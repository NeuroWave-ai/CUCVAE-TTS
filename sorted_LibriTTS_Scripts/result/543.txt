none	none	tell me of a good light exciting love story to read My husband s going away for a week She was fond of the other librarians proud of their aspirations And by the chance of propinquity she read scores of books unnatural to her gay white littleness volumes of anthropology with ditches of foot notes filled with heaps of small dusty type Parisian imagistes Hindu recipes for curry voyages to the Solomon Isles theosophy with modern American improvements treatises upon success in the real estate business She took walks and was sensible about shoes and diet And never did she feel that she was living She went to dances and suppers at the houses of college acquaintances Sometimes she one stepped demurely sometimes in dread of life s slipping past she turned into a bacchanal her tender eyes excited her throat tense as she slid down the room During her three years of library work several men showed diligent interest in her the treasurer of a fur manufacturing firm a teacher a newspaper reporter and a petty railroad official None of them made her more than pause in thought For months no male emerged from the mass Then at the Marburys she met doctor Will Kennicott CHAPTER II IT was a frail and blue and lonely Carol who trotted to the flat of the Johnson Marburys for Sunday evening supper missus Marbury was a neighbor and friend of Carol s sister mister Marbury a traveling representative of an insurance company They made a specialty of sandwich salad coffee lap suppers and they regarded Carol as their literary and artistic representative She was the one who could be depended upon to appreciate the Caruso phonograph record and the Chinese lantern which mister Marbury had brought back as his present from San Francisco Carol found the Marburys admiring and therefore admirable This September Sunday evening she wore a net frock with a pale pink lining A nap had soothed away the faint lines of tiredness beside her eyes She was young naive stimulated by the coolness She flung her coat at the chair in the hall of the flat and exploded into the green plush living room The familiar group were trying to be conversational She saw mister Marbury a woman teacher of gymnastics in a high school a chief clerk from the Great Northern Railway offices a young lawyer But there was also a stranger a thick tall man of thirty six or seven with stolid brown hair lips used to giving orders eyes which followed everything good naturedly and clothes which you could never quite remember mister Marbury boomed Carol come over here and meet Doc Kennicott doctor Will Kennicott of Gopher Prairie He does all our insurance examining up in that neck of the woods and they do say he s some doctor As she edged toward the stranger and murmured nothing in particular Carol remembered that Gopher Prairie was a Minnesota wheat prairie town of something over three thousand people Pleased to meet you stated doctor Kennicott His hand was strong the palm soft but the back weathered showing golden hairs against firm red skin He looked at her as though she was an agreeable discovery She tugged her hand free and fluttered I must go out to the kitchen and help missus Marbury She did not speak to him again till after she had heated the rolls and passed the paper napkins mister Marbury captured her with a loud Oh quit fussing now Come over here and sit down and tell us how s tricks He herded her to a sofa with doctor Kennicott who was rather vague about the eyes rather drooping of bulky shoulder as though he was wondering what he was expected to do next As their host left them Kennicott awoke Marbury tells me you re a high mogul in the public library I was surprised Didn t hardly think you were old enough I thought you were a girl still in college maybe Oh I m dreadfully old I expect to take to a lip stick and to find a gray hair any morning now Huh You must be frightfully old prob ly too old to be my granddaughter I guess Thus in the Vale of Arcady nymph and satyr beguiled the hours precisely thus and not in honeyed pentameters discoursed Elaine and the worn Sir Launcelot in the pleached alley How do you like your work asked the doctor It s pleasant but sometimes I feel shut off from things the steel stacks and the everlasting cards smeared all over with red rubber stamps Don t you get sick of the city saint Paul Why don t you like it

none	none	I hear it s a very nice town Nice Say honestly Of course I may be prejudiced but I ve seen an awful lot of towns one time I went to Atlantic City for the American Medical Association meeting and I spent practically a week in New York But I never saw a town that had such up and coming people as Gopher Prairie Bresnahan you know the famous auto manufacturer he comes from Gopher Prairie Born and brought up there And it s a darn pretty town Lots of fine maples and box elders and there s two of the dandiest lakes you ever saw right near town And we ve got seven miles of cement walks already and building more every day Course a lot of these towns still put up with plank walks but not for us you bet Really Why was she thinking of Stewart Snyder Gopher Prairie is going to have a great future Some of the best dairy and wheat land in the state right near there some of it selling right now at one fifty an acre and I bet it will go up to two and a quarter in ten years Is Do you like your profession Nothing like it Keeps you out and yet you have a chance to loaf in the office for a change I don t mean that way I mean it s such an opportunity for sympathy doctor Kennicott launched into a heavy Oh these Dutch farmers don t want sympathy All they need is a bath and a good dose of salts Carol must have flinched for instantly he was urging What I mean is I don t want you to think I m one of these old salts and quinine peddlers but I mean so many of my patients are husky farmers that I suppose I get kind of case hardened It seems to me that a doctor could transform a whole community if he wanted to if he saw it He s usually the only man in the neighborhood who has any scientific training isn t he Yes that s so but I guess most of us get rusty We land in a rut of obstetrics and typhoid and busted legs What we need is women like you to jump on us It d be you that would transform the town No I couldn t Too flighty I did used to think about doing just that curiously enough but I seem to have drifted away from the idea Oh I m a fine one to be lecturing you No You re just the one You have ideas without having lost feminine charm Say Don t you think there s a lot of these women that go out for all these movements and so on that sacrifice After his remarks upon suffrage he abruptly questioned her about herself His kindliness and the firmness of his personality enveloped her and she accepted him as one who had a right to know what she thought and wore and ate and read He was positive He had grown from a sketched in stranger to a friend whose gossip was important news She noticed the healthy solidity of his chest His nose which had seemed irregular and large was suddenly virile She was jarred out of this serious sweetness when Marbury bounced over to them and with horrible publicity yammered Say what do you two think you re doing Telling fortunes or making love Let me warn you that the doc is a frisky bacheldore Carol Come on now folks shake a leg Let s have some stunts or a dance or something She did not have another word with doctor Kennicott until their parting Been a great pleasure to meet you Miss Milford May I see you some time when I come down again I m here quite often taking patients to hospitals for majors and so on Why What s your address You can ask mister Marbury next time you come down if you really want to know Want to know Say you wait II Of the love making of Carol and Will Kennicott there is nothing to be told which may not be heard on every summer evening on every shadowy block They were biology and mystery their speech was slang phrases and flares of poetry their silences were contentment or shaky crises when his arm took her shoulder All the beauty of youth first discovered when it is passing and all the commonplaceness of a well to do unmarried man encountering a pretty girl at the time when she is slightly weary of her employment and sees no glory ahead nor any man she is glad to serve They liked each other honestly they were both honest She was disappointed by his devotion to making money but she was sure that he did not lie to patients and that he did keep up with the medical magazines What aroused her to something more than liking was his boyishness when they went tramping They walked from saint Paul down the river to Mendota Kennicott more elastic seeming in a cap and a soft crepe shirt Carol youthful in a tam o shanter of mole velvet a blue serge suit with an absurdly and agreeably broad turn down linen collar and frivolous ankles above athletic shoes The High Bridge crosses the Mississippi mounting from low banks to a palisade of cliffs Far down beneath it on the saint Paul side upon mud flats is a wild settlement of chicken infested gardens and shanties patched together from discarded sign boards sheets of corrugated iron and planks fished out of the river Carol leaned over the rail of the bridge to look down at this Yang tse village in delicious imaginary fear she shrieked that she was dizzy with the height and it was an extremely human satisfaction to have a strong male snatch her back to safety instead of having a logical woman teacher or librarian sniff Well if you re scared why don t you get away from the rail then From the cliffs across the river Carol and Kennicott looked back at saint Paul on its hills an imperial sweep from the dome of the cathedral to the dome of the state capitol The river road led past rocky field slopes deep glens woods flamboyant now with September to Mendota white walls and a spire among trees beneath a hill old world in its placid ease And for this fresh land the place is ancient Here is the bold stone house which General Sibley the king of fur traders built in eighteen thirty five with plaster of river mud and ropes of twisted grass for laths It has an air of centuries In its solid rooms Carol and Kennicott found prints from other days which the house had seen tail coats of robin s egg blue clumsy Red River carts laden with luxurious furs whiskered Union soldiers in slant forage caps and rattling sabers It suggested to them a common American past and it was memorable because they had discovered it together They talked more trustingly more personally as they trudged on They crossed the Minnesota River in a rowboat ferry They climbed the hill to the round stone tower of Fort Snelling They saw the junction of the Mississippi and the Minnesota and recalled the men who had come here eighty years ago Maine lumbermen York traders soldiers from the Maryland hills It s a good country and I m proud of it Let s make it all that those old boys dreamed about the unsentimental Kennicott was moved to vow Let s Come on Come to Gopher Prairie Show us Make the town well make it artistic It s mighty pretty but I ll admit we aren t any too darn artistic Probably the lumber yard isn t as scrumptious as all these Greek temples But go to it Make us change I would like to Some day Now You d love Gopher Prairie We ve been doing a lot with lawns and gardening the past few years and it s so homey the big trees and And the best people on earth And keen I bet Luke Dawson Carol but half listened to the names She could not fancy their ever becoming important to her I bet Luke Dawson has got more money than most of the swells on Summit Avenue and Miss Sherwin in the high school is a regular wonder reads Latin like I do English and Sam Clark the hardware man he s a corker not a better man in the state to go hunting with and if you want culture besides Vida Sherwin there s

Cass Only of course none of them have your finesse you might call it But they don t make em any more appreciative and so on Come on We re ready for you to boss us They sat on the bank below the parapet of the old fort hidden from observation He circled her shoulder with his arm Relaxed after the walk a chill nipping her throat conscious of his warmth and power she leaned gratefully against him You know I m in love with you Carol She did not answer but she touched the back of his hand with an exploring finger You say I m so darn materialistic How can I help it unless I have you to stir me up She did not answer She could not think You say a doctor could cure a town the way he does a person Well you cure the town of whatever ails it if anything does and I ll be your surgical kit She did not follow his words only the burring resoluteness of them She was shocked thrilled as he kissed her cheek and cried There s no use saying things and saying things and saying things Don t my arms talk to you now Oh please please She wondered if she ought to be angry but it was a drifting thought and she discovered that she was crying Then they were sitting six inches apart pretending that they had never been nearer while she tried to be impersonal I would like to would like to see Gopher Prairie Trust me Here she is Brought some snapshots down to show you Her cheek near his sleeve she studied a dozen village pictures They were streaky she saw only trees shrubbery a porch indistinct in leafy shadows But she exclaimed over the lakes dark water reflecting wooded bluffs a flight of ducks a fisherman in shirt sleeves and a wide straw hat holding up a string of croppies One winter picture of the edge of Plover Lake had the air of an etching lustrous slide of ice snow in the crevices of a boggy bank the mound of a muskrat house reeds in thin black lines arches of frosty grasses It was an impression of cool clear vigor How d it be to skate there for a couple of hours or go zinging along on a fast ice boat and skip back home for coffee and some hot wienies he demanded It might be fun But here s the picture Here s where you come in A photograph of a forest clearing pathetic new furrows straggling among stumps a clumsy log cabin chinked with mud and roofed with hay In front of it a sagging woman with tight drawn hair and a baby bedraggled smeary glorious eyed Those are the kind of folks I practise among good share of the time Nels Erdstrom fine clean young Svenska He ll have a corking farm in ten years but now I operated his wife on a kitchen table with my driver giving the anesthetic Look at that scared baby Needs some woman with hands like yours Waiting for you Just look at that baby s eyes look how he s begging Don t They hurt me Oh it would be sweet to help him so sweet As his arms moved toward her she answered all her doubts with Sweet so sweet CHAPTER III UNDER the rolling clouds of the prairie a moving mass of steel An irritable clank and rattle beneath a prolonged roar The sharp scent of oranges cutting the soggy smell of unbathed people and ancient baggage Towns as planless as a scattering of pasteboard boxes on an attic floor The stretch of faded gold stubble broken only by clumps of willows encircling white houses and red barns No seven the way train grumbling through Minnesota imperceptibly climbing the giant tableland that slopes in a thousand mile rise from hot Mississippi bottoms to the Rockies It is September hot very dusty There is no smug Pullman attached to the train and the day coaches of the East are replaced by free chair cars with each seat cut into two adjustable plush chairs the head rests covered with doubtful linen towels Halfway down the car is a semi partition of carved oak columns but the aisle is of bare splintery grease blackened wood There is no porter no pillows no provision for beds but all today and all tonight they will ride in this long steel box farmers with perpetually tired wives and children who seem all to be of the same age workmen going to new jobs traveling salesmen with derbies and freshly shined shoes They are parched and cramped the lines of their hands filled with grime they go to sleep curled in distorted attitudes heads against the window panes or propped on rolled coats on seat arms and legs thrust into the aisle They do not read apparently they do not think They wait An early wrinkled young old mother moving as though her joints were dry opens a suit case in which are seen creased blouses a pair of slippers worn through at the toes a bottle of patent medicine a tin cup a paper covered book about dreams which the news butcher has coaxed her into buying She brings out a graham cracker which she feeds to a baby lying flat on a seat and wailing hopelessly Most of the crumbs drop on the red plush of the seat and the woman sighs and tries to brush them away but they leap up impishly and fall back on the plush A soiled man and woman munch sandwiches and throw the crusts on the floor A large brick colored Norwegian takes off his shoes grunts in relief and props his feet in their thick gray socks against the seat in front of him An old woman whose toothless mouth shuts like a mud turtle s and whose hair is not so much white as yellow like moldy linen with bands of pink skull apparent between the tresses anxiously lifts her bag opens it peers in closes it puts it under the seat and hastily picks it up and opens it and hides it all over again The bag is full of treasures and of memories a leather buckle an ancient band concert program scraps of ribbon lace satin In the aisle beside her is an extremely indignant parrakeet in a cage Two facing seats overflowing with a Slovene iron miner s family are littered with shoes dolls whisky bottles bundles wrapped in newspapers a sewing bag The oldest boy takes a mouth organ out of his coat pocket wipes the tobacco crumbs off and plays Marching through Georgia till every head in the car begins to ache The news butcher comes through selling chocolate bars and lemon drops A girl child ceaselessly trots down to the water cooler and back to her seat The stiff paper envelope which she uses for cup drips in the aisle as she goes and on each trip she stumbles over the feet of a carpenter who grunts Ouch Look out The dust caked doors are open and from the smoking car drifts back a visible blue line of stinging tobacco smoke and with it a crackle of laughter over the story which the young man in the bright blue suit and lavender tie and light yellow shoes has just told to the squat man in garage overalls The smell grows constantly thicker more stale II To each of the passengers his seat was his temporary home and most of the passengers were slatternly housekeepers But one seat looked clean and deceptively cool In it were an obviously prosperous man and a black haired fine skinned girl whose pumps rested on an immaculate horsehide bag They were doctor Will Kennicott and his bride Carol They had been married at the end of a year of conversational courtship and they were on their way to Gopher Prairie after a wedding journey in the Colorado mountains The hordes of the way train were not altogether new to Carol She had seen them on trips from saint Paul to Chicago But now that they had become her own people to bathe and encourage and adorn she had an acute and uncomfortable interest in them They distressed her They were so stolid She had always maintained that there is no American peasantry and she sought now to defend her faith by seeing imagination and enterprise in the young Swedish farmers and in a traveling man working over his order blanks But the older people Yankees as well as Norwegians Germans Finns Canucks had settled into submission to poverty They were peasants she groaned Isn t there any way of waking them up What would happen if they understood scientific agriculture she begged of Kennicott her hand groping for his It had been a transforming honeymoon She had been frightened to discover how tumultuous a feeling could be roused in her Will had been lordly stalwart jolly impressively competent in making camp tender and understanding through the hours when they had lain side by side in a tent pitched among pines high up on a lonely mountain spur His hand swallowed hers as he started from thoughts of the practise to which he was returning These people Wake em up What for They re happy But they re so provincial No that isn t what I mean They re oh so sunk in the mud Look here Carrie You want to get over your city idea that because a man s pants aren t pressed he s a fool These farmers are mighty keen and up and coming I know That s what hurts Life seems so hard for them these lonely farms and this gritty train Oh they don t mind it Besides things are changing The auto the telephone rural free delivery they re bringing the farmers in closer touch with the town Takes time you know to change a wilderness like this was fifty years ago But already why they can hop into the Ford or the Overland and get in to the movies on Saturday evening quicker than you could get down to em by trolley in saint Paul But if it s these towns we ve been passing that the farmers run to for relief from their bleakness Can t you understand Just LOOK at them Kennicott was amazed Ever since childhood he had seen these towns from trains on this same line He grumbled Why what s the matter with em Good hustling burgs It would astonish you to know how much wheat and rye and corn and potatoes they ship in a year But they re so ugly I ll admit they aren t comfy like Gopher Prairie But give em time What s the use of giving them time unless some one has desire and training enough to plan them Hundreds of factories trying to make attractive motor cars but these towns left to chance No That can t be true It must have taken genius to make them so scrawny Oh they re not so bad was all he answered He pretended that his hand was the cat and hers the mouse For the first time she tolerated him rather than encouraged him She was staring out at Schoenstrom a hamlet of perhaps a hundred and fifty inhabitants at which the train was stopping A bearded German and his pucker mouthed wife tugged their enormous imitation leather satchel from under a seat and waddled out The station agent hoisted a dead calf aboard the baggage car There were no other visible activities in Schoenstrom In the quiet of the halt Carol could hear a horse kicking his stall a carpenter shingling a roof The business center of Schoenstrom took up one side of one block facing the railroad It was a row of one story shops covered with galvanized iron or with clapboards painted red and bilious yellow The buildings were as ill assorted as temporary looking as a mining camp street in the motion pictures The railroad station was a one room frame box a mirey cattle pen on one side and a crimson wheat elevator on the other The elevator with its cupola on the ridge of a shingled roof resembled a broad shouldered man with a small vicious pointed head The only habitable structures to be seen were the florid red brick Catholic church and rectory at the end of Main Street Carol picked at Kennicott s sleeve You wouldn t call this a not so bad town would you These Dutch burgs ARE kind of slow Still at that See that fellow coming out of the general store there getting into the big car I met him once He owns about half the town besides the store Rauskukle his name is He owns a lot of mortgages and he gambles in farm lands Good nut on him that fellow Why they say he s worth three or four hundred thousand dollars Got a dandy great big yellow brick house with tiled walks and a garden and everything other end of town can t see it from here I ve gone past it when I ve driven through here Yes sir Then if he has all that there s no excuse whatever for this place If his three hundred thousand went back into the town where it belongs they could burn up these shacks and build a dream village a jewel Why do the farmers and the town people let the Baron keep it I must say I don t quite get you sometimes Carrie Let him They can t help themselves He s a dumm old Dutchman and probably the priest can twist him around his finger but when it comes to picking good farming land he s a regular wiz I see He s their symbol of beauty The town erects him instead of erecting buildings Honestly don t know what you re driving at You re kind of played out after this long trip You ll feel better when you get home and have a good bath and put on the blue negligee That s some vampire costume you witch He squeezed her arm looked at her knowingly They moved on from the desert stillness of the Schoenstrom station The train creaked banged swayed The air was nauseatingly thick Kennicott turned her face from the window rested her head on his shoulder She was coaxed from her unhappy mood But she came out of it unwillingly and when Kennicott was satisfied that he had corrected all her worries and had opened a magazine of saffron detective stories she sat upright Here she meditated is the newest empire of the world the Northern Middlewest a land of dairy herds and exquisite lakes of new automobiles and tar paper shanties and silos like red towers of clumsy speech and a hope that is boundless An empire which feeds a quarter of the world yet its work is merely begun They are pioneers these sweaty wayfarers for all their telephones and bank accounts and automatic pianos and company operative leagues And for all its fat richness theirs is a pioneer land What is its future she wondered A future of cities and factory smut where now are loping empty fields Homes universal and secure Or placid chateaux ringed with sullen huts Youth free to find knowledge and laughter Willingness to sift the sanctified lies Or creamy skinned fat women smeared with grease and chalk gorgeous in the skins of beasts and the bloody feathers of slain birds playing bridge with puffy pink nailed jeweled fingers women who after much expenditure of labor and bad temper still grotesquely resemble their own flatulent lap dogs The ancient stale inequalities or something different in history unlike the tedious maturity of other empires What future and what hope Carol s head ached with the riddle She saw the prairie flat in giant patches or rolling in long hummocks The width and bigness of it which had expanded her spirit an hour ago began to frighten her It spread out so it went on so uncontrollably she could never know it Kennicott was closeted in his detective story With the loneliness which comes most depressingly in the midst of many people she tried to forget problems to look at the prairie objectively The grass beside the railroad had been burnt over it was a smudge prickly with charred stalks of weeds Beyond the undeviating barbed wire fences were clumps of golden rod Only this thin hedge shut them off from the plains shorn wheat lands of autumn a hundred acres to a field prickly and gray near by but in the blurred distance like tawny velvet stretched over dipping hillocks The long rows of wheat shocks marched like soldiers in worn yellow tabards The newly plowed fields were black banners fallen on the distant slope It was a martial immensity vigorous a little harsh unsoftened by kindly gardens The expanse was relieved by clumps of oaks with patches of short wild grass and every mile or two was a chain of cobalt slews with the flicker of blackbirds wings across them All this working land was turned into exuberance by the light The sunshine was dizzy on open stubble shadows from immense cumulus clouds were forever sliding across low mounds and the sky was wider and loftier and more resolutely blue than the sky of cities she declared It s a glorious country a land to be big in she crooned Then Kennicott startled her by chuckling D you realize the town after the next is Gopher Prairie Home III That one word home it terrified her Had she really bound herself to live inescapably in this town called Gopher Prairie And this thick man beside her who dared to define her future he was a stranger She turned in her seat stared at him Who was he Why was he sitting with her He wasn t of her kind His neck was heavy his speech was heavy he was twelve or thirteen years older than she and about him was none of the magic of shared adventures and eagerness She could not believe that she had ever slept in his arms That was one of the dreams which you had but did not officially admit She told herself how good he was how dependable and understanding She touched his ear smoothed the plane of his solid jaw and turning away again concentrated upon liking his town It wouldn t be like these barren settlements It couldn t be Why it had three thousand population That was a great many people There would be six hundred houses or more And The lakes near it would be so lovely She d seen them in the photographs They had looked charming hadn t they As the train left Wahkeenyan she began nervously to watch for the lakes the entrance to all her future life But when she discovered them to the left of the track her only impression of them was that they resembled the photographs A mile from Gopher Prairie the track mounts a curving low ridge and she could see the town as a whole With a passionate jerk she pushed up the window looked out the arched fingers of her left hand trembling on the sill her right hand at her breast And she saw that Gopher Prairie was merely an enlargement of all the hamlets which they had been passing Only to the eyes of a Kennicott was it exceptional The huddled low wooden houses broke the plains scarcely more than would a hazel thicket The fields swept up to it past it It was unprotected and unprotecting there was no dignity in it nor any hope of greatness Only the tall red grain elevator and a few tinny church steeples rose from the mass It was a frontier camp It was not a place to live in not possibly not conceivably The people they d be as drab as their houses as flat as their fields She couldn t stay here She would have to wrench loose from this man and flee She peeped at him She was at once helpless before his mature fixity and touched by his excitement as he sent his magazine skittering along the aisle stooped for their bags came up with flushed face and gloated Here we are She smiled loyally and looked away The train was entering town The houses on the outskirts were dusky old red mansions with wooden frills or gaunt frame shelters like grocery boxes or new bungalows with concrete foundations imitating stone Now the train was passing the elevator the grim storage tanks for oil a creamery a lumber yard a stock yard muddy and trampled and stinking Now they were stopping at a squat red frame station the platform crowded with unshaven farmers and with loafers unadventurous people with dead eyes She was here She could not go on It was the end the end of the world She sat with closed eyes longing to push past Kennicott hide somewhere in the train flee on toward the Pacific Something large arose in her soul and commanded 
512_124520_000071_000003	train-clean-360	Stop it 
none	none	Stop being a whining baby She stood up quickly she said Isn t it wonderful to be here at last He trusted her so She would make herself like the place And she was going to do tremendous things She followed Kennicott and the bobbing ends of the two bags which he carried They were held back by the slow line of disembarking passengers She reminded herself that she was actually at the dramatic moment of the bride s home coming She ought to feel exalted She felt nothing at all except irritation at their slow progress toward the door Kennicott stooped to peer through the windows He shyly exulted Look Look There s a bunch come down to welcome us Sam Clark and the missus and Dave Dyer and Jack Elder and yes sir Harry Haydock and Juanita and a whole crowd I guess they see us now Yuh yuh sure they see us See em waving She obediently bent her head to look out at them She had hold of herself She was ready to love them But she was embarrassed by the heartiness of the cheering group From the vestibule she waved to them but she clung a second to the sleeve of the brakeman who helped her down before she had the courage to dive into the cataract of hand shaking people people whom she could not tell apart She had the impression that all the men had coarse voices large damp hands tooth brush mustaches bald spots and Masonic watch charms She knew that they were welcoming her Their hands their smiles their shouts their affectionate eyes overcame her She stammered Thank you oh thank you One of the men was clamoring at Kennicott I brought my machine down to take you home doc Fine business Sam cried Kennicott and to Carol Let s jump in That big Paige over there Some boat too believe me Sam can show speed to any of these Marmons from Minneapolis Only when she was in the motor car did she distinguish the three people who were to accompany them The owner now at the wheel was the essence of decent self satisfaction a baldish largish level eyed man rugged of neck but sleek and round of face face like the back of a spoon bowl He was chuckling at her Have you got us all straight yet Course she has Trust Carrie to get things straight and get em darn quick I bet she could tell you every date in history boasted her husband But the man looked at her reassuringly and with a certainty that he was a person whom she could trust she confessed As a matter of fact I haven t got anybody straight Course you haven t child Well I m Sam Clark dealer in hardware sporting goods cream separators and almost any kind of heavy junk you can think of You can call me Sam anyway I m going to call you Carrie seein s you ve been and gone and married this poor fish of a bum medic that we keep round here Carol smiled lavishly and wished that she called people by their given names more easily The fat cranky lady back there beside you who is pretending that she can t hear me giving her away is missus Sam l Clark and this hungry looking squirt up here beside me is Dave Dyer who keeps his drug store running by not filling your hubby s prescriptions right fact you might say he s the guy that put the shun in prescription So Well leave us take the bonny bride home Say doc I ll sell you the Candersen place for three thousand plunks Better be thinking about building a new home for Carrie Prettiest Frau in G P if you asks me Contentedly Sam Clark drove off in the heavy traffic of three Fords and the Minniemashie House Free Bus I shall like mister Clark I CAN T call him Sam They re all so friendly She glanced at the houses tried not to see what she saw gave way in Why do these stories lie so They always make the bride s home coming a bower of roses Complete trust in noble spouse Lies about marriage I m NOT changed And this town O my God I can t go through with it This junk heap Her husband bent over her You look like you were in a brown study Scared I don t expect you to think Gopher Prairie is a paradise after saint Paul I don t expect you to be crazy about it at first But you ll come to like it so much life s so free here and best people on earth She whispered to him while missus Clark considerately turned away I love you for understanding I m just I m beastly over sensitive Too many books It s my lack of shoulder muscles and sense Give me time dear You bet All the time you want She laid the back of his hand against her cheek snuggled near him She was ready for her new home Kennicott had told her that with his widowed mother as housekeeper he had occupied an old house but nice and roomy and well heated best furnace I could find on the market His mother had left Carol her love and gone back to Lac qui Meurt It would be wonderful she exulted not to have to live in Other People s Houses but to make her own shrine She held his hand tightly and stared ahead as the car swung round a corner and stopped in the street before a prosaic frame house in a small parched lawn IV A concrete sidewalk with a parking of grass and mud A square smug brown house rather damp A narrow concrete walk up to it Sickly yellow leaves in a windrow with dried wings of box elder seeds and snags of wool from the cotton woods A screened porch with pillars of thin painted pine surmounted by scrolls and brackets and bumps of jigsawed wood No shrubbery to shut off the public gaze A lugubrious bay window to the right of the porch Window curtains of starched cheap lace revealing a pink marble table with a conch shell and a Family Bible You ll find it old fashioned what do you call it Mid Victorian I left it as is so you could make any changes you felt were necessary Kennicott sounded doubtful for the first time since he had come back to his own It s a real home She was moved by his humility She gaily motioned good by to the Clarks He unlocked the door he was leaving the choice of a maid to her and there was no one in the house She jiggled while he turned the key and scampered in It was next day before either of them remembered that in their honeymoon camp they had planned that he should carry her over the sill In hallway and front parlor she was conscious of dinginess and lugubriousness and airlessness but she insisted I ll make it all jolly As she followed Kennicott and the bags up to their bedroom she quavered to herself the song of the fat little gods of the hearth I have my own home To do what I please with To do what I please with My den for me and my mate and my cubs My own She was close in her husband s arms she clung to him whatever of strangeness and slowness and insularity she might find in him none of that mattered so long as she could slip her hands beneath his coat run her fingers over the warm smoothness of the satin back of his waistcoat seem almost to creep into his body find in him strength find in the courage and kindness of her man a shelter from the perplexing world Sweet so sweet she whispered CHAPTER IV I THE Clarks have invited some folks to their house to meet us tonight said Kennicott as he unpacked his suit case Oh that is nice of them You bet I told you you d like em Squarest people on earth Uh Carrie Would you mind if I sneaked down to the office for an hour just to see how things are Why no Of course not I know you re keen to get back to work Sure you don t mind Not a bit Out of my way Let me unpack But the advocate of freedom in marriage was as much disappointed as a drooping bride at the alacrity with which he took that freedom and escaped to the world of men s affairs She gazed about their bedroom and its full dismalness crawled over her the awkward knuckly L shape of it the black walnut bed with apples and spotty pears carved on the headboard the imitation maple bureau with pink daubed scent bottles and a petticoated pin cushion on a marble slab uncomfortably like a gravestone the plain pine washstand and the garlanded water pitcher and bowl The scent was of horsehair and plush and Florida Water How could people ever live with things like this she shuddered She saw the furniture as a circle of elderly judges condemning her to death by smothering The tottering brocade chair squeaked Choke her choke her smother her The old linen smelled of the tomb She was alone in this house this strange still house among the shadows of dead thoughts and haunting repressions I hate it I hate it she panted Why did I ever She remembered that Kennicott s mother had brought these family relics from the old home in Lac qui Meurt Stop it They re perfectly comfortable things They re comfortable Besides Oh they re horrible We ll change them right away Then But of course he HAS to see how things are at the office She made a pretense of busying herself with unpacking The chintz lined silver fitted bag which had seemed so desirable a luxury in saint Paul was an extravagant vanity here The daring black chemise of frail chiffon and lace was a hussy at which the deep bosomed bed stiffened in disgust and she hurled it into a bureau drawer hid it beneath a sensible linen blouse She gave up unpacking She went to the window with a purely literary thought of village charm hollyhocks and lanes and apple cheeked cottagers What she saw was the side of the Seventh Day Adventist Church a plain clapboard wall of a sour liver color the ash pile back of the church an unpainted stable and an alley in which a Ford delivery wagon had been stranded This was the terraced garden below her boudoir this was to be her scenery for I mustn t I mustn t I m nervous this afternoon Am I sick Good Lord I hope it isn t that Not now How people lie How these stories lie They say the bride is always so blushing and proud and happy when she finds that out but I d hate it I d be scared to death Some day but Please dear nebulous Lord not now Bearded sniffy old men sitting and demanding that we bear children If THEY had to bear them I wish they did have to Not now Not till I ve got hold of this job of liking the ash pile out there I must shut up I m mildly insane I m going out for a walk I ll see the town by myself My first view of the empire I m going to conquer She fled from the house She stared with seriousness at every concrete crossing every hitching post every rake for leaves and to each house she devoted all her speculation What would they come to mean How would they look six months from now In which of them would she be dining Which of these people whom she passed now mere arrangements of hair and clothes would turn into intimates loved or dreaded different from all the other people in the world As she came into the small business section she inspected a broad beamed grocer in an alpaca coat who was bending over the apples and celery on a slanted platform in front of his store Would she ever talk to him What would he say if she stopped and stated I am missus doctor Kennicott Some day I hope to confide that a heap of extremely dubious pumpkins as a window display doesn t exhilarate me much The grocer was mister Frederick F Ludelmeyer whose market is at the corner of Main Street and Lincoln Avenue In supposing that only she was observant Carol was ignorant misled by the indifference of cities She fancied that she was slipping through the streets invisible but when she had passed mister Ludelmeyer puffed into the store and coughed at his clerk I seen a young woman she come along the side street I bet she iss Doc Kennicott s new bride good looker nice legs but she wore a hell of a plain suit no style I wonder will she pay cash I bet she goes to Howland Gould s more as she does here what you done with the poster for Fluffed Oats II When Carol had walked for thirty two minutes she had completely covered the town east and west north and south and she stood at the corner of Main Street and Washington Avenue and despaired Main Street with its two story brick shops its story and a half wooden residences its muddy expanse from concrete walk to walk its huddle of Fords and lumber wagons was too small to absorb her The broad straight unenticing gashes of the streets let in the grasping prairie on every side She realized the vastness and the emptiness of the land The skeleton iron windmill on the farm a few blocks away at the north end of Main Street was like the ribs of a dead cow She thought of the coming of the Northern winter when the unprotected houses would crouch together in terror of storms galloping out of that wild waste They were so small and weak the little brown houses They were shelters for sparrows not homes for warm laughing people She told herself that down the street the leaves were a splendor The maples were orange the oaks a solid tint of raspberry And the lawns had been nursed with love But the thought would not hold At best the trees resembled a thinned woodlot There was no park to rest the eyes And since not Gopher Prairie but Wakamin was the county seat there was no court house with its grounds She glanced through the fly specked windows of the most pretentious building in sight the one place which welcomed strangers and determined their opinion of the charm and luxury of Gopher Prairie the Minniemashie House It was a tall lean shabby structure three stories of yellow streaked wood the corners covered with sanded pine slabs purporting to symbolize stone In the hotel office she could see a stretch of bare unclean floor a line of rickety chairs with brass cuspidors between a writing desk with advertisements in mother of pearl letters upon the glass covered back The dining room beyond was a jungle of stained table cloths and catsup bottles She looked no more at the Minniemashie House A man in cuffless shirt sleeves with pink arm garters wearing a linen collar but no tie yawned his way from Dyer s Drug Store across to the hotel He leaned against the wall scratched a while sighed and in a bored way gossiped with a man tilted back in a chair A lumber wagon its long green box filled with large spools of barbed wire fencing creaked down the block A Ford in reverse sounded as though it were shaking to pieces then recovered and rattled away In the Greek candy store was the whine of a peanut roaster and the oily smell of nuts There was no other sound nor sign of life She wanted to run fleeing from the encroaching prairie demanding the security of a great city Her dreams of creating a beautiful town were ludicrous Oozing out from every drab wall she felt a forbidding spirit which she could never conquer She trailed down the street on one side back on the other glancing into the cross streets It was a private Seeing Main Street tour She was within ten minutes beholding not only the heart of a place called Gopher Prairie but ten thousand towns from Albany to San Diego Dyer s Drug Store a corner building of regular and unreal blocks of artificial stone Inside the store a greasy marble soda fountain with an electric lamp of red and green and curdled yellow mosaic shade Pawed over heaps of tooth brushes and combs and packages of shaving soap Shelves of soap cartons teething rings garden seeds and patent medicines in yellow packages nostrums for consumption for women s diseases notorious mixtures of opium and alcohol in the very shop to which her husband sent patients for the filling of prescriptions From a second story window the sign W P Kennicott Phys Surgeon gilt on black sand A small wooden motion picture theater called The Rosebud Movie Palace Lithographs announcing a film called Fatty in Love Howland Gould s Grocery In the display window black overripe bananas and lettuce on which a cat was sleeping Shelves lined with red crepe paper which was now faded and torn and concentrically spotted Flat against the wall of the second story the signs of lodges the Knights of Pythias the Maccabees the Woodmen the Masons Dahl Oleson s Meat Market a reek of blood A jewelry shop with tinny looking wrist watches for women In front of it at the curb a huge wooden clock which did not go A fly buzzing saloon with a brilliant gold and enamel whisky sign across the front Other saloons down the block From them a stink of stale beer and thick voices bellowing pidgin German or trolling out dirty songs vice gone feeble and unenterprising and dull the delicacy of a mining camp minus its vigor In front of the saloons farmwives sitting on the seats of wagons waiting for their husbands to become drunk and ready to start home A tobacco shop called The Smoke House filled with young men shaking dice for cigarettes Racks of magazines and pictures of coy fat prostitutes in striped bathing suits A clothing store with a display of ox blood shade Oxfords with bull dog toes Suits which looked worn and glossless while they were still new flabbily draped on dummies like corpses with painted cheeks The Bon Ton Store Haydock Simons the largest shop in town The first story front of clear glass the plates cleverly bound at the edges with brass The second story of pleasant tapestry brick One window of excellent clothes for men interspersed with collars of floral pique which showed mauve daisies on a saffron ground Newness and an obvious notion of neatness and service Haydock Simons Haydock She had met a Haydock at the station Harry Haydock an active person of thirty five He seemed great to her now and very like a saint His shop was clean Axel Egge s General Store frequented by Scandinavian farmers In the shallow dark window space heaps of sleazy sateens badly woven galateas canvas shoes designed for women with bulging ankles steel and red glass buttons upon cards with broken edges a cottony blanket a granite ware frying pan reposing on a sun faded crepe blouse Sam Clark s Hardware Store An air of frankly metallic enterprise Guns and churns and barrels of nails and beautiful shiny butcher knives Chester Dashaway s House Furnishing Emporium A vista of heavy oak rockers with leather seats asleep in a dismal row Billy s Lunch Thick handleless cups on the wet oilcloth covered counter An odor of onions and the smoke of hot lard In the doorway a young man audibly sucking a toothpick The warehouse of the buyer of cream and potatoes The sour smell of a dairy The Ford Garage and the Buick Garage competent one story brick and cement buildings opposite each other Old and new cars on grease blackened concrete floors Tire advertisements The roaring of a tested motor a racket which beat at the nerves Surly young men in khaki union overalls The most energetic and vital places in town A large warehouse for agricultural implements An impressive barricade of green and gold wheels of shafts and sulky seats belonging to machinery of which Carol knew nothing potato planters manure spreaders silage cutters disk harrows breaking plows A feed store its windows opaque with the dust of bran a patent medicine advertisement painted on its roof Ye Art Shoppe Prop missus Mary Ellen Wilks Christian Science Library open daily free A touching fumble at beauty A one room shanty of boards recently covered with rough stucco A show window delicately rich in error vases starting out to imitate tree trunks but running off into blobs of gilt an aluminum ash tray labeled Greetings from Gopher Prairie a Christian Science magazine a stamped sofa cushion portraying a large ribbon tied to a small poppy the correct skeins of embroidery silk lying on the pillow Inside the shop a glimpse of bad carbon prints of bad and famous pictures shelves of phonograph records and camera films wooden toys and in the midst an anxious small woman sitting in a padded rocking chair A barber shop and pool room A man in shirt sleeves presumably Del Snafflin the proprietor shaving a man who had a large Adam s apple Nat Hicks s Tailor Shop on a side street off Main A one story building A fashion plate showing human pitchforks in garments which looked as hard as steel plate On another side street a raw red brick Catholic Church with a varnished yellow door The post office merely a partition of glass and brass shutting off the rear of a mildewed room which must once have been a shop A tilted writing shelf against a wall rubbed black and scattered with official notices and army recruiting posters The damp yellow brick schoolbuilding in its cindery grounds The State Bank stucco masking wood The Farmers National Bank An Ionic temple of marble Pure exquisite solitary A brass plate with Ezra Stowbody Pres t A score of similar shops and establishments Behind them and mixed with them the houses meek cottages or large comfortable soundly uninteresting symbols of prosperity In all the town not one building save the Ionic bank which gave pleasure to Carol s eyes not a dozen buildings which suggested that in the fifty years of Gopher Prairie s existence the citizens had realized that it was either desirable or possible to make this their common home amusing or attractive It was not only the unsparing unapologetic ugliness and the rigid straightness which overwhelmed her It was the planlessness the flimsy temporariness of the buildings their faded unpleasant colors The street was cluttered with electric light poles telephone poles gasoline pumps for motor cars boxes of goods Each man had built with the most valiant disregard of all the others Between a large new block of two story brick shops on one side and the fire brick Overland garage on the other side was a one story cottage turned into a millinery shop The white temple of the Farmers Bank was elbowed back by a grocery of glaring yellow brick One store building had a patchy galvanized iron cornice the building beside it was crowned with battlements and pyramids of brick capped with blocks of red sandstone She escaped from Main Street fled home She wouldn t have cared she insisted if the people had been comely She had noted a young man loafing before a shop one unwashed hand holding the cord of an awning a middle aged man who had a way of staring at women as though he had been married too long and too prosaically an old farmer solid wholesome but not clean his face like a potato fresh from the earth None of them had shaved for three days If they can t build shrines out here on the prairie surely there s nothing to prevent their buying safety razors she raged She fought herself I must be wrong People do live here It CAN T be as ugly as as I know it is I must be wrong But I can t do it I can t go through with it She came home too seriously worried for hysteria and when she found Kennicott waiting for her and exulting Have a walk Well like the town Great lawns and trees eh she was able to say with a self protective maturity new to her It s very interesting III The train which brought Carol to Gopher Prairie also brought Miss Bea Sorenson Miss Bea was a stalwart corn colored laughing young woman and she was bored by farm work She desired the excitements of city life and the way to enjoy city life was she had decided to go get a yob as hired girl in Gopher Prairie She contentedly lugged her pasteboard telescope from the station to her cousin Tina Malmquist maid of all work in the residence of missus Luke Dawson Vell so you come to town said Tina Ya Ay get a yob said Bea Vell You got a fella now Ya Yim Yacobson Vell I m glat to see you How much you vant a veek Sex dollar There ain t nobody pay dat Vait doctor Kennicott I t ink he marry a girl from de Cities Maybe she pay dat Vell You go take a valk Ya said Bea So it chanced that Carol Kennicott and Bea Sorenson were viewing Main Street at the same time Bea had never before been in a town larger than Scandia Crossing which has sixty seven inhabitants As she marched up the street she was meditating that it didn t hardly seem like it was possible there could be so many folks all in one place at the same time My It would take years to get acquainted with them all And swell people too A fine big gentleman in a new pink shirt with a diamond and not no washed out blue denim working shirt A lovely lady in a longery dress but it must be an awful hard dress to wash And the stores Not just three of them like there were at Scandia Crossing but more than four whole blocks The Bon Ton Store big as four barns my it would simply scare a person to go in there with seven or eight clerks all looking at you And the men s suits on figures just like human And Axel Egge s like home lots of Swedes and Norskes in there and a card of dandy buttons like rubies A drug store with a soda fountain that was just huge awful long and all lovely marble and on it there was a great big lamp with the biggest shade you ever saw all different kinds colored glass stuck together and the soda spouts they were silver and they came right out of the bottom of the lamp stand Behind the fountain there were glass shelves and bottles of new kinds of soft drinks that nobody ever heard of Suppose a fella took you THERE A hotel awful high higher than Oscar Tollefson s new red barn three stories one right on top of another you had to stick your head back to look clear up to the top There was a swell traveling man in there probably been to Chicago lots of times Oh the dandiest people to know here There was a lady going by you wouldn t hardly say she was any older than Bea herself she wore a dandy new gray suit and black pumps She almost looked like she was looking over the town too But you couldn t tell what she thought Bea would like to be that way kind of quiet so nobody would get fresh Kind of oh elegant A Lutheran Church Here in the city there d be lovely sermons and church twice on Sunday EVERY Sunday And a movie show A regular theater just for movies With the sign Change of bill every evening Pictures every evening There were movies in Scandia Crossing but only once every two weeks and it took the Sorensons an hour to drive in papa was such a tightwad he wouldn t get a Ford But here she could put on her hat any evening and in three minutes walk be to the movies and see lovely fellows in dress suits and Bill Hart and everything How could they have so many stores Why There was one just for tobacco alone and one a lovely one the Art Shoppy it was for pictures and vases and stuff with oh the dandiest vase made so it looked just like a tree trunk Bea stood on the corner of Main Street and Washington Avenue The roar of the city began to frighten her There were five automobiles on the street all at the same time and one of em was a great big car that must of cost two thousand dollars and the bus was starting for a train with five elegant dressed fellows and a man was pasting up red bills with lovely pictures of washing machines on them and the jeweler was laying out bracelets and wrist watches and EVERYTHING on real velvet What did she care if she got six dollars a week Or two It was worth while working for nothing to be allowed to stay here And think how it would be in the evening all lighted up and not with no lamps but with electrics And maybe a gentleman friend taking you to the movies and buying you a strawberry ice cream soda Bea trudged back Vell You lak it said Tina Ya Ay lak it Ay t ink maybe Ay stay here said Bea IV The recently built house of Sam Clark in which was given the party to welcome Carol was one of the largest in Gopher Prairie It had a clean sweep of clapboards a solid squareness a small tower and a large screened porch Inside it was as shiny as hard and as cheerful as a new oak upright piano Carol looked imploringly at Sam Clark as he rolled to the door and shouted Welcome little lady The keys of the city are yourn Beyond him in the hallway and the living room sitting in a vast prim circle as though they were attending a funeral she saw the guests They were WAITING so They were waiting for her The determination to be all one pretty flowerlet of appreciation leaked away She begged of Sam I don t dare face them They expect so much They ll swallow me in one mouthful glump like that Why sister they re going to love you same as I would if I didn t think the doc here would beat me up B but I don t dare Faces to the right of me faces in front of me volley and wonder She sounded hysterical to herself she fancied that to Sam Clark she sounded insane But he chuckled Now you just cuddle under Sam s wing and if anybody rubbers at you too long I ll shoo em off Here we go Watch my smoke Sam l the ladies delight and the bridegrooms terror His arm about her he led her in and bawled Ladies and worser halves the bride We won t introduce her round yet because she ll never get your bum names straight anyway Now bust up this star chamber They tittered politely but they did not move from the social security of their circle and they did not cease staring Carol had given creative energy to dressing for the event Her hair was demure low on her forehead with a parting and a coiled braid Now she wished that she had piled it high Her frock was an ingenue slip of lawn with a wide gold sash and a low square neck which gave a suggestion of throat and molded shoulders But as they looked her over she was certain that it was all wrong She wished alternately that she had worn a spinsterish high necked dress and that she had dared to shock them with a violent brick red scarf which she had bought in Chicago She was led about the circle Her voice mechanically produced safe remarks Oh I m sure I m going to like it here ever so much and Yes we did have the best time in Colorado mountains and Yes I lived in saint Paul several years Euclid P Tinker No I don t REMEMBER meeting him but I m pretty sure I ve heard of him Kennicott took her aside and whispered Now I ll introduce you to them one at a time Tell me about them first Well the nice looking couple over there are Harry Haydock and his wife Juanita Harry s dad owns most of the Bon Ton but it s Harry who runs it and gives it the pep He s a hustler Next to him is Dave Dyer the druggist you met him this afternoon mighty good duck shot The tall husk beyond him is Jack Elder Jackson Elder owns the planing mill and the Minniemashie House and quite a share in the Farmers National Bank Him and his wife are good sports him and Sam and I go hunting together a lot The old cheese there is Luke Dawson the richest man in town Next to him is Nat Hicks the tailor Really A tailor Sure Why not Maybe we re slow but we are democratic I go hunting with Nat same as I do with Jack Elder I m glad I ve never met a tailor socially It must be charming to meet one and not have to think about what you owe him And do you Would you go hunting with your barber too No but No use running this democracy thing into the ground Besides I ve known Nat for years and besides he s a mighty good shot and That s the way it is see Next to Nat is Chet Dashaway Great fellow for chinning He ll talk your arm off about religion or politics or books or anything Carol gazed with a polite approximation to interest at mister Dashaway a tan person with a wide mouth Oh I know He s the furniture store man She was much pleased with herself Yump and he s the undertaker You ll like him Come shake hands with him Oh no no He doesn t he doesn t do the embalming and all that himself I couldn t shake hands with an undertaker Why not You d be proud to shake hands with a great surgeon just after he d been carving up people s bellies She sought to regain her afternoon s calm of maturity Yes You re right I want oh my dear do you know how much I want to like the people you like I want to see people as they are Well don t forget to see people as other folks see them as they are They have the stuff Did you know that Percy Bresnahan came from here Born and brought up here Bresnahan Yes you know president of the Velvet Motor Company of Boston Mass make the Velvet Twelve biggest automobile factory in New England I think I ve heard of him Sure you have Why he s a millionaire several times over Well Perce comes back here for the black bass fishing almost every summer and he says if he could get away from business he d rather live here than in Boston or New York or any of those places HE doesn t mind Chet s undertaking Please I ll I ll like everybody I ll be the community sunbeam He led her to the Dawsons Luke Dawson lender of money on mortgages owner of Northern cut over land was a hesitant man in unpressed soft gray clothes with bulging eyes in a milky face His wife had bleached cheeks bleached hair bleached voice and a bleached manner She wore her expensive green frock with its passementeried bosom bead tassels and gaps between the buttons down the back as though she had bought it second hand and was afraid of meeting the former owner They were shy It was Professor George Edwin Mott superintendent of schools a Chinese mandarin turned brown who held Carol s hand and made her welcome When the Dawsons and mister Mott had stated that they were pleased to meet her there seemed to be nothing else to say but the conversation went on automatically Do you like Gopher Prairie whimpered missus Dawson Oh I m sure I m going to be ever so happy There s so many nice people missus Dawson looked to mister Mott for social and intellectual aid He lectured There s a fine class of people I don t like some of these retired farmers who come here to spend their last days especially the Germans They hate to pay school taxes They hate to spend a cent But the rest are a fine class of people Did you know that Percy Bresnahan came from here Used to go to school right at the old building I heard he did Yes He s a prince He and I went fishing together last time he was here The Dawsons and mister Mott teetered upon weary feet and smiled at Carol with crystallized expressions She went on Tell me mister Mott Have you ever tried any experiments with any of the new educational systems The modern kindergarten methods or the Gary system Oh Those Most of these would be reformers are simply notoriety seekers I believe in manual training but Latin and mathematics always will be the backbone of sound Americanism no matter what these faddists advocate heaven knows what they do want knitting I suppose and classes in wiggling the ears The Dawsons smiled their appreciation of listening to a savant Carol waited till Kennicott should rescue her The rest of the party waited for the miracle of being amused Harry and Juanita Haydock Rita Simons and doctor Terry Gould the young smart set of Gopher Prairie She was led to them Juanita Haydock flung at her in a high cackling friendly voice Well this is SO nice to have you here We ll have some good parties dances and everything You ll have to join the Jolly Seventeen We play bridge and we have a supper once a month You play of course N no I don t Really In saint Paul I ve always been such a book worm We ll have to teach you Bridge is half the fun of life Juanita had become patronizing and she glanced disrespectfully at Carol s golden sash which she had previously admired Harry Haydock said politely How do you think you re going to like the old burg I m sure I shall like it tremendously Best people on earth here Great hustlers too Course I ve had lots of chances to go live in Minneapolis but we like it here Real he town Did you know that Percy Bresnahan came from here Carol perceived that she had been weakened in the biological struggle by disclosing her lack of bridge Roused to nervous desire to regain her position she turned on doctor Terry Gould the young and pool playing competitor of her husband Her eyes coquetted with him while she gushed I ll learn bridge But what I really love most is the outdoors Can t we all get up a boating party and fish or whatever you do and have a picnic supper afterwards Now you re talking doctor Gould affirmed He looked rather too obviously at the cream smooth slope of her shoulder Like fishing Fishing is my middle name I ll teach you bridge Like cards at all I used to be rather good at bezique She knew that bezique was a game of cards or a game of something else Roulette possibly But her lie was a triumph Juanita s handsome high colored horsey face showed doubt Harry stroked his nose and said humbly Bezique Used to be great gambling game wasn t it While others drifted to her group Carol snatched up the conversation She laughed and was frivolous and rather brittle She could not distinguish their eyes They were a blurry theater audience before which she self consciously enacted the comedy of being the Clever Little Bride of Doc Kennicott These here celebrated Open Spaces that s what I m going out for I ll never read anything but the sporting page again Will converted me on our Colorado trip There were so many mousey tourists who were afraid to get out of the motor bus that I decided to be Annie Oakley the Wild Western Wampire and I bought oh a vociferous skirt which revealed my perfectly nice ankles to the Presbyterian glare of all the Ioway schoolma ams and I leaped from peak to peak like the nimble chamoys and You may think that Herr Doctor Kennicott is a Nimrod but you ought to have seen me daring him to strip to his B V D s and go swimming in an icy mountain brook She knew that they were thinking of becoming shocked but Juanita Haydock was admiring at least She swaggered on I m sure I m going to ruin Will as a respectable practitioner Is he a good doctor doctor Gould Kennicott s rival gasped at this insult to professional ethics and he took an appreciable second before he recovered his social manner I ll tell you missus Kennicott He smiled at Kennicott to imply that whatever he might say in the stress of being witty was not to count against him in the commercio medical warfare There s some people in town that say the doc is a fair to middlin diagnostician and prescription writer but let me whisper this to you but for heaven s sake don t tell him I said so don t you ever go to him for anything more serious than a pendectomy of the left ear or a strabismus of the cardiograph No one save Kennicott knew exactly what this meant but they laughed and Sam Clark s party assumed a glittering lemon yellow color of brocade panels and champagne and tulle and crystal chandeliers and sporting duchesses Carol saw that George Edwin Mott and the blanched mister and missus Dawson were not yet hypnotized They looked as though they wondered whether they ought to look as though they disapproved She concentrated on them But I know whom I wouldn t have dared to go to Colorado with mister Dawson there I m sure he s a regular heart breaker When we were introduced he held my hand and squeezed it frightfully Haw Haw Haw The entire company applauded mister Dawson was beatified He had been called many things loan shark skinflint tightwad pussyfoot but he had never before been called a flirt He is wicked isn t he missus Dawson Don t you have to lock him up Oh no but maybe I better attempted missus Dawson a tint on her pallid face For fifteen minutes Carol kept it up She asserted that she was going to stage a musical comedy that she preferred cafe parfait to beefsteak that she hoped doctor Kennicott would never lose his ability to make love to charming women and that she had a pair of gold stockings They gaped for more But she could not keep it up She retired to a chair behind Sam Clark s bulk The smile wrinkles solemnly flattened out in the faces of all the other collaborators in having a party and again they stood about hoping but not expecting to be amused Carol listened She discovered that conversation did not exist in Gopher Prairie Even at this affair which brought out the young smart set the hunting squire set the respectable intellectual set and the solid financial set they sat up with gaiety as with a corpse Juanita Haydock talked a good deal in her rattling voice but it was invariably of personalities the rumor that Raymie Wutherspoon was going to send for a pair of patent leather shoes with gray buttoned tops the rheumatism of Champ Perry the state of Guy Pollock s grippe and the dementia of Jim Howland in painting his fence salmon pink Sam Clark had been talking to Carol about motor cars but he felt his duties as host While he droned his brows popped up and down He interrupted himself Must stir em up He worried at his wife Don t you think I better stir em up He shouldered into the center of the room and cried Let s have some stunts folks Yes let s shrieked Juanita Haydock Say Dave give us that stunt about the Norwegian catching a hen You bet that s a slick stunt do that Dave cheered Chet Dashaway mister Dave Dyer obliged All the guests moved their lips in anticipation of being called on for their own stunts Ella come on and recite Old Sweetheart of Mine for us demanded Sam Miss Ella Stowbody the spinster daughter of the Ionic bank scratched her dry palms and blushed Oh you don t want to hear that old thing again Sure we do You bet asserted Sam My voice is in terrible shape tonight Tut Come on Sam loudly explained to Carol Ella is our shark at elocuting She s had professional training She studied singing and oratory and dramatic art and shorthand for a year in Milwaukee Miss Stowbody was reciting As encore to An Old Sweetheart of Mine she gave a peculiarly optimistic poem regarding the value of smiles There were four other stunts one Jewish one Irish one juvenile and Nat Hicks s parody of Mark Antony s funeral oration During the winter Carol was to hear Dave Dyer s hen catching impersonation seven times An Old Sweetheart of Mine nine times the Jewish story and the funeral oration twice but now she was ardent and because she did so want to be happy and simple hearted she was as disappointed as the others when the stunts were finished and the party instantly sank back into coma They gave up trying to be festive they began to talk naturally as they did at their shops and homes The men and women divided as they had been tending to do all evening Carol was deserted by the men left to a group of matrons who steadily pattered of children sickness and cooks their own shop talk She was piqued She remembered visions of herself as a smart married woman in a drawing room fencing with clever men Her dejection was relieved by speculation as to what the men were discussing in the corner between the piano and the phonograph Did they rise from these housewifely personalities to a larger world of abstractions and affairs She made her best curtsy to missus Dawson she twittered I won t have my husband leaving me so soon I m going over and pull the wretch s ears She rose with a jeune fille bow She was self absorbed and self approving because she had attained that quality of sentimentality She proudly dipped across the room and to the interest and commendation of all beholders sat on the arm of Kennicott s chair He was gossiping with Sam Clark Luke Dawson Jackson Elder of the planing mill Chet Dashaway Dave Dyer Harry Haydock and Ezra Stowbody president of the Ionic bank Ezra Stowbody was a troglodyte He had come to Gopher Prairie in eighteen sixty five He was a distinguished bird of prey swooping thin nose turtle mouth thick brows port wine cheeks floss of white hair contemptuous eyes He was not happy in the social changes of thirty years Three decades ago doctor Westlake Julius Flickerbaugh the lawyer Merriman Peedy the Congregational pastor and himself had been the arbiters That was as it should be the fine arts medicine law religion and finance recognized as aristocratic four Yankees democratically chatting with but ruling the Ohioans and Illini and Swedes and Germans who had ventured to follow them But Westlake was old almost retired Julius Flickerbaugh had lost much of his practice to livelier attorneys Reverend not The Reverend Peedy was dead and nobody was impressed in this rotten age of automobiles by the spanking grays which Ezra still drove The town was as heterogeneous as Chicago Norwegians and Germans owned stores The social leaders were common merchants Selling nails was considered as sacred as banking These upstarts the Clarks the Haydocks had no dignity They were sound and conservative in politics but they talked about motor cars and pump guns and heaven only knew what new fangled fads mister Stowbody felt out of place with them But his brick house with the mansard roof was still the largest residence in town and he held his position as squire by occasionally appearing among the younger men and reminding them by a wintry eye that without the banker none of them could carry on their vulgar businesses As Carol defied decency by sitting down with the men mister Stowbody was piping to mister Dawson Say Luke when was t Biggins first settled in Winnebago Township Wa n t it in eighteen seventy nine Why no twa n t mister Dawson was indignant He come out from Vermont in eighteen sixty seven no wait in eighteen sixty eight it must have been and took a claim on the Rum River quite a ways above Anoka He did not roared mister Stowbody He settled first in Blue Earth County him and his father What s the point at issue Carol whispered to Kennicott Whether this old duck Biggins had an English setter or a Llewellyn They ve been arguing it all evening Dave Dyer interrupted to give tidings D tell you that Clara Biggins was in town couple days ago She bought a hot water bottle expensive one too two dollars and thirty cents Yaaaaaah snarled mister Stowbody Course She s just like her grandad was Never save a cent Two dollars and twenty thirty was it two dollars and thirty cents for a hot water bottle Brick wrapped up in a flannel petticoat just as good anyway How s Ella s tonsils mister Stowbody yawned Chet Dashaway While mister Stowbody gave a somatic and psychic study of them Carol reflected Are they really so terribly interested in Ella s tonsils or even in Ella s esophagus I wonder if I could get them away from personalities Let s risk damnation and try There hasn t been much labor trouble around here has there mister Stowbody she asked innocently No ma am thank God we ve been free from that except maybe with hired girls and farm hands Trouble enough with these foreign farmers if you don t watch these Swedes they turn socialist or populist or some fool thing on you in a minute Of course if they have loans you can make em listen to reason I just have em come into the bank for a talk and tell em a few things I don t mind their being democrats so much but I won t stand having socialists around But thank God we ain t got the labor trouble they have in these cities Even Jack Elder here gets along pretty well in the planing mill don t you Jack Yep Sure Don t need so many skilled workmen in my place and it s a lot of these cranky wage hogging half baked skilled mechanics that start trouble reading a lot of this anarchist literature and union papers and all Do you approve of union labor Carol inquired of mister Elder Me I should say not It s like this I don t mind dealing with my men if they think they ve got any grievances though Lord knows what s come over workmen nowadays don t appreciate a good job But still if they come to me honestly as man to man I ll talk things over with them But I m not going to have any outsider any of these walking delegates or whatever fancy names they call themselves now bunch of rich grafters living on the ignorant workmen Not going to have any of those fellows butting in and telling ME how to run MY business mister Elder was growing more excited more belligerent and patriotic I stand for freedom and constitutional rights If any man don t like my shop he can get up and git Same way if I don t like him he gits And that s all there is to it I simply can t understand all these complications and hoop te doodles and government reports and wage scales and God knows what all that these fellows are balling up the labor situation with when it s all perfectly simple They like what I pay em or they get out That s all there is to it What do you think of profit sharing Carol ventured mister Elder thundered his answer while the others nodded solemnly and in tune like a shop window of flexible toys comic mandarins and judges and ducks and clowns set quivering by a breeze from the open door All this profit sharing and welfare work and insurance and old age pension is simply poppycock Enfeebles a workman s independence and wastes a lot of honest profit The half baked thinker that isn t dry behind the ears yet and these suffragettes and God knows what all buttinskis there are that are trying to tell a business man how to run his business and some of these college professors are just about as bad the whole kit and bilin of em are nothing in God s world but socialism in disguise And it s my bounden duty as a producer to resist every attack on the integrity of American industry to the last ditch Yes SIR mister Elder wiped his brow Dave Dyer added Sure You bet What they ought to do is simply to hang every one of these agitators and that would settle the whole thing right off Don t you think so doc You bet agreed Kennicott The conversation was at last relieved of the plague of Carol s intrusions and they settled down to the question of whether the justice of the peace had sent that hobo drunk to jail for ten days or twelve It was a matter not readily determined Then Dave Dyer communicated his carefree adventures on the gipsy trail Yep I get good time out of the flivver Bout a week ago I motored down to New Wurttemberg That s forty three No let s see It s seventeen miles to Belldale and bout six and three quarters call it seven to Torgenquist and it s a good nineteen miles from there to New Wurttemberg seventeen and seven and nineteen that makes uh let me see seventeen and seven s twenty four plus nineteen well say plus twenty that makes forty four well anyway say about forty three or four miles from here to New Wurttemberg We got started about seven fifteen prob ly seven twenty because I had to stop and fill the radiator and we ran along just keeping up a good steady gait mister Dyer did finally for reasons and purposes admitted and justified attain to New Wurttemberg Once only once the presence of the alien Carol was recognized Chet Dashaway leaned over and said asthmatically Say uh have you been reading this serial Two Out in Tingling Tales Corking yarn Gosh the fellow that wrote it certainly can sling baseball slang The others tried to look literary Harry Haydock offered Juanita is a great hand for reading high class stuff like Mid the Magnolias by this Sara Hetwiggin Butts and Riders of Ranch Reckless Books But me he glanced about importantly as one convinced that no other hero had ever been in so strange a plight I m so darn busy I don t have much time to read I never read anything I can t check against said Sam Clark Thus ended the literary portion of the conversation and for seven minutes Jackson Elder outlined reasons for believing that the pike fishing was better on the west shore of Lake Minniemashie than on the east though it was indeed quite true that on the east shore Nat Hicks had caught a pike altogether admirable The talk went on It did go on Their voices were monotonous thick emphatic They were harshly pompous like men in the smoking compartments of Pullman cars They did not bore Carol They frightened her She panted They will be cordial to me because my man belongs to their tribe God help me if I were an outsider Smiling as changelessly as an ivory figurine she sat quiescent avoiding thought glancing about the living room and hall noting their betrayal of unimaginative commercial prosperity Kennicott said Dandy interior eh My idea of how a place ought to be furnished Modern She looked polite and observed the oiled floors hard wood staircase unused fireplace with tiles which resembled brown linoleum cut glass vases standing upon doilies and the barred shut forbidding unit bookcases that were half filled with swashbuckler novels and unread looking sets of Dickens Kipling O Henry and Elbert Hubbard She perceived that even personalities were failing to hold the party The room filled with hesitancy as with a fog People cleared their throats tried to choke down yawns The men shot their cuffs and the women stuck their combs more firmly into their back hair Then a rattle a daring hope in every eye the swinging of a door the smell of strong coffee Dave Dyer s mewing voice in a triumphant The eats They began to chatter They had something to do They could escape from themselves They fell upon the food chicken sandwiches maple cake drug store ice cream Even when the food was gone they remained cheerful They could go home any time now and go to bed They went with a flutter of coats chiffon scarfs and good bys Carol and Kennicott walked home Did you like them he asked They were terribly sweet to me Uh Carrie You ought to be more careful about shocking folks Talking about gold stockings and about showing your ankles to schoolteachers and all More mildly You gave em a good time but I d watch out for that f I were you Juanita Haydock is such a damn cat I wouldn t give her a chance to criticize me My poor effort to lift up the party Was I wrong to try to amuse them No No Honey I didn t mean You were the only up and coming person in the bunch I just mean Don t get onto legs and all that immoral stuff Pretty conservative crowd She was silent raw with the shameful thought that the attentive circle might have been criticizing her laughing at her Don t please don t worry he pleaded Silence Gosh I m sorry I spoke about it I just meant But they were crazy about you Sam said to me That little lady of yours is the slickest thing that ever came to this town he said and Ma Dawson I didn t hardly know whether she d like you or not she s such a dried up old bird but she said Your bride is so quick and bright I declare she just wakes me up Carol liked praise the flavor and fatness of it but she was so energetically being sorry for herself that she could not taste this commendation Please Come on Cheer up His lips said it his anxious shoulder said it his arm about her said it as they halted on the obscure porch of their house Do you care if they think I m flighty Will Me Why I wouldn t care if the whole world thought you were this or that or anything else You re my well you re my soul He was an undefined mass as solid seeming as rock She found his sleeve pinched it cried I m glad It s sweet to be wanted You must tolerate my frivolousness You re all I have He lifted her carried her into the house and with her arms about his neck she forgot Main Street CHAPTER V I WE LL steal the whole day and go hunting I want you to see the country round here Kennicott announced at breakfast I d take the car want you to see how swell she runs since I put in a new piston But we ll take a team so we can get right out into the fields Not many prairie chickens left now but we might just happen to run onto a small covey He fussed over his hunting kit He pulled his hip boots out to full length and examined them for holes He feverishly counted his shotgun shells lecturing her on the qualities of smokeless powder He drew the new hammerless shotgun out of its heavy tan leather case and made her peep through the barrels to see how dazzlingly free they were from rust The world of hunting and camping outfits and fishing tackle was unfamiliar to her and in Kennicott s interest she found something creative and joyous She examined the smooth stock the carved hard rubber butt of the gun The shells with their brass caps and sleek green bodies and hieroglyphics on the wads were cool and comfortably heavy in her hands Kennicott wore a brown canvas hunting coat with vast pockets lining the inside corduroy trousers which bulged at the wrinkles peeled and scarred shoes a scarecrow felt hat In this uniform he felt virile They clumped out to the livery buggy they packed the kit and the box of lunch into the back crying to each other that it was a magnificent day Kennicott had borrowed Jackson Elder s red and white English setter a complacent dog with a waving tail of silver hair which flickered in the sunshine As they started the dog yelped and leaped at the horses heads till Kennicott took him into the buggy where he nuzzled Carol s knees and leaned out to sneer at farm mongrels The grays clattered out on the hard dirt road with a pleasant song of hoofs Ta ta ta rat Ta ta ta rat It was early and fresh the air whistling frost bright on the golden rod As the sun warmed the world of stubble into a welter of yellow they turned from the highroad through the bars of a farmer s gate into a field slowly bumping over the uneven earth In a hollow of the rolling prairie they lost sight even of the country road It was warm and placid Locusts trilled among the dry wheat stalks and brilliant little flies hurtled across the buggy A buzz of content filled the air Crows loitered and gossiped in the sky The dog had been let out and after a dance of excitement he settled down to a steady quartering of the field forth and back forth and back his nose down Pete Rustad owns this farm and he told me he saw a small covey of chickens in the west forty last week Maybe we ll get some sport after all Kennicott chuckled blissfully She watched the dog in suspense breathing quickly every time he seemed to halt She had no desire to slaughter birds but she did desire to belong to Kennicott s world The dog stopped on the point a forepaw held up By golly He s hit a scent Come on squealed Kennicott He leaped from the buggy twisted the reins about the whip socket swung her out caught up his gun slipped in two shells stalked toward the rigid dog Carol pattering after him The setter crawled ahead his tail quivering his belly close to the stubble Carol was nervous She expected clouds of large birds to fly up instantly Her eyes were strained with staring But they followed the dog for a quarter of a mile turning doubling crossing two low hills kicking through a swale of weeds crawling between the strands of a barbed wire fence The walking was hard on her pavement trained feet The earth was lumpy the stubble prickly and lined with grass thistles abortive stumps of clover She dragged and floundered She heard Kennicott gasp Look Three gray birds were starting up from the stubble They were round dumpy like enormous bumble bees Kennicott was sighting moving the barrel She was agitated Why didn t he fire The birds would be gone Then a crash another and two birds turned somersaults in the air plumped down When he showed her the birds she had no sensation of blood These heaps of feathers were so soft and unbruised there was about them no hint of death She watched her conquering man tuck them into his inside pocket and trudged with him back to the buggy They found no more prairie chickens that morning At noon they drove into her first farmyard a private village a white house with no porches save a low and quite dirty stoop at the back a crimson barn with white trimmings a glazed brick silo an ex carriage shed now the garage of a Ford an unpainted cow stable a chicken house a pig pen a corn crib a granary the galvanized iron skeleton tower of a wind mill The dooryard was of packed yellow clay treeless barren of grass littered with rusty plowshares and wheels of discarded cultivators Hardened trampled mud like lava filled the pig pen The doors of the house were grime rubbed the corners and eaves were rusted with rain and the child who stared at them from the kitchen window was smeary faced But beyond the barn was a clump of scarlet geraniums the prairie breeze was sunshine in motion the flashing metal blades of the windmill revolved with a lively hum a horse neighed a rooster crowed martins flew in and out of the cow stable A small spare woman with flaxen hair trotted from the house She was twanging a Swedish patois not in monotone like English but singing it with a lyrical whine Pete he say you kom pretty soon hunting doctor My dot s fine you kom Is dis de bride Ohhhh Ve yoost say las night ve hope maybe ve see her som day My soch a pretty lady missus Rustad was shining with welcome Vell vell Ay hope you lak dis country Von t you stay for dinner doctor No but I wonder if you wouldn t like to give us a glass of milk condescended Kennicott Vell Ay should say Ay vill You vait har a second and Ay run on de milk house She nervously hastened to a tiny red building beside the windmill she came back with a pitcher of milk from which Carol filled the thermos bottle As they drove off Carol admired She s the dearest thing I ever saw And she adores you You are the Lord of the Manor Oh no much pleased but still they do ask my advice about things Bully people these Scandinavian farmers And prosperous too Helga Rustad she s still scared of America but her kids will be doctors and lawyers and governors of the state and any darn thing they want to I wonder Carol was plunged back into last night s Weltschmerz I wonder if these farmers aren t bigger than we are So simple and hard working The town lives on them We townies are parasites and yet we feel superior to them Last night I heard mister Haydock talking about hicks Apparently he despises the farmers because they haven t reached the social heights of selling thread and buttons Parasites Us Where d the farmers be without the town Who lends them money Who why we supply them with everything Don t you find that some of the farmers think they pay too much for the services of the towns Oh of course there s a lot of cranks among the farmers same as there are among any class Listen to some of these kickers a fellow d think that the farmers ought to run the state and the whole shooting match probably if they had their way they d fill up the legislature with a lot of farmers in manure covered boots yes and they d come tell me I was hired on a salary now and couldn t fix my fees That d be fine for you wouldn t it But why shouldn t they Why That bunch of Telling ME Oh for

none	none	at a party but Let s forget it while we re hunting I know The Wonderlust probably it s a worse affliction than the Wanderlust I just wonder She told herself that she had everything in the world And after each self rebuke she stumbled again on I just wonder They ate their sandwiches by a prairie slew long grass reaching up out of clear water mossy bogs red winged black birds the scum a splash of gold green Kennicott smoked a pipe while she leaned back in the buggy and let her tired spirit be absorbed in the Nirvana of the incomparable sky They lurched to the highroad and awoke from their sun soaked drowse at the sound of the clopping hoofs They paused to look for partridges in a rim of woods little woods very clean and shiny and gay silver birches and poplars with immaculate green trunks encircling a lake of sandy bottom a splashing seclusion demure in the welter of hot prairie Kennicott brought down a fat red squirrel and at dusk he had a dramatic shot at a flight of ducks whirling down from the upper air skimming the lake instantly vanishing They drove home under the sunset Mounds of straw and wheat stacks like bee hives stood out in startling rose and gold and the green tufted stubble glistened As the vast girdle of crimson darkened the fulfilled land became autumnal in deep reds and browns The black road before the buggy turned to a faint lavender then was blotted to uncertain grayness Cattle came in a long line up to the barred gates of the farmyards and over the resting land was a dark glow Carol had found the dignity and greatness which had failed her in Main Street II Till they had a maid they took noon dinner and six o clock supper at missus Gurrey s boarding house missus Elisha Gurrey relict of Deacon Gurrey the dealer in hay and grain was a pointed nosed simpering woman with iron gray hair drawn so tight that it resembled a soiled handkerchief covering her head But she was unexpectedly cheerful and her dining room with its thin tablecloth on a long pine table had the decency of clean bareness In the line of unsmiling methodically chewing guests like horses at a manger Carol came to distinguish one countenance the pale long spectacled face and sandy pompadour hair of mister Raymond P Wutherspoon known as Raymie professional bachelor manager and one half the sales force in the shoe department of the Bon Ton Store You will enjoy Gopher Prairie very much missus Kennicott petitioned Raymie His eyes were like those of a dog waiting to be let in out of the cold He passed the stewed apricots effusively There are a great many bright cultured people here missus Wilks the Christian Science reader is a very bright woman though I am not a Scientist myself in fact I sing in the Episcopal choir And Miss Sherwin of the high school she is such a pleasing bright girl I was fitting her to a pair of tan gaiters yesterday I declare it really was a pleasure Gimme the butter Carrie was Kennicott s comment She defied him by encouraging Raymie Do you have amateur dramatics and so on here Oh yes The town s just full of talent The Knights of Pythias put on a dandy minstrel show last year It s nice you re so enthusiastic Oh do you really think so Lots of folks jolly me for trying to get up shows and so on I tell them they have more artistic gifts than they know Just yesterday I was saying to Harry Haydock if he would read poetry like Longfellow or if he would join the band I get so much pleasure out of playing the cornet and our band leader Del Snafflin is such a good musician I often say he ought to give up his barbering and become a professional musician he could play the clarinet in Minneapolis or New York or anywhere but but I couldn t get Harry to see it at all and I hear you and the doctor went out hunting yesterday Lovely country isn t it And did you make some calls The mercantile life isn t inspiring like medicine It must be wonderful to see how patients trust you doctor Huh It s me that s got to do all the trusting Be damn sight more wonderful f they d pay their bills grumbled Kennicott and to Carol he whispered something which sounded like gentleman hen But Raymie s pale eyes were watering at her She helped him with So you like to read poetry Oh yes so much though to tell the truth I don t get much time for reading we re always so busy at the store and But we had the dandiest professional reciter at the Pythian Sisters sociable last winter Carol thought she heard a grunt from the traveling salesman at the end of the table and Kennicott s jerking elbow was a grunt embodied She persisted Do you get to see many plays mister Wutherspoon He shone at her like a dim blue March moon and sighed No but I do love the movies I m a real fan One trouble with books is that they re not so thoroughly safeguarded by intelligent censors as the movies are and when you drop into the library and take out a book you never know what you re wasting your time on What I like in books is a wholesome really improving story and sometimes Why once I started a novel by this fellow Balzac that you read about and it told how a lady wasn t living with her husband I mean she wasn t his wife It went into details disgustingly And the English was real poor I spoke to the library about it and they took it off the shelves I m not narrow but I must say I don t see any use in this deliberately dragging in immorality Life itself is so full of temptations that in literature one wants only that which is pure and uplifting What s the name of that Balzac yarn Where can I get hold of it giggled the traveling salesman Raymie ignored him But the movies they are mostly clean and their humor Don t you think that the most essential quality for a person to have is a sense of humor I don t know I really haven t much said Carol He shook his finger at her Now now you re too modest I m sure we can all see that you have a perfectly corking sense of humor Besides doctor Kennicott wouldn t marry a lady that didn t have We all know how he loves his fun You bet I m a jokey old bird Come on Carrie let s beat it remarked Kennicott Raymie implored And what is your chief artistic interest missus Kennicott Oh Aware that the traveling salesman had murmured Dentistry she desperately hazarded Architecture That s a real nice art I ve always said when Haydock Simons were finishing the new front on the Bon Ton building the old man came to me you know Harry s father D H I always call him and he asked me how I liked it and I said to him Look here D H I said you see he was going to leave the front plain and I said to him It s all very well to have modern lighting and a big display space I said but when you get that in you want to have some architecture too I said and he laughed and said he guessed maybe I was right and so he had em put on a cornice Tin observed the traveling salesman Raymie bared his teeth like a belligerent mouse Well what if it is tin That s not my fault I told D H to make it polished granite You make me tired Leave us go Come on Carrie leave us go from Kennicott Raymie waylaid them in the hall and secretly informed Carol that she musn t mind the traveling salesman s coarseness he belonged to the hwa pollwa Kennicott chuckled Well child how about it Do you prefer an artistic guy like Raymie to stupid boobs like Sam Clark and me My dear Let s go home and play pinochle and laugh and be foolish and slip up to bed and sleep without dreaming It s beautiful to be just a solid citizeness III From the Gopher Prairie Weekly Dauntless One of the most charming affairs of the season was held Tuesday evening at the handsome new residence of Sam and missus Clark when many of our most prominent citizens gathered to greet the lovely new bride of our popular local physician doctor Will Kennicott All present spoke of the many charms of the bride formerly Miss Carol Milford of saint Paul Games and stunts were the order of the day with merry talk and conversation At a late hour dainty refreshments were served and the party broke up with many expressions of pleasure at the pleasant affair Among those present were Mesdames Kennicott Elder doctor Will Kennicott for the past several years one of our most popular and skilful physicians and surgeons gave the town a delightful surprise when he returned from an extended honeymoon tour in Colorado this week with his charming bride nee Miss Carol Milford of saint Paul whose family are socially prominent in Minneapolis and Mankato missus Kennicott is a lady of manifold charms not only of striking charm of appearance but is also a distinguished graduate of a school in the East and has for the past year been prominently connected in an important position of responsibility with the saint Paul Public Library in which city doctor Will had the good fortune to meet her The city of Gopher Prairie welcomes her to our midst and prophesies for her many happy years in the energetic city of the twin lakes and the future The doctor and missus Kennicott will reside for the present at the Doctor s home on Poplar Street which his charming mother has been keeping for him who has now returned to her own home at Lac qui Meurt leaving a host of friends who regret her absence and hope to see her soon with us again IV She knew that if she was ever to effect any of the reforms which she had pictured she must have a starting place What confused her during the three or four months after her marriage was not lack of perception that she must be definite but sheer careless happiness of her first home In the pride of being a housewife she loved every detail the brocade armchair with the weak back even the brass water cock on the hot water reservoir when she had become familiar with it by trying to scour it to brilliance She found a maid plump radiant Bea Sorenson from Scandia Crossing Bea was droll in her attempt to be at once a respectful servant and a bosom friend They laughed together over the fact that the stove did not draw over the slipperiness of fish in the pan Like a child playing Grandma in a trailing skirt Carol paraded uptown for her marketing crying greetings to housewives along the way Everybody bowed to her strangers and all and made her feel that they wanted her that she belonged here In city shops she was merely A Customer a hat a voice to bore a harassed clerk Here she was missus Doc Kennicott and her preferences in grape fruit and manners were known and remembered and worth discussing even if they weren t worth fulfilling Shopping was a delight of brisk conferences The very merchants whose droning she found the dullest at the two or three parties which were given to welcome her were the pleasantest confidants of all when they had something to talk about lemons or cotton voile or floor oil With that skip jack Dave Dyer the druggist she conducted a long mock quarrel She pretended that he cheated her in the price of magazines and candy he pretended she was a detective from the Twin Cities He hid behind the prescription counter and when she stamped her foot he came out wailing Honest I haven t done nothing crooked today not yet She never recalled her first impression of Main Street never had precisely the same despair at its ugliness By the end of two shopping tours everything had changed proportions As she never entered it the Minniemashie House ceased to exist for her Clark s Hardware Store Dyer s Drug Store the groceries of Ole Jenson and Frederick Ludelmeyer and Howland Gould the meat markets the notions shop they expanded and hid all other structures When she entered mister Ludelmeyer s store and he wheezed Goot mornin missus Kennicott Vell dis iss a fine day she did not notice the dustiness of the shelves nor the stupidity of the girl clerk and she did not remember the mute colloquy with him on her first view of Main Street She could not find half the kinds of food she wanted but that made shopping more of an adventure When she did contrive to get sweetbreads at Dahl Oleson s Meat Market the triumph was so vast that she buzzed with excitement and admired the strong wise butcher mister Dahl She appreciated the homely ease of village life She liked the old men farmers G A R veterans who when they gossiped sometimes squatted on their heels on the sidewalk like resting Indians and reflectively spat over the curb She found beauty in the children She had suspected that her married friends exaggerated their passion for children But in her work in the library children had become individuals to her citizens of the State with their own rights and their own senses of humor In the library she had not had much time to give them but now she knew the luxury of stopping gravely asking Bessie Clark whether her doll had yet recovered from its rheumatism and agreeing with Oscar Martinsen that it would be Good Fun to go trapping mushrats She touched the thought It would be sweet to have a baby of my own I do want one Tiny No Not yet There s so much to do And I m still tired from the job It s in my bones She rested at home She listened to the village noises common to all the world jungle or prairie sounds simple and charged with magic dogs barking chickens making a gurgling sound of content children at play a man beating a rug wind in the cottonwood trees a locust fiddling a footstep on the walk jaunty voices of Bea and a grocer s boy in the kitchen a clinking anvil a piano not too near Twice a week at least she drove into the country with Kennicott to hunt ducks in lakes enameled with sunset or to call on patients who looked up to her as the squire s lady and thanked her for toys and magazines Evenings she went with her husband to the motion pictures and was boisterously greeted by every other couple or till it became too cold they sat on the porch bawling to passers by in motors or to neighbors who were raking the leaves The dust became golden in the low sun the street was filled with the fragrance of burning leaves V But she hazily wanted some one to whom she could say what she thought On a slow afternoon when she fidgeted over sewing and wished that the telephone would ring Bea announced Miss Vida Sherwin Despite Vida Sherwin s lively blue eyes if you had looked at her in detail you would have found her face slightly lined and not so much sallow as with the bloom rubbed off you would have found her chest flat and her fingers rough from needle and chalk and penholder her blouses and plain cloth skirts undistinguished and her hat worn too far back betraying a dry forehead But you never did look at Vida Sherwin in detail You couldn t Her electric activity veiled her She was as energetic as a chipmunk Her fingers fluttered her sympathy came out in spurts she sat on the edge of a chair in eagerness to be near her auditor to send her enthusiasms and optimism across She rushed into the room pouring out I m afraid you ll think the teachers have been shabby in not coming near you but we wanted to give you a chance to get settled I am Vida Sherwin and I try to teach French and English and a few other things in the high school I ve been hoping to know the teachers You see I was a librarian Oh you needn t tell me I know all about you Awful how much I know this gossipy village We need you so much here It s a dear loyal town and isn t loyalty the finest thing in the world but it s a rough diamond and we need you for the polishing and we re ever so humble She stopped for breath and finished her compliment with a smile If I COULD help you in any way Would I be committing the unpardonable sin if I whispered that I think Gopher Prairie is a tiny bit ugly Of course it s ugly Dreadfully Though I m probably the only person in town to whom you could safely say that Except perhaps Guy Pollock the lawyer have you met him oh you MUST he s simply a darling intelligence and culture and so gentle But

none	none	so much about the ugliness That will change It s the spirit that gives me hope It s sound Wholesome But afraid It needs live creatures like you to awaken it I shall slave drive you Splendid What shall I do I ve been wondering if it would be possible to have a good architect come here to lecture Ye es but don t you think it would be better to work with existing agencies Perhaps it will sound slow to you but I was thinking It would be lovely if we could get you to teach Sunday School Carol had the empty expression of one who finds that she has been affectionately bowing to a complete stranger Oh yes But I m afraid I wouldn t be much good at that My religion is so foggy I know So is mine I don t care a bit for dogma Though I do stick firmly to the belief in the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man and the leadership of Jesus As you do of course Carol looked respectable and thought about having tea And that s all you need teach in Sunday School It s the personal influence Then there s the library board You d be so useful on that And of course there s our women s study club the Thanatopsis Club Are they doing anything Or do they read papers made out of the Encyclopedia Miss Sherwin shrugged Perhaps But still they are so earnest They will respond to your fresher interest And the Thanatopsis does do a good social work they ve made the city plant ever so many trees and they run the rest room for farmers wives And they do take such an interest in refinement and culture So in fact so very unique Carol was disappointed by nothing very tangible She said politely I ll think them all over I must have a while to look around first Miss Sherwin darted to her smoothed her hair peered at her Oh my dear don t you suppose I know These first tender days of marriage they re sacred to me Home and children that need you and depend on you to keep them alive and turn to you with their wrinkly little smiles And the hearth and She hid her face from Carol as she made an activity of patting the cushion of her chair but she went on with her former briskness I mean you must help us when you re ready I m afraid you ll think I m conservative I am So much to conserve All this treasure of American ideals Sturdiness and democracy and opportunity Maybe not at Palm Beach But thank heaven we re free from such social distinctions in Gopher Prairie I have only one good quality overwhelming belief in the brains and hearts of our nation our state our town It s so strong that sometimes I do have a tiny effect on the haughty ten thousandaires I shake em up and make em believe in ideals yes in themselves But I get into a rut of teaching I need young critical things like you to punch me up Tell me what are you reading I ve been re reading The Damnation of Theron Ware Do you know it Yes It was clever But hard Man wanted to tear down not build up Cynical Oh I do hope I m not a sentimentalist But I can t see any use in this high art stuff that doesn t encourage us day laborers to plod on Ensued a fifteen minute argument about the oldest topic in the world It s art but is it pretty Carol tried to be eloquent regarding honesty of observation Miss Sherwin stood out for sweetness and a cautious use of the uncomfortable properties of light At the end Carol cried I don t care how much we disagree It s a relief to have somebody talk something besides crops Let s make Gopher Prairie rock to its foundations let s have afternoon tea instead of afternoon coffee The delighted Bea helped her bring out the ancestral folding sewing table whose yellow and black top was scarred with dotted lines from a dressmaker s tracing wheel and to set it with an embroidered lunch cloth and the mauve glazed Japanese tea set which she had brought from saint Paul Miss Sherwin confided her latest scheme moral motion pictures for country districts with light from a portable dynamo hitched to a Ford engine Bea was twice called to fill the hot water pitcher and to make cinnamon toast When Kennicott came home at five he tried to be courtly as befits the husband of one who has afternoon tea Carol suggested that Miss Sherwin stay for supper and that Kennicott invite Guy Pollock the much praised lawyer the poetic bachelor Yes Pollock could come Yes he was over the grippe which had prevented his going to Sam Clark s party Carol regretted her impulse The man would be an opinionated politician heavily jocular about The Bride But at the entrance of Guy Pollock she discovered a personality Pollock was a man of perhaps thirty eight slender still deferential His voice was low It was very good of you to want me he said and he offered no humorous remarks and did not ask her if she didn t think Gopher Prairie was the livest little burg in the state She fancied that his even grayness might reveal a thousand tints of lavender and blue and silver At supper he hinted his love for Sir Thomas Browne Thoreau Agnes Repplier Arthur Symons Claude Washburn Charles Flandrau He presented his idols diffidently but he expanded in Carol s bookishness in Miss Sherwin s voluminous praise in Kennicott s tolerance of any one who amused his wife Carol wondered why Guy Pollock went on digging at routine law cases why he remained in Gopher Prairie She had no one whom she could ask Neither Kennicott nor Vida Sherwin would understand that there might be reasons why a Pollock should not remain in Gopher Prairie She enjoyed the faint mystery She felt triumphant and rather literary She already had a Group It would be only a while now before she provided the town with fanlights and a knowledge of Galsworthy She was doing things As she served the emergency dessert of cocoanut and sliced oranges she cried to Pollock Don t you think we ought to get up a dramatic club CHAPTER VI I WHEN the first dubious November snow had filtered down shading with white the bare clods in the plowed fields when the first small fire had been started in the furnace which is the shrine of a Gopher Prairie home Carol began to make the house her own She dismissed the parlor furniture the golden oak table with brass knobs the moldy brocade chairs the picture of The Doctor She went to Minneapolis to scamper through department stores and small Tenth Street shops devoted to ceramics and high thought She had to ship her treasures but she wanted to bring them back in her arms Carpenters had torn out the partition between front parlor and back parlor thrown it into a long room on which she lavished yellow and deep blue a Japanese obi with an intricacy of gold thread on stiff ultramarine tissue which she hung as a panel against the maize wall a couch with pillows of sapphire velvet and gold bands chairs which in Gopher Prairie seemed flippant She hid the sacred family phonograph in the dining room and replaced its stand with a square cabinet on which was a squat blue jar between yellow candles Kennicott decided against a fireplace We ll have a new house in a couple of years anyway She decorated only one room The rest Kennicott hinted she d better leave till he made a ten strike The brown cube of a house stirred and awakened it seemed to be in motion it welcomed her back from shopping it lost its mildewed repression The supreme verdict was Kennicott s Well by golly I was afraid the new junk wouldn t be so comfortable but I must say this divan or whatever you call it is a lot better than that bumpy old sofa we had and when I look around Well it s worth all it cost I guess Every one in town took an interest in the refurnishing The carpenters and painters who did not actually assist crossed the lawn to peer through the windows and exclaim Fine Looks swell Dave Dyer at the drug store Harry Haydock and Raymie Wutherspoon at the Bon Ton repeated daily How s the good work coming I hear the house is getting to be real classy Even missus Bogart missus Bogart lived across the alley from the rear of Carol s house She was a widow and a Prominent Baptist and a Good Influence She had so painfully reared three sons to be Christian gentlemen that one of them had become an Omaha bartender one a professor of Greek and one Cyrus N Bogart a boy of fourteen who was still at home the most brazen member of the toughest gang in Boytown missus Bogart was not the acid type of Good Influence She was the soft damp fat sighing indigestive clinging melancholy depressingly hopeful kind There are in every large chicken yard a number of old and indignant hens who resemble missus Bogart and when they are served at Sunday noon dinner as fricasseed chicken with thick dumplings they keep up the resemblance Carol had noted that missus Bogart from her side window kept an eye upon the house The Kennicotts and missus Bogart did not move in the same sets which meant precisely the same in Gopher Prairie as it did on Fifth Avenue or in Mayfair But the good widow came calling She wheezed in sighed gave Carol a pulpy hand sighed glanced sharply at the revelation of ankles as Carol crossed her legs sighed inspected the new blue chairs smiled with a coy sighing sound and gave voice I ve wanted to call on you so long dearie you know we re neighbors but I thought I d wait till you got settled you must run in and see me how much did that big chair cost Seventy seven dollars Sev Sakes alive Well I suppose it s all right for them that can afford it though I do sometimes think Of course as our pastor said once at Baptist Church By the way we haven t seen you there yet and of course your husband was raised up a Baptist and I do hope he won t drift away from the fold of course we all know there isn t anything not cleverness or gifts of gold or anything that can make up for humility and the inward grace and they can say what they want to about the P E church but of course there s no church that has more history or has stayed by the true principles of Christianity better than the Baptist Church and In what church were you raised missus Kennicott W why I went to Congregational as a girl in Mankato but my college was Universalist Well But of course as the Bible says is it the Bible at least I know I have heard it in church and everybody admits it it s proper for the little bride to take her husband s vessel of faith so we all hope we shall see you at the Baptist Church and As I was saying of course I agree with Reverend Zitterel in thinking that the great trouble with this nation today is lack of spiritual faith so few going to church and people automobiling on Sunday and heaven knows what all But still I do think that one trouble is this terrible waste of money people feeling that they ve got to have bath tubs and telephones in their houses I heard you were selling the old furniture cheap Yes Well of course you know your own mind but I can t help thinking when Will s ma was down here keeping house for him SHE used to run in to SEE me real OFTEN it was good enough furniture for her But there there I mustn t croak I just wanted to let you know that when you find you can t depend on a lot of these gadding young folks like the Haydocks and the Dyers and heaven only knows how much money Juanita Haydock blows in in a year why then you may be glad to know that slow old Aunty Bogart is always right there and heaven knows A portentous sigh I HOPE you and your husband won t have any of the troubles with sickness and quarreling and wasting money and all that so many of these young couples do have and But I must be running along now dearie It s been such a pleasure and Just run in and see me any time I hope Will is well I thought he looked a wee mite peaked It was twenty minutes later when missus Bogart finally oozed out of the front door Carol ran back into the living room and jerked open the windows That woman has left damp finger prints in the air she said II Carol was extravagant but at least she did not try to clear herself of blame by going about whimpering I know I m terribly extravagant but I don t seem to be able to help it Kennicott had never thought of giving her an allowance His mother had never had one As a wage earning spinster Carol had asserted to her fellow librarians that when she was married she was going to have an allowance and be business like and modern But it was too much trouble to explain to Kennicott s kindly stubbornness that she was a practical housekeeper as well as a flighty playmate She bought a budget plan account book and made her budgets as exact as budgets are likely to be when they lack budgets For the first month it was a honeymoon jest to beg prettily to confess I haven t a cent in the house dear and to be told You re an extravagant little rabbit But the budget book made her realize how inexact were her finances She became self conscious occasionally she was indignant that she should always have to petition him for the money with which to buy his food She caught herself criticizing his belief that since his joke about trying to keep her out of the poorhouse had once been accepted as admirable humor it should continue to be his daily bon mot It was a nuisance to have to run down the street after him because she had forgotten to ask him for money at breakfast But she couldn t hurt his feelings she reflected He liked the lordliness of giving largess She tried to reduce the frequency of begging by opening accounts and having the bills sent to him She had found that staple groceries sugar flour could be most cheaply purchased at Axel Egge s rustic general store She said sweetly to Axel I think I d better open a charge account here I don t do no business except for cash grunted Axel She flared Do you know who I am Yuh sure I know The doc is good for it But that s yoost a rule I made I make low prices I do business for cash She stared at his red impassive face and her fingers had the undignified desire to slap him but her reason agreed with him You re quite right You shouldn t break your rule for me Her rage had not been lost It had been transferred to her husband She wanted ten pounds of sugar in a hurry but she had no money She ran up the stairs to Kennicott s office On the door was a sign advertising a headache cure and stating The doctor is out back at Naturally the blank space was not filled out She stamped her foot She ran down to the drug store the doctor s club As she entered she heard missus Dyer demanding Dave I ve got to have some money Carol saw that her husband was there and two other men all listening in amusement Dave Dyer snapped How much do you want Dollar be enough No it won t I ve got to get some underclothes for the kids Why good Lord they got enough now to fill the closet so I couldn t find my hunting boots last time I wanted them I don t care They re all in rags You got to give me ten dollars Carol perceived that missus Dyer was accustomed to this indignity She perceived that the men particularly Dave regarded it as an excellent jest She waited she knew what would come it did Dave yelped Where s that ten dollars I gave you last year and he looked to the other men to laugh They laughed Cold and still Carol walked up to Kennicott and commanded I want to see you upstairs Why something the matter Yes He clumped after her up the stairs into his barren office Before he could get out a query she stated Yesterday in front of a saloon I heard a German farm wife beg her husband for a quarter to get a toy for the baby and he refused Just now I ve heard missus Dyer going through the same humiliation And I I m in the same position I have to beg you for money Daily I have just been informed that I couldn t have any sugar because I hadn t the money to pay for it Who said that By God I ll kill any Tut It wasn t his fault It was yours And mine I now humbly beg you to give me the money with which to buy meals for you to eat And hereafter to remember it The next time I sha n t beg I shall simply starve Do you understand I can t go on being a slave Her defiance her enjoyment of the role ran out She was sobbing against his overcoat How can you shame me so and he was blubbering Dog gone it I meant to give you some and I forgot it I swear I won t again By golly I won t He pressed fifty dollars upon her and after that he remembered to give her money regularly sometimes Daily she determined But I must have a stated amount be business like System I must do something about it And daily she didn t do anything about it III missus Bogart had by the simpering viciousness of her comments on the new furniture stirred Carol to economy She spoke judiciously to Bea about left overs She read the cookbook again and like a child with a picture book she studied the diagram of the beef which gallantly continues to browse though it is divided into cuts But she was a deliberate and joyous spendthrift in her preparations for her first party the housewarming She made lists on every envelope and laundry slip in her desk She sent orders to Minneapolis fancy grocers She pinned patterns and sewed She was irritated when Kennicott was jocular about these frightful big doings that are going on She regarded the affair as an attack on Gopher Prairie s timidity in pleasure I ll make em lively if nothing else I ll make em stop regarding parties as committee meetings Kennicott usually considered himself the master of the house At his desire she went hunting which was his symbol of happiness and she ordered porridge for breakfast which was his symbol of morality But when he came home on the afternoon before the housewarming he found himself a slave an intruder a blunderer Carol wailed Fix the furnace so

none	none	have to touch it after supper And for heaven s sake take that horrible old door mat off the porch And put on your nice brown and white shirt Why did you come home so late Would you mind hurrying Here it is almost suppertime and those fiends are just as likely as not to come at seven instead of eight PLEASE hurry She was as unreasonable as an amateur leading woman on a first night and he was reduced to humility When she came down to supper when she stood in the doorway he gasped She was in a silver sheath the calyx of a lily her piled hair like black glass she had the fragility and costliness of a Viennese goblet and her eyes were intense He was stirred to rise from the table and to hold the chair for her and all through supper he ate his bread dry because he felt that she would think him common if he said Will you hand me the butter IV She had reached the calmness of not caring whether her guests liked the party or not and a state of satisfied suspense in regard to Bea s technique in serving before Kennicott cried from the bay window in the living room Here comes somebody and mister and missus Luke Dawson faltered in at a quarter to eight Then in a shy avalanche arrived the entire aristocracy of Gopher Prairie all persons engaged in a profession or earning more than twenty five hundred dollars a year or possessed of grandparents born in America Even while they were removing their overshoes they were peeping at the new decorations Carol saw Dave Dyer secretively turn over the gold pillows to find a price tag and heard mister Julius Flickerbaugh the attorney gasp Well I ll be switched as he viewed the vermilion print hanging against the Japanese obi She was amused But her high spirits slackened as she beheld them form in dress parade in a long silent uneasy circle clear round the living room She felt that she had been magically whisked back to her first party at Sam Clark s Have I got to lift them like so many pigs of iron I don t know that I can make them happy but I ll make them hectic A silver flame in the darkling circle she whirled around drew them with her smile and sang I want my party to be noisy and undignified This is the christening of my house and I want you to help me have a bad influence on it so that it will be a giddy house For me won t you all join in an old fashioned square dance And mister Dyer will call She had a record on the phonograph Dave Dyer was capering in the center of the floor loose jointed lean small rusty headed pointed of nose clapping his hands and shouting Swing y pardners alamun lef Even the millionaire Dawsons and Ezra Stowbody and Professor George Edwin Mott danced looking only slightly foolish and by rushing about the room and being coy and coaxing to all persons over forty five Carol got them into a waltz and a Virginia Reel But when she left them to disenjoy themselves in their own way Harry Haydock put a one step record on the phonograph the younger people took the floor and all the elders sneaked back to their chairs with crystallized smiles which meant Don t believe I ll try this one myself but I do enjoy watching the youngsters dance Half of them were silent half resumed the discussions of that afternoon in the store Ezra Stowbody hunted for something to say hid a yawn and offered to Lyman Cass the owner of the flour mill How d you folks like the new furnace Lym Huh So Oh let them alone Don t pester them They must like it or they wouldn t do it Carol warned herself But they gazed at her so expectantly when she flickered past that she was reconvinced that in their debauches of respectability they had lost the power of play as well as the power of impersonal thought Even the dancers were gradually crushed by the invisible force of fifty perfectly pure and well behaved and negative minds and they sat down two by two In twenty minutes the party was again elevated to the decorum of a prayer meeting We re going to do something exciting Carol exclaimed to her new confidante Vida Sherwin She saw that in the growing quiet her voice had carried across the room Nat Hicks Ella Stowbody and Dave Dyer were abstracted fingers and lips slightly moving She knew with a cold certainty that Dave was rehearsing his stunt about the Norwegian catching the hen Ella running over the first lines of An Old Sweetheart of Mine and Nat thinking of his popular parody on Mark Antony s oration But I will not have anybody use the word stunt in my house she whispered to Miss Sherwin That s good I tell you why not have Raymond Wutherspoon sing Raymie Why my dear he s the most sentimental yearner in town See here child Your opinions on house decorating are sound but your opinions of people are rotten Raymie does wag his tail But the poor dear Longing for what he calls self expression and no training in anything except selling shoes But he can sing And some day when he gets away from Harry Haydock s patronage and ridicule he ll do something fine Carol apologized for her superciliousness She urged Raymie and warned the planners of stunts We all want you to sing mister Wutherspoon You re the only famous actor I m going to let appear on the stage tonight While Raymie blushed and admitted Oh they don t want to hear me he was clearing his throat pulling his clean handkerchief farther out of his breast pocket and thrusting his fingers between the buttons of his vest In her affection for Raymie s defender in her desire to discover artistic talent Carol prepared to be delighted by the recital Raymie sang Fly as a Bird Thou Art My Dove and When the Little Swallow Leaves Its Tiny Nest all in a reasonably bad offertory tenor Carol was shuddering with the vicarious shame which sensitive people feel when they listen to an elocutionist being humorous or to a precocious child publicly doing badly what no child should do at all She wanted to laugh at the gratified importance in Raymie s half shut eyes she wanted to weep over the meek ambitiousness which clouded like an aura his pale face flap ears and sandy pompadour She tried to look admiring for the benefit of Miss Sherwin that trusting admirer of all that was or conceivably could be the good the true and the beautiful At the end of the third ornithological lyric Miss Sherwin roused from her attitude of inspired vision and breathed to Carol My That was sweet Of course Raymond hasn t an unusually good voice but don t you think he puts such a lot of feeling into it Carol lied blackly and magnificently but without originality Oh yes I do think he has so much FEELING She saw that after the strain of listening in a cultured manner the audience had collapsed had given up their last hope of being amused She cried Now we re going to play an idiotic game which I learned in Chicago You will have to take off your shoes for a starter After that you will probably break your knees and shoulder blades Much attention and incredulity A few eyebrows indicating a verdict that Doc Kennicott s bride was noisy and improper I shall choose the most vicious like Juanita Haydock and myself as the shepherds The rest of you are wolves Your shoes are the sheep The wolves go out into the hall The shepherds scatter the sheep through this room then turn off all the lights and the wolves crawl in from the hall and in the darkness they try to get the shoes away from the shepherds who are permitted to do anything except bite and use black jacks The wolves chuck the captured shoes out into the hall No one excused Come on Shoes off Every one looked at every one else and waited for every one else to begin Carol kicked off her silver slippers and ignored the universal glance at her arches The embarrassed but loyal Vida Sherwin unbuttoned her high black shoes Ezra Stowbody cackled Well you re a terror to old folks You re like the gals I used to go horseback riding with back in the sixties Ain t much accustomed to attending parties barefoot but here goes With a whoop and a gallant jerk Ezra snatched off his elastic sided Congress shoes The others giggled and followed When the sheep had been penned up in the darkness the timorous wolves crept into the living room squealing halting thrown out of their habit of stolidity by the strangeness of advancing through nothingness toward a waiting foe a mysterious foe which expanded and grew more menacing The wolves peered to make out landmarks they touched gliding arms which did not seem to be attached to a body they quivered with a rapture of fear Reality had vanished A yelping squabble suddenly rose then Juanita Haydock s high titter and Guy Pollock s astonished Ouch Quit You re scalping me missus Luke Dawson galloped backward on stiff hands and knees into the safety of the lighted hallway moaning I declare I nev was so upset in my life But the propriety was shaken out of her and she delightedly continued to ejaculate Nev in my LIFE as she saw the living room door opened by invisible hands and shoes hurling through it as she heard from the darkness beyond the door a squawling a bumping a resolute Here s a lot of shoes Come on you wolves Ow Y would would you When Carol abruptly turned on the lights in the embattled living room half of the company were sitting back against the walls where they had craftily remained throughout the engagement but in the middle of the floor Kennicott was wrestling with Harry Haydock their collars torn off their hair in their eyes and the owlish mister Julius Flickerbaugh was retreating from Juanita Haydock and gulping with unaccustomed laughter Guy Pollock s discreet brown scarf hung down his back Young Rita Simons s net blouse had lost two buttons and betrayed more of her delicious plump shoulder than was regarded as pure in Gopher Prairie Whether by shock disgust joy of combat or physical activity all the party were freed from their years of social decorum George Edwin Mott giggled Luke Dawson twisted his beard missus Clark insisted I did too Sam I got a shoe I never knew I could fight so terrible Carol was certain that she was a great reformer She mercifully had combs mirrors brushes needle and thread ready She permitted them to restore the divine decency of buttons The grinning Bea brought down stairs a pile of soft thick sheets of paper with designs of lotos blossoms dragons apes in cobalt and crimson and gray and patterns of purple birds flying among sea green trees in the valleys of Nowhere These Carol announced are real Chinese masquerade costumes I got them from an importing shop in Minneapolis You are to put them on over your clothes and please forget that you are Minnesotans and turn into mandarins and coolies and and samurai isn t it and anything else you can think of While they were shyly rustling the paper costumes she disappeared Ten minutes after she gazed down from the stairs upon grotesquely ruddy Yankee heads above Oriental robes and cried to them The Princess Winky Poo salutes her court As they looked up she caught their suspense of admiration They saw an airy figure in trousers and coat of green brocade edged with gold a high gold collar under a proud chin black hair pierced with jade pins a languid peacock fan in an out stretched hand eyes uplifted to a vision of pagoda towers When she dropped her pose and smiled down she discovered Kennicott apoplectic with domestic pride and gray Guy Pollock staring beseechingly For a second she saw nothing in all the pink and brown mass of their faces save the hunger of the two men She shook off the spell and ran down We re going to have a real Chinese concert Messrs Pollock Kennicott and well Stowbody are drummers the rest of us sing and play the fife The fifes were combs with tissue paper the drums were tabourets and the sewing table Loren Wheeler editor of the Dauntless led the orchestra with a ruler and a totally inaccurate sense of rhythm The music was a reminiscence of tom toms heard at circus fortune telling tents or at the Minnesota State Fair but the whole company pounded and puffed and whined in a sing song and looked rapturous Before they were quite tired of the concert Carol led them in a dancing procession to the dining room to blue bowls of chow mein with Lichee nuts and ginger preserved in syrup None of them save that city rounder Harry Haydock had heard of any Chinese dish except chop sooey With agreeable doubt they ventured through the bamboo shoots into the golden fried noodles of the chow mein and Dave Dyer did a not very humorous Chinese dance with Nat Hicks and there was hubbub and contentment Carol relaxed and found that she was shockingly tired She had carried them on her thin shoulders She could not keep it up She longed for her father that artist at creating hysterical parties She thought of smoking a cigarette to shock them and dismissed the obscene thought before it was quite formed She wondered whether they could for five minutes be coaxed to talk about something besides the winter top of Knute Stamquist s Ford and what Al Tingley had said about his mother in law She sighed Oh let em alone I ve done enough She crossed her trousered legs and snuggled luxuriously above her saucer of ginger she caught Pollock s congratulatory still smile and thought well of herself for having thrown a rose light on the pallid lawyer repented the heretical supposition that any male save her husband existed jumped up to find Kennicott and whisper Happy my lord No it didn t cost much Best party this town ever saw Only Don t cross your legs in that costume Shows your knees too plain She was vexed She resented his clumsiness She returned to Guy Pollock and talked of Chinese religions not that she knew anything whatever about Chinese religions but he had read a book on the subject as on lonely evenings in his office he had read at least one book on every subject in the world Guy s thin maturity was changing in her vision to flushed youth and they were roaming an island in the yellow sea of chatter when she realized that the guests were beginning that cough which indicated in the universal instinctive language that they desired to go home and go to bed While they asserted that it had been the nicest party they d ever seen my so clever and original she smiled tremendously shook hands and cried many suitable things regarding children and being sure to wrap up warmly and Raymie s singing and Juanita Haydock s prowess at games Then she turned wearily to Kennicott in a house filled with quiet and crumbs and shreds of Chinese costumes He was gurgling I tell you Carrie you certainly are a wonder and guess you re right about waking folks up Now you ve showed em how they won t go on having the same old kind of parties and stunts and everything Here Don t touch a thing Done enough Pop up to bed and I ll clear up His wise surgeon s hands stroked her shoulder and her irritation at his clumsiness was lost in his strength V From the Weekly Dauntless One of the most delightful social events of recent months was held Wednesday evening in the housewarming of doctor and missus Kennicott who have completely redecorated their charming home on Poplar Street and is now extremely nifty in modern color scheme The doctor and his bride were at home to their numerous friends and a number of novelties in diversions were held including a Chinese orchestra in original and genuine Oriental costumes of which Ye Editor was leader Dainty refreshments were served in true Oriental style and one and all voted a delightful time VI The week after the Chet Dashaways gave a party

512_124520_000004_000000	train-clean-360	GOPHER PRAIRIE was digging in for the winter 
512_124520_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Through late November and all December it snowed daily the thermometer was at zero and might drop to twenty below or thirty 
512_124520_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Winter is not a season in the North Middlewest it is an industry 
512_124520_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Storm sheds were erected at every door In every block the householders Sam Clark the wealthy mister Dawson all save asthmatic Ezra Stowbody who extravagantly hired a boy were seen perilously staggering up ladders carrying storm windows and screwing them to second story jambs 
512_124520_000004_000004	train-clean-360	While Kennicott put up his windows Carol danced inside the bedrooms and begged him not to swallow the screws which he held in his mouth like an extraordinary set of external false teeth 
none	none	The universal sign of winter was the town handyman Miles Bjornstam a tall thick red mustached bachelor opinionated atheist general store arguer cynical Santa Claus Children loved him and he sneaked away from work to tell them improbable stories of sea faring and horse trading and bears 
512_124520_000005_000002	train-clean-360	The children s parents either laughed at him or hated him 
512_124520_000005_000003	train-clean-360	He was the one democrat in town 
512_124520_000005_000004	train-clean-360	He called both Lyman Cass the miller and the Finn homesteader from Lost Lake by their first names He was known as The Red Swede and considered slightly insane 
512_124520_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Bjornstam could do anything with his hands solder a pan weld an automobile spring soothe a frightened filly tinker a clock carve a Gloucester schooner which magically went into a bottle 
512_124520_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Now for a week he was commissioner general of Gopher Prairie 
512_124520_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He was the only person besides the repairman at Sam Clark s who understood plumbing 
none	none	Everybody begged him to look over the furnace and the water pipes 
512_124520_000006_000004	train-clean-360	He rushed from house to house till after bedtime ten o clock 
512_124520_000006_000005	train-clean-360	Icicles from burst water pipes hung along the skirt of his brown dog skin overcoat his plush cap which he never took off in the house was a pulp of ice and coal dust his red hands were cracked to rawness he chewed the stub of a cigar 
512_124520_000007_000000	train-clean-360	But he was courtly to Carol 
512_124520_000007_000001	train-clean-360	He stooped to examine the furnace flues he straightened glanced down at her and hemmed Got to fix your furnace no matter what else I do 
none	none	The poorer houses of Gopher Prairie where the services of Miles Bjornstam were a luxury which included the shanty of Miles Bjornstam were banked to the lower windows with earth and manure 
512_124520_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Along the railroad the sections of snow fence which had been stacked all summer in romantic wooden tents occupied by roving small boys were set up to prevent drifts from covering the track 
none	none	The farmers came into town in home made sleighs with bed quilts and hay piled in the rough boxes Fur coats fur caps fur mittens overshoes buckling almost to the knees gray knitted scarfs ten feet long thick woolen socks canvas jackets lined with fluffy yellow wool like the plumage of ducklings moccasins red flannel wristlets for the blazing chapped wrists of boys these protections against winter were busily dug out of moth ball sprinkled drawers and tar bags in closets and all over town small boys were squealing Oh there s my mittens or Look at my shoe packs There is so sharp a division between the panting summer and the stinging winter of the Northern plains that they rediscovered with surprise and a feeling of heroism this armor of an Artic explorer 
512_124520_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Winter garments surpassed even personal gossip as the topic at parties It was good form to ask Put on your heavies yet There were as many distinctions in wraps as in motor cars 
512_124520_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The lesser sort appeared in yellow and black dogskin coats but Kennicott was lordly in a long raccoon ulster and a new seal cap 
none	none	When the snow was too deep for his motor he went off on country calls in a shiny floral steel tipped cutter only his ruddy nose and his cigar emerging from the fur 
512_124520_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Carol herself stirred Main Street by a loose coat of nutria 
none	none	Her finger tips loved the silken fur Her liveliest activity now was organizing outdoor sports in the motor paralyzed town The automobile and bridge whist had not only made more evident the social divisions in Gopher Prairie but they had also enfeebled the love of activity 
512_124520_000014_000001	train-clean-360	It was so rich looking to sit and drive and so easy Skiing and sliding were stupid and old fashioned In fact the village longed for the elegance of city recreations almost as much as the cities longed for village sports and Gopher Prairie took as much pride in neglecting coasting as saint Paul or New York in going coasting 
none	none	Carol did inspire a successful skating party in mid November Plover Lake glistened in clear sweeps of gray green ice ringing to the skates On shore the ice tipped reeds clattered in the wind and oak twigs with stubborn last leaves hung against a milky sky 
512_124520_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Harry Haydock did figure eights and Carol was certain that she had found the perfect life 
none	none	But when snow had ended the skating and she tried to get up a moonlight sliding party the matrons hesitated to stir away from their radiators and their daily bridge whist imitations of the city 
512_124520_000014_000006	train-clean-360	She had to nag them 
512_124520_000014_000007	train-clean-360	They scooted down a long hill on a bob sled they upset and got snow down their necks they shrieked that they would do it again immediately and they did not do it again at all 
512_124520_000015_000000	train-clean-360	She badgered another group into going skiing 
none	none	They shouted and threw snowballs and informed her that it was SUCH fun and they d have another skiing expedition right away and they jollily returned home and never thereafter left their manuals of bridge 
512_124520_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Carol was discouraged 
none	none	She was grateful when Kennicott invited her to go rabbit hunting in the woods She waded down stilly cloisters between burnt stump and icy oak through drifts marked with a million hieroglyphics of rabbit and mouse and bird She squealed as he leaped on a pile of brush and fired at the rabbit which ran out 
512_124520_000016_000004	train-clean-360	He belonged there masculine in reefer and sweater and high laced boots 
512_124520_000016_000005	train-clean-360	That night she ate prodigiously of steak and fried potatoes she produced electric sparks by touching his ear with her finger tip she slept twelve hours and awoke to think how glorious was this brave land 
none	none	She rose to a radiance of sun on snow 
512_124520_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Snug in her furs she trotted up town 
none	none	Frosted shingles smoked against a sky colored like flax blossoms sleigh bells clinked shouts of greeting were loud in the thin bright air and everywhere was a rhythmic sound of wood sawing It was Saturday and the neighbors sons were getting up the winter fuel Behind walls of corded wood in back yards their sawbucks stood in depressions scattered with canary yellow flakes of sawdust 
512_124520_000017_000004	train-clean-360	The frames of their buck saws were cherry red the blades blued steel and the fresh cut ends of the sticks poplar maple iron wood birch were marked with engraved rings of growth 
512_124520_000017_000005	train-clean-360	The boys wore shoe packs blue flannel shirts with enormous pearl buttons and mackinaws of crimson lemon yellow and foxy brown 
512_124520_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Carol cried Fine day to the boys she came in a glow to Howland Gould s grocery her collar white with frost from her breath she bought a can of tomatoes as though it were Orient fruit and returned home planning to surprise Kennicott with an omelet creole for dinner 
512_124520_000019_000000	train-clean-360	So brilliant was the snow glare that when she entered the house she saw the door knobs the newspaper on the table every white surface as dazzling mauve and her head was dizzy in the pyrotechnic dimness 
512_124520_000019_000001	train-clean-360	When her eyes had recovered she felt expanded drunk with health mistress of life 
none	none	The world was so luminous that she sat down at her rickety little desk in the living room to make a poem She got no farther than The sky is bright the sun is warm there ne er will be another storm 
512_124520_000020_000000	train-clean-360	In the mid afternoon of this same day Kennicott was called into the country 
none	none	It was Bea s evening out her evening for the Lutheran Dance Carol was alone from three till midnight She wearied of reading pure love stories in the magazines and sat by a radiator beginning to brood 
512_124520_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Thus she chanced to discover that she had nothing to do 
none	none	II She had she meditated passed through the novelty of seeing the town and meeting people of skating and sliding and hunting Bea was competent there was no household labor except sewing and darning and gossipy assistance to Bea in bed making She couldn t satisfy her ingenuity in planning meals At Dahl Oleson s Meat Market you didn t give orders you wofully inquired whether there was anything today besides steak and pork and ham 
512_124520_000023_000004	train-clean-360	The cuts of beef were not cuts 
512_124520_000023_000005	train-clean-360	They were hacks 
512_124520_000023_000006	train-clean-360	Lamb chops were as exotic as sharks fins 
none	none	The meat dealers shipped their best to the city with its higher prices In all the shops there was the same lack of choice 
512_124520_000024_000001	train-clean-360	She could not find a glass headed picture nail in town she did not hunt for the sort of veiling she wanted she took what she could get and only at Howland Gould s was there such a luxury as canned asparagus 
none	none	Routine care was all she could devote to the house 
512_124520_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Only by such fussing as the Widow Bogart s could she make it fill her time 
512_124520_000025_000000	train-clean-360	She could not have outside employment 
512_124520_000025_000001	train-clean-360	To the village doctor s wife it was taboo 
512_124520_000026_000000	train-clean-360	She was a woman with a working brain and no work 
512_124520_000027_000000	train-clean-360	There were only three things which she could do Have children start her career of reforming or become so definitely a part of the town that she would be fulfilled by the activities of church and study club and bridge parties 
512_124520_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Children yes she wanted them but She was not quite ready 
512_124520_000028_000001	train-clean-360	She had been embarrassed by Kennicott s frankness but she agreed with him that in the insane condition of civilization which made the rearing of citizens more costly and perilous than any other crime it was inadvisable to have children till he had made more money 
512_124520_000028_000002	train-clean-360	She was sorry Perhaps he had made all the mystery of love a mechanical cautiousness but She fled from the thought with a dubious Some day 
512_124520_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Her reforms her impulses toward beauty in raw Main Street they had become indistinct 
512_124520_000029_000001	train-clean-360	But she would set them going now 
none	none	She would She swore it with soft fist beating the edges of the radiator And at the end of all her vows she had no notion as to when and where the crusade was to begin 
512_124520_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Become an authentic part of the town 
512_124520_000030_000001	train-clean-360	She began to think with unpleasant lucidity 
512_124520_000030_000002	train-clean-360	She reflected that she did not know whether the people liked her 
none	none	She had gone to the women at afternoon coffees to the merchants in their stores with so many outpouring comments and whimsies that she hadn t given them a chance to betray their opinions of her 
512_124520_000030_000004	train-clean-360	The men smiled but did they like her 
none	none	She was lively among the women but was she one of them She could not recall many times when she had been admitted to the whispering of scandal which is the secret chamber of Gopher Prairie conversation 
512_124520_000031_000000	train-clean-360	She was poisoned with doubt as she drooped up to bed 
512_124520_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Next day through her shopping her mind sat back and observed 
none	none	Dave Dyer and Sam Clark were as cordial as she had been fancying but wasn t there an impersonal abruptness in the H are yuh of Chet Dashaway Howland the grocer was curt 
512_124520_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Was that merely his usual manner 
512_124520_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 It s infuriating to have to pay attention to what people think 
none	none	In saint Paul I didn t care 
512_124520_000033_000002	train-clean-360	But here I m spied on 
512_124520_000033_000003	train-clean-360	They re watching me 
none	none	I mustn t let it make me self conscious she coaxed herself overstimulated by the drug of thought and offensively on the defensive III 
512_124520_000035_000000	train-clean-360	A thaw which stripped the snow from the sidewalks a ringing iron night when the lakes could be heard booming a clear roistering morning 
512_124520_000035_000001	train-clean-360	In tam o shanter and tweed skirt Carol felt herself a college junior going out to play hockey 
512_124520_000035_000002	train-clean-360	She wanted to whoop her legs ached to run 
none	none	On the way home from shopping she yielded as a pup would have yielded 
512_124520_000035_000004	train-clean-360	She galloped down a block and as she jumped from a curb across a welter of slush she gave a student Yippee 
none	none	She saw that in a window three old women were gasping Their triple glare was paralyzing 
512_124520_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Across the street at another window the curtain had secretively moved 
512_124520_000036_000003	train-clean-360	She stopped walked on sedately changed from the girl Carol into missus doctor Kennicott 
none	none	She never again felt quite young enough and defiant enough and free enough to run and halloo in the public streets and it was as a Nice Married Woman that she attended the next weekly bridge of the Jolly Seventeen IV The Jolly Seventeen the membership of which ranged from fourteen to twenty six was the social cornice of Gopher Prairie It was the country club the diplomatic set the saint Cecilia the Ritz oval room the Club de Vingt To belong to it was to be in Though its membership partly coincided with that of the Thanatopsis study club the Jolly Seventeen as a separate entity guffawed at the Thanatopsis and considered it middle class and even highbrow Most of the Jolly Seventeen were young married women with their husbands as associate members Once a week they had a women s afternoon bridge once a month the husbands joined them for supper and evening bridge twice a year they had dances at I O O F Hall 
512_124520_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Then the town exploded 
none	none	Only at the annual balls of the Firemen and of the Eastern Star was there such prodigality of chiffon scarfs and tangoing and heart burnings and these rival institutions were not select hired girls attended the Firemen s Ball with section hands and laborers Ella Stowbody had once gone to a Jolly Seventeen Soiree in the village hack hitherto confined to chief mourners at funerals and Harry Haydock and doctor Terry Gould always appeared in the town s only specimens of evening clothes The afternoon bridge of the Jolly Seventeen which followed Carol s lonely doubting was held at Juanita Haydock s new concrete bungalow with its door of polished oak and beveled plate glass jar of ferns in the plastered hall and in the living room a fumed oak Morris chair sixteen color prints and a square varnished table with a mat made of cigar ribbons on which was one Illustrated Gift Edition and one pack of cards in a burnt leather case 
512_124520_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Carol stepped into a sirocco of furnace heat 
512_124520_000042_000001	train-clean-360	They were already playing Despite her flabby resolves she had not yet learned bridge 
none	none	She was winningly apologetic about it to Juanita and ashamed that she should have to go on being apologetic missus Dave Dyer a sallow woman with a thin prettiness devoted to experiments in religious cults illnesses and scandal bearing shook her finger at Carol and trilled You re a naughty one I don t believe you appreciate the honor when you got into the Jolly Seventeen so easy missus Chet Dashaway nudged her neighbor at the second table But Carol kept up the appealing bridal manner so far as possible 
512_124520_000044_000002	train-clean-360	She twittered You re perfectly right 
512_124520_000044_000003	train-clean-360	I m a lazy thing 
none	none	I ll make Will start teaching me this very evening Her supplication had all the sound of birdies in the nest and Easter church bells and frosted Christmas cards Internally she snarled That ought to be saccharine enough She sat in the smallest rocking chair a model of Victorian modesty But she saw or she imagined that the women who had gurgled at her so welcomingly when she had first come to Gopher Prairie were nodding at her brusquely During the pause after the first game she petitioned missus Jackson Elder Don t you think we ought to get up another bob sled party soon It s so cold when you get dumped in the snow said missus Elder indifferently I hate snow down my neck volunteered missus Dave Dyer with an unpleasant look at Carol and turning her back she bubbled at Rita Simons Dearie won t you run in this evening I ve got the loveliest new Butterick pattern I want to show you Carol crept back to her chair In the fervor of discussing the game they ignored her She was not used to being a wallflower She struggled to keep from oversensitiveness from becoming unpopular by the sure method of believing that she was unpopular but she hadn t much reserve of patience and at the end of the second game when Ella Stowbody sniffily asked her Are you going to send to Minneapolis for your dress for the next soiree heard you were Carol said Don t know yet with unnecessary sharpness She was relieved by the admiration with which the jeune fille Rita Simons looked at the steel buckles on her pumps but she resented missus Howland s tart demand Don t you find that new couch of yours is too broad to be practical She nodded then shook her head and touchily left missus Howland to get out of it any meaning she desired Immediately she wanted to make peace She was close to simpering in the sweetness with which she addressed missus Howland I think that is the prettiest display of beef tea your husband has in his store Oh yes Gopher Prairie isn t so much behind the times gibed missus Howland 
512_124520_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Some one giggled 
none	none	Their rebuffs made her haughty her haughtiness irritated them to franker rebuffs they were working up to a state of painfully righteous war when they were saved by the coming of food Though Juanita Haydock was highly advanced in the matters of finger bowls doilies and bath mats her refreshments were typical of all the afternoon coffees Juanita s best friends missus Dyer and missus Dashaway passed large dinner plates each with a spoon a fork and a coffee cup without saucer They apologized and discussed the afternoon s game as they passed through the thicket of women s feet Then they distributed hot buttered rolls coffee poured from an enamel ware pot stuffed olives potato salad and angel s food cake There was even in the most strictly conforming Gopher Prairie circles a certain option as to collations 
512_124520_000052_000005	train-clean-360	The olives need not be stuffed 
none	none	Doughnuts were in some houses well thought of as a substitute for the hot buttered rolls But there was in all the town no heretic save Carol who omitted angel s food They ate enormously Carol had a suspicion that the thriftier housewives made the afternoon treat do for evening supper 
512_124520_000054_000000	train-clean-360	She tried to get back into the current 
none	none	She edged over to missus McGanum Chunky amiable young missus McGanum with her breast and arms of a milkmaid and her loud delayed laugh which burst startlingly from a sober face was the daughter of old doctor Westlake and the wife of Westlake s partner doctor McGanum Kennicott asserted that Westlake and McGanum and their contaminated families were tricky but Carol had found them gracious She asked for friendliness by crying to missus McGanum How is the baby s throat now and she was attentive while missus McGanum rocked and knitted and placidly described symptoms Vida Sherwin came in after school with Miss Ethel Villets the town librarian Miss Sherwin s optimistic presence gave Carol more confidence 
512_124520_000055_000002	train-clean-360	She talked 
none	none	She informed the circle I drove almost down to Wahkeenyan with Will a few days ago 
512_124520_000055_000004	train-clean-360	Isn t the country lovely 
none	none	And I do admire the Scandinavian farmers down there so their big red barns and silos and milking machines and everything Do you all know that lonely Lutheran church with the tin covered spire that stands out alone on a hill It s so bleak somehow it seems so brave I do think the Scandinavians are the hardiest and best people
512_124520_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh do you THINK so protested missus Jackson Elder 
none	none	My husband says the Svenskas that work in the planing mill are perfectly terrible so silent and cranky and so selfish the way they keep demanding raises If they had their way they d simply ruin the business Yes and they re simply GHASTLY hired girls wailed missus Dave Dyer I swear I work myself to skin and bone trying to please my hired girls when I can get them I do everything in the world for them They can have their gentleman friends call on them in the kitchen any time and they get just the same to eat as we do if there s any left over and I practically never jump on them 
512_124520_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Juanita Haydock rattled They re ungrateful all that class of people I do think the domestic problem is simply becoming awful 
none	none	I don t know what the country s coming to with these Scandahoofian clodhoppers demanding every cent you can save and so ignorant and impertinent and on my word demanding bath tubs and everything as if they weren t mighty good and lucky at home if they got a bath in the wash tub 
512_124520_000059_000000	train-clean-360	They were off riding hard 
none	none	Carol thought of Bea and waylaid them But isn t it possibly the fault of the mistresses if the maids are ungrateful For generations we ve given them the leavings of food and holes to live in I don t want to boast but I must say I don t have much trouble with Bea She s so friendly The Scandinavians are sturdy and honest 
512_124520_000061_000000	train-clean-360	missus Dave Dyer snapped Honest 
512_124520_000061_000001	train-clean-360	Do you call it honest to hold us up for every cent of pay they can get 
none	none	I can t say that I ve had any of them steal anything though you might call it stealing to eat so much that a roast of beef hardly lasts three days but just the same I don t intend to let them think they can put anything over on ME I always make them pack and unpack their trunks down stairs right under my eyes and then I know they aren t being tempted to dishonesty by any slackness on MY part
512_124520_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 How much do the maids get here Carol ventured 
512_124520_000063_000000	train-clean-360	missus B J Gougerling wife of the banker stated in a shocked manner Any place from three fifty to five fifty a week 
512_124520_000063_000001	train-clean-360	I know positively that missus Clark after swearing that she wouldn t weaken and encourage them in their outrageous demands went and paid five fifty think of it practically a dollar a day for unskilled work and of course her food and room and a chance to do her own washing right in with the rest of the wash 
512_124520_000063_000002	train-clean-360	HOW MUCH DO YOU PAY missus KENNICOTT 
none	none	Yes 
512_124520_000064_000001	train-clean-360	How much do you pay insisted half a dozen 
none	none	W why I pay six a week she feebly confessed 
512_124520_000066_000000	train-clean-360	They gasped 
none	none	Juanita protested Don t you think it s hard on the rest of us when you pay so much Juanita s demand was reinforced by the universal glower 
512_124520_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Carol was angry 
none	none	I don t care 
512_124520_000067_000002	train-clean-360	A maid has one of the hardest jobs on earth 
none	none	She works from ten to eighteen hours a day She has to wash slimy dishes and dirty clothes She tends the children and runs to the door with wet chapped hands and missus Dave Dyer broke into Carol s peroration with a furious That s all very well but believe me I do those things myself when I m without a maid and that s a good share of the time for a person that isn t willing to yield and pay exorbitant wages 
512_124520_000069_000000	train-clean-360	Carol was retorting But a maid does it for strangers and all she gets out of it is the pay 
512_124520_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Their eyes were hostile 
none	none	Four of them were talking at once Vida Sherwin s dictatorial voice cut through took control of the revolution Tut tut tut tut 
512_124520_000071_000001	train-clean-360	What angry passions and what an idiotic discussion 
none	none	All of you getting too serious Stop it 
512_124520_000071_000004	train-clean-360	Carol Kennicott you re probably right but you re too much ahead of the times 
512_124520_000071_000005	train-clean-360	Juanita quit looking so belligerent 
512_124520_000071_000006	train-clean-360	What is this a card party or a hen fight Carol you stop admiring yourself as the Joan of Arc of the hired girls or I ll spank you 
none	none	You come over here and talk libraries with Ethel Villets 
512_124520_000071_000008	train-clean-360	Boooooo 
512_124520_000071_000009	train-clean-360	If there s any more pecking I ll take charge of the hen roost myself 
512_124520_000072_000000	train-clean-360	They all laughed artificially and Carol obediently talked libraries 
none	none	A small town bungalow the wives of a village doctor and a village dry goods merchant a provincial teacher a colloquial brawl over paying a servant a dollar more a week Yet this insignificance echoed cellar plots and cabinet meetings and labor conferences in Persia and Prussia Rome and Boston and the orators who deemed themselves international leaders were but the raised voices of a billion Juanitas denouncing a million Carols with a hundred thousand Vida Sherwins trying to shoo away the storm Carol felt guilty She devoted herself to admiring the spinsterish Miss Villets and immediately committed another offense against the laws of decency We haven t seen you at the library yet Miss Villets reproved I ve wanted to run in so much but I ve been getting settled and I ll probably come in so often you ll get tired of me I hear you have such a nice library There are many who like it 
512_124520_000077_000001	train-clean-360	We have two thousand more books than Wakamin 
none	none	Isn t that fine I m sure you are largely responsible 
512_124520_000078_000002	train-clean-360	I ve had some experience in saint Paul 
512_124520_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 So I have been informed 
none	none	Not that I entirely approve of library methods in these large cities So careless letting tramps and all sorts of dirty persons practically sleep in the reading rooms I know but the poor souls Well I m sure you will agree with me in one thing The chief task of a librarian is to get people to read
512_124520_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 You feel so 
none	none	My feeling missus Kennicott and I am merely quoting the librarian of a very large college is that the first duty of the CONSCIENTIOUS librarian is to preserve the books Oh Carol repented her Oh Miss Villets stiffened and attacked It may be all very well in cities where they have unlimited funds to let nasty children ruin books and just deliberately tear them up and fresh young men take more books out than they are entitled to by the regulations but I m never going to permit it in this library What if some children are destructive They learn to read Books are cheaper than minds Nothing is cheaper than the minds of some of these children that come in and bother me simply because their mothers don t keep them home where they belong Some librarians may choose to be so wishy washy and turn their libraries into nursing homes and kindergartens but as long as I m in charge the Gopher Prairie library is going to be quiet and decent and the books well kept Carol saw that the others were listening waiting for her to be objectionable She flinched before their dislike She hastened to smile in agreement with Miss Villets to glance publicly at her wrist watch to warble that it was so late have to hurry home husband such nice party maybe you were right about maids prejudiced because Bea so nice such perfectly divine angel s food missus Haydock must give me the recipe good by such happy party 
512_124520_000087_000000	train-clean-360	She walked home 
none	none	She reflected It was my fault I was touchy And I opposed them so much 
512_124520_000087_000004	train-clean-360	Only I can t 
none	none	I can t be one of them if I must damn all the maids toiling in filthy kitchens all the ragged hungry children And these women are to be my arbiters the rest of my life She ignored Bea s call from the kitchen she ran up stairs to the unfrequented guest room she wept in terror her body a pale arc as she knelt beside a cumbrous black walnut bed beside a puffy mattress covered with a red quilt in a shuttered and airless room CHAPTER VIII DON T I in looking for things to do show that I m not attentive enough to Will Am I impressed enough by his work I will be Oh I will be If I can t be one of the town if I must be an outcast When Kennicott came home she bustled Dear you must tell me a lot more about your cases I want to know I want to understand Sure You bet And he went down to fix the furnace At supper she asked For instance what did you do today Do today How do you mean Medically I want to understand Today Oh there wasn t much of anything couple chumps with bellyaches and a sprained wrist and a fool woman that thinks she wants to kill herself because her husband doesn t like her and Just routine work But the unhappy woman doesn t sound routine Her Just case of nerves You can t do much with these marriage mix ups But dear PLEASE will you tell me about the next case that you do think is interesting Sure You bet Tell you about anything that Say that s pretty good salmon Get it at Howland s II Four days after the Jolly Seventeen debacle Vida Sherwin called and casually blew Carol s world to pieces May I come in and gossip a while she said with such excess of bright innocence that Carol was uneasy Vida took off her furs with a bounce she sat down as though it were a gymnasium exercise she flung out Feel disgracefully good this weather Raymond Wutherspoon says if he had my energy he d be a grand opera singer I always think this climate is the finest in the world and my friends are the dearest people in the world and my work is the most essential thing in the world Probably I fool myself But I know one thing for certain You re the pluckiest little idiot in the world And so you are about to flay me alive Carol was cheerful about it Am I Perhaps I ve been wondering I know that the third party to a squabble is often the most to blame the one who runs between A and B having a beautiful time telling each of them what the other has said But I want you to take a big part in vitalizing Gopher Prairie and so Such a very unique opportunity and Am I silly I know what you mean I was too abrupt at the Jolly Seventeen It isn t that Matter of fact I m glad you told them some wholesome truths about servants Though perhaps you were just a bit tactless It s bigger than that I wonder if you understand that in a secluded community like this every newcomer is on test People cordial to her but watching her all the time I remember when a Latin teacher came here from Wellesley they resented her broad A Were sure it was affected Of course they have discussed you Have they talked about me much My dear I always feel as though I walked around in a cloud looking out at others but not being seen I feel so inconspicuous and so normal so normal that there s nothing about me to discuss I can t realize that mister and missus Haydock must gossip about me Carol was working up a small passion of distaste And I don t like it It makes me crawly to think of their daring to talk over all I do and say Pawing me over I resent it I hate Wait child Perhaps they resent some things in you I want you to try and be impersonal They d paw over anybody who came in new Didn t you with newcomers in College Yes Well then Will you be impersonal I m paying you the compliment of supposing that you can be I want you to be big enough to help me make this town worth while I ll be as impersonal as cold boiled potatoes Not that I shall ever be able to help you make the town worth while What do they say about me Really I want to know Of course the illiterate ones resent your references to anything farther away than Minneapolis They re so suspicious that s it suspicious And some think you dress too well Oh they do do they Shall I dress in gunny sacking to suit them Please Are you going to be a baby I ll be good sulkily You certainly will or I won t tell you one single thing You must understand this I m not asking you to change yourself Just want you to know what they think You must do that no matter how absurd their prejudices are if you re going to handle them Is it your ambition to make this a better town or isn t it I don t know whether it is or not Why why Tut tut now of course it is Why I depend on you You re a born reformer I am not not any more Of course you are Oh if I really could help So they think I m affected My lamb they do Now don t say they re nervy After all Gopher Prairie standards are as reasonable to Gopher Prairie as Lake Shore Drive standards are to Chicago And there s more Gopher Prairies than there are Chicagos Or Londons And I ll tell you the whole story They think you re showing off when you say American instead of Ammurrican They think you re too frivolous Life s so serious to them that they can t imagine any kind of laughter except Juanita s snortling Ethel Villets was sure you were patronizing her when Oh 
512_124549_000028_000001	train-clean-360	I was not 
none	none	you talked about encouraging reading and missus Elder thought you were patronizing when you said she had such a pretty little car She thinks it s an enormous car And some of the merchants say you re too flip when you talk to them in the store and Poor me when I was trying to be friendly every housewife in town is doubtful about your being so chummy with your Bea All right to be kind but they say you act as though she were your cousin Wait now There s plenty more And they think you were eccentric in furnishing this room they think the broad couch and that Japanese dingus are absurd Wait I know they re silly And I guess I ve heard a dozen criticize you because you don t go to church oftener and I can t stand it I can t bear to realize that they ve been saying all these things while I ve been going about so happily and liking them I wonder if you ought to have told me It will make me self conscious I wonder the same thing Only answer I can get is the old saw about knowledge being power And some day you ll see how absorbing it is to have power even here to control the town Oh I m a crank But I do like to see things moving It hurts It makes these people seem so beastly and treacherous when I ve been perfectly natural with them But let s have it all What did they say about my Chinese house warming party Why uh Go on Or I ll make up worse things than anything you can tell me They did enjoy it But I guess some of them felt you were showing off pretending that your husband is richer than he is I can t Their meanness of mind is beyond any horrors I could imagine They really thought that I And you want to reform people like that when dynamite is so cheap Who dared to say that The rich or the poor Fairly well assorted Can t they at least understand me well enough to see that though I might be affected and culturine at least I simply couldn t commit that other kind of vulgarity If they must know you may tell them with my compliments that Will makes about four thousand a year and the party cost half of what they probably thought it did Chinese things are not very expensive and I made my own costume Stop it Stop beating me I know all that What they meant was they felt you were starting dangerous competition by giving a party such as most people here can t afford Four thousand is a pretty big income for this town I never thought of starting competition Will you believe that it was in all love and friendliness that I tried to give them the gayest party I could It was foolish it was childish and noisy But I did mean it so well I know of course And it certainly is unfair of them to make fun of your having that Chinese food chow men was it and to laugh about your wearing those pretty trousers Carol sprang up whimpering Oh they didn t do that They didn t poke fun at my feast that I ordered so carefully for them And my little Chinese costume that I was so happy making I made it secretly to surprise them And they ve been ridiculing it all this while She was huddled on the couch Vida was stroking her hair muttering I shouldn t Shrouded in shame Carol did not know when Vida slipped away The clock s bell at half past five aroused her I must get hold of myself before Will comes I hope he never knows what a fool his wife is Frozen sneering horrible hearts Like a very small very lonely girl she trudged up stairs slow step by step her feet dragging her hand on the rail It was not her husband to whom she wanted to run for protection it was her father her smiling understanding father dead these twelve years III Kennicott was yawning stretched in the largest chair between the radiator and a small kerosene stove Cautiously Will dear I wonder if the people here don t criticize me sometimes They must I mean if they ever do you mustn t let it bother you Criticize you Lord I should say not They all keep telling me you re the swellest girl they ever saw Well I ve just fancied The merchants probably think I m too fussy about shopping I m afraid I bore mister Dashaway and mister Howland and mister Ludelmeyer I can tell you how that is I didn t want to speak of it but since you ve brought it up Chet Dashaway probably resents the fact that you got this new furniture down in the Cities instead of here I didn t want to raise any objection at the time but After all I make my money here and they naturally expect me to spend it here If mister Dashaway will kindly tell me how any civilized person can furnish a room out of the mortuary pieces that he calls She remembered She said meekly But I understand And Howland and Ludelmeyer Oh you ve probably handed em a few roasts for the bum stocks they carry when you just meant to jolly em But rats what do we care This is an independent town not like these Eastern holes where you have to watch your step all the time and live up to fool demands and social customs and a lot of old tabbies always busy criticizing Everybody s free here to do what he wants to He said it with a flourish and Carol perceived that he believed it She turned her breath of fury into a yawn By the way Carrie while we re talking of this Of course I like to keep independent and I don t believe in this business of binding yourself to trade with the man that trades with you unless you really want to but same time I d be just as glad if you dealt with Jenson or Ludelmeyer as much as you ran instead of Howland Gould who go to doctor Gould every last time and the whole tribe of em the same way I don t see why I should be paying out my good money for groceries and having them pass it on to Terry Gould I ve gone to Howland Gould because they re better and cleaner I know I don t mean cut them out entirely Course Jenson is tricky give you short weight and Ludelmeyer is a shiftless old Dutch hog But same time I mean let s keep the trade in the family whenever it is convenient see how I mean I see Well guess it s about time to turn in He yawned went out to look at the thermometer slammed the door patted her head unbuttoned his waistcoat yawned wound the clock went down to look at the furnace yawned and clumped up stairs to bed casually scratching his thick woolen undershirt Till he bawled Aren t you ever coming up to bed she sat unmoving CHAPTER IX I SHE had tripped into the meadow to teach the lambs a pretty educational dance and found that the lambs were wolves There was no way out between their pressing gray shoulders She was surrounded by fangs and sneering eyes She could not go on enduring the hidden derision She wanted to flee She wanted to hide in the generous indifference of cities She practised saying to Kennicott Think perhaps I ll run down to saint Paul for a few days But she could not trust herself to say it carelessly could not abide his certain questioning Reform the town All she wanted was to be tolerated She could not look directly at people She flushed and winced before citizens who a week ago had been amusing objects of study and in their good mornings she heard a cruel sniggering She encountered Juanita Haydock at Ole Jenson s grocery She besought Oh how do you do Heavens what beautiful celery that is Yes doesn t it look fresh Harry simply has to have his celery on Sunday drat the man Carol hastened out of the shop exulting She didn t make fun of me Did she In a week she had recovered from consciousness of insecurity of shame and whispering notoriety but she kept her habit of avoiding people She walked the streets with her head down When she spied missus McGanum or missus Dyer ahead she crossed over with an elaborate pretense of looking at a billboard Always she was acting for the benefit of every one she saw and for the benefit of the ambushed leering eyes which she did not see She perceived that Vida Sherwin had told the truth Whether she entered a store or swept the back porch or stood at the bay window in the living room the village peeped at her Once she had swung along the street triumphant in making a home Now she glanced at each house and felt when she was safely home that she had won past a thousand enemies armed with ridicule She told herself that her sensitiveness was preposterous but daily she was thrown into panic She saw curtains slide back into innocent smoothness Old women who had been entering their houses slipped out again to stare at her in the wintry quiet she could hear them tiptoeing on their porches When she had for a blessed hour forgotten the searchlight when she was scampering through a chill dusk happy in yellow windows against gray night her heart checked as she realized that a head covered with a shawl was thrust up over a snow tipped bush to watch her She admitted that she was taking herself too seriously that villagers gape at every one She became placid and thought well of her philosophy But next morning she had a shock of shame as she entered Ludelmeyer s The grocer his clerk and neurotic missus Dave Dyer had been giggling about something They halted looked embarrassed babbled about onions Carol felt guilty That evening when Kennicott took her to call on the crochety Lyman Casses their hosts seemed flustered at their arrival Kennicott jovially hooted What makes you so hang dog Lym The Casses tittered feebly Except Dave Dyer Sam Clark and Raymie Wutherspoon there were no merchants of whose welcome Carol was certain She knew that she read mockery into greetings but she could not control her suspicion could not rise from her psychic collapse She alternately raged and flinched at the superiority of the merchants They did not know that they were being rude but they meant to have it understood that they were prosperous and not scared of no doctor s wife They often said One man s as good as another and a darn sight better This motto however they did not commend to farmer customers who had had crop failures The Yankee merchants were crabbed and Ole Jenson Ludelmeyer and Gus Dahl from the Old Country wished to be taken for Yankees James Madison Howland born in New Hampshire and Ole Jenson born in Sweden both proved that they were free American citizens by grunting I don t know whether I got any or not or Well you can t expect me to get it delivered by noon It was good form for the customers to fight back Juanita Haydock cheerfully jabbered You have it there by twelve or I ll snatch that fresh delivery boy bald headed But Carol had never been able to play the game of friendly rudeness and now she was certain that she never would learn it She formed the cowardly habit of going to Axel Egge s Axel was not respectable and rude He was still a foreigner and he expected to remain one His manner was heavy and uninterrogative His establishment was more fantastic than any cross roads store No one save Axel himself could find anything A part of the assortment of children s stockings was under a blanket on a shelf a part in a tin ginger snap box the rest heaped like a nest of black cotton snakes upon a flour barrel which was surrounded by brooms Norwegian Bibles dried cod for ludfisk boxes of apricots and a pair and a half of lumbermen s rubber footed boots The place was crowded with Scandinavian farmwives standing aloof in shawls and ancient fawn colored leg o mutton jackets awaiting the return of their lords They spoke Norwegian or Swedish and looked at Carol uncomprehendingly They were a relief to her they were not whispering that she was a poseur But what she told herself was that Axel Egge s was so picturesque and romantic It was in the matter of clothes that she was most self conscious When she dared to go shopping in her new checked suit with the black embroidered sulphur collar she had as good as invited all of Gopher Prairie which interested itself in nothing so intimately as in new clothes and the cost thereof to investigate her It was a smart suit with lines unfamiliar to the dragging yellow and pink frocks of the town The Widow Bogart s stare from her porch indicated Well I never saw anything like that before missus McGanum stopped Carol at the notions shop to hint My that s a nice suit wasn t it terribly expensive The gang of boys in front of the drug store commented Hey Pudgie play you a game of checkers on that dress Carol could not endure it She drew her fur coat over the suit and hastily fastened the buttons while the boys snickered II No group angered her quite so much as these staring young roues She had tried to convince herself that the village with its fresh air its lakes for fishing and swimming was healthier than the artificial city But she was sickened by glimpses of the gang of boys from fourteen to twenty who loafed before Dyer s Drug Store smoking cigarettes displaying fancy shoes and purple ties and coats of diamond shaped buttons whistling the Hoochi Koochi and catcalling Oh you baby doll at every passing girl She saw them playing pool in the stinking room behind Del Snafflin s barber shop and shaking dice in The Smoke House and gathered in a snickering knot to listen to the juicy stories of Bert Tybee the bartender of the Minniemashie House She heard them smacking moist lips over every love scene at the Rosebud Movie Palace At the counter of the Greek Confectionery Parlor while they ate dreadful messes of decayed bananas acid cherries whipped cream and gelatinous ice cream they screamed to one another Hey lemme lone Quit dog gone you looka what you went and done you almost spilled my glass swater Like hell I did Hey gol darn your hide don t you go sticking your coffin nail in my i scream Oh you Batty how juh like dancing with Tillie McGuire last night Some squeezing heh kid By diligent consultation of American fiction she discovered that this was the only virile and amusing manner in which boys could function that boys who were not compounded of the gutter and the mining camp were mollycoddles and unhappy She had taken this for granted She had studied the boys pityingly but impersonally It had not occurred to her that they might touch her Now she was aware that they knew all about her that they were waiting for some affectation over which they could guffaw No schoolgirl passed their observation posts more flushingly than did missus doctor Kennicott In shame she knew that they glanced appraisingly at her snowy overshoes speculating about her legs Theirs were not young eyes there was no youth in all the town she agonized They were born old grim and old and spying and censorious She cried again that their youth was senile and cruel on the day when she overheard Cy Bogart and Earl Haydock Cyrus N Bogart son of the righteous widow who lived across the alley was at this time a boy of fourteen or fifteen Carol had already seen quite enough of Cy Bogart On her first evening in Gopher Prairie Cy had appeared at the head of a charivari banging immensely upon a discarded automobile fender His companions were yelping in imitation of coyotes Kennicott had felt rather complimented had gone out and distributed a dollar But Cy was a capitalist in charivaris He returned with an entirely new group and this time there were three automobile fenders and a carnival rattle When Kennicott again interrupted his shaving Cy piped Naw you got to give us two dollars and he got it A week later Cy rigged a tic tac to a window of the living room and the tattoo out of the darkness frightened Carol into screaming Since then in four months she had beheld Cy hanging a cat stealing melons throwing tomatoes at the Kennicott house and making ski tracks across the lawn and had heard him explaining the mysteries of generation with great audibility and dismaying knowledge He was in fact a museum specimen of what a small town a well disciplined public school a tradition of hearty humor and a pious mother could produce from the material of a courageous and ingenious mind Carol was afraid of him Far from protesting when he set his mongrel on a kitten she worked hard at not seeing him The Kennicott garage was a shed littered with paint cans tools a lawn mower and ancient wisps of hay Above it was a loft which Cy Bogart and Earl Haydock young brother of Harry used as a den for smoking hiding from whippings and planning secret societies They climbed to it by a ladder on the alley side of the shed This morning of late January two or three weeks after Vida s revelations Carol had gone into the stable garage to find a hammer Snow softened her step She heard voices in the loft above her Ah gee lez oh lez go down the lake and swipe some mushrats out of somebody s traps Cy was yawning And get our ears beat off grumbled Earl Haydock Gosh these cigarettes are dandy Member when we were just kids and used to smoke corn silk and hayseed Yup Gosh Spit Silence Say Earl ma says if you chew tobacco you get consumption Aw rats your old lady is a crank Yuh that s so Pause But she says she knows a fella that did Aw gee whiz didn t Doc Kennicott used to chew tobacco all the time before he married this here girl from the Cities He used to spit Gee Some shot He could hit a tree ten feet off This was news to the girl from the Cities Say how is she continued Earl Huh How s who You know who I mean smarty A tussle a thumping of loose boards silence weary narration from Cy missus Kennicott Oh she s all right I guess Relief to Carol below She gimme a hunk o cake one time But Ma says she s stuck up as hell Ma s always talking about her Ma says if missus Kennicott thought as much about the doc as she does about her clothes the doc wouldn t look so peaked Spit Silence Yuh Juanita s always talking about her too from Earl She says missus Kennicott thinks she knows it all Juanita says she has to laugh till she almost busts every time she sees missus Kennicott peerading along the street with that take a look I m a swell skirt way she s got But gosh I don t pay no attention to Juanita She s meaner n a crab Ma was telling somebody that she heard that missus Kennicott claimed she made forty dollars a week when she was on some job in the Cities and Ma says she knows posolutely that she never made but eighteen a week Ma says that when she s lived here a while she won t go round making a fool of herself pulling that bighead stuff on folks that know a whole lot more than she does They re all laughing up their sleeves at her Say jever notice how missus Kennicott fusses around the house Other evening when I was coming over here she d forgot to pull down the curtain and I watched her for ten minutes Jeeze you d a died laughing She was there all alone and she must a spent five minutes getting a picture straight It was funny as hell the way she d stick out her finger to straighten the picture deedle dee see my tunnin ittle finger oh my ain t I cute what a fine long tail my cat s got But say Earl she s some good looker just the same and O Ignatz the glad rags she must of bought for her wedding Jever notice these low cut dresses and these thin shimmy shirts she wears I had a good squint at em when they were out on the line with the wash And some ankles she s got heh Then Carol fled In her innocence she had not known that the whole town could discuss even her garments her body She felt that she was being dragged naked down Main Street The moment it was dusk she pulled down the window shades all the shades flush with the sill but beyond them she felt moist fleering eyes III She remembered and tried to forget and remembered more sharply the vulgar detail of her husband s having observed the ancient customs of the land by chewing tobacco She would have preferred a prettier vice gambling or a mistress For these she might have found a luxury of forgiveness She could not remember any fascinatingly wicked hero of fiction who chewed tobacco She asserted that it proved him to be a man of the bold free West She tried to align him with the hairy chested heroes of the motion pictures She curled on the couch a pallid softness in the twilight and fought herself and lost the battle Spitting did not identify him with rangers riding the buttes it merely bound him to Gopher Prairie to Nat Hicks the tailor and Bert Tybee the bartender But he gave it up for me Oh what does it matter We re all filthy in some things I think of myself as so superior but I do eat and digest I do wash my dirty paws and scratch I m not a cool slim goddess on a column There aren t any He gave it up for me He stands by me believing that every one loves me He s the Rock of Ages in a storm of meanness that s driving me mad it will drive me mad All evening she sang Scotch ballads to Kennicott and when she noticed that he was chewing an unlighted cigar she smiled maternally at his secret She could not escape asking in the exact words and mental intonations which a thousand million women dairy wenches and mischief making queens had used before her and which a million million women will know hereafter Was it all a horrible mistake my marrying him She quieted the doubt without answering it IV Kennicott had taken her north to Lac qui Meurt in the Big Woods It was the entrance to a Chippewa Indian reservation a sandy settlement among Norway pines on the shore of a huge snow glaring lake She had her first sight of his mother except the glimpse at the wedding missus Kennicott had a hushed and delicate breeding which dignified her woodeny over scrubbed cottage with its worn hard cushions in heavy rockers She had never lost the child s miraculous power of wonder She asked questions about books and cities She murmured Will is a dear hard working boy but he s inclined to be too serious and you ve taught him how to play Last night I heard you both laughing about the old Indian basket seller and I just lay in bed and enjoyed your happiness Carol forgot her misery hunting in this solidarity of family life She could depend upon them she was not battling alone Watching missus Kennicott flit about the kitchen she was better able to translate Kennicott himself He was matter of fact yes and incurably mature He didn t really play he let Carol play with him But he had his mother s genius for trusting her disdain for prying her sure integrity From the two days at Lac qui Meurt Carol drew confidence in herself and she returned to Gopher Prairie in a throbbing calm like those golden drugged seconds when because he is for an instant free from pain a sick man revels in living A bright hard winter day the wind shrill black and silver clouds booming across the sky everything in panicky motion during the brief light They struggled against the surf of wind through deep snow Kennicott was cheerful He hailed Loren Wheeler Behave yourself while I been away The editor bellowed B gosh you stayed so long that all your patients have got well and importantly took notes for the Dauntless about their journey Jackson Elder cried Hey folks How s tricks up North missus McGanum waved to them from her porch They re glad to see us We mean something here These people are satisfied Why can t I be But can I sit back all my life and be satisfied with Hey folks They want shouts on Main Street and I want violins in a paneled room Why V Vida Sherwin ran in after school a dozen times She was tactful torrentially anecdotal She had scuttled about town and plucked compliments missus doctor Westlake had pronounced Carol a very sweet bright cultured young woman and Brad Bemis the tinsmith at Clark s Hardware Store had declared that she was easy to work for and awful easy to look at But Carol could not yet take her in She resented this outsider s knowledge of her shame Vida was not too long tolerant She hinted You re a great brooder child Buck up now The town s quit criticizing you almost entirely Come with me to the Thanatopsis Club They have some of the BEST papers and current events discussions SO interesting In Vida s demands Carol felt a compulsion but she was too listless to obey It was Bea Sorenson who was really her confidante However charitable toward the Lower Classes she may have thought herself Carol had been reared to assume that servants belong to a distinct and inferior species But she discovered that Bea was extraordinarily like girls she had loved in college and as a companion altogether superior to the young matrons of the Jolly Seventeen Daily they became more frankly two girls playing at housework Bea artlessly considered Carol the most beautiful and accomplished lady in the country she was always shrieking My dot s a swell hat or Ay t ink all dese ladies yoost die when dey see how elegant you do your hair But it was not the humbleness of a servant nor the hypocrisy of a slave it was the admiration of Freshman for Junior They made out the day s menus together Though they began with propriety Carol sitting by the kitchen table and Bea at the sink or blacking the stove the conference was likely to end with both of them by the table while Bea gurgled over the ice man s attempt to kiss her or Carol admitted Everybody knows that the doctor is lots more clever than doctor McGanum When Carol came in from marketing Bea plunged into the hall to take off her coat rub her frostied hands and ask Vos dere lots of folks up town today This was the welcome upon which Carol depended VI Through her weeks of cowering there was no change in her surface life No one save Vida was aware of her agonizing On her most despairing days she chatted to women on the street in stores But without the protection of Kennicott s presence she did not go to the Jolly Seventeen she delivered herself to the judgment of the town only when she went shopping and on the ritualistic occasions of formal afternoon calls when missus Lyman Cass or missus George Edwin Mott with clean gloves and minute handkerchiefs and sealskin card cases and countenances of frozen approbation sat on the edges of chairs and inquired Do you find Gopher Prairie pleasing When they spent evenings of social profit and loss at the Haydocks or the Dyers she hid behind Kennicott playing the simple bride Now she was unprotected Kennicott had taken a patient to Rochester for an operation He would be away for two or three days She had not minded she would loosen the matrimonial tension and be a fanciful girl for a time But now that he was gone the house was listeningly empty Bea was out this afternoon presumably drinking coffee and talking about fellows with her cousin Tina It was the day for the monthly supper and evening bridge of the Jolly Seventeen but Carol dared not go She sat alone CHAPTER X THE house was haunted long before evening Shadows slipped down the walls and waited behind every chair Did that door move No She wouldn t go to the Jolly Seventeen She hadn t energy enough to caper before them to smile blandly at Juanita s rudeness Not today But she did want a party Now If some one would come in this afternoon some one who liked her Vida or missus Sam Clark or old missus Champ Perry or gentle missus doctor Westlake Or Guy Pollock She d telephone No That wouldn t be it They must come of themselves Perhaps they would Why not She d have tea ready anyway If they came splendid If not what did she care She wasn t going to yield to the village and let down she was going to keep up a belief in the rite of tea to which she had always looked forward as the symbol of a leisurely fine existence And it would be just as much fun even if it was so babyish to have tea by herself and pretend that she was entertaining clever men It would She turned the shining thought into action She bustled to the kitchen stoked the wood range sang Schumann while she boiled the kettle warmed up raisin

none	none	on a newspaper spread on the rack in the oven She scampered up stairs to bring down her filmiest tea cloth She arranged a silver tray She proudly carried it into the living room and set it on the long cherrywood table pushing aside a hoop of embroidery a volume of Conrad from the library copies of the Saturday Evening Post the Literary Digest and Kennicott s National Geographic Magazine She moved the tray back and forth and regarded the effect She shook her head She busily unfolded the sewing table set it in the bay window patted the tea cloth to smoothness moved the tray Some time I ll have a mahogany tea table she said happily She had brought in two cups two plates For herself a straight chair but for the guest the big wing chair which she pantingly tugged to the table She had finished all the preparations she could think of She sat and waited She listened for the door bell the telephone Her eagerness was stilled Her hands drooped Surely Vida Sherwin would hear the summons She glanced through the bay window Snow was sifting over the ridge of the Howland house like sprays of water from a hose The wide yards across the street were gray with moving eddies The black trees shivered The roadway was gashed with ruts of ice She looked at the extra cup and plate She looked at the wing chair It was so empty The tea was cold in the pot With wearily dipping fingertip she tested it Yes Quite cold She couldn t wait any longer The cup across from her was icily clean glisteningly empty Simply absurd to wait She poured her own cup of tea She sat and stared at it What was it she was going to do now Oh yes how idiotic take a lump of sugar She didn t want the beastly tea She was springing up She was on the couch sobbing II She was thinking more sharply than she had for weeks She reverted to her resolution to change the town awaken it prod it reform it What if they were wolves instead of lambs They d eat her all the sooner if she was meek to them Fight or be eaten It was easier to change the town completely than to conciliate it She could not take their point of view it was a negative thing an intellectual squalor a swamp of prejudices and fears She would have to make them take hers She was not a Vincent de Paul to govern and mold a people What of that The tiniest change in their distrust of beauty would be the beginning of the end a seed to sprout and some day with thickening roots to crack their wall of mediocrity If she could not as she desired do a great thing nobly and with laughter yet she need not be content with village nothingness She would plant one seed in the blank wall Was she just Was it merely a blank wall this town which to three thousand and more people was the center of the universe Hadn t she returning from Lac qui Meurt felt the heartiness of their greetings No The ten thousand Gopher Prairies had no monopoly of greetings and friendly hands Sam Clark was no more loyal than girl librarians she knew in saint Paul the people she had met in Chicago And those others had so much that Gopher Prairie complacently lacked the world of gaiety and adventure of music and the integrity of bronze of remembered mists from tropic isles and Paris nights and the walls of Bagdad of industrial justice and a God who spake not in doggerel hymns One seed Which seed it was did not matter All knowledge and freedom were one But she had delayed so long in finding that seed Could she do something with this Thanatopsis Club Or should she make her house so charming that it would be an influence She d make Kennicott like poetry That was it for a beginning She conceived so clear a picture of their bending over large fair pages by the fire in a non existent fireplace that the spectral presences slipped away Doors no longer moved curtains were not creeping shadows but lovely dark masses in the dusk and when Bea came home Carol was singing at the piano which she had not touched for many days Their supper was the feast of two girls Carol was in the dining room in a frock of black satin edged with gold and Bea in blue gingham and an apron dined in the kitchen but the door was open between and Carol was inquiring Did you see any ducks in Dahl s window and Bea chanting No ma am Say ve have a svell time dis afternoon Tina she have coffee and knackebrod and her fella vos dere and ve yoost laughed and laughed and her fella say he vos president and he going to make me queen of Finland and Ay stick a fedder in may hair and say Ay bane going to go to var oh ve vos so foolish and ve LAUGH so When Carol sat at the piano again she did not think of her husband but of the book drugged hermit Guy Pollock She wished that Pollock would come calling If a girl really kissed him he d creep out of his den and be human If Will were as literate as Guy or Guy were as executive as Will I think I could endure even Gopher Prairie It s so hard to mother Will I could be maternal with Guy Is that what I want something to mother a man or a baby or a town I WILL have a baby Some day But to have him isolated here all his receptive years And so to bed Have I found my real level in Bea and kitchen gossip Oh I do miss you Will But it will be pleasant to turn over in bed as often as I want to without worrying about waking you up Am I really this settled thing called a married woman I feel so unmarried tonight So free To think that there was once a missus Kennicott who let herself worry over a town called Gopher Prairie when there was a whole world outside it Of course Will is going to like poetry III A black February day Clouds hewn of ponderous timber weighing down on the earth an irresolute dropping of snow specks upon the trampled wastes Gloom but no veiling of angularity The lines of roofs and sidewalks sharp and inescapable The second day of Kennicott s absence She fled from the creepy house for a walk It was thirty below zero too cold to exhilarate her In the spaces between houses the wind caught her It stung it gnawed at nose and ears and aching cheeks and she hastened from shelter to shelter catching her breath in the lee of a barn grateful for the protection of a billboard covered with ragged posters showing layer under layer of paste smeared green and streaky red The grove of oaks at the end of the street suggested Indians hunting snow shoes and she struggled past the earth banked cottages to the open country to a farm and a low hill corrugated with hard snow In her loose nutria coat seal toque virginal cheeks unmarked by lines of village jealousies she was as out of place on this dreary hillside as a scarlet tanager on an ice floe She looked down on Gopher Prairie The snow stretching without break from streets to devouring prairie beyond wiped out the town s pretense of being a shelter The houses were black specks on a white sheet Her heart shivered with that still loneliness as her body shivered with the wind She ran back into the huddle of streets all the while protesting that she wanted a city s yellow glare of shop windows and restaurants or the primitive forest with hooded furs and a rifle or a barnyard warm and steamy noisy with hens and cattle certainly not these dun houses these yards choked with winter ash piles these roads of dirty snow and clotted frozen mud The zest of winter was gone Three months more till May the cold might drag on with the snow ever filthier the weakened body less resistent She wondered why the good citizens insisted on adding the chill of prejudice why they did not make the houses of their spirits more warm and frivolous like the wise chatterers of Stockholm and Moscow She circled the outskirts of the town and viewed the slum of Swede Hollow Wherever as many as three houses are gathered there will be a slum of at least one house In Gopher Prairie the Sam Clarks boasted you don t get any of this poverty that you find in cities always plenty of work no need of charity man got to be blame shiftless if he don t get ahead But now that the summer mask of leaves and grass was gone Carol discovered misery and dead hope In a shack of thin boards covered with tar paper she saw the washerwoman missus Steinhof working in gray steam Outside her six year old boy chopped wood He had a torn jacket muffler of a blue like skimmed milk His hands were covered with red mittens through which protruded his chapped raw knuckles He halted to blow on them to cry disinterestedly A family of recently arrived Finns were camped in an abandoned stable A man of eighty was picking up lumps of coal along the railroad She did not know what to do about it She felt that these independent citizens who had been taught that they belonged to a democracy would resent her trying to play Lady Bountiful She lost her loneliness in the activity of the village industries the railroad yards with a freight train switching the wheat elevator oil tanks a slaughter house with blood marks on the snow the creamery with the sleds of farmers and piles of milk cans an unexplained stone hut labeled Danger Powder Stored Here The jolly tombstone yard where a utilitarian sculptor in a red calfskin overcoat whistled as he hammered the shiniest of granite headstones Jackson Elder s small planing mill with the smell of fresh pine shavings and the burr of circular saws Most important the Gopher Prairie Flour and Milling Company Lyman Cass president Its windows were blanketed with flour dust but it was the most stirring spot in town Workmen were wheeling barrels of flour into a box car a farmer sitting on sacks of wheat in a bobsled argued with the wheat buyer machinery within the mill boomed and whined water gurgled in the ice freed mill race The clatter was a relief to Carol after months of smug houses She wished that she could work in the mill that she did not belong to the caste of professional man s wife She started for home through the small slum Before a tar paper shack at a gateless gate a man in rough brown dogskin coat and black plush cap with lappets was watching her His square face was confident his foxy mustache was picaresque He stood erect his hands in his side pockets his pipe puffing slowly He was forty five or six perhaps How do missus Kennicott he drawled She recalled him the town handyman who had repaired their furnace at the beginning of winter Oh how do you do she fluttered My name s Bjornstam The Red Swede they call me Remember Always thought I d kind of like to say howdy to you again Ye yes I ve been exploring the outskirts of town Yump Fine mess No sewage no street cleaning and the Lutheran minister and the priest represent the arts and sciences Well thunder we submerged tenth down here in Swede Hollow are no worse off than you folks Thank God we don t have to go and purr at Juanity Haydock at the Jolly Old Seventeen The Carol who regarded herself as completely adaptable was uncomfortable at being chosen as comrade by a pipe reeking odd job man Probably he was one of her husband s patients But she must keep her dignity Yes even the Jolly Seventeen isn t always so exciting It s very cold again today isn t it Well Bjornstam was not respectfully valedictory He showed no signs of pulling a forelock His eyebrows moved as though they had a life of their own With a subgrin he went on Maybe I hadn t ought to talk about missus Haydock and her Solemcholy Seventeen in that fresh way I suppose I d be tickled to death if I was invited to sit in with that gang I m what they call a pariah I guess I m the town badman missus Kennicott town atheist and I suppose I must be an anarchist too Everybody who doesn t love the bankers and the Grand Old Republican Party is an anarchist Carol had unconsciously slipped from her attitude of departure into an attitude of listening her face full toward him her muff lowered She fumbled Yes I suppose so Her own grudges came in a flood I don t see why you shouldn t criticize the Jolly Seventeen if you want to They aren t sacred Oh yes they are The dollar sign has chased the crucifix clean off the map But then I ve got no kick I do what I please and I suppose I ought to let them do the same What do you mean by saying you re a pariah I m poor and yet I don t decently envy the rich I m an old bach I make enough money for a stake and then I sit around by myself and shake hands with myself and have a smoke and read history and I don t contribute to the wealth of Brother Elder or Daddy Cass You I fancy you read a good deal Yep In a hit or a miss way I ll tell you I m a lone wolf I trade horses and saw wood and work in lumber camps I m a first rate swamper Always wished I could go to college Though I s pose I d find it pretty slow and they d probably kick me out You really are a curious person mister Bjornstam Miles Bjornstam Half Yank and half Swede Usually known as that damn lazy big mouthed calamity howler that ain t satisfied with the way we run things No I ain t curious whatever you mean by that I m just a bookworm Probably too much reading for the amount of digestion I ve got Probably half baked I m going to get in half baked first and beat you to it because it s dead sure to be handed to a radical that wears jeans They grinned together She demanded You say that the Jolly Seventeen is stupid What makes you think so Oh trust us borers into the foundation to know about your leisure class Fact missus Kennicott I ll say that far as I can make out the only people in this man s town that do have any brains I don t mean ledger keeping brains or duck hunting brains or baby spanking brains but real imaginative brains are you and me and Guy Pollock and the foreman at the flour mill He s a socialist the foreman Don t tell Lym Cass that Lym would fire a socialist quicker than he would a horse thief Indeed no I sha n t tell him This foreman and I have some great set to s He s a regular old line party member Too dogmatic Expects to reform everything from deforestration to nosebleed by saying phrases like surplus value Like reading the prayer book But same time he s a Plato J Aristotle compared with people like Ezry Stowbody or Professor Mott or Julius Flickerbaugh It s interesting to hear about him He dug his toe into a drift like a schoolboy Rats You mean I talk too much Well I do when I get hold of somebody like you You probably want to run along and keep your nose from freezing Yes I must go I suppose But tell me Why did you leave Miss Sherwin of the high school out of your list of the town intelligentsia I guess maybe she does belong in it From all I can hear she s in everything and behind everything that looks like a reform lot more than most folks realize She lets missus Reverend Warren the president of this here Thanatopsis Club think she s running the works but Miss Sherwin is the secret boss and nags all the easy going dames into doing something But way I figure it out You see I m not interested in these dinky reforms Miss Sherwin s trying to repair the holes in this barnacle covered ship of a town by keeping busy bailing out the water And Pollock tries to repair it by reading poetry to the crew Me I want to yank it up on the ways and fire the poor bum of a shoemaker that built it so it sails crooked and have it rebuilt right from the keel up Yes that that would be better But I must run home My poor nose is nearly frozen Say you better come in and get warm and see what an old bach s shack is like She looked doubtfully at him at the low shanty the yard that was littered with cord wood moldy planks a hoopless wash tub She was disquieted but Bjornstam did not give her the opportunity to be delicate He flung out his hand in a welcoming gesture which assumed that she was her own counselor that she was not a Respectable Married Woman but fully a human being With a shaky Well just a moment to warm my nose she glanced down the street to make sure that she was not spied on and bolted toward the shanty She remained for one hour and never had she known a more considerate host than the Red Swede He had but one room bare pine floor small work bench wall bunk with amazingly neat bed frying pan and ash stippled coffee pot on the shelf behind the pot bellied cannon ball stove backwoods chairs one constructed from half a barrel one from a tilted plank and a row of books incredibly assorted Byron and Tennyson and Stevenson a manual of gas engines a book by Thorstein Veblen and a spotty treatise on The Care Feeding Diseases and Breeding of Poultry and Cattle There was but one picture a magazine color plate of a steep roofed village in the Harz Mountains which suggested kobolds and maidens with golden hair Bjornstam did not fuss over her He suggested Might throw open your coat and put your feet up on the box in front of the stove He tossed his dogskin coat into the bunk lowered himself into the barrel chair and droned on Yeh I m probably a yahoo but by gum I do keep my independence by doing odd jobs and that s more n these polite cusses like the clerks in the banks do When I m rude to some slob it may be partly because I don t know better and God knows I m not no authority on trick forks and what pants you wear with a Prince Albert but mostly it s because I mean something I m about the only man in Johnson County that remembers the joker in the Declaration of Independence about Americans being supposed to have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness I meet old Ezra Stowbody on the street He looks at me like he wants me to remember he s a highmuckamuck and worth two hundred thousand dollars and he says Uh Bjornquist Bjornstam s my name Ezra I says HE knows my name all rightee Well whatever your name is he says I understand you have a gasoline saw I want you to come around and saw up four cords of maple for me he says So you like my looks eh I says kind of innocent What difference does that make Want you to saw that wood before Saturday he says real sharp Common workman going and getting fresh with a fifth of a million dollars all walking around in a hand me down fur coat Here s the difference it makes I says just to devil him How do you know I like YOUR looks Maybe he didn t look sore Nope I says thinking it all over I don t like your application for a loan Take it to another bank only there ain t any I says and I walks off on him Sure Probably I was surly and foolish But I figured there had to be ONE man in town independent enough to sass the banker He hitched out of his chair made coffee gave Carol a cup and talked on half defiant and half apologetic half wistful for friendliness and half amused by her surprise at the discovery that there was a proletarian philosophy At the door she hinted mister Bjornstam if you were I would you worry when people thought you were affected Huh Kick em in the face Say if I were a sea gull and all over silver think I d care what a pack of dirty seals thought about my flying It was not the wind at her back it was the thrust of Bjornstam s scorn which carried her through town She faced Juanita Haydock cocked her head at Maud Dyer s brief nod and came home to Bea radiant She telephoned Vida Sherwin to run over this evening She lustily played Tschaikowsky the virile chords an echo of the red laughing philosopher of the tar paper shack When she hinted to Vida Isn t there a man here who amuses himself by being irreverent to the village gods Bjornstam some such a name the reform leader said Bjornstam Oh yes Fixes things He s awfully impertinent IV Kennicott had returned at midnight At breakfast he said four several times that he had missed her every moment On her way to market Sam Clark hailed her The top o the mornin to yez Going to stop and pass the time of day mit Sam l Warmer eh What d the doc s thermometer say it was Say you folks better come round and visit with us one of these evenings Don t be so dog gone proud staying by yourselves Champ Perry the pioneer wheat buyer at the elevator stopped her in the post office held her hand in his withered paws peered at her with faded eyes and chuckled You are so fresh and blooming my dear Mother was saying t other day that a sight of you was better n a dose of medicine In the Bon Ton Store she found Guy Pollock tentatively buying a modest gray scarf We haven t seen you for so long she said Wouldn t you like to come in and play cribbage some evening As though he meant it Pollock begged May I really While she was purchasing two yards of malines the vocal Raymie Wutherspoon tiptoed up to her his long sallow face bobbing and he besought You ve just got to come back to my department and see a pair of patent leather slippers I set aside for you In a manner of more than sacerdotal reverence he unlaced her boots tucked her skirt about her ankles slid on the slippers She took them You re a good salesman she said I m not a salesman at all I just like elegant things All this is so inartistic He indicated with a forlornly waving hand the shelves of shoe boxes the seat of thin wood perforated in rosettes the display of shoe trees and tin boxes of blacking the lithograph of a smirking young woman with cherry cheeks who proclaimed in the exalted poetry of advertising My tootsies never got hep to what pedal perfection was till I got a pair of clever classy Cleopatra Shoes But sometimes Raymie sighed there is a pair of dainty little shoes like these and I set them aside for some one who will appreciate When I saw these I said right away Wouldn t it be nice if they fitted missus Kennicott and I meant to speak to you first chance I had I haven t forgotten our jolly talks at missus Gurrey s That evening Guy Pollock came in and though Kennicott instantly impressed him into a cribbage game Carol was happy again V She did not in recovering something of her buoyancy forget her determination to begin the liberalizing of Gopher Prairie by the easy and agreeable propaganda of teaching Kennicott to enjoy reading poetry in the lamplight The campaign was delayed Twice he suggested that they call on neighbors once he was in the country The fourth evening he yawned pleasantly stretched and inquired Well what ll we do tonight Shall we go to the movies I know exactly what we re going to do Now don t ask questions Come and sit down by the table There are you comfy Lean back and forget you re a practical man and listen to me It may be that she had been influenced by the managerial Vida Sherwin certainly she sounded as though she was selling culture But she dropped it when she sat on the couch her chin in her hands a volume of Yeats on her knees and read aloud Instantly she was released from the homely comfort of a prairie town She was in the world of lonely things the flutter of twilight linnets the aching call of gulls along a shore to which the netted foam crept out of darkness the island of Aengus and the elder gods and the eternal glories that never were tall kings and women girdled with crusted gold the woful incessant chanting and the Heh cha cha coughed doctor Kennicott She stopped She remembered that he was the sort of person who chewed tobacco She glared while he uneasily petitioned That s great stuff Study it in college I like poetry fine James Whitcomb Riley and some of Longfellow this Hiawatha Gosh I wish I could appreciate that highbrow art stuff But I guess I m too old a dog to learn new tricks With pity for his bewilderment and a certain desire to giggle she consoled him Then let s try some Tennyson You ve read him Tennyson You bet Read him in school There s that And let there be no what is it of farewell When I put out to sea But let the Well I don t remember all of it but Oh sure And there s that I met a little country boy who I don t remember exactly how it goes but the chorus ends up We are seven Yes Well Shall we try The Idylls of the King They re so full of color Go to it Shoot But he hastened to shelter himself behind a cigar She was not transported to Camelot She read with an eye cocked on him and when she saw how much he was suffering she ran to him kissed his forehead cried You poor forced tube rose that wants to be a decent turnip Look here now that ain t Anyway I sha n t torture you any longer She could not quite give up She read Kipling with a great deal of emphasis There s a REGIMENT a COMING down the GRAND Trunk ROAD He tapped his foot to the rhythm he looked normal and reassured But when he complimented her That was fine I don t know but what you can elocute just as good as Ella Stowbody she banged the book and suggested that they were not too late for the nine o clock show at the movies That was her last effort to harvest the April wind to teach divine unhappiness by a correspondence course to buy the lilies of Avalon and the sunsets of Cockaigne in tin cans at Ole Jenson s Grocery But the fact is that at the motion pictures she discovered herself laughing as heartily as Kennicott at the humor of an actor who stuffed spaghetti down a woman s evening frock For a second she loathed her laughter mourned for the day when on her hill by the Mississippi she had walked the battlements with queens But the celebrated cinema jester s conceit of dropping toads into a soup plate flung her into unwilling tittering and the afterglow faded the dead queens fled through darkness VI She went to the Jolly Seventeen s afternoon bridge She had learned the elements of the game from the Sam Clarks She played quietly and reasonably badly She had no opinions on anything more polemic than woolen union suits a topic on which missus Howland discoursed for five minutes She smiled frequently and was the complete canary bird in her manner of thanking the hostess missus Dave Dyer Her only anxious period was during the conference on husbands The young matrons discussed the intimacies of domesticity with a frankness and a minuteness which dismayed Carol Juanita Haydock communicated Harry s method of shaving and his interest in deer shooting missus Gougerling reported fully and with some irritation her husband s inappreciation of liver and bacon Maud Dyer chronicled Dave s digestive disorders quoted a recent bedtime controversy with him in regard to Christian Science socks and the sewing of buttons upon vests announced that she simply wasn t going to stand his always pawing girls when he went and got crazy jealous if a man just danced with her and rather more than sketched Dave s varieties of kisses So meekly did Carol give attention so obviously was she at last desirous of being one of them that they looked on her fondly and encouraged her to give such details of her honeymoon as might be of interest She was embarrassed rather than resentful She deliberately misunderstood She talked of Kennicott s overshoes and medical ideals till they were thoroughly bored They regarded her as agreeable but green Till the end she labored to satisfy the inquisition She bubbled at Juanita the president of the club that she wanted to entertain them Only she said I don t know that I can give you any refreshments as nice as missus Dyer s salad or that simply delicious angel s food we had at your house dear Fine We need a hostess for the seventeenth of March Wouldn t it be awfully original if you made it a saint Patrick s Day bridge I ll be tickled to death to help you with it I m glad you ve learned to play bridge At first I didn t hardly know if you were going to like Gopher Prairie Isn t it dandy that you ve settled down to being homey with us Maybe we aren t as highbrow as the Cities but we do have the daisiest times and oh we go swimming in summer and dances and oh lots of good times If folks will just take us as we are I think we re a pretty good bunch I m sure of it Thank you so much for the idea about having a saint Patrick s Day bridge Oh that s nothing I always think the Jolly Seventeen are so good at original ideas If you knew these other towns Wakamin and Joralemon and all you d find out and realize that G P is the liveliest smartest town in the state Did you know that Percy Bresnahan the famous auto manufacturer came from here and Yes I think that a saint Patrick s Day party would be awfully cunning and original and yet not too queer or freaky or anything CHAPTER XI I SHE had often been invited to the weekly meetings of the Thanatopsis the women s study club but she had put it off The Thanatopsis was Vida Sherwin promised such a cozy group and yet it puts you in touch with all the intellectual thoughts that are going on everywhere Early in March missus Westlake wife of the veteran physician marched into Carol s living room like an amiable old pussy and suggested My dear you really must come to the Thanatopsis this afternoon missus Dawson is going to be leader and the poor soul is frightened to death She wanted me to get you to come She says she s sure you will brighten up the meeting with your knowledge of books and writings English poetry is our topic today So shoo Put on your coat English poetry Really I d love to go I didn t realize you were reading poetry Oh we re not so slow missus Luke Dawson wife of the richest man in town gaped at them piteously when they appeared Her expensive frock of beaver colored satin with rows plasters and pendants of solemn brown beads was intended for a woman twice her size She stood wringing her hands in front of nineteen folding chairs in her front parlor with its faded photograph of Minnehaha Falls in eighteen ninety its colored enlargement of mister Dawson its bulbous lamp painted with sepia cows and mountains and standing on a mortuary marble column She creaked O missus Kennicott I m in such a fix I m supposed to lead the discussion and I wondered would you come and help What poet do you take up today demanded Carol in her library tone of What book do you wish to take out Why the English ones Not all of them W why yes We re learning all of European Literature this year The club gets such a nice magazine Culture Hints and we follow its programs Last year our subject was Men and Women of the Bible and next year we ll probably take up Furnishings and China My it does make a body hustle to keep up with all these new culture subjects but it is improving So will you help us with the discussion today On her way over Carol had decided to use the Thanatopsis as the tool with which to liberalize the town She had immediately conceived enormous enthusiasm she had chanted These are the real people When the housewives who bear the burdens are interested in poetry it means something I ll work with them for them anything Her enthusiasm had become watery even before thirteen women resolutely removed their overshoes sat down meatily ate peppermints dusted their fingers folded their hands composed their lower thoughts and invited the naked muse of poetry to deliver her most improving message They had greeted Carol affectionately and she tried to be a daughter to them But she felt insecure Her chair was out in the open exposed to their gaze and it was a hard slatted quivery slippery church parlor chair likely to collapse publicly and without warning It was impossible to sit on it without folding the hands and listening piously She wanted to kick the chair and run It would make a magnificent clatter She saw that Vida Sherwin was watching her She pinched her wrist as though she were a noisy child in church and when she was decent and cramped again she listened missus Dawson opened the meeting by sighing I m sure I m glad to see you all here today and I understand that the ladies have prepared a number of very interesting papers this is such an interesting subject the poets they have been an inspiration for higher thought in fact wasn t it Reverend Benlick who said that some of the poets have been as much an inspiration as a good many of the ministers and so we shall be glad to hear The poor lady smiled neuralgically panted with fright scrabbled about the small oak table to find her eye glasses and continued We will first have the pleasure of hearing missus Jenson on the subject Shakespeare and Milton missus Ole Jenson said that Shakespeare was born in fifteen sixty four and died sixteen sixteen He lived in London England and in Stratford on Avon which many American tourists loved to visit a lovely town with many curios and old houses well worth examination Many people believed that Shakespeare was the greatest play wright who ever lived also a fine poet Not much was known about his life but after all that did not really make so much difference because they loved to read his numerous plays several of the best known of which she would now criticize Perhaps the best known of his plays was The Merchant of Venice having a beautiful love story and a fine appreciation of a woman s brains which a woman s club even those who did not care to commit themselves on the question of suffrage ought to appreciate Laughter missus Jenson was sure that she for one would love to be like Portia The play was about a Jew named Shylock and he didn t want his daughter to marry a Venice gentleman named Antonio missus Leonard Warren a slender gray nervous woman president of the Thanatopsis and wife of the Congregational pastor reported the birth and death dates of Byron Scott Moore Burns and wound up Burns was quite a poor boy and he did not enjoy the advantages we enjoy today except for the advantages of the fine old Scotch kirk where he heard the Word of God preached more fearlessly than even in the finest big brick churches in the big and so called advanced cities of today but he did not have our educational advantages and Latin and the other treasures of the mind so richly strewn before the alas too ofttimes inattentive feet of our youth who do not always sufficiently appreciate the privileges freely granted to every American boy rich or poor Burns had to work hard and was sometimes led by evil companionship into low habits But it is morally instructive to know that he was a good student and educated himself in striking contrast to the loose ways and so called aristocratic society life of Lord Byron on which I have just spoken And certainly though the lords and earls of his day may have looked down upon Burns as a humble person many of us have greatly enjoyed his pieces about the mouse and other rustic subjects with their message of humble beauty I am so sorry I have not got the time to quote some of them missus George Edwin Mott gave ten minutes to Tennyson and Browning missus Nat Hicks a wry faced curiously sweet woman so awed by her betters that Carol wanted to kiss her completed the day s grim task by a paper on Other Poets The other poets worthy of consideration were Coleridge Wordsworth Shelley Gray missus Hemans and Kipling Miss Ella Stowbody obliged with a recital of The Recessional and extracts from Lalla Rookh By request she gave An Old Sweetheart of Mine as encore Gopher Prairie had finished the poets It was ready for the next week s labor English Fiction and Essays missus Dawson besought Now we will have a discussion of the papers and I am sure we shall all enjoy hearing from one who we hope to have as a new member missus Kennicott who with her splendid literary training and all should be able to give us many pointers and many helpful pointers Carol had warned herself not to be so beastly supercilious She had insisted that in the belated quest of these work stained women was an aspiration which ought to stir her tears But they re so self satisfied They think they re doing Burns a favor They don t believe they have a belated quest They re sure that they have culture salted and hung up It was out of this stupor of doubt that missus Dawson s summons roused her She was in a panic How could she speak without hurting them missus Champ Perry leaned over to stroke her hand and whisper You look tired dearie Don t you talk unless you want to Affection flooded Carol she was on her feet searching for words and courtesies The only thing in the way of suggestion I know you are following a definite program but I do wish that now you ve had such a splendid introduction instead of going on with some other subject next year you could return and take up the poets more in detail Especially actual quotations even though their lives are so interesting and as missus Warren said so morally instructive And perhaps there are several poets not mentioned today whom it might be worth while considering Keats for instance and Matthew Arnold and Rossetti and Swinburne Swinburne would be such a well that is such a contrast to life as we all enjoy it in our beautiful Middle west She saw that missus Leonard Warren was not with her She captured her by innocently continuing Unless perhaps Swinburne tends to be uh more outspoken than you than we really like What do you think missus Warren The pastor s wife decided Why you ve caught my very thoughts missus Kennicott Of course I have never READ Swinburne but years ago when he was in vogue I remember mister Warren saying that Swinburne or was it Oscar Wilde but anyway he said that though many so called intellectual people posed and pretended to find beauty in Swinburne there can never be genuine beauty without the message from the heart But at the same time I do think you have an excellent idea and though we have talked about Furnishings and China as the probable subject for next year I believe that it would be nice if the program committee would try to work in another day entirely devoted to English poetry In fact Madame Chairman I so move you When missus Dawson s coffee and angel s food had helped them to recover from the depression caused by thoughts of Shakespeare s death they all told Carol that it was a pleasure to have her with them The membership committee retired to the sitting room for three minutes and elected her a member And she stopped being patronizing She wanted to be one of them They were so loyal and kind It was they who would carry out her aspiration Her campaign against village sloth was actually begun On what specific reform should she first loose her army During the gossip after the meeting missus George Edwin Mott remarked that the city hall seemed inadequate for the splendid modern Gopher Prairie missus Nat Hicks timidly wished that the young people could have free dances there the lodge dances were so exclusive The city hall That was it Carol hurried home She had not realized that Gopher Prairie was a city From Kennicott she discovered that it was legally organized with a mayor and city council and wards She was delighted by the simplicity of voting one s self a metropolis Why not She was a proud and patriotic citizen all evening II She examined the city hall next morning She had remembered it only as a bleak inconspicuousness She found it a liver colored frame coop half a block from Main Street The front was an unrelieved wall of clapboards and dirty windows It had an unobstructed view of a vacant lot and Nat Hicks s tailor shop It was larger than the carpenter shop beside it but not so well built No one was about She walked into the corridor On one side was the municipal court like a country school on the other the room of the volunteer fire company with a Ford hose cart and the ornamental helmets used in parades at the end of the hall a filthy two cell jail now empty but smelling of ammonia and ancient sweat The whole second story was a large unfinished room littered with piles of folding chairs a lime crusted mortar mixing box and the skeletons of Fourth of July floats covered with decomposing plaster shields and faded red white and blue bunting At the end was an abortive stage The room was large enough for the community dances which missus Nat Hicks advocated But Carol was after something bigger than dances In the afternoon she scampered to the public library The library was open three afternoons and four evenings a week It was housed in an old dwelling sufficient but unattractive Carol caught herself picturing pleasanter reading rooms chairs for children an art collection a librarian young enough to experiment She berated herself Stop this fever of reforming everything I WILL be satisfied with the library The city hall is enough for a beginning And it s really an excellent library It s it isn t so bad Is it possible that I am to find dishonesties and stupidity in every human activity I encounter In schools and business and government and everything Is there never any contentment never any rest She shook her head as though she were shaking off water and hastened into the library a young light amiable presence modest in unbuttoned fur coat blue suit fresh organdy collar and tan boots roughened from scuffling snow Miss Villets stared at her and Carol purred I was so sorry not to see you at the Thanatopsis yesterday Vida said you might come Oh You went to the Thanatopsis Did you enjoy it So much Such good papers on the poets Carol lied resolutely But I did think they should have had you give one of the papers on poetry Well Of course I m not one of the bunch that seem to have the time to take and run the club and if they prefer to have papers on literature by other ladies who have no literary training after all why should I complain What am I but a city employee You re not You re the one person that does that does oh you do so much Tell me is there uh Who are the people who control the club Miss Villets emphatically stamped a date in the front of Frank on the Lower Mississippi for a small flaxen boy glowered at him as though she were stamping a warning on his brain and sighed I wouldn t put myself forward or criticize any one for the world and Vida is one of my best friends and such a splendid teacher and there is no one in town more advanced and interested in all movements but I must say that no matter who the president or the committees are Vida Sherwin seems to be behind them all the time and though she is always telling me about what she is pleased to call my fine work in the library I notice that I m not often called on for papers though missus Lyman Cass once volunteered and told me that she thought my paper on The Cathedrals of England was the most interesting paper we had the year we took up English and French travel and architecture But And of course missus Mott and missus Warren are very important in the club as you might expect of the wives of the superintendent of schools and the Congregational pastor and indeed they are both very cultured but No you may regard me as entirely unimportant I m sure what I say doesn t matter a bit You re much too modest and I m going to tell Vida so and uh I wonder if you can give me just a teeny bit of your time and show me where the magazine files are kept She had won She was profusely escorted to a room like a grandmother s attic where she discovered periodicals devoted to house decoration and town planning with a six year file of the National Geographic Miss Villets blessedly left her alone Humming fluttering pages with delighted fingers Carol sat cross legged on the floor the magazines in heaps about her She found pictures of New England streets the dignity of Falmouth the charm of Concord Stockbridge and Farmington and Hillhouse Avenue The fairy book suburb of Forest Hills on Long Island Devonshire cottages and Essex manors and a Yorkshire High Street and Port Sunlight The Arab village of Djeddah an intricately chased jewel box A town in California which had changed itself from the barren brick fronts and slatternly frame sheds of a Main Street to a way which led the eye down a vista of arcades and gardens Assured that she was not quite mad in her belief that a small American town might be lovely as well as useful in buying wheat and selling plows she sat brooding her thin fingers playing a tattoo on her cheeks She saw in Gopher Prairie a Georgian city hall warm brick walls with white shutters a fanlight a wide hall and curving stair She saw it the common home and inspiration not only of the town but of the country about It should contain the court room she couldn t get herself to put in a jail public library a collection of excellent prints rest room and model kitchen for farmwives theater lecture room free community ballroom farm bureau gymnasium Forming about it and influenced by it as mediaeval villages gathered about the castle she saw a new Georgian town as graceful and beloved as Annapolis or that bowery Alexandria to which Washington rode All this the Thanatopsis Club was to accomplish with no difficulty whatever since its several husbands were the controllers of business and politics She was proud of herself for this practical view She had taken only half an hour to change a wire fenced potato plot into a walled rose garden She hurried out to apprize missus Leonard Warren as president of the Thanatopsis of the miracle which had been worked III At a quarter to three Carol had left home at half past four she had created the Georgian town at a quarter to five she was in the dignified poverty of the Congregational parsonage her enthusiasm pattering upon missus Leonard Warren like summer rain upon an old gray roof at two minutes to five a town of demure courtyards and welcoming dormer windows had been erected and at two minutes past five the entire town was as flat as Babylon Erect in a black William and Mary chair against gray and speckly brown volumes of sermons and Biblical commentaries and Palestine geographies upon long pine shelves her neat black shoes firm on a rag rug herself as correct and low toned as her background missus Warren listened without comment till Carol was quite through then answered delicately Yes I think you draw a very nice picture of what might easily come to pass some day I have no doubt that such villages will be found on the prairie some day But if I might make just the least little criticism it seems to me that you are wrong in supposing either that the city hall would be the proper start or that the Thanatopsis would be the right instrument After all it s the churches isn t it that are the real heart of the community As you may possibly know my husband is prominent in Congregational circles all through the state for his advocacy of church union He hopes to see all the evangelical denominations joined in one strong body opposing Catholicism and Christian Science and properly guiding all movements that make for morality and prohibition Here the combined churches could afford a splendid club house maybe a stucco and half timber building with gargoyles and all sorts of pleasing decorations on it which it seems to me would be lots better to impress the ordinary class of people than just a plain old fashioned colonial house such as you describe And that would be the proper center for all educational and pleasurable activities instead of letting them fall into the hands of the politicians I don t suppose it will take more than thirty or forty years for the churches to get together Carol said innocently Hardly that long even things are moving so rapidly So it would be a mistake to make any other plans Carol did not recover her zeal till two days after when she tried missus George Edwin Mott wife of the superintendent of schools missus Mott commented Personally I am terribly busy with dressmaking and having the seamstress in the house and all but it would be splendid to have the other members of the Thanatopsis take up the question Except for one thing First and foremost we must have a new schoolbuilding mister Mott says they are terribly cramped Carol went to view the old building The grades and the high school were combined in a damp yellow brick structure with the narrow windows of an antiquated jail a hulk which expressed hatred and compulsory training She conceded missus Mott s demand so violently that for two days she dropped her own campaign Then she built the school and city hall together as the center of the reborn town She ventured to the lead colored dwelling of missus Dave Dyer Behind the mask of winter stripped vines and a wide porch only a foot above the ground the cottage was so impersonal that Carol could never visualize it Nor could she remember anything that was inside it But missus Dyer was personal enough With Carol missus Howland missus McGanum and Vida Sherwin she was a link between the Jolly Seventeen and the serious Thanatopsis in contrast to Juanita Haydock who unnecessarily boasted of being a lowbrow and publicly stated that she would see herself in jail before she d write any darned old club papers missus Dyer was superfeminine in the kimono in which she received Carol Her skin was fine pale soft suggesting a weak voluptuousness At afternoon coffees she had been rude but now she addressed Carol as dear and insisted on being called Maud Carol did not quite know why she was uncomfortable in this talcum powder atmosphere but she hastened to get into the fresh air of her plans Maud Dyer granted that the city hall wasn t so very nice yet as Dave said there was no use doing anything about it till they received an appropriation from the state and combined a new city hall with a national guard armory Dave had given verdict What these mouthy youngsters that hang around the pool room need is universal military training Make men of em missus Dyer removed the new schoolbuilding from the city hall Oh so missus Mott has got you going on her school craze She s been dinging at that till everybody s sick and tired What she really wants is a big office for her dear bald headed Gawge to sit around and look important in Of course I admire missus Mott and I m very fond of her she s so brainy even if she does try to butt in and run the Thanatopsis but I must say we re sick of her nagging The old building was good enough for us when we were kids I hate these would be women politicians don t you IV The first week of March had given promise of spring and stirred Carol with a thousand desires for lakes and fields and roads The snow was gone except for filthy woolly patches under trees the thermometer leaped in a day from wind bitten chill to itchy warmth As soon as Carol was convinced that even in this imprisoned North spring could exist again the snow came down as abruptly as a paper storm in a theater the northwest gale flung it up in a half blizzard and with her hope of a glorified town went hope of summer meadows But a week later though the snow was everywhere in slushy heaps the promise was unmistakable By the invisible hints in air and sky and earth which had aroused her every year through ten thousand generations she knew that spring was coming It was not a scorching hard dusty day like the treacherous intruder of a week before but soaked with languor softened with a milky light Rivulets were hurrying in each alley a calling robin appeared by magic on the crab apple tree in the Howlands yard Everybody chuckled Looks like winter is going and This ll bring the frost out of the roads have the autos out pretty soon now wonder what kind of bass fishing we ll get this summer ought to be good crops this year Each evening Kennicott repeated We better not take off our Heavy Underwear or the storm windows too soon might be nother spell of cold got to be careful bout catching cold wonder if the coal will last through The expanding forces of life within her choked the desire for reforming She trotted through the house planning the spring cleaning with Bea When she attended her second meeting of the Thanatopsis she said nothing about remaking the town She listened respectably to statistics on Dickens Thackeray Jane Austen George Eliot Scott Hardy Lamb De Quincey and missus Humphry Ward who it seemed constituted the writers of English Fiction and Essays Not till she inspected the rest room did she again become a fanatic She had often glanced at the store building which had been turned into a refuge in which farmwives could wait while their husbands transacted business She had heard Vida Sherwin and missus Warren caress the virtue of the Thanatopsis in establishing the rest room and in sharing with the city council the expense of maintaining it But she had never entered it till this March day She went in impulsively nodded at the matron a plump worthy widow named Nodelquist and at a couple of farm women who were meekly rocking The rest room resembled a second hand store It was furnished with discarded patent rockers lopsided reed chairs a scratched pine table a gritty straw mat old steel engravings of milkmaids being morally amorous under willow trees faded chromos of roses and fish and a kerosene stove for warming lunches The front window was darkened by torn net curtains and by a mound of geraniums and rubber plants While she was listening to missus Nodelquist s account of how many thousands of farmers wives used the rest room every year and how much they appreciated the kindness of the ladies in providing them with this lovely place and all free she thought Kindness nothing The kind ladies husbands get the farmers trade This is mere commercial accommodation And it s horrible It ought to be the most charming room in town to comfort women sick of prairie kitchens Certainly it ought to have a clear window so that they can see the metropolitan life go by Some day I m going to make a better rest room a club room Why I ve already planned that as part of my Georgian town hall So it chanced that she was plotting against the peace of the Thanatopsis at her third meeting which covered Scandinavian Russian and Polish Literature with remarks by missus Leonard Warren on the sinful paganism of the Russian so called church Even before the entrance of the coffee and hot rolls Carol seized on missus Champ Perry the kind and ample bosomed pioneer woman who gave historic dignity to the modern matrons of the Thanatopsis She poured out her plans missus Perry nodded and stroked Carol s hand but at the end she sighed I wish I could agree with you dearie I m sure you re one of the Lord s anointed even if we don t see you at the Baptist Church as often as we d like to But I m afraid you re too tender hearted When Champ and 
639_124526_000032_000001	train-clean-360	I came here 
none	none	we teamed it with an ox cart from Sauk Centre to Gopher Prairie and there was nothing here then but a stockade and a few soldiers and some log cabins When we wanted salt pork and gunpowder we sent out a man on horseback and probably he was shot dead by the Injuns before he got back We ladies of course we were all farmers at first we didn t expect any rest room in those days My we d have thought the one they have now was simply elegant My house was roofed with hay and it leaked something terrible when it rained only dry place was under a shelf And when the town grew up we thought the new city hall was real fine And I don t see any need for dance halls Dancing isn t what it was anyway We used to dance modest and we had just as much fun as all these young folks do now with their terrible Turkey Trots and hugging and all But if they must neglect the Lord s injunction that young girls ought to be modest then I guess they manage pretty well at the K P Hall and the Oddfellows even if some of tie lodges don t always welcome a lot of these foreigners and hired help to all their dances And I certainly don t see any need of a farm bureau or this domestic science demonstration you talk about In my day the boys learned to farm by honest sweating and every gal could cook or her ma learned her how across her knee Besides ain t there a county agent at Wakamin He comes here once a fortnight maybe That s enough monkeying with this scientific farming Champ says there s nothing to it anyway And as for a lecture hall haven t we got the churches Good deal better to listen to a good old fashioned sermon than a lot of geography and books and things that nobody needs to know more n enough heathen learning right here in the Thanatopsis And as for trying to make a whole town in this Colonial architecture you talk about I do love nice things to this day I run ribbons into my petticoats even if Champ Perry does laugh at me the old villain But just the same I don t believe any of us old timers would like to see the town that we worked so hard to build being tore down to make a place that wouldn t look like nothing but some Dutch story book and not a bit like the place we loved And don t you think it s sweet now All the trees and lawns And such comfy houses and hot water heat and electric lights and telephones and cement walks and everything Why I thought everybody from the Twin Cities always said it was such a beautiful town Carol forswore herself declared that Gopher Prairie had the color of Algiers and the gaiety of Mardi Gras Yet the next afternoon she was pouncing on missus Lyman Cass the hook nosed consort of the owner of the flour mill missus Cass s parlor belonged to the crammed Victorian school as missus Luke Dawson s belonged to the bare Victorian It was furnished on two principles First everything must resemble something else A rocker had a back like a lyre a near leather seat imitating tufted cloth and arms like Scotch Presbyterian lions with knobs scrolls shields and spear points on unexpected portions of the chair The second principle of the crammed Victorian school was that every inch of the interior must be filled with useless objects The walls of missus Cass s parlor were plastered with hand painted pictures buckeye pictures of birch trees news boys puppies and church steeples on Christmas Eve with a plaque depicting the Exposition Building in Minneapolis burnt wood portraits of Indian chiefs of no tribe in particular a pansy decked poetic motto a Yard of Roses and the banners of the educational institutions attended by the Casses two sons Chicopee Falls Business College and McGillicuddy University One small square table contained a card receiver of painted china with a rim of wrought and gilded lead a Family Bible Grant s Memoirs the latest novel by missus Gene Stratton Porter a wooden model of a Swiss chalet which was also a bank for dimes a polished abalone shell holding one black headed pin and one empty spool a velvet pin cushion in a gilded metal slipper with Souvenir of Troy N Y stamped on the toe and an unexplained red glass dish which had warts missus Cass s first remark was I must show you all my pretty things and art objects She piped after Carol s appeal I see You think the New England villages and Colonial houses are so much more cunning than these Middlewestern towns I m glad you feel that way You ll be interested to know I was born in Vermont And don t you think we ought to try to make Gopher Prai My gracious no We can t afford it Taxes are much too high as it is We ought to retrench and not let the city council spend another cent Uh Don t you think that was a grand paper missus Westlake read about Tolstoy I was so glad she pointed out how all his silly socialistic ideas failed What missus Cass said was what Kennicott said that evening Not in twenty years would the council propose or Gopher Prairie vote the funds for a new city hall V Carol had avoided exposing her plans to Vida Sherwin She was shy of the big sister manner Vida would either laugh at her or snatch the idea and change it to suit herself But there was no other hope When Vida came in to tea Carol sketched her Utopia Vida was soothing but decisive My dear you re all off I would like to see it a real gardeny place to shut out the gales But it can t be done What could the clubwomen accomplish Their husbands are the most important men in town They ARE the town But the town as a separate unit is not the husband of the Thanatopsis If you knew the trouble we had in getting the city council to spend the money and cover the pumping station with vines Whatever you may think of Gopher Prairie women they re twice as progressive as the men But can t the men see the ugliness They don t think it s ugly And how can you prove it Matter of taste Why should they like what a Boston architect likes What they like is to sell prunes Well why not Anyway the point is that you have to work from the inside with what we have rather than from the outside with foreign ideas The shell ought not to be forced on the spirit It can t be The bright shell has to grow out of the spirit and express it That means waiting If we keep after the city council for another ten years they MAY vote the bonds for a new school I refuse to believe that if they saw it the big men would be too tight fisted to spend a few dollars each for a building think dancing and lectures and plays all done company operatively You mention the word company operative to the merchants and they ll lynch you The one thing they fear more than mail order houses is that farmers company operative movements may get started The secret trails that lead to scared pocket books Always in everything And I don t have any of the fine melodrama of fiction the dictagraphs and speeches by torchlight I m merely blocked by stupidity Oh I know I m a fool I dream of Venice and I live in Archangel and scold because the Northern seas aren t tender colored But at least they sha n t keep me from loving Venice and sometime I ll run away All right No more She flung out her hands in a gesture of renunciation VI Early May wheat springing up in blades like grass corn and potatoes being planted the land humming For two days there had been steady rain Even in town the roads were a furrowed welter of mud hideous to view and difficult to cross Main Street was a black swamp from curb to curb on residence streets the grass parking beside the walks oozed gray water It was prickly hot yet the town was barren under the bleak sky Softened neither by snow nor by waving boughs the houses squatted and scowled revealed in their unkempt harshness As she dragged homeward Carol looked with distaste at her clay loaded rubbers the smeared hem of her skirt She passed Lyman Cass s pinnacled dark red hulking house She waded a streaky yellow pool This morass was not her home she insisted Her home and her beautiful town existed in her mind They had already been created The task was done What she really had been questing was some one to share them with her Vida would not Kennicott could not Some one to share her refuge Suddenly she was thinking of Guy Pollock She dismissed him He was too cautious She needed a spirit as young and unreasonable as her own And she would never find it Youth would never come singing She was beaten Yet that same evening she had an idea which solved the rebuilding of Gopher Prairie Within ten minutes she was jerking the old fashioned bell pull of Luke Dawson missus Dawson opened the door and peered doubtfully about the edge of it Carol kissed her cheek and frisked into the lugubrious sitting room Well well you re a sight for sore eyes chuckled mister Dawson dropping his newspaper pushing his spectacles back on his forehead You seem so excited sighed missus Dawson I am mister Dawson aren t you a millionaire He cocked his head and purred Well I guess if I cashed in on all my securities and farm holdings and my interests in iron on the Mesaba and in Northern timber and cut over lands I could push two million dollars pretty close and I ve made every cent of it by hard work and having the sense to not go out and spend every I think I want most of it from you The Dawsons glanced at each other in appreciation of the jest and he chirped You re worse than Reverend Benlick He don t hardly ever strike me for more than ten dollars at a time I m not joking I mean it Your children in the Cities are grown up and well to do You don t want to die and leave your name unknown Why not do a big original thing Why not rebuild the whole town Get a great architect and have him plan a town that would be suitable to the prairie Perhaps he d create some entirely new form of architecture Then tear down all these shambling buildings mister Dawson had decided that she really did mean it He wailed Why that would cost at least three or four million dollars But you alone just one man have two of those millions Me Spend all my hard earned cash on building houses for a lot of shiftless beggars that never had the sense to save their money Not that I ve ever been mean Mama could always have a hired girl to do the work when we could find one But her and I have worked our fingers to the bone and spend it on a lot of these rascals Please Don t be angry I just mean I mean Oh not spend all of it of course but if you led off the list and the others came in and if they heard you talk about a more attractive town Why now child you ve got a lot of notions Besides what s the matter with the town Looks good to me I ve had people that have traveled all over the world tell me time and again that Gopher Prairie is the prettiest place in the Middlewest Good enough for anybody Certainly good enough for Mama and me Besides Mama and me are planning to go out to Pasadena and buy a bungalow and live there VII She had met Miles Bjornstam on the street For the second of welcome encounter this workman with the bandit mustache and the muddy overalls seemed nearer than any one else to the credulous youth which she was seeking to fight beside her and she told him as a cheerful anecdote a little of her story 
512_124549_000021_000000	train-clean-360	He grunted 
none	none	I never thought I d be agreeing with Old Man Dawson the penny pinching old land thief and a fine briber he is too But you got the wrong slant You aren t one of the people yet You want to do something for the town I don t I want the town to do something for itself We don t want old Dawson s money not if it s a gift with a string We ll take it away from him because it belongs to us You got to get more iron and cussedness into you Come join us cheerful bums and some day when we educate ourselves and quit being bums we ll take things and run em straight He had changed from her friend to a cynical man in overalls She could not relish the autocracy of cheerful bums She forgot him as she tramped the outskirts of town She had replaced the city hall project by an entirely new and highly exhilarating thought of how little was done for these unpicturesque poor VIII The spring of the plains is not a reluctant virgin but brazen and soon away The mud roads of a few days ago are powdery dust and the puddles beside them have hardened into lozenges of black sleek earth like cracked patent leather Carol was panting as she crept to the meeting of the Thanatopsis program committee which was to decide the subject for next fall and winter Madam Chairman Miss Ella Stowbody in an oyster colored blouse asked if there was any new business Carol rose She suggested that the Thanatopsis ought to help the poor of the town She was ever so correct and modern She did not she said want charity for them but a chance of self help an employment bureau direction in washing babies and making pleasing stews possibly a municipal fund for home building What do you think of my plans missus Warren she concluded Speaking judiciously as one related to the church by marriage missus Warren gave verdict I m sure we re all heartily in accord with missus Kennicott in feeling that wherever genuine poverty is encountered it is not only noblesse oblige but a joy to fulfil our duty to the less fortunate ones But I must say it seems to me we should lose the whole point of the thing by not regarding it as charity Why that s the chief adornment of the true Christian and the church The Bible has laid it down for our guidance Faith Hope and CHARITY it says and The poor ye have with ye always which indicates that there never can be anything to these so called scientific schemes for abolishing charity never And isn t it better so I should hate to think of a world in which we were deprived of all the pleasure of giving Besides if these shiftless folks realize they re getting charity and not something to which they have a right they re so much more grateful Besides snorted Miss Ella Stowbody they ve been fooling you missus Kennicott There isn t any real poverty here Take that missus Steinhof you speak of I send her our washing whenever there s too much for our hired girl I must have sent her ten dollars worth the past year alone I m sure Papa would never approve of a city home building fund Papa says these folks are fakers Especially all these tenant farmers that pretend they have so much trouble getting seed and machinery Papa says they simply won t pay their debts He says he s sure he hates to foreclose mortgages but it s the only way to make them respect the law And then think of all the clothes we give these people said missus Jackson Elder Carol intruded again Oh yes The clothes I was going to speak of that Don t you think that when we give clothes to the poor if we do give them old ones we ought to mend them first and make them as presentable as we can Next Christmas when the Thanatopsis makes its distribution wouldn t it be jolly if we got together and sewed on the clothes and trimmed hats and made them Heavens and earth they have more time than we have They ought to be mighty good and grateful to get anything no matter what shape it s in I know I m not going to sit and sew for that lazy missus Vopni with all I ve got to do snapped Ella Stowbody They were glaring at Carol She reflected that missus Vopni whose husband had been killed by a train had ten children But missus Mary Ellen Wilks was smiling missus Wilks was the proprietor of Ye Art Shoppe and Magazine and Book Store and the reader of the small Christian Science church She made it all clear If this class of people had an understanding of Science and that we are the children of God and nothing can harm us they wouldn t be in error and poverty missus Jackson Elder confirmed Besides it strikes me the club is already doing enough with tree planting and the anti fly campaign and the responsibility for the rest room to say nothing of the fact that we ve talked of trying to get the railroad to put in a park at the station I think so too said Madam Chairman She glanced uneasily at Miss Sherwin But what do you think Vida Vida smiled tactfully at each of the committee and announced Well I don t believe we d better start anything more right now But it s been a privilege to hear Carol s dear generous ideas hasn t it Oh There is one thing we must decide on at once We must get together and oppose any move on the part of the Minneapolis clubs to elect another State Federation president from the Twin Cities And this missus Edgar Potbury they re putting forward I know there are people who think she s a bright interesting speaker but I regard her as very shallow What do you say to my writing to the Lake Ojibawasha Club telling them that if their district will support missus Warren for second vice president we ll support their missus Hagelton and such a dear lovely cultivated woman too for president Yes We ought to show up those Minneapolis folks Ella Stowbody said acidly And oh by the way we must oppose this movement of missus Potbury s to have the state clubs come out definitely in favor of woman suffrage Women haven t any place in politics They would lose all their daintiness and charm if they became involved in these horried plots and log rolling and all this awful political stuff about scandal and personalities and so on All save one nodded They interrupted the formal business meeting to discuss missus Edgar Potbury s husband missus Potbury s income missus Potbury s sedan missus Potbury s residence missus Potbury s oratorical style missus Potbury s mandarin evening coat missus Potbury s coiffure and missus Potbury s altogether reprehensible influence on the State Federation of Women s Clubs Before the program committee adjourned they took three minutes to decide which of the subjects suggested by the magazine Culture Hints Furnishings and China or The Bible as Literature would be better for the coming year There was one annoying incident missus doctor Kennicott interfered and showed off again She commented Don t you think that we already get enough of the Bible in our churches and Sunday Schools missus Leonard Warren somewhat out of order but much more out of temper cried Well upon my word I didn t suppose there was any one who felt that we could get enough of the Bible I guess if the Grand Old Book has withstood the attacks of infidels for these two thousand years it is worth our SLIGHT consideration Oh I didn t mean Carol begged Inasmuch as she did mean it was hard to be extremely lucid But I wish instead of limiting ourselves either to the Bible or to anecdotes about the Brothers Adam s wigs which Culture Hints seems to regard as the significant point about furniture we could study some of the really stirring ideas that are springing up today whether it s chemistry or anthropology or labor problems the things that are going to mean so terribly much Everybody cleared her polite throat Madam Chairman inquired Is there any other discussion Will some one make a motion to adopt the suggestion of Vida Sherwin to take up Furnishings and China It was adopted unanimously Checkmate murmured Carol as she held up her hand Had she actually believed that she could plant a seed of liberalism in the blank wall of mediocrity How had she fallen into the folly of trying to plant anything whatever in a wall so smooth and sun glazed and so satisfying to the happy sleepers within CHAPTER XII ONE week of authentic spring one rare sweet week of May one tranquil moment between the blast of winter and the charge of summer Daily Carol walked from town into flashing country hysteric with new life One enchanted hour when she returned to youth and a belief in the possibility of beauty She had walked northward toward the upper shore of Plover Lake taking to the railroad track whose directness and dryness make it the natural highway for pedestrians on the plains She stepped from tie to tie in long strides At each road crossing she had to crawl over a cattle guard of sharpened timbers She walked the rails balancing with arms extended cautious heel before toe As she lost balance her body bent over her arms revolved wildly and when she toppled she laughed aloud The thick grass beside the track coarse and prickly with many burnings hid canary yellow buttercups and the mauve petals and woolly sage green coats of the pasque flowers The branches of the kinnikinic brush were red and smooth as lacquer on a saki bowl She ran down the gravelly embankment smiled at children gathering flowers in a little basket thrust a handful of the soft pasque flowers into the bosom of her white blouse Fields of springing wheat drew her from the straight propriety of the railroad and she crawled through the rusty barbed wire fence She followed a furrow between low wheat blades and a field of rye which showed silver lights as it flowed before the wind She found a pasture by the lake So sprinkled was the pasture with rag baby blossoms and the cottony herb of Indian tobacco that it spread out like a rare old Persian carpet of cream and rose and delicate green Under her feet the rough grass made a pleasant crunching Sweet winds blew from the sunny lake beside her and small waves sputtered on the meadowy shore She leaped a tiny creek bowered in pussy willow buds She was nearing a frivolous grove of birch and poplar and wild plum trees The poplar foliage had the downiness of a Corot arbor the green and silver trunks were as candid as the birches as slender and lustrous as the limbs of a Pierrot The cloudy white blossoms of the plum trees filled the grove with a springtime mistiness which gave an illusion of distance She ran into the wood crying out for joy of freedom regained after winter Choke cherry blossoms lured her from the outer sun warmed spaces to depths of green stillness where a submarine light came through the young leaves She walked pensively along an abandoned road She found a moccasin flower beside a lichen covered log At the end of the road she saw the open acres dipping rolling fields bright with wheat I believe The woodland gods still live And out there the great land It s beautiful as the mountains What do I care for Thanatopsises She came out on the prairie spacious under an arch of boldly cut clouds Small pools glittered Above a marsh red winged blackbirds chased a crow in a swift melodrama of the air On a hill was silhouetted a man following a drag His horse bent its neck and plodded content A path took her to the Corinth road leading back to town Dandelions glowed in patches amidst the wild grass by the way A stream golloped through a concrete culvert beneath the road She trudged in healthy weariness A man in a bumping Ford rattled up beside her hailed Give you a lift missus Kennicott Thank you It s awfully good of you but I m enjoying the walk Great day by golly I seen some wheat that must of been five inches high Well so long She hadn t the dimmest notion who he was but his greeting warmed her This countryman gave her a companionship which she had never whether by her fault or theirs or neither been able to find in the matrons and commercial lords of the town Half a mile from town in a hollow between hazelnut bushes and a brook she discovered a gipsy encampment a covered wagon a tent a bunch of pegged out horses A broad shouldered man was squatted on his heels holding a frying pan over a camp fire He looked toward her He was Miles Bjornstam Well well what you doing out here he roared Come have a hunk o bacon Pete Hey Pete A tousled person came from behind the covered wagon Pete here s the one honest to God lady in my bum town Come on crawl in and set a couple minutes missus Kennicott I m hiking off for all summer The Red Swede staggered up rubbed his cramped knees lumbered to the wire fence held the strands apart for her She unconsciously smiled at him as she went through Her skirt caught on a barb he carefully freed it Beside this man in blue flannel shirt baggy khaki trousers uneven suspenders and vile felt hat she was small and exquisite The surly Pete set out an upturned bucket for her She lounged on it her elbows on her knees Where are you going she asked Just starting off for the summer horse trading Bjornstam chuckled His red mustache caught the sun Regular hoboes and public benefactors we are Take a hike like this every once in a while Sharks on horses Buy em from farmers and sell em to others We re honest frequently Great time Camp along the road I was wishing I had a chance to say good by to you before I ducked out but Say you better come along with us
639_124526_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 I d like to 
none	none	While you re playing mumblety peg with missus Lym Cass Pete and me will be rambling across Dakota through the Bad Lands into the butte country and when fall comes we ll be crossing over a pass of the Big Horn Mountains maybe and camp in a snow storm quarter of a mile right straight up above a lake Then in the morning we ll lie snug in our blankets and look up through the pines at an eagle How d it strike you Heh Eagle soaring and soaring all day big wide sky Don t Or I will go with you and I m afraid there might be some slight scandal Perhaps some day I ll do it Good by Her hand disappeared in his blackened leather glove From the turn in the road she waved at him She walked on more soberly now and she was lonely But the wheat and grass were sleek velvet under the sunset the prairie clouds were tawny gold and she swung happily into Main Street II Through the first days of June she drove with Kennicott on his calls She identified him with the virile land she admired him as she saw with what respect the farmers obeyed him She was out in the early chill after a hasty cup of coffee reaching open country as the fresh sun came up in that unspoiled world Meadow larks called from the tops of thin split fence posts The wild roses smelled clean As they returned in late afternoon the low sun was a solemnity of radial bands like a heavenly fan of beaten gold the limitless circle of the grain was a green sea rimmed with fog and the willow wind breaks were palmy isles Before July the close heat blanketed them The tortured earth cracked Farmers panted through corn fields behind cultivators and the sweating flanks of horses While she waited for Kennicott in the car before a farmhouse the seat burned her fingers and her head ached with the glare on fenders and hood A black thunder shower was followed by a dust storm which turned the sky yellow with the hint of a coming tornado Impalpable black dust far borne from Dakota covered the inner sills of the closed windows The July heat was ever more stifling They crawled along Main Street by day they found it hard to sleep at night They brought mattresses down to the living room and thrashed and turned by the open window Ten times a night they talked of going out to soak themselves with the hose and wade through the dew but they were too listless to take the trouble On cool evenings when they tried to go walking the gnats appeared in swarms which peppered their faces and caught in their throats She wanted the Northern pines the Eastern sea but Kennicott declared that it would be kind of hard to get away just NOW The Health and Improvement Committee of the Thanatopsis asked her to take part in the anti fly campaign and she toiled about town persuading householders to use the fly traps furnished by the club or giving out money prizes to fly swatting children She was loyal enough but not ardent and without ever quite intending to she began to neglect the task as heat sucked at her strength Kennicott and she motored North and spent a week with his mother that is Carol spent it with his mother while he fished for bass The great event was their purchase of a summer cottage down on Lake Minniemashie Perhaps the most amiable feature of life in Gopher Prairie was the summer cottages They were merely two room shanties with a seepage of broken down chairs peeling veneered tables chromos pasted on wooden walls and inefficient kerosene stoves They were so thin walled and so close together that you could and did hear a baby being spanked in the fifth cottage off But they were set among elms and lindens on a bluff which looked across the lake to fields of ripened wheat sloping up to green woods Here the matrons forgot social jealousies and sat gossiping in gingham or in old bathing suits surrounded by hysterical children they paddled for hours Carol joined them she ducked shrieking small boys and helped babies construct sand basins for unfortunate minnows She liked Juanita Haydock and Maud Dyer when she helped them make picnic supper for the men who came motoring out from town each evening She was easier and more natural with them In the debate as to whether there should be veal loaf or poached egg on hash she had no chance to be heretical and oversensitive They danced sometimes in the evening they had a minstrel show with Kennicott surprisingly good as end man always they were encircled by children wise in the lore of woodchucks and gophers and rafts and willow whistles If they could have continued this normal barbaric life Carol would have been the most enthusiastic citizen of Gopher Prairie She was relieved to be assured that she did not want bookish conversation alone that she did not expect the town to become a Bohemia She was content now She did not criticize But in September when the year was at its richest custom dictated that it was time to return to town to remove the children from the waste occupation of learning the earth and send them back to lessons about the number of potatoes which in a delightful world untroubled by commission houses or shortages in freight cars William sold to John The women who had cheerfully gone bathing all summer looked doubtful when Carol begged Let s keep up an outdoor life this winter let s slide and skate Their hearts shut again till spring and the nine months of cliques and radiators and dainty refreshments began all over III Carol had started a salon Since Kennicott Vida Sherwin and Guy Pollock were her only lions and since Kennicott would have preferred Sam Clark to all the poets and radicals in the entire world her private and self defensive clique did not get beyond one evening dinner for Vida and Guy on her first wedding anniversary and that dinner did not get beyond a controversy regarding Raymie Wutherspoon s yearnings Guy Pollock was the gentlest person she had found here He spoke of her new jade and cream frock naturally not jocosely he held her chair for her as they sat down to dinner and he did not like Kennicott interrupt her to shout Oh say speaking of that I heard a good story today But Guy was incurably hermit He sat late and talked hard and did not come again Then she met Champ Perry in the post office and decided that in the history of the pioneers was the panacea for Gopher Prairie for all of America We have lost their sturdiness she told herself We must restore the last of the veterans to power and follow them on the backward path to the integrity of Lincoln to the gaiety of settlers dancing in a saw mill She read in the records of the Minnesota Territorial Pioneers that only sixty years ago not so far back as the birth of her own father four cabins had composed Gopher Prairie The log stockade which missus Champ Perry was to find when she trekked in was built afterward by the soldiers as a defense against the Sioux The four cabins were inhabited by Maine Yankees who had come up the Mississippi to saint Paul and driven north over virgin prairie into virgin woods They ground their own corn the men folks shot ducks and pigeons and prairie chickens the new breakings yielded the turnip like rutabagas which they ate raw and boiled and baked and raw again For treat they had wild plums and crab apples and tiny wild strawberries Grasshoppers came darkening the sky and in an hour ate the farmwife s garden and the farmer s coat Precious horses painfully brought from Illinois were drowned in bogs or stampeded by the fear of blizzards Snow blew through the chinks of new made cabins and Eastern children with flowery muslin dresses shivered all winter and in summer were red and black with mosquito bites Indians were everywhere they camped in dooryards stalked into kitchens to demand doughnuts came with rifles across their backs into schoolhouses and begged to see the pictures in the geographies Packs of timber wolves treed the children and the settlers found dens of rattle snakes killed fifty a hundred in a day Yet it was a buoyant life Carol read enviously in the admirable Minnesota chronicles called Old Rail Fence Corners the reminiscence of missus Mahlon Black who settled in Stillwater in eighteen forty eight There was nothing to parade over in those days We took it as it came and had happy lives We would all gather together and in about two minutes would be having a good time playing cards or dancing We used to waltz and dance contra dances None of these new jigs and not wear any clothes to speak of We covered our hides in those days no tight skirts like now You could take three or four steps inside our skirts and then not reach the edge One of the boys would fiddle a while and then some one would spell him and he could get a dance Sometimes they would dance and fiddle too She reflected that if she could not have ballrooms of gray and rose and crystal she wanted to be swinging across a puncheon floor with a dancing fiddler This smug in between town which had exchanged Money Musk for phonographs grinding out ragtime it was neither the heroic old nor the sophisticated new Couldn t she somehow some yet unimagined how turn it back to simplicity She herself knew two of the pioneers the Perrys Champ Perry was the buyer at the grain elevator He weighed wagons of wheat on a rough platform scale in the cracks of which the kernels sprouted every spring Between times he napped in the dusty peace of his office She called on the Perrys at their rooms above Howland Gould s grocery When they were already old they had lost the money which they had invested in an elevator They had given up their beloved yellow brick house and moved into these rooms over a store which were the Gopher Prairie equivalent of a flat A broad stairway led from the street to the upper hall along which were the doors of a lawyer s office a dentist s a photographer s studio the lodge rooms of the Affiliated Order of Spartans and at the back the Perrys apartment They received her their first caller in a month with aged fluttering tenderness missus Perry confided My it s a shame we got to entertain you in such a cramped place And there ain t any water except that ole iron sink outside in the hall but still as I say to Champ beggars can t be choosers Sides the brick house was too big for me to sweep and it was way out and it s nice to be living down here among folks Yes we re glad to be here But Some day maybe we can have a house of our own again We re saving up Oh dear if we could have our own home But these rooms are real nice ain t they As old people will the world over they had moved as much as possible of their familiar furniture into this small space Carol had none of the superiority she felt toward missus Lyman Cass s plutocratic parlor She was at home here She noted with tenderness all the makeshifts the darned chair arms the patent rocker covered with sleazy cretonne the pasted strips of paper mending the birch bark napkin rings labeled Papa and Mama She hinted of her new enthusiasm To find one of the young folks who took them seriously heartened the Perrys and she easily drew from them the principles by which Gopher Prairie should be born again should again become amusing to live in This was their philosophy complete in the era of aeroplanes and syndicalism The Baptist Church and somewhat less the Methodist Congregational and Presbyterian Churches is the perfect the divinely ordained standard in music oratory philanthropy and ethics We don t need all this new fangled science or this terrible Higher Criticism that s ruining our young men in colleges What we need is to get back to the true Word of God and a good sound belief in hell like we used to have it preached to us The Republican Party the Grand Old Party of Blaine and McKinley is the agent of the Lord and of the Baptist Church in temporal affairs All socialists ought to be hanged Harold Bell Wright is a lovely writer and he teaches such good morals in his novels and folks say he s made prett near a million dollars out of em People who make more than ten thousand a year or less than eight hundred are wicked Europeans are still wickeder It doesn t hurt any to drink a glass of beer on a warm day but anybody who touches wine is headed straight for hell Virgins are not so virginal as they used to be Nobody needs drug store ice cream pie is good enough for anybody The farmers want too much for their wheat The owners of the elevator company expect too much for the salaries they pay There would be no more trouble or discontent in the world if everybody worked as hard as Pa did when he cleared our first farm IV Carol s hero worship dwindled to polite nodding and the nodding dwindled to a desire to escape and she went home with a headache Next day she saw Miles Bjornstam on the street Just back from Montana Great summer Pumped my lungs chuck full of Rocky Mountain air Now for another whirl at sassing the bosses of Gopher Prairie

none	none	 SHE tried more from loyalty than from desire to call upon the Perrys on a November evening when Kennicott was away They were not at home Like a child who has no one to play with she loitered through the dark hall 
639_124526_000004_000001	train-clean-360	She saw a light under an office door

639_124526_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Most places that have lost the smell of earth but not yet acquired the smell of patchouli or of factory smoke are just as suspicious and righteous

none	none	I have the Village Virus It sounds dangerous It is More dangerous than the cancer that will certainly get me at fifty unless I stop this smoking The Village Virus is the germ which it s extraordinarily like the hook worm it infects ambitious people who stay too long in the provinces You ll find it epidemic among lawyers and doctors and ministers and college bred merchants all these people who have had a glimpse of the world that thinks and laughs but have returned to their swamp

none	none	But I sha n t pester you with my dolors You won t And do sit down so I can see you He dropped into the shrieking desk chair He looked squarely at her she was conscious of the pupils of his eyes of the fact that he was a man and lonely They were embarrassed They elaborately glanced away and were relieved as he went on The diagnosis of my Village Virus is simple enough I was born in an Ohio town about the same size as Gopher Prairie and much less friendly It d had more generations in which to form an oligarchy of respectability Here a stranger is taken in if he is correct if he likes hunting and motoring and God and our Senator There we didn t take in even our own till we had contemptuously got used to them It was a red brick Ohio town and the trees made it damp and it smelled of rotten apples The country wasn t like our lakes and prairie There were small stuffy corn fields and brick yards and greasy oil wells I went to a denominational college and learned that since dictating the Bible and hiring a perfect race of ministers to explain it God has never done much but creep around and try to catch us disobeying it 
639_124526_000031_000001	train-clean-360	From college I went to New York to the Columbia Law School 
none	none	And for four years I lived Oh I won t rhapsodize about New York It was dirty and noisy and breathless and ghastly expensive But compared with the moldy academy in which I had been smothered 
639_124526_000031_000006	train-clean-360	I went to symphonies twice a week 
none	none	I saw Irving and Terry and Duse and Bernhardt from the top gallery 
639_124526_000031_000008	train-clean-360	I walked in Gramercy Park 
639_124526_000031_000009	train-clean-360	And I read oh everything

none	none	He didn t like my way of loafing five hours and then doing my work really not so badly in one We parted When I first came here I swore I d keep up my interests Very lofty I read Browning and went to Minneapolis for the theaters 
639_124526_000033_000001	train-clean-360	I thought I was keeping up But I guess the Village Virus had me already 
none	none	I was reading four copies of cheap fiction magazines to one poem I d put off the Minneapolis trips till I simply had to go there on a lot of legal matters A few years ago I was talking to a patent lawyer from Chicago and I realized that I d always felt so superior to people like Julius Flickerbaugh but I saw that I was as provincial and behind the times as Julius Worse Julius plows through the Literary Digest and the Outlook faithfully while I m turning over pages of a book by Charles Flandrau that I already know by heart I decided to leave here Stern resolution Grasp the world Then I found that the Village Virus had me absolute I didn t want to face new streets and younger men real competition It was too easy to go on making out conveyances and arguing ditching cases So That s all of the biography of a living dead man except the diverting last chapter the lies about my having been a tower of strength and legal wisdom which some day a preacher will spin over my lean dry body He looked down at his table desk fingering the starry enameled vase She could not comment She pictured herself running across the room to pat his hair She saw that his lips were firm under his soft faded mustache She sat still and maundered I know The Village Virus Perhaps it will get me Some day I m going Oh no matter 
639_124526_000037_000006	train-clean-360	At least I am making you talk

639_124526_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Twenty six Guy 
none	none	Twenty six I was just leaving New York at twenty six I heard Patti sing at twenty six And now I m forty seven I feel like a child yet I m old enough to be your father So it s decently paternal to imagine you curled at my feet Of course I hope it isn t but we ll reflect the morals of Gopher Prairie by officially announcing that it is These standards that you and I live up to 
639_124526_000042_000008	train-clean-360	There s one thing that s the matter with Gopher Prairie at least with the ruling class there is a ruling class despite all our professions of democracy And the penalty we tribal rulers pay is that our subjects watch us every minute 
none	none	We can t get wholesomely drunk and relax We have to be so correct about sex morals and inconspicuous clothes and doing our commercial trickery only in the traditional ways that none of us can live up to it and we become horribly hypocritical Unavoidably The widow robbing deacon of fiction can t help being hypocritical 
639_124526_000042_000013	train-clean-360	The widows themselves demand it

639_124526_000042_000016	train-clean-360	Suppose I did dare to make love to some exquisite married woman I wouldn t admit it to myself 
none	none	I giggle with the most revolting salaciousness over La Vie Parisienne when I get hold of one in Chicago yet I shouldn t even try to hold your hand 
639_124526_000042_000018	train-clean-360	I m broken 
none	none	It s the historical Anglo Saxon way of making life miserable Oh my dear I haven t talked to anybody about myself and all our selves for years Guy Can t we do something with the town Really No we can t He disposed of it like a judge ruling out an improper objection returned to matters less uncomfortably energetic Curious Most troubles are unnecessary We have Nature beaten we can make her grow wheat we can keep warm when she sends blizzards So we raise the devil just for pleasure wars politics race hatreds labor disputes Here in Gopher Prairie we ve cleared the fields and become soft so we make ourselves unhappy artificially at great expense and exertion Methodists disliking Episcopalians the man with the Hudson laughing at the man with the flivver The worst is the commercial hatred the grocer feeling that any man who doesn t deal with him is robbing him What hurts me is that it applies to lawyers and doctors and decidedly to their wives as much as to grocers The doctors you know about that how your husband and Westlake and Gould dislike one another No I won t admit it He grinned
639_124526_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh maybe once or twice when Will has positively known of a case where Doctor where one of the others has continued to call on patients longer than necessary he has laughed about it but 
none	none	He still grinned No REALLY And when you say the wives of the doctors share these jealousies missus McGanum and I haven t any particular crush on each other she s so stolid 
639_124526_000049_000003	train-clean-360	But her mother missus Westlake nobody could be sweeter 
639_124526_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I m sure she s very bland 
none	none	But I wouldn t tell her my heart s secrets if I were you my dear I insist that there s only one professional man s wife in this town who doesn t plot and that is you you blessed credulous outsider
639_124526_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I won t be cajoled 
none	none	I won t believe that medicine the priesthood of healing can be turned into a penny picking business See here Hasn t Kennicott ever hinted to you that you d better be nice to some old woman because she tells her friends which doctor to call in But I oughtn t to She remembered certain remarks which Kennicott had offered regarding the Widow Bogart She flinched looked at Guy beseechingly He sprang up strode to her with a nervous step smoothed her hand She wondered if she ought to be offended by his caress Then she wondered if he liked her hat the new Oriental turban of rose and silver brocade He dropped her hand 
639_124526_000055_000001	train-clean-360	His elbow brushed her shoulder 
639_124526_000055_000002	train-clean-360	He flitted over to the desk chair his thin back stooped 
639_124526_000055_000003	train-clean-360	He picked up the cloisonne vase Across it he peered at her with such loneliness that she was startled But his eyes faded into impersonality as he talked of the jealousies of Gopher Prairie 
639_124526_000055_000004	train-clean-360	He stopped himself with a sharp Good Lord Carol you re not a jury 
none	none	You are within your legal rights in refusing to be subjected to this summing up I m a tedious old fool analyzing the obvious while you re the spirit of rebellion 
639_124526_000055_000007	train-clean-360	Tell me your side

none	none	Can I help
639_124526_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 How could you 
none	none	I don t know Perhaps by listening I haven t done that tonight But normally Can t I be the confidant of the old French plays the tiring maid with the mirror and the loyal ears Oh what is there to confide The people are savorless and proud of it And even if I liked you tremendously I couldn t talk to you without twenty old hexes watching whispering But you will come talk to me once in a while I m not sure that I shall I m trying to develop my own large capacity for dullness and contentment I ve failed at every positive thing I ve tried I d better settle down as they call it and be satisfied to be nothing Don t be cynical It hurts me in you 
639_124526_000063_000002	train-clean-360	It s like blood on the wing of a humming bird

none	none	I m a hawk a tiny leashed hawk pecked to death by these large white flabby wormy hens But I am grateful to you for confirming me in the faith And I m going home
639_124526_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Please stay and have some coffee with me 
none	none	I d like to But they ve succeeded in terrorizing me 
639_124526_000066_000002	train-clean-360	I m afraid of what people might say 
none	none	I m not afraid of that I m only afraid of what you might say He stalked to her took her unresponsive hand Carol You have been happy here tonight Yes I m begging She squeezed his hand quickly then snatched hers away She had but little of the curiosity of the flirt and none of the intrigante s joy in furtiveness If she was the naive girl Guy Pollock was the clumsy boy He raced about the office he rammed his fists into his pockets He stammered I I I Oh the devil Why do I awaken from smooth dustiness to this jagged rawness I ll make I m going to trot down the hall and bring in the Dillons and we ll all have coffee or something The Dillons Yes Really quite a decent young pair Harvey Dillon and his wife 
639_124526_000070_000002	train-clean-360	He s a dentist just come to town 
none	none	They live in a room behind his office same as I do here 
639_124526_000070_000004	train-clean-360	They don t know much of anybody 
none	none	I ve heard of them 
639_124526_000071_000001	train-clean-360	And I ve never thought to call 
none	none	I m horribly ashamed Do bring them She stopped for no very clear reason but his expression said her faltering admitted that they wished they had never mentioned the Dillons With spurious enthusiasm he said Splendid I will From the door he glanced at her curled in the peeled leather chair 
639_124526_000072_000003	train-clean-360	He slipped out came back with doctor and missus Dillon 
none	none	The four of them drank rather bad coffee which Pollock made on a kerosene burner They laughed and spoke of Minneapolis and were tremendously tactful and Carol started for home through the November wind CHAPTER XIV SHE was marching home No I couldn t fall in love with him I like him very much But he s too much of a recluse Could I kiss him No No Guy Pollock at twenty six I could have kissed him then maybe even if I were married to some one else and probably I d have been glib in persuading myself that it wasn t really wrong The amazing thing is that I m not more amazed at myself I the virtuous young matron Am I to be trusted If the Prince Charming came A Gopher Prairie housewife married a year and yearning for a Prince Charming like a bachfisch of sixteen They say that marriage is a magic change But I m not changed But No I wouldn t want to fall in love even if the Prince did come I wouldn t want to hurt Will I am fond of Will I am He doesn t stir me not any longer But I depend on him He is home and children I wonder when we will begin to have children I do want them I wonder whether I remembered to tell Bea to have hominy tomorrow instead of oatmeal She will have gone to bed by now Perhaps I ll be up early enough Ever so fond of Will I wouldn t hurt him even if I had to lose the mad love If the Prince came I d look once at him and run Darn fast Oh Carol you are not heroic nor fine You are the immutable vulgar young female But I m not the faithless wife who enjoys confiding that she s misunderstood Oh I m not I m not Am I At least I didn t whisper to Guy about Will s faults and his blindness to my remarkable soul I didn t Matter of fact Will probably understands me perfectly If only if he would just back me up in rousing the town How many how incredibly many wives there must be who tingle over the first Guy Pollock who smiles at them No I will not be one of that herd of yearners The coy virgin brides Yet probably if the Prince were young and dared to face life I m not half as well oriented as that missus Dillon So obviously adoring her dentist And seeing Guy only as an eccentric fogy They weren t silk missus Dillon s stockings They were lisle Her legs are nice and slim But no nicer than mine I hate cotton tops on silk stockings Are my ankles getting fat I will NOT have fat ankles No I am fond of Will His work one farmer he pulls through diphtheria is worth all my yammering for a castle in Spain A castle with baths This hat is so tight I must stretch it Guy liked it There s the house I m awfully chilly Time to get out the fur coat I wonder if I ll ever have a beaver coat Nutria is NOT the same thing Beaver glossy Like to run my fingers over it Guy s mustache like beaver How utterly absurd I am I AM fond of Will and Can t I ever find another word than fond He s home He ll think I was out late Why can t he ever remember to pull down the shades Cy Bogart and all the beastly boys peeping in But the poor dear he s absent minded about minute minush whatever the word is He has so much worry and work while I do nothing but jabber to Bea I MUSTN T forget the hominy She was flying into the hall Kennicott looked up from the Journal of the American Medical Society Hello What time did you get back she cried About nine You been gadding Here it is past eleven Good natured yet not quite approving Did it feel neglected Well you didn t remember to close the lower draft in the furnace Oh I m so sorry But I don t often forget things like that do I She dropped into his lap and after he had jerked back his head to save his eye glasses and removed the glasses and settled her in a position less cramping to his legs and casually cleared his throat he kissed her amiably and remarked Nope I must say you re fairly good about things like that I wasn t kicking I just meant I wouldn t want the fire to go out on us Leave that draft open and the fire might burn up and go out on us And the nights are beginning to get pretty cold again Pretty cold on my drive I put the side curtains up it was so chilly But the generator is working all right now Yes It is chilly But I feel fine after my walk Go walking I went up to see the Perrys By a definite act of will she added the truth They weren t in And I saw Guy Pollock Dropped into his office Why you haven t been sitting and chinning with him till eleven o clock Of course there were some other people there and Will What do you think of doctor Westlake Westlake Why I noticed him on the street today Was he limping If the poor fish would have his teeth X rayed I ll bet nine and a half cents he d find an abscess there Rheumatism he calls it Rheumatism hell He s behind the times Wonder he doesn t bleed himself Wellllllll A profound and serious yawn I hate to break up the party but it s getting late and a doctor never knows when he ll get routed out before morning She remembered that he had given this explanation in these words not less than thirty times in the year I guess we better be trotting up to bed I ve wound the clock and looked at the furnace Did you lock the front door when you came in They trailed up stairs after he had turned out the lights and twice tested the front door to make sure it was fast While they talked they were preparing for bed Carol still sought to maintain privacy by undressing behind the screen of the closet door Kennicott was not so reticent Tonight as every night she was irritated by having to push the old plush chair out of the way before she could open the closet door Every time she opened the door she shoved the chair Ten times an hour But Kennicott liked to have the chair in the room and there was no place for it except in front of the closet She pushed it felt angry hid her anger Kennicott was yawning more portentously The room smelled stale She shrugged and became chatty You were speaking of doctor Westlake Tell me you ve never summed him up Is he really a good doctor Oh yes he s a wise old coot There You see there is no medical rivalry Not in my house she said triumphantly to Guy Pollock She hung her silk petticoat on a closet hook and went on doctor Westlake is so gentle and scholarly Well I don t know as I d say he was such a whale of a scholar I ve always had a suspicion he did a good deal of four flushing about that He likes to have people think he keeps up his French and Greek and Lord knows what all and he s always got an old Dago book lying around the sitting room but I ve got a hunch he reads detective stories bout like the rest of us And I don t know where he d ever learn so dog gone many languages anyway He kind of lets people assume he went to Harvard or Berlin or Oxford or somewhere but I looked him up in the medical register and he graduated from a hick college in Pennsylvania way back in eighteen sixty one But this is the important thing Is he an honest doctor How do you mean honest Depends on what you mean Suppose you were sick Would you call him in Would you let me call him in Not if I were well enough to cuss and bite I wouldn t No SIR I wouldn t have the old fake in the house Makes me tired his everlasting palavering and soft soaping He s all right for an ordinary bellyache or holding some fool woman s hand but I wouldn t call him in for an honest to God illness not much I wouldn t NO sir You know I don t do much back biting but same time I ll tell you Carrrie I ve never got over being sore at Westlake for the way he treated missus Jonderquist Nothing the matter with her what she really needed was a rest but Westlake kept calling on her and calling on her for weeks almost every day and he sent her a good big fat bill too you can bet I never did forgive him for that Nice decent hard working people like the Jonderquists In her batiste nightgown she was standing at the bureau engaged in the invariable rites of wishing that she had a real dressing table with a triple mirror of bending toward the streaky glass and raising her chin to inspect a pin head mole on her throat and finally of brushing her hair In rhythm to the strokes she went on But Will there isn t any of what you might call financial rivalry between you and the partners Westlake and McGanum is there He flipped into bed with a solemn back somersault and a ludicrous kick of his heels as he tucked his legs under the blankets He snorted Lord no I never begrudge any man a nickel he can get away from me fairly But is Westlake fair Isn t he sly Sly is the word He s a fox that boy She saw Guy Pollock s grin in the mirror She flushed Kennicott with his arms behind his head was yawning Yump He s smooth too smooth But I bet I make prett near as much as Westlake and McGanum both together though I ve never wanted to grab more than my just share If anybody wants to go to the partners instead of to me that s his business Though I must say it makes me tired when Westlake gets hold of the Dawsons Here Luke Dawson had been coming to me for every toeache and headache and a lot of little things that just wasted my time and then when his grandchild was here last summer and had summer complaint I suppose or something like that probably you know the time you and I drove up to Lac qui Meurt why Westlake got hold of Ma Dawson and scared her to death and made her think the kid had appendicitis and by golly if he and McGanum didn t operate and holler their heads off about the terrible adhesions they found and what a regular Charley and Will Mayo they were for classy surgery They let on that if they d waited two hours more the kid would have developed peritonitis and God knows what all and then they collected a nice fat hundred and fifty dollars And probably they d have charged three hundred if they hadn t been afraid of me I m no hog but I certainly do hate to give old Luke ten dollars worth of advice for a dollar and a half and then see a hundred and fifty go glimmering And if I can t do a better pendectomy than either Westlake or McGanum I ll eat my hat As she crept into bed she was dazzled by Guy s blazing grin She experimented But Westlake is cleverer than his son in law don t you think Yes Westlake may be old fashioned and all that but he s got a certain amount of intuition while McGanum goes into everything bull headed and butts his way through like a damn yahoo and tries to argue his patients into having whatever he diagnoses them as having About the best thing Mac can do is to stick to baby snatching He s just about on a par with this bone pounding chiropractor female missus Mattie Gooch missus Westlake and missus McGanum though they re nice They ve been awfully cordial to me Well no reason why they shouldn t be is there Oh they re nice enough though you can bet your bottom dollar they re both plugging for their husbands all the time trying to get the business And I don t know as I call it so damn cordial in missus McGanum when I holler at her on the street and she nods back like she had a sore neck Still she s all right It s Ma Westlake that makes the mischief pussyfooting around all the time But I wouldn t trust any Westlake out of the whole lot and while missus McGanum SEEMS square enough you don t never want to forget that she s Westlake s daughter You bet What about doctor Gould Don t you think he s worse than either Westlake or McGanum He s so cheap drinking and playing pool and always smoking cigars in such a cocky way That s all right now Terry Gould is a good deal of a tin horn sport but he knows a lot about medicine and don t you forget it for one second She stared down Guy s grin and asked more cheerfully Is he honest too Ooooooooooo Gosh I m sleepy He burrowed beneath the bedclothes in a luxurious stretch and came up like a diver shaking his head as he complained How s that Who Terry Gould honest Don t start me laughing I m too nice and sleepy I didn t say he was honest I said he had savvy enough to find the index in Gray s Anatomy which is more than McGanum can do But I didn t say anything about his being honest He isn t Terry is crooked as a dog s hind leg He s done me more than one dirty trick He told missus Glorbach seventeen miles out that I wasn t up to date in obstetrics Fat lot of good it did him She came right in and told me And Terry s lazy He d let a pneumonia patient choke rather than interrupt a poker game Oh no I can t believe Well now I m telling you Does he play much poker doctor Dillon told me that doctor Gould wanted him to play Dillon told you what Where d you meet Dillon He s just come to town He and his wife were at mister Pollock s tonight Say uh what d you think of them Didn t Dillon strike you as pretty light waisted Why no He seemed intelligent I m sure he s much more wide awake than our dentist Well now the old man is a good dentist He knows his business And Dillon I wouldn t cuddle up to the Dillons too close if I were you All right for Pollock and that s none of our business but we I think I d just give the Dillons the glad hand and pass em up But why He isn t a rival That s all right Kennicott was aggressively awake now He ll work right in with Westlake and McGanum Matter of fact I suspect they were largely responsible for his locating here They ll be sending him patients and he ll send all that he can get hold of to them I don t trust anybody that s too much hand in glove with Westlake You give Dillon a shot at some fellow that s just bought a farm here and drifts into town to get his teeth looked at and after Dillon gets through with him you ll see him edging around to Westlake and McGanum every time Carol reached for her blouse which hung on a chair by the bed She draped it about her shoulders and sat up studying Kennicott her chin in her hands In the gray light from the small electric bulb down the hall she could see that he was frowning Will this is I must get this straight Some one said to me the other day that in towns like this even more than in cities all the doctors hate each other because of the money Who said that It doesn t matter I ll bet a hat it was your Vida Sherwin She s a brainy woman but she d be a damn sight brainier if she kept her mouth shut and didn t let so much of her brains ooze out that way Will O Will That s horrible Aside from the vulgarity Some ways Vida is my best friend Even if she HAD said it Which as a matter of fact she didn t He reared up his thick shoulders in absurd pink and green flannelette pajamas He sat straight and irritatingly snapped his fingers and growled Well if she didn t say it let s forget her Doesn t make any difference who said it anyway The point is that you believe it God To think you don t understand me any better than that Money This is the first real quarrel we ve ever had she was agonizing He thrust out his long arm and snatched his wrinkly vest from a chair He took out a cigar a match He tossed the vest on the floor He lighted the cigar and puffed savagely He broke up the match and snapped the fragments at the foot board She suddenly saw the foot board of the bed as the foot stone of the grave of love The room was drab colored and ill ventilated Kennicott did not believe in opening the windows so darn wide that you heat all outdoors The stale air seemed never to change In the light from the hall they were two lumps of bedclothes with shoulders and tousled heads attached She begged I didn t mean to wake you up dear And please don t smoke You ve been smoking so much Please go back to sleep I m sorry Being sorry s all right but I m going to tell you one or two things This falling for anybody s say so about medical jealousy and competition is simply part and parcel of your usual willingness to think the worst you possibly can of us poor dubs in Gopher Prairie Trouble with women like you is you always want to ARGUE Can t take things the way they are Got to argue Well I m not going to argue about this in any way shape manner or form Trouble with you is you don t make any effort to appreciate us You re so damned superior and think the city is such a hell of a lot finer place and you want us to do what YOU want all the time That s not true It s I who make the effort It s they it s you who stand back and criticize I have to come over to the town s opinion I have to devote myself to their interests They can t even SEE my interests to say nothing of adopting them I get ever so excited about their old Lake Minniemashie and the cottages but they simply guffaw in that lovely friendly way you advertise so much if I speak of wanting to see Taormina also Sure Tormina whatever that is some nice expensive millionaire colony I suppose Sure that s the idea champagne taste and beer income and make sure that we never will have more than a beer income too Are you by any chance implying that I am not economical Well I hadn t intended to but since you bring it up yourself I don t mind saying the grocery bills are about twice what they ought to be Yes they probably are I m not economical I can t be Thanks to you Where d you get that thanks to you Please don t be quite so colloquial or shall I say VULGAR I ll be as damn colloquial as I want to How do you get that thanks to you Here about a year ago you jump me for not remembering to give you money Well I m reasonable I didn t blame you and I SAID I was to blame But have I ever forgotten it since practically No You haven t practically But that isn t it I ought to have an allowance I will too I must have an agreement for a regular stated amount every month Fine idea Of course a doctor gets a regular stated amount Sure A thousand one month and lucky if he makes a hundred the next Very well then a percentage Or something else No matter how much you vary you can make a rough average for But what s the idea What are you trying to get at Mean to say I m unreasonable Think I m so unreliable and tightwad that you ve got to tie me down with a contract By God that hurts I thought I d been pretty generous and decent and I took a lot of pleasure thinks I she ll be tickled when I hand her over this twenty or fifty or whatever it was and now seems you been wanting to make it a kind of alimony Me like a poor fool thinking I was liberal all the while and you Please stop pitying yourself You re having a beautiful time feeling injured I admit all you say Certainly You ve given me money both freely and amiably Quite as if I were your mistress Carrie I mean it What was a magnificent spectacle of generosity to you was humiliation to me You GAVE me money gave it to your mistress if she was complaisant and then you Carrie Don t interrupt me then you felt you d discharged all obligation Well hereafter I ll refuse your money as a gift Either I m your partner in charge of the household department of our business with a regular budget for it or else I m nothing If I m to be a mistress I shall choose my lovers Oh I hate it I hate it this smirking and hoping for money and then not even spending it on jewels as a mistress has a right to but spending it on double boilers and socks for you Yes indeed You re generous You give me a dollar right out the only proviso is that I must spend it on a tie for you And you give it when and as you wish How can I be anything but uneconomical Oh well of course looking at it that way I can t shop around can t buy in large quantities have to stick to stores where I have a charge account good deal of the time can t plan because I don t know how much money I can depend on That s what I pay for your charming sentimentalities about giving so generously You make me Wait Wait You know you re exaggerating You never thought about that mistress stuff till just this minute Matter of fact you never have smirked and hoped for money But all the same you may be right You ought to run the household as a business I ll figure out a definite plan tomorrow and hereafter you ll be on a regular amount or percentage with your own checking account Oh that IS decent of you She turned toward him trying to be affectionate But his eyes were pink and unlovely in the flare of the match with which he lighted his dead and malodorous cigar His head drooped and a ridge of flesh scattered with pale small bristles bulged out under his chin She sat in abeyance till he croaked No Tisn t especially decent It s just fair And God knows I want to be fair But I expect others to be fair too And you re so high and mighty about people Take Sam Clark best soul that ever lived honest and loyal and a damn good fellow Yes and a good shot at ducks don t forget that Well and he is a good shot too Sam drops around in the evening to sit and visit and by golly just because he takes a dry smoke and rolls his cigar around in his mouth and maybe spits a few times you look at him as if he was a hog Oh you didn t know I was onto you and I certainly hope Sam hasn t noticed it but I never miss it I have felt that way Spitting ugh But I m sorry you caught my thoughts I tried to be nice I tried to hide them Maybe I catch a whole lot more than you think I do Yes perhaps you do And d you know why Sam doesn t light his cigar when he s here Why He s so darn afraid you ll be offended if he smokes You scare him Every time he speaks of the weather you jump him because he ain t talking about poetry or Gertie Goethe or some other highbrow junk You ve got him so leery he scarcely dares to come here Oh I AM sorry Though I m sure it s you who are exaggerating now Well now I don t know as I am And I can tell you one thing if you keep on you ll manage to drive away every friend I ve got That would be horrible of me You KNOW I don t mean to Will what is it about me that frightens Sam if I do frighten him Oh you do all right Stead of putting his legs up on another chair and unbuttoning his vest and telling a good story or maybe kidding me about something he sits on the edge of his chair and tries to make conversation about politics and he doesn t even cuss and Sam s never real comfortable unless he can cuss a little In other words he isn t comfortable unless he can behave like a peasant in a mud hut Now that ll be about enough of that You want to know how you scare him First you deliberately fire some question at him that you know darn well he can t answer any fool could see you were experimenting with him and then you shock him by talking of mistresses or something like you were doing just now Of course the pure Samuel never speaks of such erring ladies in his private conversations Not when there s ladies around You can bet your life on that So the impurity lies in failing to pretend that Now we won t go into all that eugenics or whatever damn fad you choose to call it As I say first you shock him and then you become so darn flighty that nobody can follow you Either you want to dance or you bang the piano or else you get moody as the devil and don t want to talk or anything else If you must be temperamental why can t you be that way by yourself My dear man there s nothing I d like better than to be by myself occasionally To have a room of my own I suppose you expect me to sit here and dream delicately and satisfy my temperamentality while you wander in from the bathroom with lather all over your face and shout Seen my brown pants Huh He did not sound impressed He made no answer He turned out of bed his feet making one solid thud on the floor He marched from the room a grotesque figure in baggy union pajamas She heard him drawing a drink of water at the bathroom tap She was furious at the contemptuousness of his exit She snuggled down in bed and looked away from him as he returned He ignored her As he flumped into bed he yawned and casually stated Well you ll have plenty of privacy when we build a new house When Oh I ll build it all right don t you fret But of course I don t expect any credit for it Now it was she who grunted Huh and ignored him and felt independent and masterful as she shot up out of bed turned her back on him fished a lone and petrified chocolate out of her glove box in the top right hand drawer of the bureau gnawed at it found that it had cocoanut filling said Damn wished that she had not said it so that she might be superior to his colloquialism and hurled the chocolate into the wastebasket where it made an evil and mocking clatter among the debris of torn linen collars and toothpaste box Then in great dignity and self dramatization she returned to bed All this time he had been talking on embroidering his assertion that he didn t expect any credit She was reflecting that he was a rustic that she hated him that she had been insane to marry him that she had married him only because she was tired of work that she must get her long gloves cleaned that she would never do anything more for him and that she mustn t forget his hominy for breakfast She was roused to attention by his storming I m a fool to think about a new house By the time I get it built you ll probably have succeeded in your plan to get me completely in Dutch with every friend and every patient I ve got She sat up with a bounce She said coldly Thank you very much for revealing your real opinion of me If that s the way you feel if I m such a hindrance to you I can t stay under this roof another minute And I am perfectly well able to earn my own living I will go at once and you may get a divorce at your pleasure What you want is a nice sweet cow of a woman who will enjoy having your dear friends talk about the weather and spit on the floor Tut Don t be a fool You will very soon find out whether I m a fool or not I mean it Do you think I d stay here one second after I found out that I was injuring you At least I have enough sense of justice not to do that Please stop flying off at tangents Carrie This Tangents TANGENTS Let me tell you isn t a theater play it s a serious effort to have us get together on fundamentals We ve both been cranky and said a lot of things we didn t mean I wish we were a couple o bloomin poets and just talked about roses and moonshine but we re human All right Let s cut out jabbing at each other Let s admit we both do fool things See here You KNOW you feel superior to folks You re not as bad as I say but you re not as good as you say not by a long shot What s the reason you re so superior Why can t you take folks as they are Her preparations for stalking out of the Doll s House were not yet visible She mused I think perhaps it s my childhood She halted When she went on her voice had an artificial sound her words the bookish quality of emotional meditation My father was the tenderest man in the world but he did feel superior to ordinary people Well he was And the Minnesota Valley I used to sit there on the cliffs above Mankato for hours at a time my chin in my hand looking way down the valley wanting to write poems The shiny tilted roofs below me and the river and beyond it the level fields in the mist and the rim of palisades across It held my thoughts in I LIVED in the valley But the prairie all my thoughts go flying off into the big space Do you think it might be that Um well maybe but Carrie you always talk so much about getting all you can out of life and not letting the years slip by and here you deliberately go and deprive yourself of a lot of real good home pleasure by not enjoying people unless they wear frock coats and trot out Morning clothes Oh Sorry Didn t mean t interrupt you to a lot of tea parties Take Jack Elder You think Jack hasn t got any ideas about anything but manufacturing and the tariff on lumber But do you know that Jack is nutty about music He ll put a grand opera record on the phonograph and sit and listen to it and close his eyes Or you take Lym Cass Ever realize what a well informed man he is But IS he Gopher Prairie calls anybody well informed who s been through the State Capitol and heard about Gladstone Now I m telling you Lym reads a lot solid stuff history Or take Mart Mahoney the garageman He s got a lot of Perry prints of famous pictures in his office Or old Bingham Playfair that died here bout a year ago lived seven miles out He was a captain in the Civil War and knew General Sherman and they say he was a miner in Nevada right alongside of Mark Twain You ll find these characters in all these small towns and a pile of savvy in every single one of them if you just dig for it I know And I do love them Especially people like Champ Perry But I can t be so very enthusiastic over the smug cits like Jack Elder Then I m a smug cit too whatever that is No you re a scientist Oh I will try and get the music out of mister Elder Only why can t he let it COME out instead of being ashamed of it and always talking about hunting dogs But I will try Is it all right now Sure But there s one other thing You might give me some attention too That s unjust You have everything I am No I haven t You think you respect me you always hand out some spiel about my being so useful But you never think of me as having ambitions just as much as you have Perhaps not I think of you as being perfectly satisfied Well I m not not by a long shot I don t want to be a plug general practitioner all my life like Westlake and die in harness because I can t get out of it and have em say He was a good fellow but he couldn t save a cent Not that I care a whoop what they say after I ve kicked in and can t hear em but I want to put enough money away so you and I can be independent some day and not have to work unless I feel like it and I want to have a good house by golly I ll have as good a house as anybody in THIS town and if we want to travel and see your Tormina or whatever it is why we can do it with enough money in our jeans so we won t have to take anything off anybody or fret about our old age You never worry about what might happen if we got sick and didn t have a good fat wad salted away do you I don t suppose I do Well then I have to do it for you And if you think for one moment I want to be stuck in this burg all my life and not have a chance to travel and see the different points of interest and all that then you simply don t get me I want to have a squint at the world much s you do Only I m practical about it First place I m going to make the money I m investing in good safe farmlands Do you understand why now Yes Will you try and see if you can t think of me as something more than just a dollar chasing roughneck Oh my dear I haven t been just I AM difficile And I won t call on the Dillons And if doctor Dillon is working for Westlake and McGanum I hate him CHAPTER XV THAT December she was in love with her husband She romanticized herself not as a great reformer but as the wife of a country physician The realities of the doctor s household were colored by her pride Late at night a step on the wooden porch heard through her confusion of sleep the storm door opened fumbling over the inner door panels the buzz of the electric bell Kennicott muttering Gol darn it but patiently creeping out of bed remembering to draw the covers up to keep her warm feeling for slippers and bathrobe clumping down stairs From below half heard in her drowsiness a colloquy in the pidgin German of the farmers who have forgotten the Old Country language without learning the new Hello Barney wass willst du Morgen doctor Die Frau ist ja awful sick All night she been having an awful pain in de belly How long she been this way Wie lang eh I dunno maybe two days Why didn t you come for me yesterday instead of waking me up out of a sound sleep Here it is two o clock So spat warum eh Nun

Vell I t ink about vot ve alwis eat maybe corn beef and cabbage and sausage und so weiter Doc sie weint immer all the time she holler like hell I vish you come Well all right but you call me earlier next time Look here Barney you better install a phone telephone haben Some of you Dutchmen will be dying one of these days before you can fetch the doctor The door closing Barney s wagon the wheels silent in the snow but the wagon body rattling Kennicott clicking the receiver hook to rouse the night telephone operator giving a number waiting cursing mildly waiting again and at last growling Hello Gus this is the doctor Say uh send me up a team Guess snow s too thick for a machine Going eight miles south All right Huh The hell I will Don t you go back to sleep Huh Well that s all right now you didn t wait so very darn long All right Gus shoot her along By His step on the stairs his quiet moving about the frigid room while he dressed his abstracted and meaningless cough She was supposed to be asleep she was too exquisitely drowsy to break the charm by speaking On a slip of paper laid on the bureau she could hear the pencil grinding against the marble slab he wrote his destination He went out hungry chilly unprotesting and she before she fell asleep again loved him for his sturdiness and saw the drama of his riding by night to the frightened household on the distant farm pictured children standing at a window waiting for him He suddenly had in her eyes the heroism of a wireless operator on a ship in a collision of an explorer fever clawed deserted by his bearers but going on jungle going At six when the light faltered in as through ground glass and bleakly identified the chairs as gray rectangles she heard his step on the porch heard him at the furnace the rattle of shaking the grate the slow grinding removal of ashes the shovel thrust into the coal bin the abrupt clatter of the coal as it flew into the fire box the fussy regulation of drafts the daily sounds of a Gopher Prairie life now first appealing to her as something brave and enduring many colored and free She visioned the fire box flames turned to lemon and metallic gold as the coal dust sifted over them thin twisty flutters of purple ghost flames which gave no light slipping up between the dark banked coals It was luxurious in bed and the house would be warm for her when she rose she reflected What a worthless cat she was What were her aspirations beside his capability She awoke again as he dropped into bed Seems just a few minutes ago that you started out I ve been away four hours I ve operated a woman for appendicitis in a Dutch kitchen Came awful close to losing her too but I pulled her through all right Close squeak Barney says he shot ten rabbits last Sunday He was instantly asleep one hour of rest before he had to be up and ready for the farmers who came in early She marveled that in what was to her but a night blurred moment he should have been in a distant place have taken charge of a strange house have slashed a woman saved a life What wonder he detested the lazy Westlake and McGanum How could the easy Guy Pollock understand this skill and endurance Then Kennicott was grumbling Seven fifteen Aren t you ever going to get up for breakfast and he was not a hero scientist but a rather irritable and commonplace man who needed a shave They had coffee griddle cakes and sausages and talked about missus McGanum s atrocious alligator hide belt Night witchery and morning disillusion were alike forgotten in the march of realities and days II Familiar to the doctor s wife was the man with an injured leg driven in from the country on a Sunday afternoon and brought to the house He sat in a rocker in the back of a lumber wagon his face pale from the anguish of the jolting His leg was thrust out before him resting on a starch box and covered with a leather bound horse blanket His drab courageous wife drove the wagon and she helped Kennicott support him as he hobbled up the steps into the house Fellow cut his leg with an ax pretty bad gash Halvor Nelson nine miles out Kennicott observed Carol fluttered at the back of the room childishly excited when she was sent to fetch towels and a basin of water Kennicott lifted the farmer into a chair and chuckled There we are Halvor We ll have you out fixing fences and drinking aquavit in a month The farmwife sat on the couch expressionless bulky in a man s dogskin coat and unplumbed layers of jackets The flowery silk handkerchief which she had worn over her head now hung about her seamed neck Her white wool gloves lay in her lap Kennicott drew from the injured leg the thick red German sock the innumerous other socks of gray and white wool then the spiral bandage The leg was of an unwholesome dead white with the black hairs feeble and thin and flattened and the scar a puckered line of crimson Surely Carol shuddered this was not human flesh the rosy shining tissue of the amorous poets Kennicott examined the scar smiled at Halvor and his wife chanted Fine b gosh Couldn t be better The Nelsons looked deprecating The farmer nodded a cue to his wife and she mourned Vell how much ve going to owe you doctor I guess it ll be Let s see one drive out and two calls I guess it ll be about eleven dollars in all Lena I dunno ve can pay you yoost a little w ile doctor Kennicott lumbered over to her patted her shoulder roared Why Lord love you sister I won t worry if I never get it You pay me next fall when you get your crop Carrie Suppose you or Bea could shake up a cup of coffee and some cold lamb for the Nelsons They got a long cold drive ahead III He had been gone since morning her eyes ached with reading Vida Sherwin could not come to tea She wandered through the house empty as the bleary street without The problem of Will the doctor be home in time for supper or shall I sit down without him was important in the household Six was the rigid the canonical supper hour but at half past six he had not come Much speculation with Bea Had the obstetrical case taken longer than he had expected Had he been called somewhere else Was the snow much heavier out in the country so that he should have taken a buggy or even a cutter instead of the car Here in town it had melted a lot but still A honking a shout the motor engine raced before it was shut off She hurried to the window The car was a monster at rest after furious adventures The headlights blazed on the clots of ice in the road so that the tiniest lumps gave mountainous shadows and the taillight cast a circle of ruby on the snow behind Kennicott was opening the door crying Here we are old girl Got stuck couple times but we made it by golly we made it and here we be Come on Food Eatin s She rushed to him patted his fur coat the long hairs smooth but chilly to her fingers She joyously summoned Bea All right He s here We ll sit right down IV There were to inform the doctor s wife of his successes no clapping audiences nor book reviews nor honorary degrees But there was a letter written by a German farmer recently moved from Minnesota to Saskatchewan Dear sor as you haf bin treading mee for a fue Weaks dis Somer and seen wat is rong wit mee so in Regarding to dat i wont to tank you the Doctor heir say wat shot bee rong wit mee and day give mee som Madsin but it diten

dissy and a dull Hadig Now you gust lett mee know Wat you tink about mee i do Wat you say V She encountered Guy Pollock at the drug store He looked at her as though he had a right to he spoke softly I haven t see you the last few days No I ve been out in the country with Will several times He s so Do you know that people like you and me can never understand people like him We re a pair of hypercritical loafers you and I while he quietly goes and does things She nodded and smiled and was very busy about purchasing boric acid He stared after her and slipped away When she found that he was gone she was slightly disconcerted VI She could at times agree with Kennicott that the shaving and corsets familiarity of married life was not dreary vulgarity but a wholesome frankness that artificial reticences might merely be irritating She was not much disturbed when for hours he sat about the living room in his honest socks But she would not listen to his theory that all this romance stuff is simply moonshine elegant when you re courting but no use busting yourself keeping it up all your life She thought of surprises games to vary the days She knitted an astounding purple scarf which she hid under his supper plate When he discovered it he looked embarrassed and gasped Is today an anniversary or something Gosh I d forgotten it Once she filled a thermos bottle with hot coffee a corn flakes box with cookies just baked by Bea and bustled to his office at three in the afternoon She hid her bundles in the hall and peeped in The office was shabby Kennicott had inherited it from a medical predecessor and changed it only by adding a white enameled operating table a sterilizer a Roentgen ray apparatus and a small portable typewriter It was a suite of two rooms a waiting room with straight chairs shaky pine table and those coverless and unknown magazines which are found only in the offices of dentists and doctors The room beyond looking on Main Street was business office consulting room operating room and in an alcove bacteriological and chemical laboratory The wooden floors of both rooms were bare the furniture was brown and scaly Waiting for the doctor were two women as still as though they were paralyzed and a man in a railroad brakeman s uniform holding his bandaged right hand with his tanned left They stared at Carol She sat modestly in a stiff chair feeling frivolous and out of place Kennicott appeared at the inner door ushering out a bleached man with a trickle of wan beard and consoling him All right Dad Be careful about the sugar and mind the diet I gave you Gut the prescription filled and come in and see me next week Say uh better uh better not drink too much beer All right Dad His voice was artificially hearty He looked absently at Carol He was a medical machine now not a domestic machine What is it Carrie he droned No hurry Just wanted to say hello Well Self pity because he did not divine that this was a surprise party rendered her sad and interesting to herself and she had the pleasure of the martyrs in saying bravely to him It s nothing special If you re busy long I ll trot home While she waited she ceased to pity and began to mock herself For the first time she observed the waiting room Oh yes the doctor s family had to have obi panels and a wide couch and an electric percolator but any hole was good enough for sick tired common people who were nothing but the one means and excuse for the doctor s existing No She couldn t blame Kennicott He was satisfied by the shabby chairs He put up with them as his patients did It was her neglected province she who had been going about talking of rebuilding the whole town When the patients were gone she brought in her bundles What s those wondered Kennicott Turn your back Look out of the window He obeyed not very much bored When she cried Now a feast of cookies and small hard candies and hot coffee was spread on the roll top desk in the inner room His broad face lightened That s a new one on me Never was more surprised in my life And by golly I believe I am hungry Say this is fine When the first exhilaration of the surprise had declined she demanded Will I m going to refurnish your waiting room What s the matter with it It s all right It is not It s hideous We can afford to give your patients a better place And it would be good business She felt tremendously politic Rats I don t worry about the business You look here now As I told you Just because I like to tuck a few dollars away I ll be switched if I ll stand for your thinking I m nothing but a dollar chasing Stop it Quick I m not hurting your feelings I m not criticizing I m the adoring least one of thy harem I just mean Two days later with pictures wicker chairs a rug she had made the waiting room habitable and Kennicott admitted Does look a lot better Never thought much about it Guess I need being bullied She was convinced that she was gloriously content in her career as doctor s wife VII She tried to free herself from the speculation and disillusionment which had been twitching at her sought to dismiss all the opinionation of an insurgent era She wanted to shine upon the veal faced bristly bearded Lyman Cass as much as upon Miles Bjornstam or Guy Pollock She gave a reception for the Thanatopsis Club But her real acquiring of merit was in calling upon that missus Bogart whose gossipy good opinion was so valuable to a doctor Though the Bogart house was next door she had entered it but three times Now she put on her new moleskin cap which made her face small and innocent she rubbed off the traces of a lip stick and fled across the alley before her admirable resolution should sneak away The age of houses like the age of men has small relation to their years The dull green cottage of the good Widow Bogart was twenty years old but it had the antiquity of Cheops and the smell of mummy dust Its neatness rebuked the street The two stones by the path were painted yellow the outhouse was so overmodestly masked with vines and lattice that it was not concealed at all the last iron dog remaining in Gopher Prairie stood among whitewashed conch shells upon the lawn The hallway was dismayingly scrubbed the kitchen was an exercise in mathematics with problems worked out in equidistant chairs The parlor was kept for visitors Carol suggested Let s sit in the kitchen Please don t trouble to light the parlor stove No trouble at all My gracious and you coming so seldom and all and the kitchen is a perfect sight I try to keep it clean but Cy will track mud all over it I ve spoken to him about it a hundred times if I ve spoken once no you sit right there dearie and I ll make a fire no trouble at all practically no trouble at all missus Bogart groaned rubbed her joints and repeatedly dusted her hands while she made the fire and when Carol tried to help she lamented Oh it doesn t matter guess I ain t good for much but toil and workin anyway seems as though that s what a lot of folks think The parlor was distinguished by an expanse of rag carpet from which as they entered missus Bogart hastily picked one sad dead fly In the center of the carpet was a rug depicting a red Newfoundland dog reclining in a green and yellow daisy field and labeled Our Friend The parlor organ tall and thin was adorned with a mirror partly circular partly square and partly diamond shaped and with brackets holding a pot of geraniums a mouth organ and a copy of The Oldtime Hymnal On the center table was a Sears Roebuck mail order catalogue a silver frame with photographs of the Baptist Church and of an elderly clergyman and an aluminum tray containing a rattlesnake s rattle and a broken spectacle lens missus Bogart spoke of the eloquence of the Reverend mister Zitterel the coldness of cold days the price of poplar wood Dave Dyer s new hair cut and Cy Bogart s essential piety As I said to his Sunday School teacher Cy may be a little wild but that s because he s got so much better brains than a lot of these boys and this farmer that claims he caught Cy stealing beggies is a liar and I ought to have the law on him missus Bogart went thoroughly into the rumor that the girl waiter at Billy s Lunch was not all she might be or rather was quite all she might be My lands what can you expect when everybody knows what her mother was And if these traveling salesmen would let her alone she would be all right though I certainly don t believe she ought to be allowed to think she can pull the wool over our eyes The sooner she s sent to the school for incorrigible girls down at Sauk Centre the better for all and Won t you just have a cup of coffee Carol dearie I m sure you won t mind old Aunty Bogart calling you by your first name when you think how long I ve known Will and I was such a friend of his dear lovely mother when she lived here and was that fur cap expensive But Don t you think it s awful the way folks talk in this town missus Bogart hitched her chair nearer Her large face with its disturbing collection of moles and lone black hairs wrinkled cunningly She showed her decayed teeth in a reproving smile and in the confidential voice of one who scents stale bedroom scandal she breathed I just don t see how folks can talk and act like they do You don t know the things that go on under cover This town why it s only the religious training I ve given Cy that s kept him so innocent of things Just the other day I never pay no attention to stories but I heard it mighty good and straight that Harry Haydock is carrying on with a girl that clerks in a store down in Minneapolis and poor Juanita not knowing anything about it though maybe it s the judgment of God because before she married Harry she acted up with more than one boy Well I don t like to say it and maybe I ain t up to date like Cy says but I always believed a lady shouldn t even give names to all sorts of dreadful things but just the same I know there was at least one case where Juanita and a boy well they were just dreadful And and Then there s that Ole Jenson the grocer that thinks he s so plaguey smart and I know he made up to a farmer s wife and And this awful man Bjornstam that does chores and Nat Hicks and There was it seemed no person in town who was not living a life of shame except missus Bogart and naturally she resented it She knew She had always happened to be there Once she whispered she was going by when an indiscreet window shade had been left up a couple of inches Once she had noticed a man and woman holding hands and right at a Methodist sociable Another thing Heaven knows I never want to start trouble but I can t help what I see from my back steps and I notice your hired girl Bea carrying on with the grocery boys and all missus Bogart I d trust Bea as I would myself Oh dearie you don t understand me I m sure she s a good girl I mean she s green and I hope that none of these horrid young men that there are around town will get her into trouble It s their parents fault letting them run wild and hear evil things If I had my way there wouldn t be none of them not boys nor girls neither allowed to know anything about about things till they was married It s terrible the bald way that some folks talk It just shows and gives away what awful thoughts they got inside them and there s nothing can cure them except coming right to God and kneeling down like I do at prayer meeting every Wednesday evening and saying O God I would be a miserable sinner except for thy grace I d make every last one of these brats go to Sunday School and learn to think about nice things stead of about cigarettes and goings on and these dances they have at the lodges are the worst thing that ever happened to this town lot of young men squeezing girls and finding out Oh it s dreadful I ve told the mayor he ought to put a stop to them and There was one boy in this town I don t want to be suspicious or uncharitable but It was half an hour before Carol escaped She stopped on her own porch and thought viciously If that woman is on the side of the angels then I have no choice I must be on the side of the devil But isn t she like me She too wants to reform the town She too criticizes everybody She too thinks the men are vulgar and limited AM I LIKE HER This is ghastly That evening she did not merely consent to play cribbage with Kennicott she urged him to play and she worked up a hectic interest in land deals and Sam Clark VIII In courtship days Kennicott had shown her a photograph of Nels Erdstrom s baby and log cabin but she had never seen the Erdstroms They had become merely patients of the doctor Kennicott telephoned her on a mid December afternoon Want to throw your coat on and drive out to Erdstrom s with me Fairly warm Nels got the jaundice Oh yes She hastened to put on woolen stockings high boots sweater muffler cap mittens The snow was too thick and the ruts frozen too hard for the motor They drove out in a clumsy high carriage Tucked over them was a blue woolen cover prickly to her wrists and outside of it a buffalo robe humble and moth eaten now used ever since the bison herds had streaked the prairie a few miles to the west The scattered houses between which they passed in town were small and desolate in contrast to the expanse of huge snowy yards and wide street They crossed the railroad tracks and instantly were in the farm country The big piebald horses snorted clouds of steam and started to trot The carriage squeaked in rhythm Kennicott drove with clucks of There boy take it easy He was thinking He paid no attention to Carol Yet it was he who commented Pretty nice over there as they approached an oak grove where shifty winter sunlight quivered in the hollow between two snow drifts They drove from the natural prairie to a cleared district which twenty years ago had been forest The country seemed to stretch unchanging to the North Pole low hill brush scraggly bottom reedy creek muskrat mound fields with frozen brown clods thrust up through the snow Her ears and nose were pinched her breath frosted her collar her fingers ached Getting colder she said Yup That was all their conversation for three miles Yet she was happy They reached Nels Erdstrom s at four and with a throb she recognized the courageous venture which had lured her to Gopher Prairie the cleared fields furrows among stumps a log cabin chinked with mud and roofed with dry hay But Nels had prospered He used the log cabin as a barn and a new house reared up a proud unwise Gopher Prairie house the more naked and ungraceful in its glossy white paint and pink trimmings Every tree had been cut down The house was so unsheltered so battered by the wind so bleakly thrust out into the harsh clearing that Carol shivered But they were welcomed warmly enough in the kitchen with its crisp new plaster its black and nickel range its cream separator in a corner missus Erdstrom begged her to sit in the parlor where there was a phonograph and an oak and leather davenport the prairie farmer s proofs of social progress but she dropped down by the kitchen stove and insisted Please don t mind me When missus Erdstrom had followed the doctor out of the room Carol glanced in a friendly way at the grained pine cupboard the framed Lutheran Konfirmations Attest the traces of fried eggs and sausages on the dining table against the wall and a jewel among calendars presenting not only a lithographic young woman with cherry lips and a Swedish advertisement of Axel Egge s grocery but also a thermometer and a match holder She saw that a boy of four or five was staring at her from the hall a boy in gingham shirt and faded corduroy trousers but large eyed firm mouthed wide browed He vanished then peeped in again biting his knuckles turning his shoulder toward her in shyness Didn t she remember what was it Kennicott sitting beside her at Fort Snelling urging See how scared that baby is Needs some woman like you Magic had fluttered about her then magic of sunset and cool air and the curiosity of lovers She held out her hands as much to that sanctity as to the boy He edged into the room doubtfully sucking his thumb Hello she said What s your name Hee hee hee You re quite right I agree with you Silly people like me always ask children their names Hee hee hee Come here and I ll tell you the story of well I don t know what it will be about but it will have a slim heroine and a Prince Charming He stood stoically while she spun nonsense His giggling ceased She was winning him Then the telephone bell two long rings one short missus Erdstrom galloped into the room shrieked into the transmitter Vell Yes yes dis is Erdstrom s place Heh Oh you vant de doctor Kennicott appeared growled into the telephone Well what do you want Oh hello Dave what do you want Which Morgenroth s Adolph s All right Amputation Yuh I see Say Dave get Gus to harness up and take my surgical kit down there and have him take some chloroform I ll go straight down from here May not get home tonight You can get me at Adolph s Huh No Carrie can give the anesthetic I guess G by Huh No tell me about that tomorrow too damn many people always listening in on this farmers line He turned to Carol Adolph Morgenroth farmer ten miles southwest of town got his arm crushed fixing his cow shed and a post caved in on him smashed him up pretty bad may have to amputate Dave Dyer says Afraid we ll have to go right from here Darn sorry to drag you clear down there with me Please do Don t mind me a bit Think you could give the anesthetic Usually have my driver do it If you ll tell me how All right Say did you hear me putting one over on these goats that are always rubbering in on party wires I hope they heard me Well Now Bessie don t you worry about Nels He s getting along all right Tomorrow you or one of the neighbors drive in and get this prescription filled at Dyer s Give him a teaspoonful every four hours Good by Hel lo Here s the little fellow My Lord Bessie it ain t possible this is the fellow that used to be so sickly Why say he s a great big strapping Svenska now going to be bigger n his daddy Kennicott s bluffness made the child squirm with a delight which Carol could not evoke It was a humble wife who followed the busy doctor out to the carriage and her ambition was not to play Rachmaninoff better nor to build town halls but to chuckle at babies The sunset was merely a flush of rose on a dome of silver with oak twigs and thin poplar branches against it but a silo on the horizon changed from a red tank to a tower of violet misted over with gray The purple road vanished and without lights in the darkness of a world destroyed they swayed on toward nothing It was a bumpy cold way to the Morgenroth farm and she was asleep when they arrived Here was no glaring new house with a proud phonograph but a low whitewashed kitchen smelling of cream and cabbage Adolph Morgenroth was lying on a couch in the rarely used dining room His heavy work scarred wife was shaking her hands in anxiety Carol felt that Kennicott would do something magnificent and startling But he was casual He greeted the man Well well Adolph have to fix you up eh Quietly to the wife Hat die drug store my schwartze bag hier geschickt So schon Wie viel Uhr ist s Sieben Nun lassen uns ein wenig supper zuerst haben Got any of that good beer left giebt s noch Bier He had supped in four minutes His coat off his sleeves rolled up he was scrubbing his hands in a tin basin in the sink using the bar of yellow kitchen soap Carol had not dared to look into the farther room while she labored over the supper of beer rye bread moist cornbeef and cabbage set on the kitchen table The man in there was groaning In her one glance she had seen that his blue flannel shirt was open at a corded tobacco brown neck the hollows of which were sprinkled with thin black and gray hairs He was covered with a sheet like a corpse and outside the sheet was his right arm wrapped in towels stained with blood But Kennicott strode into the other room gaily and she followed him With surprising delicacy in his large fingers he unwrapped the towels and revealed an arm which below the elbow was a mass of blood and raw flesh The man bellowed The room grew thick about her she was very seasick she fled to a chair in the kitchen Through the haze of nausea she heard Kennicott grumbling Afraid it will have to come off Adolph What did you do Fall on a reaper blade We ll fix it right up Carrie CAROL She couldn t she couldn t get up Then she was up her knees like water her stomach revolving a thousand times a second her eyes filmed her ears full of roaring She couldn t reach the dining room She was going to faint Then she was in the dining room leaning against the wall trying to smile flushing hot and cold along her chest and sides while Kennicott mumbled Say help missus Morgenroth and me carry him in on the kitchen table No first go out and shove those two tables together and put a blanket on them and a clean sheet It was salvation to push the heavy tables to scrub them to be exact in placing the sheet Her head cleared she was able to look calmly in at her husband and the farmwife while they undressed the wailing man got him into a clean nightgown and washed his arm Kennicott came to lay out his instruments She realized that with no hospital facilities yet with no worry about it her husband HER HUSBAND was going to perform a surgical operation that miraculous boldness of which one read in stories about famous surgeons She helped them to move Adolph into the kitchen The man was in such a funk that he would not use his legs He was heavy and smelled of sweat and the stable But she put her arm about his waist her sleek head by his chest she tugged at him she clicked her tongue in imitation of Kennicott s cheerful noises When Adolph was on the table Kennicott laid a hemispheric steel and cotton frame on his face suggested to Carol Now you sit here at his head and keep the ether dripping about this fast see I ll watch his breathing Look who s here Real anesthetist Ochsner hasn t got a better one Class eh Now now Adolph take it easy This won t hurt you a bit Put you all nice and asleep and it won t hurt a bit Schweig mal Bald schlaft man grat wie ein Kind So So Bald geht s besser As she let the ether drip nervously trying to keep the rhythm that Kennicott had indicated Carol stared at her husband with the abandon of hero worship He shook his head Bad light bad light Here missus Morgenroth you stand right here and hold this lamp Hier und dieses dieses lamp halten so By that streaky glimmer he worked swiftly at ease The room was still Carol tried to look at him yet not look at the seeping blood the crimson slash the vicious scalpel The ether fumes were sweet choking Her head seemed to be floating away from her body Her arm was feeble It was not the blood but the grating of the surgical saw on the living bone that broke her and she knew that she had been fighting off nausea that she was beaten She was lost in dizziness She heard Kennicott s voice Sick Trot outdoors couple minutes Adolph will stay under now She was fumbling at a door knob which whirled in insulting circles she was on the stoop gasping forcing air into her chest her head clearing As she returned she caught the scene as a whole the cavernous kitchen two milk cans a leaden patch by the wall hams dangling from a beam bats of light at the stove door and in the center illuminated by a small glass lamp held by a frightened stout woman doctor Kennicott bending over a body which was humped under a sheet the surgeon his bare arms daubed with blood his hands in pale yellow rubber gloves loosening the tourniquet his face without emotion save when he threw up his head and clucked at the farmwife Hold that light steady just a second more noch blos esn wenig He speaks a vulgar common incorrect German of life and death and birth and the soil I read the French and German of sentimental lovers and Christmas garlands And I thought that it was I who had the culture she worshiped as she returned to her place After a time he snapped That s enough Don t give him any more ether He was concentrated on tying an artery His gruffness seemed heroic to her As he shaped the flap of flesh she murmured Oh you ARE wonderful He was surprised Why this is a cinch Now if it had been like last week Get me some more water Now last week I had a case with an ooze in the peritoneal cavity and by golly if it wasn t a stomach ulcer that I hadn t suspected and There Say I certainly am sleepy Let s turn in here Too late to drive home And tastes to me like a storm coming IX They slept on a feather bed with their fur coats over them in the morning they broke ice in the pitcher the vast flowered and gilt pitcher Kennicott s storm had not come When they set out it was hazy and growing warmer After a mile she saw that he was studying a dark cloud in the north He urged the horses to the run But she forgot his unusual haste in wonder at the tragic landscape The pale snow the prickles of old stubble and the clumps of ragged brush faded into a gray obscurity Under the hillocks were cold shadows The willows about a farmhouse were agitated by the rising wind and the patches of bare wood where the bark had peeled away were white as the flesh of a leper The snowy slews were of a harsh flatness The whole land was cruel and a climbing cloud of slate edged blackness dominated the sky Guess we re about in for a blizzard speculated Kennicott We can make Ben McGonegal s anyway Blizzard Really Why But still we used to think they were fun when I was a girl Daddy had to stay home from court and we d stand at the window and watch the snow Not much fun on the prairie Get lost Freeze to death Take no chances He chirruped at the horses They were flying now the carriage rocking on the hard ruts The whole air suddenly crystallized into large damp flakes The horses and the buffalo robe were covered with snow her face was wet the thin butt of the whip held a white ridge The air became colder The snowflakes were harder they shot in level lines clawing at her face She could not see a hundred feet ahead Kennicott was stern He bent forward the reins firm in his coonskin gauntlets She was certain that he would get through He always got through things Save for his presence the world and all normal living disappeared They were lost in the boiling snow He leaned close to bawl Letting the horses have their heads They ll get us home With a terrifying bump they were off the road slanting with two wheels in the ditch but instantly they were jerked back as the horses fled on She gasped She tried to and did not feel brave as she pulled the woolen robe up about her chin They were passing something like a dark wall on the right I know that barn he yelped He pulled at the reins Peeping from the covers she saw his teeth pinch his lower lip saw him scowl as he slackened and sawed and jerked sharply again at the racing horses They stopped Farmhouse there Put robe around you and come on he cried It was like diving into icy water to climb out of the carriage but on the ground she smiled at him her face little and childish and pink above the buffalo robe over her shoulders In a swirl of flakes which scratched at their eyes like a maniac darkness he unbuckled the harness He turned and plodded back a ponderous furry figure holding the horses bridles Carol s hand dragging at his sleeve They came to the cloudy bulk of a barn whose outer wall was directly upon the road Feeling along it he found a gate led them into a yard into the barn The interior was warm It stunned them with its languid quiet He carefully drove the horses into stalls Her toes were coals of pain Let s run for the house she said Can t Not yet Might never find it Might get lost ten feet away from it Sit over in this stall near the horses We ll rush for the house when the blizzard lifts I m so stiff I can t walk He carried her into the stall stripped off her overshoes and boots stopping to blow on his purple fingers as he fumbled at her laces He rubbed her feet and covered her with the buffalo robe and horse blankets from the pile on the feed box She was drowsy hemmed in by the storm She sighed You re so strong and yet so skilful and not afraid of blood or storm or Used to it Only thing that s bothered me was the chance the ether fumes might explode last night I don t understand Why Dave the darn fool sent me ether instead of chloroform like I told him and you know ether fumes are mighty inflammable especially with that lamp right by the table But I had to operate of course wound chuck full of barnyard filth that way You knew all the time that Both you and I might have been blown up You knew it while you were operating Sure Didn t you Why what s the matter CHAPTER XVI KENNICOTT was heavily pleased by her Christmas presents and he gave her a diamond bar pin But she could not persuade herself that he was much interested in the rites of the morning in the tree she had decorated the three stockings she had hung the ribbons and gilt seals and hidden messages He said only Nice way to fix things all right What do you say we go down to Jack Elder s and have a game of five hundred this afternoon She remembered her father s Christmas fantasies the sacred old rag doll at the top of the tree the score of cheap presents the punch and carols the roast chestnuts by the fire and the gravity with which the judge opened the children s scrawly notes and took cognizance of demands for sled rides for opinions upon the existence of Santa Claus She remembered him reading out a long indictment of himself for being a sentimentalist against the peace and dignity of the State of Minnesota She remembered his thin legs twinkling before their sled She muttered unsteadily Must run up and put on my shoes slippers so cold In the not very romantic solitude of the locked bathroom she sat on the slippery edge of the tub and wept II Kennicott had five hobbies medicine land investment Carol motoring and hunting It is not certain in what order he preferred them Solid though his enthusiasms were in the matter of medicine his admiration of this city surgeon his condemnation of that for tricky ways of persuading country practitioners to bring in surgical patients his indignation about fee splitting his pride in a new X ray apparatus none of these beatified him as did motoring He nursed his two year old Buick even in winter when it was stored in the stable garage behind the house He filled the grease cups varnished a fender removed from beneath the back seat the debris of gloves copper washers crumpled maps dust and greasy rags Winter noons he wandered out and stared owlishly at the car He became excited over a fabulous trip we might take next summer He galloped to the station brought home railway maps and traced motor routes from Gopher Prairie to Winnipeg or Des Moines or Grand Marais thinking aloud and expecting her to be effusive about such academic questions as Now I wonder if we could stop at Baraboo and break the jump from La Crosse to Chicago To him motoring was a faith not to be questioned a high church cult with electric sparks for candles and piston rings possessing the sanctity of altar vessels His liturgy was composed of intoned and metrical road comments They say there s a pretty good hike from Duluth to International Falls Hunting was equally a devotion full of metaphysical concepts veiled from Carol All winter he read sporting catalogues and thought about remarkable past shots Member that time when I got two ducks on a long chance just at sunset At least once a month he drew his favorite repeating shotgun his pump gun from its wrapper of greased canton flannel he oiled the trigger and spent silent ecstatic moments aiming at the ceiling Sunday mornings Carol heard him trudging up to the attic and there an hour later she found him turning over boots wooden duck decoys lunch boxes or reflectively squinting at old shells rubbing their brass caps with his sleeve and shaking his head as he thought about their uselessness He kept the loading tools he had used as a boy a capper for shot gun shells a mold for lead bullets When once in a housewifely frenzy for getting rid of things she raged Why don t you give these away he solemnly defended them Well you can t tell they might come in handy some day She flushed She wondered if he was thinking of the child they would have when as he put it they were sure they could afford one Mysteriously aching nebulously sad she slipped away half convinced but only half convinced that it was horrible and unnatural this postponement of release of mother affection this sacrifice to her opinionation and to his cautious desire for prosperity But it would be worse if he were like Sam Clark insisted on having children she considered then If Will were the Prince wouldn t I DEMAND his child Kennicott s land deals were both financial advancement and favorite game Driving through the country he noticed which farms had good crops he heard the news about the restless farmer who was thinking about selling out here and pulling his freight for Alberta He asked the veterinarian about the value of different breeds of stock he inquired of Lyman Cass whether or not Einar Gyseldson really had had a yield of forty bushels of wheat to the acre He was always consulting Julius Flickerbaugh who handled more real estate than law and more law than justice He studied township maps and read notices of auctions Thus he was able to buy a quarter section of land for one hundred and fifty dollars an acre and to sell it in a year or two after installing a cement floor in the barn and running water in the house for one hundred and eighty or even two hundred He spoke of these details to Sam Clark rather often In all his games cars and guns and land he expected Carol to take an interest But he did not give her the facts which might have created interest He talked only of the obvious and tedious aspects never of his aspirations in finance nor of the mechanical principles of motors This month of romance she was eager to understand his hobbies She shivered in the garage while he spent half an hour in deciding whether to put alcohol or patent non freezing liquid into the radiator or to drain out the water entirely Or no then I wouldn t want to take her out if it turned warm still of course I could fill the radiator again wouldn t take so awful long just take a few pails of water still if it turned cold on me again before I drained it Course there s some people that put in kerosene but they say it rots the hose connections and Where did I put that lug wrench It was at this point that she gave up being a motorist and retired to the house In their new intimacy he was more communicative about his practise he informed her with the invariable warning not to tell that missus Sunderquist had another baby coming that the hired girl at Howland s was in trouble But when she asked technical questions he did not know how to answer when she inquired Exactly what is the method of taking out the tonsils he yawned Tonsilectomy Why you just If there s pus you operate Just take em out Seen the newspaper What the devil did Bea do with it She did not try again III They had gone to the movies The movies were almost as vital to Kennicott and the other solid citizens of Gopher Prairie as land speculation and guns and automobiles The feature film portrayed a brave young Yankee who conquered a South American republic He turned the natives from their barbarous habits of singing and laughing to the vigorous sanity the Pep and Punch and Go of the North he taught them to work in factories to wear Klassy Kollege Klothes and to shout Oh you baby doll watch me gather in the mazuma He changed nature itself A mountain which had borne nothing but lilies and cedars and loafing clouds was by his Hustle so inspirited that it broke out in long wooden sheds and piles of iron ore to be converted into steamers to carry iron ore to be converted into steamers to carry iron ore The intellectual tension induced by the master film was relieved by a livelier more lyric and less philosophical drama Mack Schnarken and the Bathing Suit Babes in a comedy of manners entitled Right on the Coco mister Schnarken was at various high moments a cook a life guard a burlesque actor and a sculptor There was a hotel hallway up which policemen charged only to be stunned by plaster busts hurled upon them from the innumerous doors If the plot lacked lucidity the dual motif of legs and pie was clear and sure Bathing and modeling were equally sound occasions for legs the wedding scene was but an approach to the thunderous climax when mister Schnarken slipped a piece of custard pie into the clergyman s rear pocket The audience in the Rosebud Movie Palace squealed and wiped their eyes they scrambled under the seats for overshoes mittens and mufflers while the screen announced that next week mister Schnarken might be seen in a new riproaring extra special superfeature of the Clean Comedy Corporation entitled Under Mollie s Bed I m glad said Carol to Kennicott as they stooped before the northwest gale which was torturing the barren street that this is a moral country We don t allow any of these beastly frank novels Yump Vice Society and Postal Department won t stand for them The American people don t like filth Yes It s fine I m glad we have such dainty romances as Right on the Coco instead Say what in heck do you think you re trying to do Kid me He was silent She awaited his anger She meditated upon his gutter patois the Boeotian dialect characteristic of Gopher Prairie He laughed puzzlingly When they came into the glow of the house he laughed again He condescended I ve got to hand it to you You re consistent all right I d of thought that after getting this look in at a lot of good decent farmers you d get over this high art stuff but you hang right on Well To herself He takes advantage of my trying to be good Tell you Carrie There s just three classes of people folks that haven t got any ideas at all and cranks that kick about everything and Regular Guys the fellows with sticktuitiveness that boost and get the world s work done Then I m probably a crank She smiled negligently No I won t admit it You do like to talk but at a show down you d prefer Sam Clark to any damn long haired artist Oh well Oh well mockingly My we re just going to change everything aren t we Going to tell fellows that have been making movies for ten years how to direct em and tell architects how to build towns and make the magazines publish nothing but a lot of highbrow stories about old maids and about wives that don t know what they want Oh we re a terror Come on now Carrie come out of it wake up You ve got a fine nerve kicking about a movie because it shows a few legs Why you re always touting these Greek dancers or whatever they are that don t even wear a shimmy But dear the trouble with that film it wasn t that it got in so many legs but that it giggled coyly and promised to show more of them and then didn t keep the promise It was Peeping Tom s idea of humor I don t get you Look here now She lay awake while he rumbled with sleep I must go on My crank ideas he calls them I thought that adoring him watching him operate would be enough It isn t Not after the first thrill I don t want to hurt him But I must go on It isn t enough to stand by while he fills an automobile radiator and chucks me bits of information If I stood by and admired him long enough I would be content I would become a nice little woman The Village Virus Already I m not reading anything I haven t touched the piano for a week I m letting the days drown in worship of a good deal ten plunks more per acre I won t I won t succumb How I ve failed at everything the Thanatopsis parties pioneers city hall Guy and Vida But It doesn t MATTER I m not trying to reform the town now I m not trying to organize Browning Clubs and sit in clean white kids yearning up at lecturers with ribbony eyeglasses I am trying to save my soul Will Kennicott asleep there trusting me thinking he holds me And I m leaving him All of me left him when he laughed at me It wasn t enough for him that I admired him I must change myself and grow like him He takes advantage No more It s finished I will go on IV Her violin lay on top of the upright piano She picked it up Since she had last touched it the dried strings had snapped and upon it lay a gold and crimson cigar band V She longed to see Guy Pollock for the confirming of the brethren in the faith But Kennicott s dominance was heavy upon her She could not determine whether she was checked by fear or him or by inertia by dislike of the emotional labor of the scenes which would be involved in asserting independence She was like the revolutionist at fifty not afraid of death but bored by the probability of bad steaks and bad breaths and sitting up all night on windy barricades The second evening after the movies she impulsively summoned Vida Sherwin and Guy to the house for pop corn and cider In the living room Vida and Kennicott debated the value of manual training in grades below the eighth while Carol sat beside Guy at the dining table buttering pop corn She was quickened by the speculation in his eyes She murmured Guy do you want to help me My dear How I don t know He waited I think I want you to help me find out what has made the darkness of the women Gray darkness and shadowy trees We re all in it ten million women young married women with good prosperous husbands and business women in linen collars and grandmothers that gad out to teas and wives of under paid miners and farmwives who really like to make butter and go to church What is it we want and need Will Kennicott there would say that we need lots of children and hard work But it isn t that There s the same discontent in women with eight children and one more coming always one more coming And you find it in stenographers and wives who scrub just as much as in girl college graduates who wonder how they can escape their kind parents What do we want Essentially I think you are like myself Carol you want to go back to an age of tranquillity and charming manners You want to enthrone good taste again Just good taste Fastidious people Oh no I believe all of us want the same things we re all together the industrial workers and the women and the farmers and the negro race and the Asiatic colonies and even a few of the Respectables It s all the same revolt in all the classes that have waited and taken advice I think perhaps we want a more conscious life We re tired of drudging and sleeping and dying We re tired of seeing just a few people able to be individualists We re tired of always deferring hope till the next generation We re tired of hearing the politicians and priests and cautious reformers and the husbands coax us Be calm Be patient Wait We have the plans for a Utopia already made just give us a bit more time and we ll produce it trust us we re wiser than you For ten thousand years they ve said that We want our Utopia NOW and we re going to try our hands at it All we want is everything for all of us For every housewife and every longshoreman and every Hindu nationalist and every teacher We want everything We shatn t get it So we shatn t ever be content She wondered why he was wincing He broke in See here my dear I certainly hope you don t class yourself with a lot of trouble making labor leaders Democracy is all right theoretically and I ll admit there are industrial injustices but I d rather have them than see the world reduced to a dead level of mediocrity I refuse to believe that you have anything in common with a lot of laboring men rowing for bigger wages so that they can buy wretched flivvers and hideous player pianos and At this second in Buenos Ayres a newspaper editor broke his routine of being bored by exchanges to assert Any injustice is better than seeing the world reduced to a gray level of scientific dullness At this second a clerk standing at the bar of a New York saloon stopped milling his secret fear of his nagging office manager long enough to growl at the chauffeur beside him Aw you socialists make me sick I m an individualist I ain t going to be nagged by no bureaus and take orders off labor leaders And mean to say a hobo s as good as you and me At this second Carol realized that for all Guy s love of dead elegances his timidity was as depressing to her as the bulkiness of Sam Clark She realized that he was not a mystery as she had excitedly believed not a romantic messenger from the World Outside on whom she could count for escape He belonged to Gopher Prairie absolutely She was snatched back from a dream of far countries and found herself on Main Street He was completing his protest You don t want to be mixed up in all this orgy of meaningless discontent She soothed him No I don t I m not heroic I m scared by all the fighting that s going on in the world I want nobility and adventure but perhaps I want still more to curl on the hearth with some one I love Would you He did not finish it He picked up a handful of pop corn let it run through his fingers looked at her wistfully With the loneliness of one who has put away a possible love Carol saw that he was a stranger She saw that he had never been anything but a frame on which she had hung shining garments If she had let him diffidently make love to her it was not because she cared but because she did not care because it did not matter She smiled at him with the exasperating tactfulness of a woman checking a flirtation a smile like an airy pat on the arm She sighed You re a dear to let me tell you my imaginary troubles She bounced up and trilled Shall we take the pop corn in to them now Guy looked after her desolately While she teased Vida and Kennicott she was repeating I must go on VI Miles Bjornstam the pariah Red Swede had brought his circular saw and portable gasoline engine to the house to cut the cords of poplar for the kitchen range Kennicott had given the order Carol knew nothing of it till she heard the ringing of the saw and glanced out to see Bjornstam in black leather jacket and enormous ragged purple mittens pressing sticks against the whirling blade and flinging the stove lengths to one side The red irritable motor kept up a red irritable tip tip tip tip tip tip The whine of the saw rose till it simulated the shriek of a fire alarm whistle at night but always at the end it gave a lively metallic clang and in the stillness she heard the flump of the cut stick falling on the pile She threw a motor robe over her ran out Bjornstam welcomed her Well well well Here s old Miles fresh as ever Well say that s all right he ain t even begun to be cheeky yet next summer he s going to take you out on his horse trading trip clear into Idaho Yes and I may go How s tricks Crazy about the town yet No but I probably shall be some day Don t let em get you Kick em in the face He shouted at her while he worked The pile of stove wood grew astonishingly The pale bark of the poplar sticks was mottled with lichens of sage green and dusty gray the newly sawed ends were fresh colored with the agreeable roughness of a woolen muffler To the sterile winter air the wood gave a scent of March sap Kennicott telephoned that he was going into the country Bjornstam had not finished his work at noon and she invited him to have dinner with Bea in the kitchen She wished that she were independent enough to dine with these her guests She considered their friendliness she sneered at social distinctions she raged at her own taboos and she continued to regard them as retainers and herself as a lady She sat in the dining room and listened through the door to Bjornstam s booming and Bea s giggles She was the more absurd to herself in that after the rite of dining alone she could go out to the kitchen lean against the sink and talk to them They were attracted to each other a Swedish Othello and Desdemona more useful and amiable than their prototypes Bjornstam told his scapes selling horses in a Montana mining camp breaking a log jam being impertinent to a two fisted millionaire lumberman Bea gurgled Oh my and kept his coffee cup filled He took a long time to finish the wood He had frequently to go into the kitchen to get warm Carol heard him confiding to Bea You re a darn nice Swede girl I guess if I had a woman like you I wouldn t be such a sorehead Gosh your kitchen is clean makes an old bach feel sloppy Say that s nice hair you got Huh Me fresh Saaaay girl if I ever do get fresh you ll know it Why I could pick you up with one finger and hold you in the air long enough to read Robert J Ingersoll clean through Ingersoll Oh he s a religious writer Sure You d like him fine When he drove off he waved to Bea and Carol lonely at the window above was envious of their pastoral And I But I will go on CHAPTER XVII I THEY were driving down the lake to the cottages that moonlit January night twenty of them in the bob sled They sang Toy Land and Seeing Nelly Home they leaped from the low back of the sled to race over the slippery snow ruts and when they were tired they climbed on the runners for a lift The moon tipped flakes kicked up by the horses settled over the revelers and dripped down their necks but they laughed yelped beat their leather mittens against their chests The harness rattled the sleigh bells were frantic Jack Elder s setter sprang beside the horses barking For a time Carol raced with them The cold air gave fictive power She felt that she could run on all night leap twenty feet at a stride But the excess of energy tired her and she was glad to snuggle under the comforters which covered the hay in the sled box In the midst of the babel she found enchanted quietude Along the road the shadows from oak branches were inked on the snow like bars of music Then the sled came out on the surface of Lake Minniemashie Across the thick ice was a veritable road a short cut for farmers On the glaring expanse of the lake levels of hard crust flashes of green ice blown clear chains of drifts ribbed like the sea beach the moonlight was overwhelming It stormed on the snow it turned the woods ashore into crystals of fire The night was tropical and voluptuous In that drugged magic there was no difference between heavy heat and insinuating cold Carol was dream strayed The turbulent voices even Guy Pollock being connotative beside her were nothing She repeated Deep on the convent roof the snows Are sparkling to the moon The words and the light blurred into one vast indefinite happiness and she believed that some great thing was coming to her She withdrew from the clamor into a worship of incomprehensible gods The night expanded she was conscious of the universe and all mysteries stooped down to her She was jarred out of her ecstasy as the bob sled bumped up the steep road to the bluff where stood the cottages They dismounted at Jack Elder s shack The interior walls of unpainted boards which had been grateful in August were forbidding in the chill In fur coats and mufflers tied over caps they were a strange company bears and walruses talking Jack Elder lighted the shavings waiting in the belly of a cast iron stove which was like an enlarged bean pot They piled their wraps high on a rocker and cheered the rocker as it solemnly tipped over backward missus Elder and missus Sam Clark made coffee in an enormous blackened tin pot Vida Sherwin and missus McGanum unpacked doughnuts and gingerbread missus Dave Dyer warmed up hot dogs frankfurters in rolls doctor Terry Gould after announcing Ladies and gents prepare to be shocked shock line forms on the right produced a bottle of bourbon whisky The others danced muttering Ouch as their frosted feet struck the pine planks Carol had lost her dream Harry Haydock lifted her by the waist and swung her She laughed The gravity of the people who stood apart and talked made her the more impatient for frolic Kennicott Sam Clark Jackson Elder young doctor McGanum and James Madison Howland teetering on their toes near the stove conversed with the sedate pomposity of the commercialist In details the men were unlike yet they said the same things in the same hearty monotonous voices You had to look at them to see which was speaking Well we made pretty good time coming up from one any one Yump we hit it up after we struck the good going on the lake Seems kind of slow though after driving an auto Yump it does at that Say how d you make out with that Sphinx tire you got Seems to hold out fine Still I don t know s I like it any better than the Roadeater Cord Yump nothing better than a Roadeater Especially the cord The cord s lots better than the fabric Yump you said something Roadeater s a good tire Say how d you come out with Pete Garsheim on his payments He s paying up pretty good That s a nice piece of land he s got Yump that s a dandy farm Yump Pete s got a good place there They glided from these serious topics into the jocose insults which are the wit of Main Street Sam Clark was particularly apt at them What s this wild eyed sale of summer caps you think you re trying to pull off he clamored at Harry Haydock Did you steal em or are you just overcharging us as usual Oh say speaking about caps d I ever tell you the good one I ve got on Will The doc thinks he s a pretty good driver fact he thinks he s almost got human intelligence but one time he had his machine out in the rain and the poor fish he hadn t put on chains and thinks I Carol had heard the story rather often She fled back to the dancers and at Dave Dyer s masterstroke of dropping an icicle down missus McGanum s back she applauded hysterically They sat on the floor devouring the food The men giggled amiably as they passed the whisky bottle and laughed There s a real sport when Juanita Haydock took a sip Carol tried to follow she believed that she desired to be drunk and riotous but the whisky choked her and as she saw Kennicott frown she handed the bottle on repentantly Somewhat too late she remembered that she had given up domesticity and repentance Let s play charades said Raymie Wutherspoon Oh yes do let us said Ella Stowbody That s the caper sanctioned Harry Haydock They interpreted the word making as May and King The crown was a red flannel mitten cocked on Sam Clark s broad pink bald head They forgot they were respectable They made believe Carol was stimulated to cry Let s form a dramatic club and give a play Shall we It s been so much fun tonight They looked affable Sure observed Sam Clark loyally Oh do let us I think it would be lovely to present Romeo and Juliet yearned Ella Stowbody Be a whale of a lot of fun doctor Terry Gould granted But if we did Carol cautioned it would be awfully silly to have amateur theatricals We ought to paint our own scenery and everything and really do something fine There d be a lot of hard work Would you would we all be punctual at rehearsals do you suppose You bet Sure That s the idea Fellow ought to be prompt at rehearsals they all agreed Then let s meet next week and form the Gopher Prairie Dramatic Association Carol sang She drove home loving these friends who raced through moonlit snow had Bohemian parties and were about to create beauty in the theater Everything was solved She would be an authentic part of the town yet escape the coma of the Village Virus She would be free of Kennicott again without hurting him without his knowing She had triumphed The moon was small and high now and unheeding II Though they had all been certain that they longed for the privilege of attending committee meetings and rehearsals the dramatic association as definitely formed consisted only of Kennicott Carol Guy Pollock Vida Sherwin Ella Stowbody the Harry Haydocks the Dave Dyers Raymie Wutherspoon doctor Terry Gould and four new candidates flirtatious Rita Simons doctor and missus Harvey Dillon and Myrtle Cass an uncomely but intense girl of nineteen Of these fifteen only seven came to the first meeting The rest telephoned their unparalleled regrets and engagements and illnesses and announced that they would be present at all other meetings through eternity Carol was made president and director She had added the Dillons Despite Kennicott s apprehension the dentist and his wife had not been taken up by the Westlakes but had remained as definitely outside really smart society as Willis Woodford who was teller bookkeeper and janitor in Stowbody s bank Carol had noted missus Dillon dragging past the house during a bridge of the Jolly Seventeen looking in with pathetic lips at the splendor of the accepted She impulsively invited the Dillons to the dramatic association meeting and when Kennicott was brusque to them she was unusually cordial and felt virtuous That self approval balanced her disappointment at the smallness of the meeting and her embarrassment during Raymie Wutherspoon s repetitions of The stage needs uplifting and I believe that there are great lessons in some plays Ella Stowbody who was a professional having studied elocution in Milwaukee disapproved of Carol s enthusiasm for recent plays Miss Stowbody expressed the fundamental principle of the American drama the only way to be artistic is to present Shakespeare As no one listened to her she sat back and looked like Lady Macbeth III The Little Theaters which were to give piquancy to American drama three or four years later were only in embryo But of this fast coming revolt Carol had premonitions She knew from some lost magazine article that in Dublin were innovators called The Irish Players She knew confusedly that a man named Gordon Craig had painted scenery or had he written plays She felt that in the turbulence of the drama she was discovering a history more important than the commonplace chronicles which dealt with senators and their pompous puerilities She had a sensation of familiarity a dream of sitting in a Brussels cafe and going afterward to a tiny gay theater under a cathedral wall The advertisement in the Minneapolis paper leaped from the page to her eyes The Cosmos School of Music Oratory and Dramatic Art announces a program of four one act plays by Schnitzler Shaw Yeats and Lord Dunsany She had to be there She begged Kennicott to run down to the Cities with her Well I don t know Be fun to take in a show but why the deuce do you want to see those darn foreign plays given by a lot of amateurs Why don t you wait for a regular play later on There s going to be some corkers coming Lottie of Two Gun Rancho and Cops and Crooks real Broadway stuff with the New York casts What s this junk you want to see Hm How He Lied to Her Husband That doesn t listen so bad Sounds racy And uh well I could go to the motor show I suppose I d like to see this new Hup roadster Well She never knew which attraction made him decide She had four days of delightful worry over the hole in her one good silk petticoat the loss of a string of beads from her chiffon and brown velvet frock the catsup stain on her best georgette crepe blouse She wailed I haven t a single solitary thing that s fit to be seen in and enjoyed herself very much indeed Kennicott went about casually letting people know that he was going to run down to the Cities and see some shows As the train plodded through the gray prairie on a windless day with the smoke from the engine clinging to the fields in giant cotton rolls in a low and writhing wall which shut off the snowy fields she did not look out of the window She closed her eyes and hummed and did not know that she was humming She was the young poet attacking fame and Paris In the Minneapolis station the crowd of lumberjacks farmers and Swedish families with innumerous children and grandparents and paper parcels their foggy crowding and their clamor confused her She felt rustic in this once familiar city after a year and a half of Gopher Prairie She was certain that Kennicott was taking the wrong trolley car By dusk the liquor warehouses Hebraic clothing shops and lodging houses on lower Hennepin Avenue were smoky hideous ill tempered She was battered by the noise and shuttling of the rush hour traffic When a clerk in an overcoat too closely fitted at the waist stared at her she moved nearer to Kennicott s arm The clerk was flippant and urban He was a superior person used to this tumult Was he laughing at her For a moment she wanted the secure quiet of Gopher Prairie In the hotel lobby she was self conscious She was not used to hotels she remembered with jealousy how often Juanita Haydock talked of the famous hotels in Chicago She could not face the traveling salesmen baronial in large leather chairs She wanted people to believe that her husband and she were accustomed to luxury and chill elegance she was faintly angry at him for the vulgar way in which after signing the register doctor W P Kennicott wife he bellowed at the clerk Got a nice room with bath for us old man She gazed about haughtily but as she discovered that no one was interested in her she felt foolish and ashamed of her irritation She asserted This silly lobby is too florid and simultaneously she admired it the onyx columns with gilt capitals the crown embroidered velvet curtains at the restaurant door the silk roped alcove where pretty girls perpetually waited for mysterious men the two pound boxes of candy and the variety of magazines at the news stand The hidden orchestra was lively She saw a man who looked like a European diplomat in a loose top coat and a Homburg hat A woman with a broadtail coat a heavy lace veil pearl earrings and a close black hat entered the restaurant Heavens That s the first really smart woman I ve seen in a year Carol exulted She felt metropolitan But as she followed Kennicott to the elevator the coat check girl a confident young woman with cheeks powdered like lime and a blouse low and thin and furiously crimson inspected her and under that supercilious glance Carol was shy again She unconsciously waited for the bellboy to precede her into the elevator When he snorted Go ahead she was mortified He thought she was a hayseed she worried The moment she was in their room with the bellboy safely out of the way she looked critically at Kennicott For the first time in months she really saw him His clothes were too heavy and provincial His decent gray suit made by Nat Hicks of Gopher Prairie might have been of sheet iron it had no distinction of cut no easy grace like the diplomat s Burberry His black shoes were blunt and not well polished His scarf was a stupid brown He needed a shave But she forgot her doubt as she realized the ingenuities of the room She ran about turning on the taps of the bathtub which gushed instead of dribbling like the taps at home snatching the new wash rag out of its envelope of oiled paper trying the rose shaded light between the twin beds pulling out the drawers of the kidney shaped walnut desk to examine the engraved stationery planning to write on it to every one she knew admiring the claret colored velvet armchair and the blue rug testing the ice water tap and squealing happily when the water really did come out cold She flung her arms about Kennicott kissed him Like it old lady It s adorable It s so amusing I love you for bringing me You really are a dear He looked blankly indulgent and yawned and condescended That s a pretty slick arrangement on the radiator so you can adjust it at any temperature you want Must take a big furnace to run this place Gosh I hope Bea remembers to turn off the drafts tonight Under the glass cover of the dressing table was a menu with the most enchanting dishes breast of guinea hen De Vitresse pommes de terre a la Russe meringue Chantilly gateaux Bruxelles Oh let s I m going to have a hot bath and put on my new hat with the wool flowers and let s go down and eat for hours and we ll have a cocktail she chanted While Kennicott labored over ordering it was annoying to see him permit the waiter to be impertinent but as the cocktail elevated her to a bridge among colored stars as the oysters came in not canned oysters in the Gopher Prairie fashion but on the half shell she cried If you only knew how wonderful it is not to have had to plan this dinner and order it at the butcher s and fuss and think about it and then watch Bea cook it I feel so free And to have new kinds of food and different patterns of dishes and linen and not worry about whether the pudding is being spoiled Oh this is a great moment for me IV They had all the experiences of provincials in a metropolis After breakfast Carol bustled to a hair dresser s bought gloves and a blouse and importantly met Kennicott in front of an optician s in accordance with plans laid down revised and verified They admired the diamonds and furs and frosty silverware and mahogany chairs and polished morocco sewing boxes in shop windows and were abashed by the throngs in the department stores and were bullied by a clerk into buying too many shirts for Kennicott and gaped at the clever novelty perfumes just in from New York Carol got three books on the theater and spent an exultant hour in warning herself that she could not afford this rajah silk frock in thinking how envious it would make Juanita Haydock in closing her eyes and buying it Kennicott went from shop to shop earnestly hunting down a felt covered device to keep the windshield of his car clear of rain They dined extravagantly at their hotel at night and next morning sneaked round the corner to economize at a Childs Restaurant They were tired by three in the afternoon and dozed at the motion pictures and said they wished they were back in Gopher Prairie and by eleven in the evening they were again so lively that they went to a Chinese restaurant that was frequented by clerks and their sweethearts on pay days They sat at a teak and marble table eating Eggs Fooyung and listened to a brassy automatic piano and were altogether cosmopolitan On the street they met people from home the McGanums They laughed shook hands repeatedly and exclaimed Well this is quite a coincidence They asked when the McGanums had come down and begged for news of the town they had left two days before Whatever the McGanums were at home here they stood out as so superior to all the undistinguishable strangers absurdly hurrying past that the Kennicotts held them as long as they could The McGanums said good by as though they were going to Tibet instead of to the station to catch No seven north They explored Minneapolis Kennicott was conversational and technical regarding gluten and cockle cylinders and No I Hard when they were shown through the gray stone hulks and new cement elevators of the largest flour mills in the world They looked across Loring Park and the Parade to the towers of saint Mark s and the Procathedral and the red roofs of houses climbing Kenwood Hill They drove about the chain of garden circled lakes and viewed the houses of the millers and lumbermen and real estate peers the potentates of the expanding city They surveyed the small eccentric bungalows with pergolas the houses of pebbledash and tapestry brick with sleeping porches above sun parlors and one vast incredible chateau fronting the Lake of the Isles They tramped through a shining new section of apartment houses not the tall bleak apartments of Eastern cities but low structures of cheerful yellow brick in which each flat had its glass enclosed porch with swinging couch and scarlet cushions and Russian brass bowls Between a waste of tracks and a raw gouged hill they found poverty in staggering shanties They saw miles of the city which they had never known in their days of absorption in college They were distinguished explorers and they remarked in great mutual esteem I bet Harry Haydock s never seen the City like this Why he d never have sense enough to study the machinery in the mills or go through all these outlying districts Wonder folks in Gopher Prairie wouldn t use their legs and explore the way we do They had two meals with Carol s sister and were bored and felt that intimacy which beatifies married people when they suddenly admit that they equally dislike a relative of either of them So it was with affection but also with weariness that they approached the evening on which Carol was to see the plays at the dramatic school Kennicott suggested not going So darn tired from all this walking don t know but what we better turn in early and get rested up It was only from duty that Carol dragged him and herself out of the warm hotel into a stinking trolley up the brownstone steps of the converted residence which lugubriously housed the dramatic school V They were in a long whitewashed hall with a clumsy draw curtain across the front The folding chairs were filled with people who looked washed and ironed parents of the pupils girl students dutiful teachers Strikes me it s going to be punk If the first play isn t good let s beat it said Kennicott hopefully All right she yawned With hazy eyes she tried to read the lists of characters which were hidden among lifeless advertisements of pianos music dealers restaurants candy She regarded the Schnitzler play with no vast interest The actors moved and spoke stiffly Just as its cynicism was beginning to rouse her village dulled frivolity it was over Don t think a whale of a lot of that How about taking a sneak petitioned Kennicott Oh let s try the next one How He Lied to Her Husband The Shaw conceit amused her and perplexed Kennicott Strikes me it s darn fresh Thought it would be racy Don t know as I think much of a play where a husband actually claims he wants a fellow to make love to his wife No husband ever did that Shall we shake a leg I want to see this Yeats thing Land of Heart s Desire I used to love it in college She was awake now and urgent I know you didn t care so much for Yeats when I read him aloud to you but you just see if you don t adore him on the stage Most of the cast were as unwieldy as oak chairs marching and the setting was an arty arrangement of batik scarfs and heavy tables but Maire Bruin was slim as Carol and larger eyed and her voice was a morning bell In her Carol lived and on her lifting voice was transported from this sleepy small town husband and all the rows of polite parents to the stilly loft of a thatched cottage where in a green dimness beside a window caressed by linden branches she bent over a chronicle of twilight women and the ancient gods Well gosh nice kid played that girl good looker said Kennicott Want to stay for the last piece Heh She shivered She did not answer The curtain was again drawn aside On the stage they saw nothing but long green curtains and a leather chair Two young men in brown robes like furniture covers were gesturing vacuously and droning cryptic sentences full of repetitions It was Carol s first hearing of Dunsany She sympathized with the restless Kennicott as he felt in his pocket for a cigar and unhappily put it back Without understanding when or how without a tangible change in the stilted intoning of the stage puppets she was conscious of another time and place Stately and aloof among vainglorious tiring maids a queen in robes that murmured on the marble floor she trod the gallery of a crumbling palace In the courtyard elephants trumpeted and swart men with beards dyed crimson stood with blood stained hands folded upon their hilts guarding the caravan from El Sharnak the camels with Tyrian stuffs of topaz and cinnabar Beyond the turrets of the outer wall the jungle glared and shrieked and the sun was furious above drenched orchids A youth came striding through the steel bossed doors the sword bitten doors that were higher than ten tall men He was in flexible mail and under the rim of his planished morion were amorous curls His hand was out to her before she touched it she could feel its warmth Gosh all hemlock What the dickens is all this stuff about Carrie She was no Syrian queen She was missus doctor Kennicott She fell with a jolt into a whitewashed hall and sat looking at two scared girls and a young man in wrinkled tights Kennicott fondly rambled as they left the hall What the deuce did that last spiel mean Couldn t make head or tail of it If that s highbrow drama give me a cow puncher movie every time Thank God that s over and we can get to bed Wonder if we wouldn t make time by walking over to Nicollet to take a car One thing I will say for that dump they had it warm enough Must have a big hot air furnace I guess Wonder how much coal it takes to run em through the winter In the car he affectionately patted her knee and he was for a second the striding youth in armor then he was Doc Kennicott of Gopher Prairie and she was recaptured by Main Street Never not all her life would she behold jungles and the tombs of kings There were strange things in the world they really existed but she would never see them She would recreate them in plays She would make the dramatic association understand her aspiration They would surely they would She looked doubtfully at the impenetrable reality of yawning trolley conductor and sleepy passengers and placards advertising soap and underwear CHAPTER XVIII I SHE hurried to the first meeting of the play reading committee Her jungle romance had faded but she retained a religious fervor a surge of half formed thought about the creation of beauty by suggestion A Dunsany play would be too difficult for the Gopher Prairie association She would let them compromise on Shaw on Androcles and the Lion which had just been published The committee was composed of Carol Vida Sherwin Guy Pollock Raymie Wutherspoon and Juanita Haydock They were exalted by the picture of themselves as being simultaneously business like and artistic They were entertained by Vida in the parlor of missus Elisha Gurrey s boarding house with its steel engraving of Grant at Appomattox its basket of stereoscopic views and its mysterious stains on the gritty carpet Vida was an advocate of culture buying and efficiency systems She hinted that they ought to have as at the committee meetings of the Thanatopsis a regular order of business and the reading of the minutes but as there were no minutes to read and as no one knew exactly what was the regular order of the business of being literary they had to give up efficiency Carol as chairman said politely Have you any ideas about what play we d better give first She waited for them to look abashed and vacant so that she might suggest Androcles Guy Pollock answered with disconcerting readiness I ll tell you since we re going to try to do something artistic and not simply fool around I believe we ought to give something classic How about The School for Scandal Why Don t you think that has been done a good deal Yes perhaps it has Carol was ready to say How about Bernard Shaw when he treacherously went on How would it be then to give a Greek drama say Oedipus Tyrannus Why I don t believe Vida Sherwin intruded I m sure that would be too hard for us Now I ve brought something that I think would be awfully jolly She held out and Carol incredulously took a thin gray pamphlet entitled McGinerty s Mother in law It was the sort of farce which is advertised in school entertainment catalogues as Riproaring knock out five m three f time two hrs interior set popular with churches and all high class occasions Carol glanced from the scabrous object to Vida and realized that she was not joking But this is this is why it s just a Why Vida I thought you appreciated well appreciated art Vida snorted Oh Art Oh yes I do like art It s very nice But after all what does it matter what kind of play we give as long as we get the association started The thing that matters is something that none of you have spoken of that is what are we going to do with the money if we make any I think it would be awfully nice if we presented the high school with a full set of Stoddard s travel lectures Carol moaned Oh but Vida dear do forgive me but this farce Now what I d like us to give is something distinguished Say Shaw s Androcles Have any of you read it Yes Good play said Guy Pollock Then Raymie Wutherspoon astoundingly spoke up So have I I read through all the plays in the public library so s to be ready for this meeting And But I don t believe you grasp the irreligious ideas in this Androcles missus Kennicott I guess the feminine mind is too innocent to understand all these immoral writers I m sure I don t want to criticize Bernard Shaw I understand he is very popular with the highbrows in Minneapolis but just the same As far as I can make out he s downright improper The things he SAYS Well it would be a very risky thing for our young folks to see It seems to me that a play that doesn t leave a nice taste in the mouth and that hasn t any message is nothing but nothing but Well whatever it may be it isn t art So Now I ve found a play that is clean and there s some awfully funny scenes in it too I laughed out loud reading it It s called His Mother s Heart and it s about a young man in college who gets in with a lot of free thinkers and boozers and everything but in the end his mother s influence Juanita Haydock broke in with a derisive Oh rats Raymie Can the mother s influence I say let s give something with some class to it I bet we could get the rights to The Girl from Kankakee and that s a real show It ran for eleven months in New York That would be lots of fun if it wouldn t cost too much reflected Vida Carol s was the only vote cast against The Girl from Kankakee II She disliked The Girl from Kankakee even more than she had expected It narrated the success of a farm lassie in clearing her brother of a charge of forgery She became secretary to a New York millionaire and social counselor to his wife and after a well conceived speech on the discomfort of having money she married his son There was also a humorous office boy Carol discerned that both Juanita Haydock and Ella Stowbody wanted the lead She let Juanita have it Juanita kissed her and in the exuberant manner of a new star presented to the executive committee her theory What we want in a play is humor and pep There s where American playwrights put it all over these darn old European glooms As selected by Carol and confirmed by the committee the persons of the play were John Grimm a millionaire Guy Pollock His wife Miss Vida Sherwin His son doctor Harvey Dillon His business rival Raymond T Wutherspoon Friend of missus Grimm Miss Ella Stowbody The girl from Kankakee missus Harold C Haydock Her brother doctor Terence Gould Her mother missus David Dyer Stenographer Miss Rita Simons Office boy Miss Myrtle Cass Maid in the Grimms home missus W P Kennicott Direction of missus Kennicott Among the minor lamentations was Maud Dyer s Well of course I suppose I look old enough to be Juanita s mother even if Juanita is eight months older than I am but I don t know as I care to have everybody noticing it and Carol pleaded Oh my DEAR You two look exactly the same age I chose you because you have such a darling complexion and you know with powder and a white wig anybody looks twice her age and I want the mother to be sweet no matter who else is Ella Stowbody the professional perceiving that it was because of a conspiracy of jealousy that she had been given a small part alternated between lofty amusement and Christian patience Carol hinted that the play would be improved by cutting but as every actor except Vida and Guy and herself wailed at the loss of a single line she was defeated She told herself that after all a great deal could be done with direction and settings Sam Clark had boastfully written about the dramatic association to his schoolmate Percy Bresnahan president of the Velvet Motor Company of Boston Bresnahan sent a check for a hundred dollars Sam added twenty five and brought the fund to Carol fondly crying There That ll give you a start for putting the thing across swell She rented the second floor of the city hall for two months All through the spring the association thrilled to its own talent in that dismal room They cleared out the bunting ballot boxes handbills legless chairs They attacked the stage It was a simple minded stage It was raised above the floor and it did have a movable curtain painted with the advertisement of a druggist dead these ten years but otherwise it might not have been recognized as a stage There were two dressing rooms one for men one for women on either side The dressing room doors were also the stage entrances opening from the house and many a citizen of Gopher Prairie had for his first glimpse of romance the bare shoulders of the leading woman There were three sets of scenery a woodland a Poor Interior and a Rich Interior the last also useful for railway stations offices and as a background for the Swedish Quartette from Chicago There were three gradations of lighting full on half on and entirely off This was the only theater in Gopher Prairie It was known as the op ra house Once strolling companies had used it for performances of The Two Orphans and Nellie the Beautiful Cloak Model and Othello with specialties between acts but now the motion pictures had ousted the gipsy drama Carol intended to be furiously modern in constructing the office set the drawing room for mister Grimm and the Humble Home near Kankakee It was the first time that any one in Gopher Prairie had been so revolutionary as to use enclosed scenes with continuous side walls The rooms in the op ra house sets had separate wing pieces for sides which simplified dramaturgy as the villain could always get out of the hero s way by walking out through the wall The inhabitants of the Humble Home were supposed to be amiable and intelligent Carol planned for them a simple set with warm color She could see the beginning of the play all dark save the high settles and the solid wooden table between them which were to be illuminated by a ray from offstage The high light was a polished copper pot filled with primroses Less clearly she sketched the Grimm drawing room as a series of cool high white arches As to how she was to produce these effects she had no notion She discovered that despite the enthusiastic young writers the drama was not half so native and close to the soil as motor cars and telephones She discovered that simple arts require sophisticated training She discovered that to produce one perfect stage picture would be as difficult as to turn all of Gopher Prairie into a Georgian garden She read all she could find regarding staging she bought paint and light wood she borrowed furniture and drapes unscrupulously she made Kennicott turn carpenter She collided with the problem of lighting Against the protest of Kennicott and Vida she mortgaged the association by sending to Minneapolis for a baby spotlight a strip light a dimming device and blue and amber bulbs and with the gloating rapture of a born painter first turned loose among colors she spent absorbed evenings in grouping dimming painting with lights Only Kennicott Guy and Vida helped her They speculated as to how flats could be lashed together to form a wall they hung crocus yellow curtains at the windows they blacked the sheet iron stove they put on aprons and swept The rest of the association dropped into the theater every evening and were literary and superior They had borrowed Carol s manuals of play production and had become extremely stagey in vocabulary Juanita Haydock Rita Simons and Raymie Wutherspoon sat on a sawhorse watching Carol try to get the right position for a picture on the wall in the first scene I don t want to hand myself anything but I believe I ll give a swell performance in this first act confided Juanita I wish Carol wasn t so bossy though She doesn t understand clothes I want to wear oh a dandy dress I have all scarlet and I said to her When I enter wouldn t it knock their eyes out if I just stood there at the door in this straight scarlet thing But she wouldn t let me Young Rita agreed She s so much taken up with her old details and carpentering and everything that she can t see the picture as a whole Now I thought it would be lovely if we had an office scene like the one in Little But Oh My Because I SAW that in Duluth But she simply wouldn t listen at all Juanita sighed I wanted to give one speech like Ethel Barrymore would if she was in a play like this Harry and I heard her one time in Minneapolis we had dandy seats in the orchestra I just know I could imitate her Carol didn t pay any attention to my suggestion I don t want to criticize but I guess Ethel knows more about acting than Carol does Say do you think Carol has the right dope about using a strip light behind the fireplace in the second act I told her I thought we ought to use a bunch offered Raymie And I suggested it would be lovely if we used a cyclorama outside the window in the first act and what do you think she said Yes and it would be lovely to have Eleanora Duse play the lead she said and aside from the fact that it s evening in the first act you re a great technician she said I must say I think she was pretty sarcastic I ve been reading up and I know I could build a cyclorama if she didn t want to run everything Yes and another thing I think the entrance in the first act ought to be L U E not L three E from Juanita And why does she just use plain white tormenters What s a tormenter blurted Rita Simons The savants stared at her ignorance III Carol did not resent their criticisms she didn t very much resent their sudden knowledge so long as they let her make pictures It was at rehearsals that the quarrrels broke No one understood that rehearsals were as real engagements as bridge games or sociables at the Episcopal Church They gaily came in half an hour late or they vociferously came in ten minutes early and they were so hurt that they whispered about resigning when Carol protested They telephoned I don t think I d better come out afraid the dampness might start my toothache or Guess can t make it tonight Dave wants me to sit in on a poker game When after a month of labor as many as nine elevenths of the cast were often present at a rehearsal when most of them had learned their parts and some of them spoke like human beings Carol had a new shock in the realization that Guy Pollock and herself were very bad actors and that Raymie Wutherspoon was a surprisingly good one For all her visions she could not control her voice and she was bored by the fiftieth repetition of her few lines as maid Guy pulled his soft mustache looked self conscious and turned mister Grimm into a limp dummy But Raymie as the villain had no repressions The tilt of his head was full of character his drawl was admirably vicious There was an evening when Carol hoped she was going to make a play a rehearsal during which Guy stopped looking abashed From that evening the play declined They were weary We know our parts well enough now what s the use of getting sick of them they complained They began to skylark to play with the sacred lights to giggle when Carol was trying to make the sentimental Myrtle Cass into a humorous office boy to act everything but The Girl from Kankakee After loafing through his proper part doctor Terry Gould had great applause for his burlesque of Hamlet Even Raymie lost his simple faith and tried to show that he could do a vaudeville shuffle Carol turned on the company See here I want this nonsense to stop We ve simply got to get down to work Juanita Haydock led the mutiny Look here Carol don t be so bossy After all we re doing this play principally for the fun of it and if we have fun out of a lot of monkey shines why then Ye es feebly You said one time that folks in G P didn t get enough fun out of life And now we are having a circus you want us to stop Carol answered slowly I wonder if I can explain what I mean It s the difference between looking at the comic page and looking at Manet I want fun out of this of course Only I don t think it would be less fun but more to produce as perfect a play as we can She was curiously exalted her voice was strained she stared not at the company but at the grotesques scrawled on the backs of wing pieces by forgotten stage hands I wonder if you can understand the fun of making a beautiful thing the pride and satisfaction of it and the holiness The company glanced doubtfully at one another In Gopher Prairie it is not good form to be holy except at a church between ten thirty and twelve on Sunday But if we want to do it we ve got to work we must have self discipline They were at once amused and embarrassed They did not want to affront this mad woman They backed off and tried to rehearse Carol did not hear Juanita in front protesting to Maud Dyer If she calls it fun and holiness to sweat over her darned old play well I don t IV Carol attended the only professional play which came to Gopher Prairie that spring It was a tent show presenting snappy new dramas under canvas The hard working actors doubled in brass and took tickets and between acts sang about the moon in June and sold doctor Wintergreen s Surefire Tonic for Ills of the Heart Lungs Kidneys and Bowels They presented Sunbonnet Nell A Dramatic Comedy of the Ozarks with J Witherbee Boothby wringing the soul by his resonant Yuh ain t done right by mah little gal mister City Man but yer a goin to find that back in these yere hills there s honest folks and good shots The audience on planks beneath the patched tent admired mister Boothby s beard and long rifle stamped their feet in the dust at the spectacle of his heroism shouted when the comedian aped the City Lady s use of a lorgnon by looking through a doughnut stuck on a fork wept visibly over mister Boothby s Little Gal Nell who was also mister Boothby s legal wife Pearl and when the curtain went down listened respectfully to mister Boothby s lecture on doctor Wintergreen s Tonic as a cure for tape worms which he illustrated by horrible pallid objects curled in bottles of yellowing alcohol Carol shook her head Juanita is right I m a fool Holiness of the drama Bernard Shaw The only trouble with The Girl from Kankakee is that it s too subtle for Gopher Prairie She sought faith in spacious banal phrases taken from books the instinctive nobility of simple souls need only the opportunity to appreciate fine things and sturdy exponents of democracy But these optimisms did not sound so loud as the laughter of the audience at the funny man s line Yes by heckelum I m a smart fella She wanted to give up the play the dramatic association the town As she came out of the tent and walked with Kennicott down the dusty spring street she peered at this straggling wooden village and felt that she could not possibly stay here through all of tomorrow It was Miles Bjornstam who gave her strength he and the fact that every seat for The Girl from Kankakee had been sold Bjornstam was keeping company with Bea Every night he was sitting on the back steps Once when Carol appeared he grumbled Hope you re going to give this burg one good show If you don t reckon nobody ever will V It was the great night it was the night of the play The two dressing rooms were swirling with actors panting twitchy pale Del Snafflin the barber who was as much a professional as Ella having once gone on in a mob scene at a stock company performance in Minneapolis was making them up and showing his scorn for amateurs with Stand still For the love o Mike how do you expect me to get your eyelids dark if you keep a wigglin The actors were beseeching Hey Del put some red in my nostrils you put some in Rita s gee you didn t hardly do anything to my face They were enormously theatric They examined Del s makeup box they sniffed the scent of grease paint every minute they ran out to peep through the hole in the curtain they came back to inspect their wigs and costumes they read on the whitewashed walls of the dressing rooms the pencil inscriptions The Flora Flanders Comedy Company and This is a bum theater and felt that they were companions of these vanished troupers Carol smart in maid s uniform coaxed the temporary stage hands to finish setting the first act wailed at Kennicott the electrician Now for heaven s sake remember the change in cue for the ambers in Act Two slipped out to ask Dave Dyer the ticket taker if he could get some more chairs warned the frightened Myrtle Cass to be sure to upset the waste basket when John Grimm called Here you Reddy Del Snafflin s orchestra of piano violin and cornet began to tune up and every one behind the magic line of the proscenic arch was frightened into paralysis Carol wavered to the hole in the curtain There were so many people out there staring so hard In the second row she saw Miles Bjornstam not with Bea but alone He really wanted to see the play It was a good omen Who could tell Perhaps this evening would convert Gopher Prairie to conscious beauty She darted into the women s dressing room roused Maud Dyer from her fainting panic pushed her to the wings and ordered the curtain up It rose doubtfully it staggered and trembled but it did get up without catching this time Then she realized that Kennicott had forgotten to turn off the houselights Some one out front was giggling She galloped round to the left wing herself pulled the switch looked so ferociously at Kennicott that he quaked and fled back missus Dyer was creeping out on the half darkened stage The play was begun And with that instant Carol realized that it was a bad play abominably acted Encouraging them with lying smiles she watched her work go to pieces The settings seemed flimsy the lighting commonplace She watched Guy Pollock stammer and twist his mustache when he should have been a bullying magnate Vida Sherwin as Grimm s timid wife chatter at the audience as though they were her class in high school English Juanita in the leading role defy mister Grimm as though she were repeating a list of things she had to buy at the grocery this morning Ella Stowbody remark I d like a cup of tea as though she were reciting Curfew Shall Not Ring Tonight and doctor Gould making love to Rita Simons squeak My my you are a won erful girl Myrtle Cass as the office boy was so much pleased by the applause of her relatives then so much agitated by the remarks of Cy Bogart in the back row in reference to her wearing trousers that she could hardly be got off the stage Only Raymie was so unsociable as to devote himself entirely to acting That she was right in her opinion of the play Carol was certain when Miles Bjornstam went out after the first act and did not come back VI Between the second and third acts she called the company together and supplicated I want to know something before we have a chance to separate Whether we re doing well or badly tonight it is a beginning But will we take it as merely a beginning How many of you will pledge yourselves to start in with me right away tomorrow and plan for another play to be given in September They stared at her they nodded at Juanita s protest I think one s enough for a while It s going elegant tonight but another play Seems to me it ll be time enough to talk about that next fall Carol I hope you don t mean to hint and suggest we re not doing fine tonight I m sure the applause shows the audience think it s just dandy Then Carol knew how completely she had failed As the audience seeped out she heard B J Gougerling the banker say to Howland the grocer Well I think the folks did splendid just as good as professionals But I don t care much for these plays What I like is a good movie with auto accidents and hold ups and some git to it and not all this talky talk Then Carol knew how certain she was to fail again She wearily did not blame them company nor audience Herself she blamed for trying to carve intaglios in good wholesome jack pine It s the worst defeat of all I m beaten By Main Street I must go on But I can t She was not vastly encouraged by the Gopher Prairie Dauntless would be impossible to distinguish among the actors when all gave such fine account of themselves in difficult roles of this well known New York stage play Guy Pollock as the old millionaire could not have been bettered for his fine impersonation of the gruff old millionaire missus Harry Haydock as the young lady from the West who so easily showed the New York four flushers where they got off was a vision of loveliness and with fine stage presence Miss Vida Sherwin the ever popular teacher in our high school pleased as missus Grimm doctor Gould was well suited in the role of young lover girls you better look out remember the doc is a bachelor The local Four Hundred also report that he is a great hand at shaking the light fantastic tootsies in the dance As the stenographer Rita Simons was pretty as a picture and Miss Ella Stowbody s long and intensive study of the drama and kindred arts in Eastern schools was seen in the fine finish of her part to no one is greater credit to be given than to missus Will Kennicott on whose capable shoulders fell the burden of directing So kindly Carol mused so well meant so neighborly and so confoundedly untrue Is it really my failure or theirs She sought to be sensible she elaborately explained to herself that it was hysterical to condemn Gopher Prairie because it did not foam over the drama Its justification was in its service as a market town for farmers How bravely and generously it did its work forwarding the bread of the world feeding and healing the farmers Then on the corner below her husband s office she heard a farmer holding forth Sure Course I was beaten The shipper and the grocers here wouldn t pay us a decent price for our potatoes even though folks in the cities were howling for em So we says well we ll get a truck and ship em right down to Minneapolis But the commission merchants there were in cahoots with the local shipper here they said they wouldn t pay us a cent more than he would not even if they was nearer to the market Well we found we could get higher prices in Chicago but when we tried to get freight cars to ship there the railroads wouldn t let us have em even though they had cars standing empty right here in the yards There you got it good market and these towns keeping us from it Gus that s the way these towns work all the time They pay what they want to for our wheat but we pay what they want us to for their clothes Stowbody and Dawson foreclose every mortgage they can and put in tenant farmers The Dauntless lies to us about the Nonpartisan League the lawyers sting us the machinery dealers hate to carry us over bad years and then their daughters put on swell dresses and look at us as if we were a bunch of hoboes Man I d like to burn this town Kennicott observed There s that old crank Wes Brannigan shooting off his mouth again Gosh but he loves to hear himself talk They ought to run that fellow out of town VII She felt old and detached through high school commencement week which is the fete of youth in Gopher Prairie through baccalaureate sermon senior Parade junior entertainment commencement address by an Iowa clergyman who asserted that he believed in the virtue of virtuousness and the procession of Decoration Day when the few Civil War veterans followed Champ Perry in his rusty forage cap along the spring powdered road to the cemetery She met Guy she found that she had nothing to say to him Her head ached in an aimless way When Kennicott rejoiced We ll have a great time this summer move down to the lake early and wear old clothes and act natural she smiled but her smile creaked In the prairie heat she trudged along unchanging ways talked about nothing to tepid people and reflected that she might never escape from them She was startled to find that she was using the word escape Then for three years which passed like one curt paragraph she ceased to find anything interesting save the Bjornstams and her baby CHAPTER XIX I IN three years of exile from herself Carol had certain experiences chronicled as important by the Dauntless or discussed by the Jolly Seventeen but the event unchronicled undiscussed and supremely controlling was her slow admission of longing to find her own people II Bea and Miles Bjornstam were married in June a month after The Girl from Kankakee Miles had turned respectable He had renounced his criticisms of state and society he had given up roving as horse trader and wearing red mackinaws in lumber camps he had gone to work as engineer in Jackson Elder s planing mill he was to be seen upon the streets endeavoring to be neighborly with suspicious men whom he had taunted for years Carol was the patroness and manager of the wedding Juanita Haydock mocked You re a chump to let a good hired girl like Bea go Besides How do you know it s a good thing her marrying a sassy bum like this awful Red Swede person Get wise Chase the man off with a mop and hold onto your Svenska while the holding s good Huh Me go to their Scandahoofian wedding Not a chance The other matrons echoed Juanita Carol was dismayed by the casualness of their cruelty but she persisted Miles had exclaimed to her Jack Elder says maybe he ll come to the wedding Gee it would be nice to have Bea meet the Boss as a reg lar married lady Some day I ll be so well off that Bea can play with missus Elder and you Watch us There was an uneasy knot of only nine guests at the service in the unpainted Lutheran Church Carol Kennicott Guy Pollock and the Champ Perrys all brought by Carol Bea s frightened rustic parents her cousin Tina and Pete Miles s ex partner in horse trading a surly hairy man who had bought a black suit and come twelve hundred miles from Spokane for the event Miles continuously glanced back at the church door Jackson Elder did not appear The door did not once open after the awkward entrance of the first guests Miles s hand closed on Bea s arm He had with Carol s help made his shanty over into a cottage with white curtains and a canary and a chintz chair Carol coaxed the powerful matrons to call on Bea They half scoffed half promised to go Bea s successor was the oldish broad silent Oscarina who was suspicious of her frivolous mistress for a month so that Juanita Haydock was able to crow There smarty I told you you d run into the Domestic Problem But Oscarina adopted Carol as a daughter and with her as faithful to the kitchen as Bea had been there was nothing changed in Carol s life III She was unexpectedly appointed to the town library board by Ole Jenson the new mayor The other members were doctor Westlake Lyman Cass Julius Flickerbaugh the attorney Guy Pollock and Martin Mahoney former livery stable keeper and now owner of a garage She was delighted She went to the first meeting rather condescendingly regarding herself as the only one besides Guy who knew anything about books or library methods She was planning to revolutionize the whole system Her condescension was ruined and her humility wholesomely increased when she found the board in the shabby room on the second floor of the house which had been converted into the library not discussing the weather and longing to play checkers but talking about books She discovered that amiable old doctor Westlake read everything in verse and light fiction that Lyman Cass the veal faced bristly bearded owner of the mill had tramped through Gibbon Hume Grote Prescott and the other thick historians that he could repeat pages from them and did When doctor Westlake whispered to her Yes Lym is a very well informed man but he s modest about it she felt uninformed and immodest and scolded at herself that she had missed the human potentialities in this vast Gopher Prairie When doctor Westlake quoted the Paradiso Don Quixote Wilhelm Meister and the Koran she reflected that no one she knew not even her father had read all four She came diffidently to the second meeting of the board She did not plan to revolutionize anything She hoped that the wise elders might be so tolerant as to listen to her suggestions about changing the shelving of the juveniles Yet after four sessions of the library board she was where she had been before the first session She had found that for all their pride in being reading men Westlake and Cass and even Guy had no conception of making the library familiar to the whole town They used it they passed resolutions about it and they left it as dead as Moses Only the Henty books and the Elsie books and the latest optimisms by moral female novelists and virile clergymen were in general demand and the board themselves were interested only in old stilted volumes They had no tenderness for the noisiness of youth discovering great literature If she was egotistic about her tiny learning they were at least as much so regarding theirs And for all their talk of the need of additional library tax none of them was willing to risk censure by battling for it though they now had so small a fund that after paying for rent heat light and Miss Villets s salary they had only a hundred dollars a year for the purchase of books The Incident of the Seventeen Cents killed her none too enduring interest She had come to the board meeting singing with a plan She had made a list of thirty European novels of the past ten years with twenty important books on psychology education and economics which the library lacked She had made Kennicott promise to give fifteen dollars If each of the board would contribute the same they could have the books Lym Cass looked alarmed scratched himself and protested I think it would be a bad precedent for the board members to contribute money uh not that I mind but it wouldn t be fair establish precedent Gracious They don t pay us a cent for our services Certainly can t expect us to pay for the privilege of serving Only Guy looked sympathetic and he stroked the pine table and said nothing The rest of the meeting they gave to a bellicose investigation of the fact that there was seventeen cents less than there should be in the Fund Miss Villets was summoned she spent half an hour in explosively defending herself the seventeen cents were gnawed over penny by penny and Carol glancing at the carefully inscribed list which had been so lovely and exciting an hour before was silent and sorry for Miss Villets and sorrier for herself She was reasonably regular in attendance till her two years were up and Vida Sherwin was appointed to the board in her place but she did not try to be revolutionary In the plodding course of her life there was nothing changed and nothing new IV Kennicott made an excellent land deal but as he told her none of the details she was not greatly exalted or agitated What did agitate her was his announcement half whispered and half blurted half tender and half coldly medical that they ought to have a baby now they could afford it They had so long agreed that perhaps it would be just as well not to have any children for a while yet that childlessness had come to be natural Now she feared and longed and did not know she hesitatingly assented and wished that she had not assented As there appeared no change in their drowsy relations she forgot all about it and life was planless V Idling on the porch of their summer cottage at the lake on afternoons when Kennicott was in town when the water was glazed and the whole air languid she pictured a hundred escapes Fifth Avenue in a snow storm with limousines golden shops a cathedral spire A reed hut on fantastic piles above the mud of a jungle river A suite in Paris immense high grave rooms with lambrequins and a balcony The Enchanted Mesa An ancient stone mill in Maryland at the turn of the road between rocky brook and abrupt hills An upland moor of sheep and flitting cool sunlight A clanging dock where steel cranes unloaded steamers from Buenos Ayres and Tsing tao A Munich concert hall and a famous cellist playing playing to her One scene had a persistent witchery She stood on a terrace overlooking a boulevard by the warm sea She was certain though she had no reason for it that the place was Mentone Along the drive below her swept barouches with a mechanical tlot tlot tlot tlot tlot tlot and great cars with polished black hoods and engines quiet as the sigh of an old man In them were women erect slender enameled and expressionless as marionettes their small hands upon parasols their unchanging eyes always forward ignoring the men beside them tall men with gray hair and distinguished faces Beyond the drive were painted sea and painted sands and blue and yellow pavilions Nothing moved except the gliding carriages and the people were small and wooden spots in a picture drenched with gold and hard bright blues There was no sound of sea or winds no softness of whispers nor of falling petals nothing but yellow and cobalt and staring light and the never changing tlot tlot tlot tlot She startled She whimpered It was the rapid ticking of the clock which had hypnotized her into hearing the steady hoofs No aching color of the sea and pride of supercilious people but the reality of a round bellied nickel alarm clock on a shelf against a fuzzy unplaned pine wall with a stiff gray wash rag hanging above it and a kerosene stove standing below A thousand dreams governed by the fiction she had read drawn from the pictures she had envied absorbed her drowsy lake afternoons but always in the midst of them Kennicott came out from town drew on khaki trousers which were plastered with dry fish scales asked Enjoying yourself and did not listen to her answer And nothing was changed and there was no reason to believe that there ever would be change VI Trains At the lake cottage she missed the passing of the trains She realized that in town she had depended upon them for assurance that there remained a world beyond The railroad was more than a means of transportation to Gopher Prairie It was a new god a monster of steel limbs oak ribs flesh of gravel and a stupendous hunger for freight a deity created by man that he might keep himself respectful to Property as elsewhere he had elevated and served as tribal gods the mines cotton mills motor factories colleges army The East remembered generations when there had been no railroad and had no awe of it but here the railroads had been before time was The towns had been staked out on barren prairie as convenient points for future train halts and back in eighteen sixty and eighteen seventy there had been much profit much opportunity to found aristocratic families in the possession of advance knowledge as to where the towns would arise If a town was in disfavor the railroad could ignore it cut it off from commerce slay it To Gopher Prairie the tracks were eternal verities and boards of railroad directors an omnipotence The smallest boy or the most secluded grandam could tell you whether No thirty two had a hot box last Tuesday whether No seven was going to put on an extra day coach and the name of the president of the road was familiar to every breakfast table Even in this new era of motors the citizens went down to the station to see the trains go through It was their romance their only mystery besides mass at the Catholic Church and from the trains came lords of the outer world traveling salesmen with piping on their waistcoats and visiting cousins from Milwaukee Gopher Prairie had once been a division point The roundhouse and repair shops were gone but two conductors still retained residence and they were persons of distinction men who traveled and talked to strangers who wore uniforms with brass buttons and knew all about these crooked games of con men They were a special caste neither above nor below the Haydocks but apart artists and adventurers The night telegraph operator at the railroad station was the most melodramatic figure in town awake at three in the morning alone in a room hectic with clatter of the telegraph key All night he talked to operators twenty fifty a hundred miles away It was always to be expected that he would be held up by robbers He never was but round him was a suggestion of masked faces at the window revolvers cords binding him to a chair his struggle to crawl to the key before he fainted During blizzards everything about the railroad was melodramatic There were days when the town was completely shut off when they had no mail no express no fresh meat no newspapers At last the rotary snow plow came through bucking the drifts sending up a geyser and the way to the Outside was open again The brakemen in mufflers and fur caps running along the tops of ice coated freight cars the engineers scratching frost from the cab windows and looking out inscrutable self contained pilots of the prairie sea they were heroism they were to Carol the daring of the quest in a world of groceries and sermons To the small boys the railroad was a familiar playground They climbed the iron ladders on the sides of the box cars built fires behind piles of old ties waved to favorite brakemen But to Carol it was magic She was motoring with Kennicott the car lumping through darkness the lights showing mud puddles and ragged weeds by the road A train coming A rapid chuck a chuck chuck a chuck chuck a chuck It was hurling past the Pacific Flyer an arrow of golden flame Light from the fire box splashed the under side of the trailing smoke Instantly the vision was gone Carol was back in the long darkness and Kennicott was giving his version of that fire and wonder No nineteen Must be bout ten minutes late In town she listened from bed to the express whistling in the cut a mile north Uuuuuuu faint nervous distrait horn of the free night riders journeying to the tall towns where were laughter and banners and the sound of bells Uuuuu Uuuuu the world going by Uuuuuuu fainter more wistful gone Down here there were no trains The stillness was very great The prairie encircled the lake lay round her raw dusty thick Only the train could cut it Some day she would take a train and that would be a great taking VII She turned to the Chautauqua as she had turned to the dramatic association to the library board Besides the permanent Mother Chautauqua in New York there are all over these States commercial Chautauqua companies which send out to every smallest town troupes of lecturers and entertainers to give a week of culture under canvas Living in Minneapolis Carol had never encountered the ambulant Chautauqua and the announcement of its coming to Gopher Prairie gave her hope that others might be doing the vague things which she had attempted She pictured a condensed university course brought to the people Mornings when she came in from the lake with Kennicott she saw placards in every shop window and strung on a cord across Main Street a line of pennants alternately worded The Boland Chautauqua COMING and A solid week of inspiration and enjoyment But she was disappointed when she saw the program It did not seem to be a tabloid university it did not seem to be any kind of a university it seemed to be a combination of vaudeville performance Y M C A lecture and the graduation exercises of an elocution class She took her doubt to Kennicott He insisted Well maybe it won t be so awful darn intellectual the way you and I might like it but it s a whole lot better than nothing Vida Sherwin added They have some splendid speakers If the people don t carry off so much actual information they do get a lot of new ideas and that s what counts During the Chautauqua Carol attended three evening meetings two afternoon meetings and one in the morning She was impressed by the audience the sallow women in skirts and blouses eager to be made to think the men in vests and shirt sleeves eager to be allowed to laugh and the wriggling children eager to sneak away She liked the plain benches the portable stage under its red marquee the great tent over all shadowy above strings of incandescent bulbs at night and by day casting an amber radiance on the patient crowd The scent of dust and trampled grass and sun baked wood gave her an illusion of Syrian caravans she forgot the speakers while she listened to noises outside the tent two farmers talking hoarsely a wagon creaking down Main Street the crow of a rooster She was content But it was the contentment of the lost hunter stopping to rest For from the Chautauqua itself she got nothing but wind and chaff and heavy laughter the laughter of yokels at old jokes a mirthless and primitive sound like the cries of beasts on a farm These were the several instructors in the condensed university s seven day course Nine lecturers four of them ex ministers and one an ex congressman all of them delivering inspirational addresses The only facts or opinions which Carol derived from them were Lincoln was a celebrated president of the United States but in his youth extremely poor James J Hill was the best known railroad man of the West and in his youth extremely poor Honesty and courtesy in business are preferable to boorishness and exposed trickery but this is not to be taken personally since all persons in Gopher Prairie are known to be honest and courteous London is a large city A distinguished statesman once taught Sunday School Four entertainers who told Jewish stories Irish stories German stories Chinese stories and Tennessee mountaineer stories most of which Carol had heard A lady elocutionist who recited Kipling and imitated children A lecturer with motion pictures of an Andean exploration excellent pictures and a halting narrative Three brass bands a company of six opera singers a Hawaiian sextette and four youths who played saxophones and guitars disguised as wash boards The most applauded pieces were those such as the Lucia inevitability which the audience had heard most often The local superintendent who remained through the week while the other enlighteners went to other Chautauquas for their daily performances The superintendent was a bookish underfed man who worked hard at rousing artificial enthusiasm at trying to make the audience cheer by dividing them into competitive squads and telling them that they were intelligent and made splendid communal noises He gave most of the morning lectures droning with equal unhappy facility about poetry the Holy Land and the injustice to employers in any system of profit sharing The final item was a man who neither lectured inspired nor entertained a plain little man with his hands in his pockets All the other speakers had confessed I cannot keep from telling the citizens of your beautiful city that none of the talent on this circuit have found a more charming spot or more enterprising and hospitable people But the little man suggested that the architecture of Gopher Prairie was haphazard and that it was sottish to let the lake front be monopolized by the cinder heaped wall of the railroad embankment Afterward the audience grumbled Maybe that guy s got the right dope but what s the use of looking on the dark side of things all the time New ideas are first rate but not all this criticism Enough trouble in life without looking for it Thus the Chautauqua as Carol saw it After it the town felt proud and educated VIII Two weeks later the Great War smote Europe For a month Gopher Prairie had the delight of shuddering then as the war settled down to a business of trench fighting they forgot When Carol talked about the Balkans and the possibility of a German revolution Kennicott yawned Oh yes it s a great old scrap but it s none of our business Folks out here are too busy growing corn to monkey with any fool war that those foreigners want to get themselves into It was Miles Bjornstam who said I can t figure it out I m opposed to wars but still seems like Germany has got to be licked because them Junkers stands in the way of progress She was calling on Miles and Bea early in autumn They had received her with cries with dusting of chairs and a running to fetch water for coffee Miles stood and beamed at her He fell often and joyously into his old irreverence about the lords of Gopher Prairie but always with a certain difficulty he added something decorous and appreciative Lots of people have come to see you haven t they Carol hinted Why Bea s cousin Tina comes in right along and the foreman at the mill and Oh we have good times Say take a look at that Bea Wouldn t you think she was a canary bird to listen to her and to see that Scandahoofian tow head of hers But say know what she is She s a mother hen Way she fusses over me way she makes old Miles wear a necktie Hate to spoil her by letting her hear it but she s one pretty darn nice nice Hell What do we care if none of the dirty snobs come and call We ve got each other Carol worried about their struggle but she forgot it in the stress of sickness and fear For that autumn she knew that a baby was coming that at last life promised to be interesting in the peril of the great change CHAPTER XX I THE baby was coming Each morning she was nauseated chilly bedraggled and certain that she would never again be attractive each twilight she was afraid She did not feel exalted but unkempt and furious The period of daily sickness crawled into an endless time of boredom It became difficult for her to move about and she raged that she who had been slim and light footed should have to lean on a stick and be heartily commented upon by street gossips She was encircled by greasy eyes Every matron hinted Now that you re going to be a mother dearie you ll get over all these ideas of yours and settle down She felt that willy nilly she was being initiated into the assembly of housekeepers with the baby for hostage she would never escape presently she would be drinking coffee and rocking and talking about diapers I could stand fighting them I m used to that But this being taken in being taken as a matter of course I can t stand it and I must stand it She alternately detested herself for not appreciating the kindly women and detested them for their advice lugubrious hints as to how much she would suffer in labor details of baby hygiene based on long experience and total misunderstanding superstitious cautions about the things she must eat and read and look at in prenatal care for the baby s soul and always a pest of simpering baby talk missus Champ Perry bustled in to lend Ben Hur as a preventive of future infant immorality The Widow Bogart appeared trailing pinkish exclamations And how is our lovely ittle muzzy today My ain t it just like they always say being in a Family Way does make the girlie so lovely just like a Madonna Tell me Her whisper was tinged with salaciousness does oo feel the dear itsy one stirring the pledge of love I remember with Cy of course he was so big I do not look lovely missus Bogart My complexion is rotten and my hair is coming out and I look like a potato bag and I think my arches are falling and he isn t a pledge of love and I m afraid he WILL look like us and I don t believe in mother devotion and the whole business is a confounded nuisance of a biological process remarked Carol Then the baby was born without unusual difficulty a boy with straight back and strong legs The first day she hated him for the tides of pain and hopeless fear he had caused she resented his raw ugliness After that she loved him with all the devotion and instinct at which she had scoffed She marveled at the perfection of the miniature hands as noisily as did Kennicott she was overwhelmed by the trust with which the baby turned to her passion for him grew with each unpoetic irritating thing she had to do for him He was named Hugh for her father Hugh developed into a thin healthy child with a large head and straight delicate hair of a faint brown He was thoughtful and casual a Kennicott For two years nothing else existed She did not as the cynical matrons had prophesied give up worrying about the world and other folks babies soon as she got one of her own to fight for The barbarity of that willingness to sacrifice other children so that one child might have too much was impossible to her But she would sacrifice herself She understood consecration she who answered Kennicott s hints about having Hugh christened I refuse to insult my baby and myself by asking an ignorant young man in a frock coat to sanction him to permit me to have him I refuse to subject him to any devil chasing rites If I didn t give my baby MY BABY enough sanctification in those nine hours of hell then he can t get any more out of the Reverend mister Zitterel Well Baptists hardly ever christen kids I was kind of thinking more about Reverend Warren said Kennicott Hugh was her reason for living promise of accomplishment in the future shrine of adoration and a diverting toy I thought I d be a dilettante mother but I m as dismayingly natural as missus Bogart she boasted For two years Carol was a part of the town as much one of Our Young Mothers as missus McGanum Her opinionation seemed dead she had no apparent desire for escape her brooding centered on Hugh While she wondered at the pearl texture of his ear she exulted I feel like an old woman with a skin like sandpaper beside him and I m glad of it He is perfect He shall have everything He sha n t always stay here in Gopher Prairie I wonder which is really the best Harvard or Yale or Oxford II The people who hemmed her in had been brilliantly reinforced by mister and missus Whittier N Smail Kennicott s Uncle Whittier and Aunt Bessie The true Main Streetite defines a relative as a person to whose house you go uninvited to stay as long as you like If you hear that Lym Cass on his journey East has spent all his time visiting in Oyster Center it does not mean that he prefers that village to the rest of New England but that he has relatives there It does not mean that he has written to the relatives these many years nor that they have ever given signs of a desire to look upon him But you wouldn t expect a man to go and spend good money at a hotel in Boston when his own third cousins live right in the same state would you When the Smails sold their creamery in North Dakota they visited mister Smail s sister Kennicott s mother at Lac qui Meurt then plodded on to Gopher Prairie to stay with their nephew They appeared unannounced before the baby was born took their welcome for granted and immediately began to complain of the fact that their room faced north Uncle Whittier and Aunt Bessie assumed that it was their privilege as relatives to laugh at Carol and their duty as Christians to let her know how absurd her notions were They objected to the food to Oscarina s lack of friendliness to the wind the rain and the immodesty of Carol s maternity gowns They were strong and enduring for an hour at a time they could go on heaving questions about her father s income about her theology and about the reason why she had not put on her rubbers when she had gone across the street For fussy discussion they had a rich full genius and their example developed in Kennicott a tendency to the same form of affectionate flaying If Carol was so indiscreet as to murmur that she had a small headache instantly the two Smails and Kennicott were at it Every five minutes every time she sat down or rose or spoke to Oscarina they twanged Is your head better now Where does it hurt Don t you keep hartshorn in the house Didn t you walk too far today Have you tried hartshorn Don t you keep some in the house so it will be handy Does it feel better now How does it feel Do your eyes hurt too What time do you usually get to bed As late as THAT Well How does it feel now In her presence Uncle Whittier snorted at Kennicott Carol get these headaches often Huh Be better for her if she didn t go gadding around to all these bridge whist parties and took some care of herself once in a while They kept it up commenting questioning commenting questioning till her determination broke and she bleated For heaven s SAKE don t dis CUSS it My head s all RIGHT She listened to the Smails and Kennicott trying to determine by dialectics whether the copy of the Dauntless which Aunt Bessie wanted to send to her sister in Alberta ought to have two or four cents postage on it Carol would have taken it to the drug store and weighed it but then she was a dreamer while they were practical people as they frequently admitted So they sought to evolve the postal rate from their inner consciousnesses which combined with entire frankness in thinking aloud was their method of settling all problems The Smails did not believe in all this nonsense about privacy and reticence When Carol left a letter from her sister on the table she was astounded to hear from Uncle Whittier I see your sister says her husband is doing fine You ought to go see her oftener I asked Will and he says you don t go see her very often My You ought to go see her oftener If Carol was writing a letter to a classmate or planning the week s menus she could be certain that Aunt Bessie would pop in and titter Now don t let me disturb you I just wanted to see where you were don t stop I m not going to stay only a second I just wondered if you could possibly have thought that I didn t eat the onions this noon because I didn t think they were properly cooked but that wasn t the reason at all it wasn t because I didn t think they were well cooked I m sure that everything in your house is always very dainty and nice though I do think that Oscarina is careless about some things she doesn t appreciate the big wages you pay her and she is so cranky all these Swedes are so cranky I don t really see why you have a Swede but But that wasn t it I didn t eat them not because I didn t think they weren t cooked proper it was just I find that onions don t agree with me it s very strange ever since I had an attack of biliousness one time I have found that onions either fried onions or raw ones and Whittier does love raw onions with vinegar and sugar on them It was pure affection Carol was discovering that the one thing that can be more disconcerting than intelligent hatred is demanding love She supposed that she was being gracefully dull and standardized in the Smails presence but they scented the heretic and with forward stooping delight they sat and tried to drag out her ludicrous concepts for their amusement They were like the Sunday afternoon mob starting at monkeys in the Zoo poking fingers and making faces and giggling at the resentment of the more dignified race With a loose lipped superior village smile Uncle Whittier hinted What s this I hear about your thinking Gopher Prairie ought to be all tore down and rebuilt Carrie I don t know where folks get these new fangled ideas Lots of farmers in Dakota getting em these days About company operation Think they can run stores better n storekeepers Huh Whit and I didn t need no company operation as long as we was farming triumphed Aunt Bessie Carrie tell your old auntie now don t you ever go to church on Sunday You do go sometimes But you ought to go every Sunday When you re as old as I am you ll learn that no matter how smart folks think they are God knows a whole lot more than they do and then you ll realize and be glad to go and listen to your pastor In the manner of one who has just beheld a two headed calf they repeated that they had never HEARD such funny ideas They were staggered to learn that a real tangible person living in Minnesota and married to their own flesh and blood relation could apparently believe that divorce may not always be immoral that illegitimate children do not bear any special and guaranteed form of curse that there are ethical authorities outside of the Hebrew Bible that men have drunk wine yet not died in the gutter that the capitalistic system of distribution and the Baptist wedding ceremony were not known in the Garden of Eden that mushrooms are as edible as corn beef hash that the word dude is no longer frequently used that there are Ministers of the Gospel who accept evolution that some persons of apparent intelligence and business ability do not always vote the Republican ticket straight that it is not a universal custom to wear scratchy flannels next the skin in winter that a violin is not inherently more immoral than a chapel organ that some poets do not have long hair and that Jews are not always pedlers or pants makers Where does she get all them the ries marveled Uncle Whittier Smail while Aunt Bessie inquired Do you suppose there s many folks got notions like hers My If there are and her tone settled the fact that there were not I just don t know what the world s coming to Patiently more or less Carol awaited the exquisite day when they would announce departure After three weeks Uncle Whittier remarked We kinda like Gopher Prairie Guess maybe we ll stay here We d been wondering what we d do now we ve sold the creamery and my farms So I had a talk with Ole Jenson about his grocery and I guess I ll buy him out and storekeep for a while He did Carol rebelled Kennicott soothed her Oh we won t see much of them They ll have their own house She resolved to be so chilly that they would stay away But she had no talent for conscious insolence They found a house but Carol was never safe from their appearance with a hearty Thought we d drop in this evening and keep you from being lonely Why you ain t had them curtains washed yet Invariably whenever she was touched by the realization that it was they who were lonely they wrecked her pitying affection by comments questions comments advice They immediately became friendly with all of their own race with the Luke Dawsons the Deacon Piersons and missus Bogart and brought them along in the evening Aunt Bessie was a bridge over whom the older women bearing gifts of counsel and the ignorance of experience poured into Carol s island of reserve Aunt Bessie urged the good Widow Bogart Drop in and see Carrie real often Young folks today don t understand housekeeping like we do missus Bogart showed herself perfectly willing to be an associate relative Carol was thinking up protective insults when Kennicott s mother came down to stay with Brother Whittier for two months Carol was fond of missus Kennicott She could not carry out her insults She felt trapped She had been kidnaped by the town She was Aunt Bessie s niece and she was to be a mother She was expected she almost expected herself to sit forever talking of babies cooks embroidery stitches the price of potatoes and the tastes of husbands in the matter of spinach She found a refuge in the Jolly Seventeen She suddenly understood that they could be depended upon to laugh with her at missus Bogart and she now saw Juanita Haydock s gossip not as vulgarity but as gaiety and remarkable analysis Her life had changed even before Hugh appeared She looked forward to the next bridge of the Jolly Seventeen and the security of whispering with her dear friends Maud Dyer and Juanita and missus McGanum She was part of the town Its philosophy and its feuds dominated her III She was no longer irritated by the cooing of the matrons nor by their opinion that diet didn t matter so long as the Little Ones had plenty of lace and moist kisses but she concluded that in the care of babies as in politics intelligence was superior to quotations about pansies She liked best to talk about Hugh to Kennicott Vida and the Bjornstams She was happily domestic when Kennicott sat by her on the floor to watch baby make faces She was delighted when Miles speaking as one man to another admonished Hugh I wouldn t stand them skirts if I was you Come on Join the union and strike Make em give you pants As a parent Kennicott was moved to establish the first child welfare week held in Gopher Prairie Carol helped him weigh babies and examine their throats and she wrote out the diets for mute German and Scandinavian mothers The aristocracy of Gopher Prairie even the wives of the rival doctors took part and for several days there was community spirit and much uplift But this reign of love was overthrown when the prize for Best Baby was awarded not to decent parents but to Bea and Miles Bjornstam The good matrons glared at Olaf Bjornstam with his blue eyes his honey colored hair and magnificent back and they remarked Well missus Kennicott maybe that Swede brat is as healthy as your husband says he is but let me tell you I hate to think of the future that awaits any boy with a hired girl for a mother and an awful irreligious socialist for a pa She raged but so violent was the current of their respectability so persistent was Aunt Bessie in running to her with their blabber that she was embarrassed when she took Hugh to play with Olaf She hated herself for it but she hoped that no one saw her go into the Bjornstam shanty She hated herself and the town s indifferent cruelty when she saw Bea s radiant devotion to both babies alike when she saw Miles staring at them wistfully He had saved money had quit Elder s planing mill and started a dairy on a vacant lot near his shack He was proud of his three cows and sixty chickens and got up nights to nurse them I ll be a big farmer before you can bat an eye I tell you that young fellow Olaf is going to go East to college along with the Haydock kids Uh Lots of folks dropping in to chin with Bea and me now Say Ma Bogart come in one day She was I liked the old lady fine And the mill foreman comes in right along Oh we got lots of friends You bet IV Though the town seemed to Carol to change no more than the surrounding fields there was a constant shifting these three years The citizen of the prairie drifts always westward It may be because he is the heir of ancient migrations and it may be because he finds within his own spirit so little adventure that he is driven to seek it by changing his horizon The towns remain unvaried yet the individual faces alter like classes in college The Gopher Prairie jeweler sells out for no discernible reason and moves on to Alberta or the state of Washington to open a shop precisely like his former one in a town precisely like the one he has left There is except among professional men and the wealthy small permanence either of residence or occupation A man becomes farmer grocer town policeman garageman restaurant owner postmaster insurance agent and farmer all over again and the community more or less patiently suffers from his lack of knowledge in each of his experiments Ole Jenson the grocer and Dahl the butcher moved on to South Dakota and Idaho Luke and missus Dawson picked up ten thousand acres of prairie soil in the magic portable form of a small check book and went to Pasadena to a bungalow and sunshine and cafeterias Chet Dashaway sold his furniture and undertaking business and wandered to Los Angeles where the Dauntless reported Our good friend Chester has accepted a fine position with a real estate firm and his wife has in the charming social circles of the Queen City of the Southwestland that same popularity which she enjoyed in our own society sets Rita Simons was married to Terry Gould and rivaled Juanita Haydock as the gayest of the Young Married Set But Juanita also acquired merit Harry s father died Harry became senior partner in the Bon Ton Store and Juanita was more acidulous and shrewd and cackling than ever She bought an evening frock and exposed her collar bone to the wonder of the Jolly Seventeen and talked of moving to Minneapolis To defend her position against the new missus Terry Gould she sought to attach Carol to her faction by giggling that SOME folks might call Rita innocent but I ve got a hunch that she isn t half as ignorant of things as brides are supposed to be and of course Terry isn t one two three as a doctor alongside of your husband Carol herself would gladly have followed mister Ole Jenson and migrated even to another Main Street flight from familiar tedium to new tedium would have for a time the outer look and promise of adventure She hinted to Kennicott of the probable medical advantages of Montana and Oregon She knew that he was satisfied with Gopher Prairie but it gave her vicarious hope to think of going to ask for railroad folders at the station to trace the maps with a restless forefinger Yet to the casual eye she was not discontented she was not an abnormal and distressing traitor to the faith of Main Street The settled citizen believes that the rebel is constantly in a stew of complaining and hearing of a Carol Kennicott he gasps What an awful person She must be a Holy Terror to live with Glad MY folks are satisfied with things way they are Actually it was not so much as five minutes a day that Carol devoted to lonely desires It is probable that the agitated citizen has within his circle at least one inarticulate rebel with aspirations as wayward as Carol s The presence of the baby had made her take Gopher Prairie and the brown house seriously as natural places of residence She pleased Kennicott by being friendly with the complacent maturity of missus Clark and missus Elder and when she had often enough been in conference upon the Elders new Cadillac car or the job which the oldest Clark boy had taken in the office of the flour mill these topics became important things to follow up day by day With nine tenths of her emotion concentrated upon Hugh she did not criticize shops streets acquaintances this year or two She hurried to Uncle Whittier s store for a package of corn flakes she abstractedly listened to Uncle Whittier s denunciation of Martin Mahoney for asserting that the wind last Tuesday had been south and not southwest she came back along streets that held no surprises nor the startling faces of strangers Thinking of Hugh s teething all the way she did not reflect that this store these drab blocks made up all her background She did her work and she triumphed over winning from the Clarks at five hundred The most considerable event of the two years after the birth of Hugh occurred when Vida Sherwin resigned from the high school and was married Carol was her attendant and as the wedding was at the Episcopal Church all the women wore new kid slippers and long white kid gloves and looked refined For years Carol had been little sister to Vida and had never in the least known to what degree Vida loved her and hated her and in curious strained ways was bound to her CHAPTER XXI I GRAY steel that seems unmoving because it spins so fast in the balanced fly wheel gray snow in an avenue of elms gray dawn with the sun behind it this was the gray of Vida Sherwin s life at thirty six She was small and active and sallow her yellow hair was faded and looked dry her blue silk blouses and modest lace collars and high black shoes and sailor hats were as literal and uncharming as a schoolroom desk but her eyes determined her appearance revealed her as a personage and a force indicated her faith in the goodness and purpose of everything They were blue and they were never still they expressed amusement pity enthusiasm If she had been seen in sleep with the wrinkles beside her eyes stilled and the creased lids hiding the radiant irises she would have lost her potency She was born in a hill smothered Wisconsin village where her father was a prosy minister she labored through a sanctimonious college she taught for two years in an iron range town of blurry faced Tatars and Montenegrins and wastes of ore and when she came to Gopher Prairie its trees and the shining spaciousness of the wheat prairie made her certain that she was in paradise She admitted to her fellow teachers that the schoolbuilding was slightly damp but she insisted that the rooms were arranged so conveniently and then that bust of President McKinley at the head of the stairs it s a lovely art work and isn t it an inspiration to have the brave honest martyr president to think about She taught French English and history and the Sophomore Latin class which dealt in matters of a metaphysical nature called Indirect Discourse and the Ablative Absolute Each year she was reconvinced that the pupils were beginning to learn more quickly She spent four winters in building up the Debating Society and when the debate really was lively one Friday afternoon and the speakers of pieces did not forget their lines she felt rewarded She lived an engrossed useful life and seemed as cool and simple as an apple But secretly she was creeping among fears longing and guilt She knew what it was but she dared not name it She hated even the sound of the word sex When she dreamed of being a woman of the harem with great white warm limbs she awoke to shudder defenseless in the dusk of her room She prayed to Jesus always to the Son of God offering him the terrible power of her adoration addressing him as the eternal lover growing passionate exalted large as she contemplated his splendor Thus she mounted to endurance and surcease By day rattling about in many activities she was able to ridicule her blazing nights of darkness With spurious cheerfulness she announced everywhere I guess I m a born spinster and No one will ever marry a plain schoolma am like me and You men great big noisy bothersome creatures we women wouldn t have you round the place dirtying up nice clean rooms if it wasn t that you have to be petted and guided We just ought to say Scat to all of you But when a man held her close at a dance even when Professor George Edwin Mott patted her hand paternally as they considered the naughtinesses of Cy Bogart she quivered and reflected how superior she was to have kept her virginity In the autumn of nineteen eleven a year before doctor Will Kennicott was married Vida was his partner at a five hundred tournament She was thirty four then Kennicott about thirty six To her he was a superb boyish diverting creature all the heroic qualities in a manly magnificent body They had been helping the hostess to serve the Waldorf salad and coffee and gingerbread They were in the kitchen side by side on a bench while the others ponderously supped in the room beyond Kennicott was masculine and experimental He stroked Vida s hand he put his arm carelessly about her shoulder Don t she said sharply You re a cunning thing he offered patting the back of her shoulder in an exploratory manner While she strained away she longed to move nearer to him He bent over looked at her knowingly She glanced down at his left hand as it touched her knee She sprang up started noisily and needlessly to wash the dishes He helped her He was too lazy to adventure further and too used to women in his profession She was grateful for the impersonality of his talk It enabled her to gain control She knew that she had skirted wild thoughts A month after on a sleighing party under the buffalo robes in the bob sled he whispered You pretend to be a grown up schoolteacher but you re nothing but a kiddie His arm was about her She resisted Don t you like the poor lonely bachelor he yammered in a fatuous way No I don t You don t care for me in the least You re just practising on me You re so mean I m terribly fond of you I m not of you And I m not going to let myself be fond of you either He persistently drew her toward him She clutched his arm Then she threw off the robe climbed out of the sled raced after it with Harry Haydock At the dance which followed the sleigh ride Kennicott was devoted to the watery prettiness of Maud Dyer and Vida was noisily interested in getting up a Virginia Reel Without seeming to watch Kennicott she knew that he did not once look at her That was all of her first love affair He gave no sign of remembering that he was terribly fond She waited for him she reveled in longing and in a sense of guilt because she longed She told herself that she did not want part of him unless he gave her all his devotion she would never let him touch her and when she found that she was probably lying she burned with scorn She fought it out in prayer She knelt in a pink flannel nightgown her thin hair down her back her forehead as full of horror as a mask of tragedy while she identified her love for the Son of God with her love for a mortal and wondered if any other woman had ever been so sacrilegious She wanted to be a nun and observe perpetual adoration She bought a rosary but she had been so bitterly reared as a Protestant that she could not bring herself to use it Yet none of her intimates in the school and in the boarding house knew of her abyss of passion They said she was so optimistic When she heard that Kennicott was to marry a girl pretty young and imposingly from the Cities Vida despaired She congratulated Kennicott carelessly ascertained from him the hour of marriage At that hour sitting in her room Vida pictured the wedding in saint Paul Full of an ecstasy which horrified her she followed Kennicott and the girl who had stolen her place followed them to the train through the evening the night She was relieved when she had worked out a belief that she wasn t really shameful that there was a mystical relation between herself and Carol so that she was vicariously yet veritably with Kennicott and had the right to be She saw Carol during the first five minutes in Gopher Prairie She stared at the passing motor at Kennicott and the girl beside him In that fog world of transference of emotion Vida had no normal jealousy but a conviction that since through Carol she had received Kennicott s love then Carol was a part of her an astral self a heightened and more beloved self She was glad of the girl s charm of the smooth black hair the airy head and young shoulders But she was suddenly angry Carol glanced at her for a quarter second but looked past her at an old roadside barn If she had made the great sacrifice at least she expected gratitude and recognition Vida raged while her conscious schoolroom mind fussily begged her to control this insanity During her first call half of her wanted to welcome a fellow reader of books the other half itched to find out whether Carol knew anything about Kennicott s former interest in herself She discovered that Carol was not aware that he had ever touched another woman s hand Carol was an amusing naive curiously learned child While Vida was most actively describing the glories of the Thanatopsis and complimenting this librarian on her training as a worker she was fancying that this girl was the child born of herself and Kennicott and out of that symbolizing she had a comfort she had not known for months When she came home after supper with the Kennicotts and Guy Pollock she had a sudden and rather pleasant backsliding from devotion She bustled into her room she slammed her hat on the bed and chattered I don t CARE I m a lot like her except a few years older I m light and quick too and I can talk just as well as she can and I m sure Men are such fools I d be ten times as sweet to make love to as that dreamy baby And I AM as good looking But as she sat on the bed and stared at her thin thighs defiance oozed away She mourned No I m not Dear God how we fool ourselves I pretend I m spiritual I pretend my legs are graceful They aren t They re skinny Old maidish I hate it I hate that impertinent young woman A selfish cat taking his love for granted No she s adorable I don t think she ought to be so friendly with Guy Pollock For a year Vida loved Carol longed to and did not pry into the details of her relations with Kennicott enjoyed her spirit of play as expressed in childish tea parties and with the mystic bond between them forgotten was healthily vexed by Carol s assumption that she was a sociological messiah come to save Gopher Prairie This last facet of Vida s thought was the one which after a year was most often turned to the light In a testy way she brooded These people that want to change everything all of a sudden without doing any work make me tired Here I have to go and work for four years picking out the pupils for debates and drilling them and nagging at them to get them to look up references and begging them to choose their own subjects four years to get up a couple of good debates And she comes rushing in and expects in one year to change the whole town into a lollypop paradise with everybody stopping everything else to grow tulips and drink tea And it s a comfy homey old town too She had such an outburst after each of Carol s campaigns for better Thanatopsis programs for Shavian plays for more human schools but she never betrayed herself and always she was penitent Vida was and always would be a reformer a liberal She believed that details could excitingly be altered but that things in general were comely and kind and immutable Carol was without understanding or accepting it a revolutionist a radical and therefore possessed of constructive ideas which only the destroyer can have since the reformer believes that all the essential constructing has already been done After years of intimacy it was this unexpressed opposition more than the fancied loss of Kennicott s love which held Vida irritably fascinated But the birth of Hugh revived the transcendental emotion She was indignant that Carol should not be utterly fulfilled in having borne Kennicott s child She admitted that Carol seemed to have affection and immaculate care for the baby but she began to identify herself now with Kennicott and in this phase to feel that she had endured quite too much from Carol s instability She recalled certain other women who had come from the Outside and had not appreciated Gopher Prairie She remembered the rector s wife who had been chilly to callers and who was rumored throughout the town to have said Re ah ly I cawn t endure this bucolic heartiness in the responses The woman was positively known to have worn handkerchiefs in her bodice as padding oh the town had simply roared at her Of course the rector and she were got rid of in a few months Then there was the mysterious woman with the dyed hair and penciled eyebrows who wore tight English dresses like basques who smelled of stale musk who flirted with the men and got them to advance money for her expenses in a lawsuit who laughed at Vida s reading at a school entertainment and went off owing a hotel bill and the three hundred dollars she had borrowed Vida insisted that she loved Carol but with some satisfaction she compared her to these traducers of the town II Vida had enjoyed Raymie Wutherspoon s singing in the Episcopal choir she had thoroughly reviewed the weather with him at Methodist sociables and in the Bon Ton But she did not really know him till she moved to missus Gurrey s boarding house It was five years after her affair with Kennicott She was thirty nine Raymie perhaps a year younger She said to him and sincerely My You can do anything with your brains and tact and that heavenly voice You were so good in The Girl from Kankakee You made me feel terribly stupid If you d gone on the stage I believe you d be just as good as anybody in Minneapolis But still I m not sorry you stuck to business It s such a constructive career Do you really think so yearned Raymie across the apple sauce It was the first time that either of them had found a dependable intellectual companionship They looked down on Willis Woodford the bank clerk and his anxious babycentric wife the silent Lyman Casses the slangy traveling man and the rest of missus Gurrey s unenlightened guests They sat opposite and they sat late They were exhilarated to find that they agreed in confession of faith People like Sam Clark and Harry Haydock aren t earnest about music and pictures and eloquent sermons and really refined movies but then on the other hand people like Carol Kennicott put too much stress on all this art Folks ought to appreciate lovely things but just the same they got to be practical and they got to look at things in a practical way Smiling passing each other the pressed glass pickle dish seeing missus Gurrey s linty supper cloth irradiated by the light of intimacy Vida and Raymie talked about Carol s rose colored turban Carol s sweetness Carol s new low shoes Carol s erroneous theory that there was no need of strict discipline in school Carol s amiability in the Bon Ton Carol s flow of wild ideas which honestly just simply made you nervous trying to keep track of them About the lovely display of gents shirts in the Bon Ton window as dressed by Raymie about Raymie s offertory last Sunday the fact that there weren t any of these new solos as nice as Jerusalem the Golden and the way Raymie stood up to Juanita Haydock when she came into the store and tried to run things and he as much as told her that she was so anxious to have folks think she was smart and bright that she said things she didn t mean and anyway Raymie was running the shoe department and if Juanita or Harry either didn t like the way he ran things they could go get another man About Vida s new jabot which made her look thirty two Vida s estimate or twenty two Raymie s estimate Vida s plan to have the high school Debating Society give a playlet and the difficulty of keeping the younger boys well behaved on the playground when a big lubber like Cy Bogart acted up so About the picture post card which missus Dawson had sent to missus Cass from Pasadena showing roses growing right outdoors in February the change in time on No four the reckless way doctor Gould always drove his auto the reckless way almost all these people drove their autos the fallacy of supposing that these socialists could carry on a government for as much as six months if they ever did have a chance to try out their theories and the crazy way in which Carol jumped from subject to subject Vida had once beheld Raymie as a thin man with spectacles mournful drawn out face and colorless stiff hair Now she noted that his jaw was square that his long hands moved quickly and were bleached in a refined manner and that his trusting eyes indicated that he had led a clean life She began to call him Ray and to bounce in defense of his unselfishness and thoughtfulness every time Juanita Haydock or Rita Gould giggled about him at the Jolly Seventeen On a Sunday afternoon of late autumn they walked down to Lake Minniemashie Ray said that he would like to see the ocean it must be a grand sight it must be much grander than a lake even a great big lake Vida had seen it she stated modestly she had seen it on a summer trip to Cape Cod Have you been clear to Cape Cod Massachusetts I knew you d traveled but I never realized you d been that far Made taller and younger by his interest she poured out Oh my yes It was a wonderful trip So many points of interest through Massachusetts historical There s Lexington where we turned back the redcoats and Longfellow s home at Cambridge and Cape Cod just everything fishermen and whale ships and sand dunes and everything She wished that she had a little cane to carry He broke off a willow branch My you re strong she said No not very I wish there was a Y M C A here so I could take up regular exercise I used to think I could do pretty good acrobatics if I had a chance I m sure you could You re unusually lithe for a large man Oh no not so very But I wish we had a Y M It would be dandy to have lectures and everything and I d like to take a class in improving the memory I believe a fellow ought to go on educating himself and improving his mind even if he is in business don t you Vida I guess I m kind of fresh to call you Vida I ve been calling you Ray for weeks He wondered why she sounded tart He helped her down the bank to the edge of the lake but dropped her hand abruptly and as they sat on a willow log and he brushed her sleeve he delicately moved over and murmured Oh excuse me accident She stared at the mud browned chilly water the floating gray reeds You look so thoughtful he said She threw out her hands I am Will you kindly tell me what s the use of anything Oh don t mind me I m a moody old hen Tell me about your plan for getting a partnership in the Bon Ton I do think you re right Harry Haydock and that mean old Simons ought to give you one He hymned the old unhappy wars in which he had been Achilles and the mellifluous Nestor yet gone his righteous ways unheeded by the cruel kings Why if I ve told em once I ve told em a dozen times to get in a side line of light weight pants for gents summer wear and of course here they go and let a cheap kike like Rifkin beat them to it and grab the trade right off em and then Harry said you know how Harry is maybe he don t mean to be grouchy but he s such a sore head He gave her a hand to rise If you don t MIND I think a fellow is awful if a lady goes on a walk with him and she can t trust him and he tries to flirt with her and all I m sure you re highly trustworthy she snapped and she sprang up without his aid Then smiling excessively Uh don t you think Carol sometimes fails to appreciate doctor Will s ability III Ray habitually asked her about his window trimming the display of the new shoes the best music for the entertainment at the Eastern Star and though he was recognized as a professional authority on what the town called gents furnishings about his own clothes She persuaded him not to wear the small bow ties which made him look like an elongated Sunday School scholar Once she burst out Ray I could shake you Do you know you re too apologetic You always appreciate other people too much You fuss over Carol Kennicott when she has some crazy theory that we all ought to turn anarchists or live on figs and nuts or something And you listen when Harry Haydock tries to show off and talk about turnovers and credits and things you know lots better than he does Look folks in the eye Glare at em Talk deep You re the smartest man in town if you only knew it You ARE He could not believe it He kept coming back to her for confirmation He practised glaring and talking deep but he circuitously hinted to Vida that when he had tried to look Harry Haydock in the eye Harry had inquired What s the matter with you Raymie Got a pain But afterward Harry had asked about Kantbeatum socks in a manner which Ray felt was somehow different from his former condescension They were sitting on the squat yellow satin settee in the boarding house parlor As Ray reannounced that he simply wouldn t stand it many more years if Harry didn t give him a partnership his gesticulating hand touched Vida s shoulders Oh excuse me he pleaded It s all right Well I think I must be running up to my room Headache she said briefly IV Ray and she had stopped in at Dyer s for a hot chocolate on their way home from the movies that March evening Vida speculated Do you know that I may not be here next year What do you mean With her fragile narrow nails she smoothed the glass slab which formed the top of the round table at which they sat She peeped through the glass at the perfume boxes of black and gold and citron in the hollow table She looked about at shelves of red rubber water bottles pale yellow sponges wash rags with blue borders hair brushes of polished cherry backs She shook her head like a nervous medium coming out of a trance stared at him unhappily demanded Why should I stay here And I must make up my mind Now Time to renew our teaching contracts for next year I think I ll go teach in some other town Everybody here is tired of me I might as well go Before folks come out and SAY they re tired of me I have to decide tonight I might as well Oh no matter Come Let s skip It s late She sprang up ignoring his wail of Vida Wait Sit down Gosh I m flabbergasted Gee Vida She marched out While he was paying his check she got ahead He ran after her blubbering Vida Wait In the shade of the lilacs in front of the Gougerling house he came up with her stayed her flight by a hand on her shoulder Oh don t Don t What does it matter she begged She was sobbing her soft wrinkly lids soaked with tears Who cares for my affection or help I might as well drift on forgotten O Ray please don t hold me Let me go I ll just decide not to renew my contract here and and drift way off His hand was steady on her shoulder She dropped her head rubbed the back of his hand with her cheek They were married in June V They took the Ole Jenson house It s small said Vida but it s got the dearest vegetable garden and I love having time to get near to Nature for once Though she became Vida Wutherspoon technically and though she certainly had no ideals about the independence of keeping her name she continued to be known as Vida Sherwin She had resigned from the school but she kept up one class in English She bustled about on every committee of the Thanatopsis she was always popping into the rest room to make missus Nodelquist sweep the floor she was appointed to the library board to succeed Carol she taught the Senior Girls Class in the Episcopal Sunday School and tried to revive the King s Daughters She exploded into self confidence and happiness her draining thoughts were by marriage turned into energy She became daily and visibly more plump and though she chattered as eagerly she was less obviously admiring of marital bliss less sentimental about babies sharper in demanding that the entire town share her reforms the purchase of a park the compulsory cleaning of back yards She penned Harry Haydock at his desk in the Bon Ton she interrupted his joking she told him that it was Ray who had built up the shoe department and men s department she demanded that he be made a partner Before Harry could answer she threatened that Ray and she would start a rival shop I ll clerk behind the counter myself and a Certain Party is all ready to put up the money She rather wondered who the Certain Party was Ray was made a one sixth partner He became a glorified floor walker greeting the men with new poise no longer coyly subservient to pretty women When he was not affectionately coercing people into buying things they did not need he stood at the back of the store glowing abstracted feeling masculine as he recalled the tempestuous surprises of love revealed by Vida The only remnant of Vida s identification of herself with Carol was a jealousy when she saw Kennicott and Ray together and reflected that some people might suppose that Kennicott was his superior She was sure that Carol thought so and she wanted to shriek You needn t try to gloat I wouldn t have your pokey old husband He hasn t one single bit of Ray s spiritual nobility CHAPTER XXII I THE greatest mystery about a human being is not his reaction to sex or praise but the manner in which he contrives to put in twenty four hours a day It is this which puzzles the long shoreman about the clerk the Londoner about the bushman It was this which puzzled Carol in regard to the married Vida Carol herself had the baby a larger house to care for all the telephone calls for Kennicott when he was away and she read everything while Vida was satisfied with newspaper headlines But after detached brown years in boarding houses Vida was hungry for housework for the most pottering detail of it She had no maid nor wanted one She cooked baked swept washed supper cloths with the triumph of a chemist in a new laboratory To her the hearth was veritably the altar When she went shopping she hugged the cans of soup and she bought a mop or a side of bacon as though she were preparing for a reception She knelt beside a bean sprout and crooned I raised this with my own hands I brought this new life into the world I love her for being so happy Carol brooded I ought to be that way I worship the baby but the housework Oh I suppose I m fortunate so much better off than farm women on a new clearing or people in a slum It has not yet been recorded that any human being has gained a very large or permanent contentment from meditation upon the fact that he is better off than others In Carol s own twenty four hours a day she got up dressed the baby had breakfast talked to Oscarina about the day s shopping put the baby on the porch to play went to the butcher s to choose between steak and pork chops bathed the baby nailed up a shelf had dinner put the baby to bed for a nap paid the iceman read for an hour took the baby out for a walk called on Vida had supper put the baby to bed darned socks listened to Kennicott s yawning comment on what a fool doctor McGanum was to try to use that cheap X ray outfit of his on an epithelioma repaired a frock drowsily heard Kennicott stoke the furnace tried to read a page of Thorstein Veblen and the day was gone Except when Hugh was vigorously naughty or whiney or laughing or saying I like my chair with thrilling maturity she was always enfeebled by loneliness She no longer felt superior about that misfortune She would gladly have been converted to Vida s satisfaction in Gopher Prairie and mopping the floor II Carol drove through an astonishing number of books from the public library and from city shops Kennicott was at first uncomfortable over her disconcerting habit of buying them A book was a book and if you had several thousand of them right here in the library free why the dickens should you spend your good money After worrying about it for two or three years he decided that this was one of the Funny Ideas which she had caught as a librarian and from which she would never entirely recover The authors whom she read were most of them frightfully annoyed by the Vida Sherwins They were young American sociologists young English realists Russian horrorists Anatole France Rolland Nexo Wells Shaw Key Edgar Lee Masters Theodore Dreiser Sherwood Anderson Henry Mencken and all the other subversive philosophers and artists whom women were consulting everywhere in batik curtained studios in New York in Kansas farmhouses San Francisco drawing rooms Alabama schools for negroes From them she got the same confused desire which the million other women felt the same determination to be class conscious without discovering the class of which she was to be conscious Certainly her reading precipitated her observations of Main Street of Gopher Prairie and of the several adjacent Gopher Prairies which she had seen on drives with Kennicott In her fluid thought certain convictions appeared jaggedly a fragment of an impression at a time while she was going to sleep or manicuring her nails or waiting for Kennicott These convictions she presented to Vida Sherwin Vida Wutherspoon beside a radiator over a bowl of not very good walnuts and pecans from Uncle Whittier s grocery on an evening when both Kennicott and Raymie had gone out of town with the other officers of the Ancient and Affiliated Order of Spartans to inaugurate a new chapter at Wakamin Vida had come to the house for the night She helped in putting Hugh to bed sputtering the while about his soft skin Then they talked till midnight What Carol said that evening what she was passionately thinking was also emerging in the minds of women in ten thousand Gopher Prairies Her formulations were not pat solutions but visions of a tragic futility She did not utter them so compactly that they can be given in her words they were roughened with Well you see and if you get what I mean and I don t know that I m making myself clear But they were definite enough and indignant enough III In reading popular stories and seeing plays asserted Carol she had found only two traditions of the American small town The first tradition repeated in scores of magazines every month is that the American village remains the one sure abode of friendship honesty and clean sweet marriageable girls Therefore all men who succeed in painting in Paris or in finance in New York at last become weary of smart women return to their native towns assert that cities are vicious marry their childhood sweethearts and presumably joyously abide in those towns until death The other tradition is that the significant features of all villages are whiskers iron dogs upon lawns gold bricks checkers jars of gilded cat tails and shrewd comic old men who are known as hicks and who ejaculate Waal I swan This altogether admirable tradition rules the vaudeville stage facetious illustrators and syndicated newspaper humor but out of actual life it passed forty years ago Carol s small town thinks not in hoss swapping but in cheap motor cars telephones ready made clothes silos alfalfa kodaks phonographs leather upholstered Morris chairs bridge prizes oil stocks motion pictures land deals unread sets of Mark Twain and a chaste version of national politics With such a small town life a Kennicott or a Champ Perry is content but there are also hundreds of thousands particularly women and young men who are not at all content The more intelligent young people and the fortunate widows flee to the cities with agility and despite the fictional tradition resolutely stay there seldom returning even for holidays The most protesting patriots of the towns leave them in old age if they can afford it and go to live in California or in the cities The reason Carol insisted is not a whiskered rusticity It is nothing so amusing It is an unimaginatively standardized background a sluggishness of speech and manners a rigid ruling of the spirit by the desire to appear respectable It is contentment the contentment of the quiet dead who are scornful of the living for their restless walking It is negation canonized as the one positive virtue It is the prohibition of happiness It is slavery self sought and self defended It is dullness made God A savorless people gulping tasteless food and sitting afterward coatless and thoughtless in rocking chairs prickly with inane decorations listening to mechanical music saying mechanical things about the excellence of Ford automobiles and viewing themselves as the greatest race in the world IV She had inquired as to the effect of this dominating dullness upon foreigners She remembered the feeble exotic quality to be found in the first generation Scandinavians she recalled the Norwegian Fair at the Lutheran Church to which Bea had taken her There in the bondestue the replica of a Norse farm kitchen pale women in scarlet jackets embroidered with gold thread and colored beads in black skirts with a line of blue green striped aprons and ridged caps very pretty to set off a fresh face had served rommegrod og lefse sweet cakes and sour milk pudding spiced with cinnamon For the first time in Gopher Prairie Carol had found novelty She had reveled in the mild foreignness of it But she saw these Scandinavian women zealously exchanging their spiced puddings and red jackets for fried pork chops and congealed white blouses trading the ancient Christmas hymns of the fjords for She s My Jazzland Cutie being Americanized into uniformity and in less than a generation losing in the grayness whatever pleasant new customs they might have added to the life of the town Their sons finished the process In ready made clothes and ready made high school phrases they sank into propriety and the sound American customs had absorbed without one trace of pollution another alien invasion And along with these foreigners she felt herself being ironed into glossy mediocrity and she rebelled in fear The respectability of the Gopher Prairies said Carol is reinforced by vows of poverty and chastity in the matter of knowledge Except for half a dozen in each town the citizens are proud of that achievement of ignorance which it is so easy to come by To be intellectual or artistic or in their own word to be highbrow is to be priggish and of dubious virtue Large experiments in politics and in company operative distribution ventures requiring knowledge courage and imagination do originate in the West and Middlewest but they are not of the towns they are of the farmers If these heresies are supported by the townsmen it is only by occasional teachers doctors lawyers the labor unions and workmen like Miles Bjornstam who are punished by being mocked as cranks as half baked parlor socialists The editor and the rector preach at them The cloud of serene ignorance submerges them in unhappiness and futility V Here Vida observed Yes well Do you know I ve always thought that Ray would have made a wonderful rector He has what I call an essentially religious soul My He d have read the service beautifully I suppose it s too late now but as I tell him he can also serve the world by selling shoes and I wonder if we oughtn t to have family prayers VI Doubtless all small towns in all countries in all ages Carol admitted have a tendency to be not only dull but mean bitter infested with curiosity In France or Tibet quite as much as in Wyoming or Indiana these timidities are inherent in isolation But a village in a country which is taking pains to become altogether standardized and pure which aspires to succeed Victorian England as the chief mediocrity of the world is no longer merely provincial no longer downy and restful in its leaf shadowed ignorance It is a force seeking to dominate the earth to drain the hills and sea of color to set Dante at boosting Gopher Prairie and to dress the high gods in Klassy Kollege Klothes Sure of itself it bullies other civilizations as a traveling salesman in a brown derby conquers the wisdom of China and tacks advertisements of cigarettes over arches for centuries dedicate to the sayings of Confucius Such a society functions admirably in the large production of cheap automobiles dollar watches and safety razors But it is not satisfied until the entire world also admits that the end and joyous purpose of living is to ride in flivvers to make advertising pictures of dollar watches and in the twilight to sit talking not of love and courage but of the convenience of safety razors And such a society such a nation is determined by the Gopher Prairies The greatest manufacturer is but a busier Sam Clark and all the rotund senators and presidents are village lawyers and bankers grown nine feet tall Though a Gopher Prairie regards itself as a part of the Great World compares itself to Rome and Vienna it will not acquire the scientific spirit the international mind which would make it great It picks at information which will visibly procure money or social distinction Its conception of a community ideal is not the grand manner the noble aspiration the fine aristocratic pride but cheap labor for the kitchen and rapid increase in the price of land It plays at cards on greasy oil cloth in a shanty and does not know that prophets are walking and talking on the terrace If all the provincials were as kindly as Champ Perry and Sam Clark there would be no reason for desiring the town to seek great traditions It is the Harry Haydocks the Dave Dyers the Jackson Elders small busy men crushingly powerful in their common purpose viewing themselves as men of the world but keeping themselves men of the cash register and the comic film who make the town a sterile oligarchy VII She had sought to be definite in analyzing the surface ugliness of the Gopher Prairies She asserted that it is a matter of universal similarity of flimsiness of construction so that the towns resemble frontier camps of neglect of natural advantages so that the hills are covered with brush the lakes shut off by railroads and the creeks lined with dumping grounds of depressing sobriety of color rectangularity of buildings and excessive breadth and straightness of the gashed streets so that there is no escape from gales and from sight of the grim sweep of land nor any windings to coax the loiterer along while the breadth which would be majestic in an avenue of palaces makes the low shabby shops creeping down the typical Main Street the more mean by comparison The universal similarity that is the physical expression of the philosophy of dull safety Nine tenths of the American towns are so alike that it is the completest boredom to wander from one to another Always west of Pittsburg and often east of it there is the same lumber yard the same railroad station the same Ford garage the same creamery the same box like houses and two story shops The new more conscious houses are alike in their very attempts at diversity the same bungalows the same square houses of stucco or tapestry brick The shops show the same standardized nationally advertised wares the newspapers of sections three thousand miles apart have the same syndicated features the boy in Arkansas displays just such a flamboyant ready made suit as is found on just such a boy in Delaware both of them iterate the same slang phrases from the same sporting pages and if one of them is in college and the other is a barber no one may surmise which is which If Kennicott were snatched from Gopher Prairie and instantly conveyed to a town leagues away he would not realize it He would go down apparently the same Main Street almost certainly it would be called Main Street in the same drug store he would see the same young man serving the same ice cream soda to the same young woman with the same magazines and phonograph records under her arm Not till he had climbed to his office and found another sign on the door another doctor Kennicott inside would he understand that something curious had presumably happened Finally behind all her comments Carol saw the fact that the prairie towns no more exist to serve the farmers who are their reason of existence than do the great capitals they exist to fatten on the farmers to provide for the townsmen large motors and social preferment and unlike the capitals they do not give to the district in return for usury a stately and permanent center but only this ragged camp It is a parasitic Greek civilization minus the civilization There we are then said Carol The remedy Is there any Criticism perhaps for the beginning of the beginning Oh there s nothing that attacks the Tribal God Mediocrity that doesn t help a little and probably there s nothing that helps very much Perhaps some day the farmers will build and own their market towns Think of the club they could have But I m afraid I haven t any reform program Not any more The trouble is spiritual and no League or Party can enact a preference for gardens rather than dumping grounds There s my confession WELL In other words all you want is perfection Yes Why not How you hate this place How can you expect to do anything with it if you haven t any sympathy But I have And affection Or else I wouldn t fume so I ve learned that Gopher Prairie isn t just an eruption on the prairie as I thought first but as large as New York In New York I wouldn t know more than forty or fifty people and I know that many here Go on Say what you re thinking Well my dear if I DID take all your notions seriously it would be pretty discouraging Imagine how a person would feel after working hard for years and helping to build up a nice town to have you airily flit in and simply say Rotten Think that s fair Why not It must be just as discouraging for the Gopher Prairieite to see Venice and make comparisons It would not I imagine gondolas are kind of nice to ride in but we ve got better bath rooms But My dear you re not the only person in this town who has done some thinking for herself although pardon my rudeness I m afraid you think so I ll admit we lack some things Maybe our theater isn t as good as shows in Paris All right I don t want to see any foreign culture suddenly forced on us whether it s street planning or table manners or crazy communistic ideas Vida sketched what she termed practical things that will make a happier and prettier town but that do belong to our life that actually are being done Of the Thanatopsis Club she spoke of the rest room the fight against mosquitos the campaign for more gardens and shade trees and sewers matters not fantastic and nebulous and distant but immediate and sure Carol s answer was fantastic and nebulous enough Yes Yes I know They re good But if I could put through all those reforms at once I d still want startling exotic things Life is comfortable and clean enough here already And so secure What it needs is to be less secure more eager The civic improvements which I d like the Thanatopsis to advocate are Strindberg plays and classic dancers exquisite legs beneath tulle and I can see him so clearly a thick black bearded cynical Frenchman who would sit about and drink and sing opera and tell bawdy stories and laugh at our proprieties and quote Rabelais and not be ashamed to kiss my hand Huh Not sure about the rest of it but I guess that s what you and all the other discontented young women really want some stranger kissing your hand At Carol s gasp the old squirrel like Vida darted out and cried Oh my dear don t take that too seriously I just meant I know You just meant it Go on Be good for my soul Isn t it funny here we all are me trying to be good for Gopher Prairie s soul and Gopher Prairie trying to be good for my soul What are my other sins Oh there s plenty of them Possibly some day we shall have your fat cynical Frenchman horrible sneering tobacco stained object ruining his brains and his digestion with vile liquor but thank heaven for a while we ll manage to keep busy with our lawns and pavements You see these things really are coming The Thanatopsis is getting somewhere And you Her tone italicized the words to my great disappointment are doing less not more than the people you laugh at Sam Clark on the school board is working for better school ventilation Ella Stowbody whose elocuting you always think is so absurd has persuaded the railroad to share the expense of a parked space at the station to do away with that vacant lot You sneer so easily I m sorry but I do think there s something essentially cheap in your attitude Especially about religion If you must know you re not a sound reformer at all You re an impossibilist And you give up too easily You gave up on the new city hall the anti fly campaign club papers the library board the dramatic association just because we didn t graduate into Ibsen the very first thing You want perfection all at once Do you know what the finest thing you ve done is aside from bringing Hugh into the world It was the help you gave doctor Will during baby welfare week You didn t demand that each baby be a philosopher and artist before you weighed him as you do with the rest of us And now I m afraid perhaps I ll hurt you We re going to have a new schoolbuilding in this town in just a few years and we ll have it without one bit of help or interest from you Professor Mott and I and some others have been dinging away at the moneyed men for years We didn t call on you because you would never stand the pound pound pounding year after year without one bit of encouragement And we ve won I ve got the promise of everybody who counts that just as soon as war conditions permit they ll vote the bonds for the schoolhouse And we ll have a wonderful building lovely brown brick with big windows and agricultural and manual training departments When we get it that ll be my answer to all your theories I m glad And I m ashamed I haven t had any part in getting it But Please don t think I m unsympathetic if I ask one question Will the teachers in the hygienic new building go on informing the children that Persia is a yellow spot on the map and Caesar the title of a book of grammatical puzzles VIII Vida was indignant Carol was apologetic they talked for another hour the eternal Mary and Martha an immoralist Mary and a reformist Martha It was Vida who conquered The fact that she had been left out of the campaign for the new schoolbuilding disconcerted Carol She laid her dreams of perfection aside When Vida asked her to take charge of a group of Camp Fire Girls she obeyed and had definite pleasure out of the Indian dances and ritual and costumes She went more regularly to the Thanatopsis With Vida as lieutenant and unofficial commander she campaigned for a village nurse to attend poor families raised the fund herself saw to it that the nurse was young and strong and amiable and intelligent Yet all the while she beheld the burly cynical Frenchman and the diaphanous dancers as clearly as the child sees its air born playmates she relished the Camp Fire Girls not because in Vida s words this Scout training will help so much to make them Good Wives but because she hoped that the Sioux dances would bring subversive color into their dinginess She helped Ella Stowbody to set out plants in the tiny triangular park at the railroad station she squatted in the dirt with a small curved trowel and the most decorous of gardening gauntlets she talked to Ella about the public spiritedness of fuchsias and cannas and she felt that she was scrubbing a temple deserted by the gods and empty even of incense and the sound of chanting Passengers looking from trains saw her as a village woman of fading prettiness incorruptible virtue and no abnormalities the baggageman heard her say Oh yes I do think it will be a good example for the children and all the while she saw herself running garlanded through the streets of Babylon Planting led her to botanizing She never got much farther than recognizing the tiger lily and the wild rose but she rediscovered Hugh What does the buttercup say mummy he cried his hand full of straggly grasses his cheek gilded with pollen She knelt to embrace him she affirmed that he made life more than full she was altogether reconciled for an hour But she awoke at night to hovering death She crept away from the hump of bedding that was Kennicott tiptoed into the bathroom and by the mirror in the door of the medicine cabinet examined her pallid face Wasn t she growing visibly older in ratio as Vida grew plumper and younger Wasn t her nose sharper Wasn t her neck granulated She stared and choked She was only thirty But the five years since her marriage had they not gone by as hastily and stupidly as though she had been under ether would time not slink past till death She pounded her fist on the cool enameled rim of the bathtub and raged mutely against the indifferent gods I don t care I won t endure it They lie so Vida and Will and Aunt Bessie they tell me I ought to be satisfied with Hugh and a good home and planting seven nasturtiums in a station garden I am I When I die the world will be annihilated as far as I m concerned I am I I m not content to leave the sea and the ivory towers to others I want them for me Damn Vida Damn all of them Do they think they can make me believe that a display of potatoes at Howland Gould s is enough beauty and strangeness CHAPTER XXIII I WHEN America entered the Great European War Vida sent Raymie off to an officers training camp less than a year after her wedding Raymie was diligent and rather strong He came out a first lieutenant of infantry and was one of the earliest sent abroad Carol grew definitely afraid of Vida as Vida transferred the passion which had been released in marriage to the cause of the war as she lost all tolerance When Carol was touched by the desire for heroism in Raymie and tried tactfully to express it Vida made her feel like an impertinent child By enlistment and draft the sons of Lyman Cass Nat Hicks Sam Clark joined the army But most of the soldiers were the sons of German and Swedish farmers unknown to Carol doctor Terry Gould and doctor McGanum became captains in the medical corps and were stationed at camps in Iowa and Georgia They were the only officers besides Raymie from the Gopher Prairie district Kennicott wanted to go with them but the several doctors of the town forgot medical rivalry and meeting in council decided that he would do better to wait and keep the town well till he should be needed Kennicott was forty two now the only youngish doctor left in a radius of eighteen miles Old doctor Westlake who loved comfort like a cat protestingly rolled out at night for country calls and hunted through his collar box for his G A R button Carol did not quite know what she thought about Kennicott s going Certainly she was no Spartan wife She knew that he wanted to go she knew that this longing was always in him behind his unchanged trudging and remarks about the weather She felt for him an admiring affection and she was sorry that she had nothing more than affection Cy Bogart was the spectacular warrior of the town Cy was no longer the weedy boy who had sat in the loft speculating about Carol s egotism and the mysteries of generation He was nineteen now tall broad busy the town sport famous for his ability to drink beer to shake dice to tell undesirable stories and from his post in front of Dyer s drug store to embarrass the girls by jollying them as they passed His face was at once peach bloomed and pimply Cy was to be heard publishing it abroad that if he couldn t get the Widow Bogart s permission to enlist he d run away and enlist without it He shouted that he hated every dirty Hun by gosh if he could just poke a bayonet into one big fat Heinie and learn him some decency and democracy he d die happy Cy got much reputation by whipping a farmboy named Adolph Pochbauer for being a damn hyphenated German This was the younger Pochbauer who was killed in the Argonne while he was trying to bring the body of his Yankee captain back to the lines At this time Cy Bogart was still dwelling in Gopher Prairie and planning to go to war II Everywhere Carol heard that the war was going to bring a basic change in psychology to purify and uplift everything from marital relations to national politics and she tried to exult in it Only she did not find it She saw the women who made bandages for the Red Cross giving up bridge and laughing at having to do without sugar but over the surgical dressings they did not speak of God and the souls of men but of Miles Bjornstam s impudence of Terry Gould s scandalous carryings on with a farmer s daughter four years ago of cooking cabbage and of altering blouses Their references to the war touched atrocities only She herself was punctual and efficient at making dressings but she could not like missus Lyman Cass and missus Bogart fill the dressings with hate for enemies When she protested to Vida The young do the work while these old ones sit around and interrupt us and gag with hate because they re too feeble to do anything but hate then Vida turned on her If you can t be reverent at least don t be so pert and opinionated now when men and women are dying Some of us we have given up so much and we re glad to At least we expect that you others sha n t try to be witty at our expense There was weeping Carol did desire to see the Prussian autocracy defeated she did persuade herself that there were no autocracies save that of Prussia she did thrill to motion pictures of troops embarking in New York and she was uncomfortable when she met Miles Bjornstam on the street and he croaked How s tricks Things going fine with me got two new cows Well have you become a patriot Eh Sure they ll bring democracy the democracy of death Yes sure in every war since the Garden of Eden the workmen have gone out to fight each other for perfectly good reasons handed to them by their bosses Now me I m wise I m so wise that I know I don t know anything about the war It was not a thought of the war that remained with her after Miles s declamation but a perception that she and Vida and all of the good intentioners who wanted to do something for the common people were insignificant because the common people were able to do things for themselves and highly likely to as soon as they learned the fact The conception of millions of workmen like Miles taking control frightened her and she scuttled rapidly away from the thought of a time when she might no longer retain the position of Lady Bountiful to the Bjornstams and Beas and Oscarinas whom she loved and patronized III It was in June two months after America s entrance into the war that the momentous event happened the visit of the great Percy Bresnahan the millionaire president of the Velvet Motor Car Company of Boston the one native son who was always to be mentioned to strangers For two weeks there were rumors Sam Clark cried to Kennicott Say I hear Perce Bresnahan is coming By golly it ll be great to see the old scout eh Finally the Dauntless printed on the front page with a No one head a letter from Bresnahan to Jackson Elder DEAR JACK Well Jack I find I can make it I m to go to Washington as a dollar a year man for the government in the aviation motor section and tell them how much I don t know about carburetors But before I start in being a hero I want to shoot out and catch me a big black bass and cuss out you and Sam Clark and Harry Haydock and Will Kennicott and the rest of you pirates I ll land in G P on June seven on No seven from Mpls Shake a day day Tell Bert Tybee to save me a glass of beer Sincerely yours Perce All members of the social financial scientific literary and sporting sets were at No seven to meet Bresnahan missus Lyman Cass was beside Del Snafflin the barber and Juanita Haydock almost cordial to Miss Villets the librarian Carol saw Bresnahan laughing down at them from the train vestibule big immaculate overjawed with the eye of an executive In the voice of the professional Good Fellow he bellowed Howdy folks As she was introduced to him not he to her Bresnahan looked into her eyes and his hand shake was warm unhurried He declined the offers of motors he walked off his arm about the shoulder of Nat Hicks the sporting tailor with the elegant Harry Haydock carrying one of his enormous pale leather bags Del Snafflin the other Jack Elder bearing an overcoat and Julius Flickerbaugh the fishing tackle Carol noted that though Bresnahan wore spats and a stick no small boy jeered She decided I must have Will get a double breasted blue coat and a wing collar and a dotted bow tie like his That evening when Kennicott was trimming the grass along the walk with sheep shears Bresnahan rolled up alone He was now in corduroy trousers khaki shirt open at the throat a white boating hat and marvelous canvas and leather shoes On the job there old Will Say my Lord this is living to come back and get into a regular man sized pair of pants They can talk all they want to about the city but my idea of a good time is to loaf around and see you boys and catch a gamey bass He hustled up the walk and blared at Carol Where s that little fellow I hear you ve got one fine big he boy that you re holding out on me He s gone to bed rather briefly I know And rules are rules these days Kids get routed through the shop like a motor But look here sister I m one great hand at busting rules Come on now let Uncle Perce have a look at him Please now sister He put his arm about her waist it was a large strong sophisticated arm and very agreeable he grinned at her with a devastating knowingness while Kennicott glowed inanely She flushed she was alarmed by the ease with which the big city man invaded her guarded personality She was glad in retreat to scamper ahead of the two men up stairs to the hall room in which Hugh slept All the way Kennicott muttered Well well say gee whittakers but it s good to have you back certainly is good to see you Hugh lay on his stomach making an earnest business of sleeping He burrowed his eyes in the dwarf blue pillow to escape the electric light then sat up abruptly small and frail in his woolly nightdrawers his floss of brown hair wild the pillow clutched to his breast He wailed He stared at the stranger in a manner of patient dismissal He explained confidentially to Carol Daddy wouldn t let it be morning yet What does the pillow say Bresnahan dropped his arm caressingly on Carol s shoulder he pronounced My Lord you re a lucky girl to have a fine young husk like that I figure Will knew what he was doing when he persuaded you to take a chance on an old bum like him They tell me you come from saint Paul We re going to get you to come to Boston some day He leaned over the bed Young man you re the slickest sight I ve seen this side of Boston With your permission may we present you with a slight token of our regard and appreciation of your long service He held out a red rubber Pierrot Hugh remarked Gimme it hid it under the bedclothes and stared at Bresnahan as though he had never seen the man before For once Carol permitted herself the spiritual luxury of not asking Why Hugh dear what do you say when some one gives you a present The great man was apparently waiting They stood in inane suspense till Bresnahan led them out rumbling How about planning a fishing trip Will He remained for half an hour Always he told Carol what a charming person she was always he looked at her knowingly Yes He probably would make a woman fall in love with him But it wouldn t last a week I d get tired of his confounded buoyancy His hypocrisy He s a spiritual bully He makes me rude to him in self defense Oh yes he is glad to be here He does like us He s so good an actor that he convinces his own self I d HATE him in Boston He d have all the obvious big city things Limousines Discreet evening clothes Order a clever dinner at a smart restaurant Drawing room decorated by the best firm but the pictures giving him away I d rather talk to Guy Pollock in his dusty office How I lie His arm coaxed my shoulder and his eyes dared me not to admire him I d be afraid of him I hate him Oh the inconceivable egotistic imagination of women All this stew of analysis about a man a good decent friendly efficient man because he was kind to me as Will s wife IV The Kennicotts the Elders the Clarks and Bresnahan went fishing at Red Squaw Lake They drove forty miles to the lake in Elder s new Cadillac There was much laughter and bustle at the start much storing of lunch baskets and jointed poles much inquiry as to whether it would really bother Carol to sit with her feet up on a roll of shawls When they were ready to go missus Clark lamented Oh Sam I forgot my magazine and Bresnahan bullied Come on now if you women think you re going to be literary you can t go with us tough guys Every one laughed a great deal and as they drove on missus Clark explained that though probably she would not have read it still she might have wanted to while the other girls had a nap in the afternoon and she was right in the middle of a serial it was an awfully exciting story it seems that this girl was a Turkish dancer only she was really the daughter of an American lady and a Russian prince and men kept running after her just disgustingly but she remained pure and there was a scene While the men floated on the lake casting for black bass the women prepared lunch and yawned Carol was a little resentful of the manner in which the men assumed that they did not care to fish I don t want to go with them but I would like the privilege of refusing The lunch was long and pleasant It was a background for the talk of the great man come home hints of cities and large imperative affairs and famous people jocosely modest admissions that yes their friend Perce was doing about as well as most of these Boston swells that think so much of themselves because they come from rich old families and went to college and everything Believe me it s us new business men that are running Beantown today and not a lot of fussy old bucks snoozing in their clubs Carol realized that he was not one of the sons of Gopher Prairie who if they do not actually starve in the East are invariably spoken of as highly successful and she found behind his too incessant flattery a genuine affection for his mates It was in the matter of the war that he most favored and thrilled them Dropping his voice while they bent nearer there was no one within two miles to overhear he disclosed the fact that in both Boston and Washington he d been getting a lot of inside stuff on the war right straight from headquarters he was in touch with some men couldn t name them but they were darn high up in both the War and State Departments and he would say only for Pete s sake they mustn t breathe one word of this it was strictly on the Q T and not generally known outside of Washington but just between ourselves and they could take this for gospel Spain had finally decided to join the Entente allies in the Grand Scrap Yes sir there d be two million fully equipped Spanish soldiers fighting with us in France in one month now Some surprise for Germany all right How about the prospects for revolution in Germany reverently asked Kennicott The authority grunted Nothing to it The one thing you can bet on is that no matter what happens to the German people win or lose they ll stick by the Kaiser till hell freezes over I got that absolutely straight from a fellow who s on the inside of the inside in Washington No sir I don t pretend to know much about international affairs but one thing you can put down as settled is that Germany will be a Hohenzollern empire for the next forty years At that I don t know as it s so bad The Kaiser and the Junkers keep a firm hand on a lot of these red agitators who d be worse than a king if they could get control I m terribly interested in this uprising that overthrew the Czar in Russia suggested Carol She had finally been conquered by the man s wizard knowledge of affairs Kennicott apologized for her Carrie s nuts about this Russian revolution Is there much to it Perce There is not Bresnahan said flatly I can speak by the book there Carol honey I m surprised to find you talking like a New York Russian Jew or one of these long hairs I can tell you only you don t need to let every one in on it this is confidential I got it from a man who s close to the State Department but as a matter of fact the Czar will be back in power before the end of the year You read a lot about his retiring and about his being killed but I know he s got a big army back of him and he ll show these damn agitators lazy beggars hunting for a soft berth bossing the poor goats that fall for em he ll show em where they get off Carol was sorry to hear that the Czar was coming back but she said nothing The others had looked vacant at the mention of a country so far away as Russia Now they edged in and asked Bresnahan what he thought about the Packard car investments in Texas oil wells the comparative merits of young men born in Minnesota and in Massachusetts the question of prohibition the future cost of motor tires and wasn t it true that American aviators put it all over these Frenchmen They were glad to find that he agreed with them on every point As she heard Bresnahan announce We re perfectly willing to talk to any committee the men may choose but we re not going to stand for some outside agitator butting in and telling us how we re going to run our plant Carol remembered that Jackson Elder now meekly receiving New Ideas had said the same thing in the same words While Sam Clark was digging up from his memory a long and immensely detailed story of the crushing things he had said to a Pullman porter named George Bresnahan hugged his knees and rocked and watched Carol She wondered if he did not understand the laboriousness of the smile with which she listened to Kennicott s account of the good one he had on Carrie that marital coyly improper ten times told tale of how she had forgotten to attend to Hugh because she was all het up pounding the box which may be translated as eagerly playing the piano She was certain that Bresnahan saw through her when she pretended not to hear Kennicott s invitation to join a game of cribbage She feared the comments he might make she was irritated by her fear She was equally irritated when the motor returned through Gopher Prairie to find that she was proud of sharing in Bresnahan s kudos as people waved and Juanita Haydock leaned from a window She said to herself As though I cared whether I m seen with this fat phonograph and simultaneously Everybody has noticed how much Will and I are playing with mister Bresnahan The town was full of his stories his friendliness his memory for names his clothes his trout flies his generosity He had given a hundred dollars to Father Klubok the priest and a hundred to the Reverend mister Zitterel the Baptist minister for Americanization work At the Bon Ton Carol heard Nat Hicks the tailor exulting Old Perce certainly pulled a good one on this fellow Bjornstam that always is shooting off his mouth He s supposed to of settled down since he got married but Lord those fellows that think they know it all they never change Well the Red Swede got the grand razz handed to him all right He had the nerve to breeze up to Perce at Dave Dyer s and he said he said to Perce I ve always wanted to look at a man that was so useful that folks would pay him a million dollars for existing and Perce gave him the once over and come right back Have eh he says Well he says I ve been looking for a man so useful sweeping floors that I could pay him four dollars a day Want the job my friend Ha ha ha Say you know how lippy Bjornstam is Well for once he didn t have a thing to say He tried to get fresh and tell what a rotten town this is and Perce come right back at him If you don t like this country you better get out of it and go back to Germany where you belong Say maybe us fellows didn t give Bjornstam the horse laugh though Oh Perce is the white haired boy in this burg all rightee V Bresnahan had borrowed Jackson Elder s motor he stopped at the Kennicotts he bawled at Carol rocking with Hugh on the porch Better come for a ride She wanted to snub him Thanks so much but I m being maternal Bring him along Bring him along Bresnahan was out of the seat stalking up the sidewalk and the rest of her protests and dignities were feeble She did not bring Hugh along Bresnahan was silent for a mile in words But he looked at her as though he meant her to know that he understood everything she thought She observed how deep was his chest Lovely fields over there he said You really like them There s no profit in them He chuckled Sister you can t get away with it I m onto you You consider me a big bluff Well maybe I am But so are you my dear and pretty enough so that I d try to make love to you if I weren t afraid you d slap me mister Bresnahan do you talk that way to your wife s friends And do you call them sister As a matter of fact I do And I make em like it Score two But his chuckle was not so rotund and he was very attentive to the ammeter In a moment he was cautiously attacking That s a wonderful boy Will Kennicott Great work these country practitioners are doing The other day in Washington I was talking to a big scientific shark a professor in Johns Hopkins medical school and he was saying that no one has ever sufficiently appreciated the general practitioner and the sympathy and help he gives folks These crack specialists the young scientific fellows they re so cocksure and so wrapped up in their laboratories that they miss the human element Except in the case of a few freak diseases that no respectable human being would waste his time having it s the old doc that keeps a community well mind and body And strikes me that Will is one of the steadiest and clearest headed counter practitioners I ve ever met Eh I m sure he is He s a servant of reality Come again Um Yes All of that whatever that is Say child you don t care a whole lot for Gopher Prairie if I m not mistaken Nope There s where you re missing a big chance There s nothing to these cities Believe me I KNOW This is a good town as they go You re lucky to be here I wish I could shy on Very well why don t you Huh Why Lord can t get away fr You don t have to stay I do So I want to change it Do you know that men like you prominent men do quite a reasonable amount of harm by insisting that your native towns and native states are perfect It s you who encourage the denizens not to change They quote you and go on believing that they live in paradise and She clenched her fist The incredible dullness of it Suppose you were right Even so don t you think you waste a lot of thundering on one poor scared little town Kind of mean I tell you it s dull DULL The folks don t find it dull These couples like the Haydocks have a high old time dances and cards They don t They re bored Almost every one here is Vacuousness and bad manners and spiteful gossip that s what I hate Those things course they re here So are they in Boston And every place else Why the faults you find in this town are simply human nature and never will be changed Perhaps But in a Boston all the good Carols I ll admit I have no faults can find one another and play But here I m alone in a stale pool except as it s stirred by the great mister Bresnahan My Lord to hear you tell it a fellow d think that all the denizens as you impolitely call em are so confoundedly unhappy that it s a wonder they don t all up and commit suicide But they seem to struggle along somehow They don t know what they miss And anybody can endure anything Look at men in mines and in prisons He drew up on the south shore of Lake Minniemashie He glanced across the reeds reflected on the water the quiver of wavelets like crumpled tinfoil the distant shores patched with dark woods silvery oats and deep yellow wheat He patted her hand Sis Carol you re a darling girl but you re difficult Know what I think Yes Humph Maybe you do but My humble not too humble opinion is that you like to be different You like to think you re peculiar Why if you knew how many tens of thousands of women especially in New York say just what you do you d lose all the fun of thinking you re a lone genius and you d be on the band wagon whooping it up for Gopher Prairie and a good decent family life There s always about a million young women just out of college who want to teach their grandmothers how to suck eggs How proud you are of that homely rustic metaphor You use it at banquets and directors meetings and boast of your climb from a humble homestead Huh You may have my number I m not telling But look here You re so prejudiced against Gopher Prairie that you overshoot the mark you antagonize those who might be inclined to agree with you in some particulars but Great guns the town can t be all wrong No it isn t But it could be Let me tell you a fable Imagine a cavewoman complaining to her mate She doesn t like one single thing she hates the damp cave the rats running over her bare legs the stiff skin garments the eating of half raw meat her husband s bushy face the constant battles and the worship of the spirits who will hoodoo her unless she gives the priests her best claw necklace Her man protests But it can t all be wrong and he thinks he has reduced her to absurdity Now you assume that a world which produces a Percy Bresnahan and a Velvet Motor Company must be civilized It is Aren t we only about half way along in barbarism I suggest missus Bogart as a test And we ll continue in barbarism just as long as people as nearly intelligent as you continue to defend things as they are because they are You re a fair spieler child But by golly I d like to see you try to design a new manifold or run a factory and keep a lot of your fellow reds from Czech slovenski magyar godknowswheria on the job You d drop your theories so darn quick I m not any defender of things as they are Sure They re rotten Only I m sensible He preached his gospel love of outdoors Playing the Game loyalty to friends She had the neophyte s shock of discovery that outside of tracts conservatives do not tremble and find no answer when an iconoclast turns on them but retort with agility and confusing statistics He was so much the man the worker the friend that she liked him when she most tried to stand out against him he was so much the successful executive that she did not want him to despise her His manner of sneering at what he called parlor socialists though the phrase was not overwhelmingly new had a power which made her wish to placate his company of well fed speed loving administrators When he demanded Would you like to associate with nothing but a lot of turkey necked horn spectacled nuts that have adenoids and need a hair cut and that spend all their time kicking about conditions and never do a lick of work she said No but just the same When he asserted Even if your cavewoman was right in knocking the whole works I bet some red blooded Regular Fellow some real He man found her a nice dry cave and not any whining criticizing radical she wriggled her head feebly between a nod and a shake His large hands sensual lips easy voice supported his self confidence He made her feel young and soft as Kennicott had once made her feel She had nothing to say when he bent his powerful head and experimented My dear I m sorry I m going away from this town You d be a darling child to play with You ARE pretty Some day in Boston I ll show you how we buy a lunch Well hang it got to be starting back The only answer to his gospel of beef which she could find when she was home was a wail of But just the same She did not see him again before he departed for Washington His eyes remained His glances at her lips and hair and shoulders had revealed to her that she was not a wife and mother alone but a girl that there still were men in the world as there had been in college days That admiration led her to study Kennicott to tear at the shroud of intimacy to perceive the strangeness of the most familiar CHAPTER XXIV I ALL that midsummer month Carol was sensitive to Kennicott She recalled a hundred grotesqueries her comic dismay at his having chewed tobacco the evening when she had tried to read poetry to him matters which had seemed to vanish with no trace or sequence Always she repeated that he had been heroically patient in his desire to join the army She made much of her consoling affection for him in little things She liked the homeliness of his tinkering about the house his strength and handiness as he tightened the hinges of a shutter his boyishness when he ran to her to be comforted because he had found rust in the barrel of his pump gun But at the highest he was to her another Hugh without the glamor of Hugh s unknown future There was late in June a day of heat lightning Because of the work imposed by the absence of the other doctors the Kennicotts had not moved to the lake cottage but remained in town dusty and irritable In the afternoon when she went to Oleson McGuire s formerly Dahl Oleson s Carol was vexed by the assumption of the youthful clerk recently come from the farm that he had to be neighborly and rude He was no more brusquely familiar than a dozen other clerks of the town but her nerves were heat scorched When she asked for codfish for supper he grunted What d you want that darned old dry stuff for I like it Punk Guess the doc can afford something better than that Try some of the new wienies we got in Swell The Haydocks use em She exploded My dear young man it is not your duty to instruct me in housekeeping and it doesn t particularly concern me what the Haydocks condescend to approve He was hurt He hastily wrapped up the leprous fragment of fish he gaped as she trailed out She lamented I shouldn t have spoken so He didn t mean anything He doesn t know when he is being rude Her repentance was not proof against Uncle Whittier when she stopped in at his grocery for salt and a package of safety matches Uncle Whittier in a shirt collarless and soaked with sweat in a brown streak down his back was whining at a clerk Come on now get a hustle on and lug that pound cake up to Mis Cass s Some folks in this town think a storekeeper ain t got nothing to do but chase out phone orders Hello Carrie That dress you got on looks kind of low in the neck to me May be decent and modest I suppose I m old fashioned but I never thought much of showing the whole town a woman s bust Hee hee hee Afternoon missus Hicks Sage Just out of it Lemme sell you some other spices Heh Uncle Whittier was nasally indignant CERTAINLY Got PLENTY other spices jus good as sage for any purp se whatever What s the matter with well with allspice When missus Hicks had gone he raged Some folks don t know what they want Sweating sanctimonious bully my husband s uncle thought Carol She crept into Dave Dyer s Dave held up his arms with Don t shoot I surrender She smiled but it occurred to her that for nearly five years Dave had kept up this game of pretending that she threatened his life As she went dragging through the prickly hot street she reflected that a citizen of Gopher Prairie does not have jests he has a jest Every cold morning for five winters Lyman Cass had remarked Fair to middlin chilly get worse before it gets better Fifty times had Ezra Stowbody informed the public that Carol had once asked Shall I indorse this check on the back Fifty times had Sam Clark called to her Where d you steal that hat Fifty times had the mention of Barney Cahoon the town drayman like a nickel in a slot produced from Kennicott the apocryphal story of Barney s directing a minister Come down to the depot and get your case of religious books they re leaking She came home by the unvarying route She knew every house front every street crossing every billboard every tree every dog She knew every blackened banana skin and empty cigarette box in the gutters She knew every greeting When Jim Howland stopped and gaped at her there was no possibility that he was about to confide anything but his grudging Well haryuh t day All her future life this same red labeled bread crate in front of the bakery this same thimble shaped crack in the sidewalk a quarter of a block beyond Stowbody s granite hitching post She silently handed her purchases to the silent Oscarina She sat on the porch rocking fanning twitchy with Hugh s whining Kennicott came home grumbled What the devil is the kid yapping about I guess you can stand it ten minutes if I can stand it all day He came to supper in his shirt sleeves his vest partly open revealing discolored suspenders Why don t you put on your nice Palm Beach suit and take off that hideous vest she complained Too much trouble Too hot to go up stairs She realized that for perhaps a year she had not definitely looked at her husband She regarded his table manners He violently chased fragments of fish about his plate with a knife and licked the knife after gobbling them She was slightly sick She asserted I m ridiculous What do these things matter Don t be so simple But she knew that to her they did matter these solecisms and mixed tenses of the table She realized that they found little to say that incredibly they were like the talked out couples whom she had pitied at restaurants Bresnahan would have spouted in a lively exciting unreliable manner She realized that Kennicott s clothes were seldom pressed His coat was wrinkled his trousers would flap at the knees when he arose His shoes were unblacked and they were of an elderly shapelessness He refused to wear soft hats cleaved to a hard derby as a symbol of virility and prosperity and sometimes he forgot to take it off in the house She peeped at his cuffs They were frayed in prickles of starched linen She had turned them once she clipped them every week but when she had begged him to throw the shirt away last Sunday morning at the crisis of the weekly bath he had uneasily protested Oh it ll wear quite a while yet He was shaved by himself or more socially by Del Snafflin only three times a week This morning had not been one of the three times Yet he was vain of his new turn down collars and sleek ties he often spoke of the sloppy dressing of doctor McGanum and he laughed at old men who wore detachable cuffs or Gladstone collars Carol did not care much for the creamed codfish that evening She noted that his nails were jagged and ill shaped from his habit of cutting them with a pocket knife and despising a nail file as effeminate and urban That they were invariably clean that his were the scoured fingers of the surgeon made his stubborn untidiness the more jarring They were wise hands kind hands but they were not the hands of love She remembered him in the days of courtship He had tried to please her then had touched her by sheepishly wearing a colored band on his straw hat Was it possible that those days of fumbling for each other were gone so completely He had read books to impress her had said she recalled it ironically that she was to point out his every fault had insisted once as they sat in the secret place beneath the walls of Fort Snelling She shut the door on her thoughts That was sacred ground But it WAS a shame that She nervously pushed away her cake and stewed apricots After supper when they had been driven in from the porch by mosquitos when Kennicott had for the two hundredth time in five years commented We must have a new screen on the porch lets all the bugs in they sat reading and she noted and detested herself for noting and noted again his habitual awkwardness He slumped down in one chair his legs up on another and he explored the recesses of his left ear with the end of his little finger she could hear the faint smack he kept it up he kept it up He blurted Oh Forgot tell you Some of the fellows coming in to play poker this evening Suppose we could have some crackers and cheese and beer She nodded He might have mentioned it before Oh well it s his house The poker party straggled in Sam Clark Jack Elder Dave Dyer Jim Howland To her they mechanically said Devenin but to Kennicott in a heroic male manner Well well shall we start playing Got a hunch I m going to lick somebody real bad No one suggested that she join them She told herself that it was her own fault because she was not more friendly but she remembered that they never asked missus Sam Clark to play Bresnahan would have asked her She sat in the living room glancing across the hall at the men as they humped over the dining table They were in shirt sleeves smoking chewing spitting incessantly lowering their voices for a moment so that she did not hear what they said and afterward giggling hoarsely using over and over the canonical phrases Three to dole I raise you a finif Come on now ante up what do you think this is a pink tea The cigar smoke was acrid and pervasive The firmness with which the men mouthed their cigars made the lower part of their faces expressionless heavy unappealing They were like politicians cynically dividing appointments How could they understand her world Did that faint and delicate world exist Was she a fool She doubted her world doubted herself and was sick in the acid smoke stained air She slipped back into brooding upon the habituality of the house Kennicott was as fixed in routine as an isolated old man At first he had amorously deceived himself into liking her experiments with food the one medium in which she could express imagination but now he wanted only his round of favorite dishes steak roast beef boiled pig s feet oatmeal baked apples Because at some more flexible period he had advanced from oranges to grape fruit he considered himself an epicure During their first autumn she had smiled over his affection for his hunting coat but now that the leather had come unstitched in dribbles of pale yellow thread and tatters of canvas smeared with dirt of the fields and grease from gun cleaning hung in a border of rags she hated the thing Wasn t her whole life like that hunting coat She knew every nick and brown spot on each piece of the set of china purchased by Kennicott s mother in eighteen ninety five discreet china with a pattern of washed out forget me nots rimmed with blurred gold the gravy boat in a saucer which did not match the solemn and evangelical covered vegetable dishes the two platters Twenty times had Kennicott sighed over the fact that Bea had broken the other platter the medium sized one The kitchen Damp black iron sink damp whitey yellow drain board with shreds of discolored wood which from long scrubbing were as soft as cotton thread warped table alarm clock stove bravely blackened by Oscarina but an abomination in its loose doors and broken drafts and oven that never would keep an even heat Carol had done her best by the kitchen painted it white put up curtains replaced a six year old calendar by a color print She had hoped for tiling and a kerosene range for summer cooking but Kennicott always postponed these expenses She was better acquainted with the utensils in the kitchen than with Vida Sherwin or Guy Pollock The can opener whose soft gray metal handle was twisted from some ancient effort to pry open a window was more pertinent to her than all the cathedrals in Europe and more significant than the future of Asia was the never settled weekly question as to whether the small kitchen knife with the unpainted handle or the second best buckhorn carving knife was better for cutting up cold chicken for Sunday supper II She was ignored by the males till midnight Her husband called Suppose we could have some eats Carrie As she passed through the dining room the men smiled on her belly smiles None of them noticed her while she was serving the crackers and cheese and sardines and beer They were determining the exact psychology of Dave Dyer in standing pat two hours before When they were gone she said to Kennicott Your friends have the manners of a barroom They expect me to wait on them like a servant They re not so much interested in me as they would be in a waiter because they don t have to tip me Unfortunately Well good night So rarely did she nag in this petty hot weather fashion that he was astonished rather than angry Hey Wait What s the idea I must say I don t get you The boys Barroom Why Perce Bresnahan was saying there isn t a finer bunch of royal good fellows anywhere than just the crowd that were here tonight They stood in the lower hall He was too shocked to go on with his duties of locking the front door and winding his watch and the clock Bresnahan I m sick of him She meant nothing in particular Why Carrie he s one of the biggest men in the country Boston just eats out of his hand I wonder if it does How do we know but that in Boston among well bred people he may be regarded as an absolute lout The way he calls women Sister and the way Now look here That ll do Of course I know you don t mean it you re simply hot and tired and trying to work off your peeve on me But just the same I won t stand your jumping on Perce You It s just like your attitude toward the war so darn afraid that America will become militaristic But you are the pure patriot By God I am Yes I heard you talking to Sam Clark tonight about ways of avoiding the income tax He had recovered enough to lock the door he clumped up stairs ahead of her growling You don t know what you re talking about I m perfectly willing to pay my full tax fact I m in favor of the income tax even though I do think it s a penalty on frugality and enterprise fact it s an unjust darn fool tax But just the same I ll pay it Only I m not idiot enough to pay more than the government makes me pay and Sam and I were just figuring out whether all automobile expenses oughn t to be exemptions I ll take a lot off you Carrie but I don t propose for one second to stand your saying I m not patriotic You know mighty well and good that I ve tried to get away and join the army And at the beginning of the whole fracas I said I ve said right along that we ought to have entered the war the minute Germany invaded Belgium You don t get me at all You can t appreciate a man s work You re abnormal You ve fussed so much with these fool novels and books and all this highbrow junk You like to argue It ended a quarter of an hour later in his calling her a neurotic before he turned away and pretended to sleep For the first time they had failed to make peace There are two races of people only two and they live side by side His calls mine neurotic mine calls his stupid We ll never understand each other never and it s madness for us to debate to lie together in a hot bed in a creepy room enemies yoked III It clarified in her the longing for a place of her own While it s so hot I think I ll sleep in the spare room she said next day Not a bad idea He was cheerful and kindly The room was filled with a lumbering double bed and a cheap pine bureau She stored the bed in the attic replaced it by a cot which with a denim cover made a couch by day put in a dressing table a rocker transformed by a cretonne cover had Miles Bjornstam build book shelves Kennicott slowly understood that she meant to keep up her seclusion In his queries Changing the whole room Putting your books in there she caught his dismay But it was so easy once her door was closed to shut out his worry That hurt her the ease of forgetting him Aunt Bessie Smail sleuthed out this anarchy She yammered Why Carrie you ain t going to sleep all alone by yourself I don t believe in that Married folks should have the same room of course Don t go getting silly notions No telling what a thing like that might lead to Suppose I up and told your Uncle Whit that I wanted a room of my own Carol spoke of recipes for corn pudding But from missus doctor Westlake she drew encouragement She had made an afternoon call on missus Westlake She was for the first time invited up stairs and found the suave old woman sewing in a white and mahogany room with a small bed Oh do you have your own royal apartments and the doctor his Carol hinted Indeed I do The doctor says it s bad enough to have to stand my temper at meals Do missus Westlake looked at her sharply Why don t you do the same thing I ve been thinking about it Carol laughed in an embarrassed way Then you wouldn t regard me as a complete hussy if I wanted to be by myself now and then Why child every woman ought to get off by herself and turn over her thoughts about children and God and how bad her complexion is and the way men don t really understand her and how much work she finds to do in the house and how much patience it takes to endure some things in a man s love Yes Carol said it in a gasp her hands twisted together She wanted to confess not only her hatred for the Aunt Bessies but her covert irritation toward those she best loved her alienation from Kennicott her disappointment in Guy Pollock her uneasiness in the presence of Vida She had enough self control to confine herself to Yes Men The dear blundering souls we do have to get off and laugh at them Of course we do Not that you have to laugh at doctor Kennicott so much but MY man heavens now there s a rare old bird Reading story books when he ought to be tending to business Marcus Westlake I say to him you re a romantic old fool And does he get angry He does not He chuckles and says Yes my beloved folks do say that married people grow to resemble each other Drat him missus Westlake laughed comfortably After such a disclosure what could Carol do but return the courtesy by remarking that as for Kennicott he wasn t romantic enough the darling Before she left she had babbled to missus Westlake her dislike for Aunt Bessie the fact that Kennicott s income was now more than five thousand a year her view of the reason why Vida had married Raymie which included some thoroughly insincere praise of Raymie s kind heart her opinion of the library board just what Kennicott had said about missus Carthal s diabetes and what Kennicott thought of the several surgeons in the Cities She went home soothed by confession inspirited by finding a new friend IV The tragicomedy of the domestic situation Oscarina went back home to help on the farm and Carol had a succession of maids with gaps between The lack of servants was becoming one of the most cramping problems of the prairie town Increasingly the farmers daughters rebelled against village dullness and against the unchanged attitude of the Juanitas toward hired girls They went off to city kitchens or to city shops and factories that they might be free and even human after hours The Jolly Seventeen were delighted at Carol s desertion by the loyal Oscarina They reminded her that she had said I don t have any trouble with maids see how Oscarina stays on Between incumbencies of Finn maids from the North Woods Germans from the prairies occasional Swedes and Norwegians and Icelanders Carol did her own work and endured Aunt Bessie s skittering in to tell her how to dampen a broom for fluffy dust how to sugar doughnuts how to stuff a goose Carol was deft and won shy praise from Kennicott but as her shoulder blades began to sting she wondered how many millions of women had lied to themselves during the death rimmed years through which they had pretended to enjoy the puerile methods persisting in housework She doubted the convenience and as a natural sequent the sanctity of the monogamous and separate home which she had regarded as the basis of all decent life She considered her doubts vicious She refused to remember how many of the women of the Jolly Seventeen nagged their husbands and were nagged by them She energetically did not whine to Kennicott But her eyes ached she was not the girl in breeches and a flannel shirt who had cooked over a camp fire in the Colorado mountains five years ago Her ambition was to get to bed at nine her strongest emotion was resentment over rising at half past six to care for Hugh The back of her neck ached as she got out of bed She was cynical about the joys of a simple laborious life She understood why workmen and workmen s wives are not grateful to their kind employers At mid morning when she was momentarily free from the ache in her neck and back she was glad of the reality of work The hours were living and nimble But she had no desire to read the eloquent little newspaper essays in praise of labor which are daily written by the white browed journalistic prophets She felt independent and though she hid it a bit surly In cleaning the house she pondered upon the maid s room It was a slant roofed small windowed hole above the kitchen oppressive in summer frigid in winter She saw that while she had been considering herself an unusually good mistress she had been permitting her friends Bea and Oscarina to live in a sty She complained to Kennicott What s the matter with it he growled as they stood on the perilous stairs dodging up from the kitchen She commented upon the sloping roof of unplastered boards stained in brown rings by the rain the uneven floor the cot and its tumbled discouraged looking quilts the broken rocker the distorting mirror Maybe it ain t any Hotel Radisson parlor but still it s so much better than anything these hired girls are accustomed to at home that they think it s fine Seems foolish to spend money when they wouldn t appreciate it But that night he drawled with the casualness of a man who wishes to be surprising and delightful Carrie don t know but what we might begin to think about building a new house one of these days How d you like that W why I m getting to the point now where I feel we can afford one and a corker I ll show this burg something like a real house We ll put one over on Sam and Harry Make folks sit up an take notice Yes she said He did not go on Daily he returned to the subject of the new house but as to time and mode he was indefinite At first she believed She babbled of a low stone house with lattice windows and tulip beds of colonial brick of a white frame cottage with green shutters and dormer windows To her enthusiasms he answered Well ye es might be worth thinking about Remember where I put my pipe When she pressed him he fidgeted I don t know seems to me those kind of houses you speak of have been overdone It proved that what he wanted was a house exactly like Sam Clark s which was exactly like every third new house in every town in the country a square yellow stolidity with immaculate clapboards a broad screened porch tidy grass plots and concrete walks a house resembling the mind of a merchant who votes the party ticket straight and goes to church once a month and owns a good car He admitted Well yes maybe it isn t so darn artistic but Matter of fact though I don t want a place just like Sam s Maybe I would cut off that fool tower he s got and I think probably it would look better painted a nice cream color That yellow on Sam s house is too kind of flashy Then there s another kind of house that s mighty nice and substantial looking with shingles in a nice brown stain instead of clapboards seen some in Minneapolis You re way off your base when you say I only like one kind of house Uncle Whittier and Aunt Bessie came in one evening when Carol was sleepily advocating a rose garden cottage You ve had a lot of experience with housekeeping aunty and don t you think Kennicott appealed that it would be sensible to have a nice square house and pay more attention to getting a crackajack furnace than to all this architecture and doodads Aunt Bessie worked her lips as though they were an elastic band Why of course I know how it is with young folks like you Carrie you want towers and bay windows and pianos and heaven knows what all but the thing to get is closets and a good furnace and a handy place to hang out the washing and the rest don t matter Uncle Whittier dribbled a little put his face near to Carol s and sputtered Course it don t What d you care what folks think about the outside of your house It s the inside you re living in None of my business but I must say you young folks that d rather have cakes than potatoes get me riled She reached her room before she became savage Below dreadfully near she could hear the broom swish of Aunt Bessie s voice and the mop pounding of Uncle Whittier s grumble She had a reasonless dread that they would intrude on her then a fear that she would yield to Gopher Prairie s conception of duty toward an Aunt Bessie and go down stairs to be nice She felt the demand for standardized behavior coming in waves from all the citizens who sat in their sitting rooms watching her with respectable eyes waiting demanding unyielding She snarled Oh all right I ll go She powdered her nose straightened her collar and coldly marched down stairs The three elders ignored her They had advanced from the new house to agreeable general fussing Aunt Bessie was saying in a tone like the munching of dry toast I do think mister Stowbody ought to have had the rain pipe fixed at our store right away I went to see him on Tuesday morning before ten no it was couple minutes after ten but anyway it was long before noon I know because I went right from the bank to the meat market to get some steak my I think it s outrageous the prices Oleson McGuire charge for their meat and it isn t as if they gave you a good cut either but just any old thing and I had time to get it and I stopped in at missus Bogart s to ask about her rheumatism Carol was watching Uncle Whittier She knew from his taut expression that he was not listening to Aunt Bessie but herding his own thoughts and that he would interrupt her bluntly He did Will where c n I get an extra pair of pants for this coat and vest D want to pay too much Well guess Nat Hicks could make you up a pair But if I were you I d drop into Ike Rifkin s his prices are lower than the Bon Ton s Humph Got the new stove in your office yet No been looking at some at Sam Clark s but Well y ought get t in Don t do to put off getting a stove all summer and then have it come cold on you in the fall Carol smiled upon them ingratiatingly Do you dears mind if I slip up to bed I m rather tired cleaned the upstairs today She retreated She was certain that they were discussing her and foully forgiving her She lay awake till she heard the distant creak of a bed which indicated that Kennicott had retired Then she felt safe It was Kennicott who brought up the matter of the Smails at breakfast With no visible connection he said Uncle Whit is kind of clumsy but just the same he s a pretty wise old coot He s certainly making good with the store Carol smiled and Kennicott was pleased that she had come to her senses As Whit says after all the first thing is to have the inside of a house right and darn the people on the outside looking in It seemed settled that the house was to be a sound example of the Sam Clark school Kennicott made much of erecting it entirely for her and the baby He spoke of closets for her frocks and a comfy sewing room But when he drew on a leaf from an old account book he was a paper saver and a string picker the plans for the garage he gave much more attention to a cement floor and a work bench and a gasoline tank than he had to sewing rooms She sat back and was afraid In the present rookery there were odd things a step up from the hall to the dining room a picturesqueness in the shed and bedraggled lilac bush But the new place would be smooth standardized fixed It was probable now that Kennicott was past forty and settled that this would be the last venture he would ever make in building So long as she stayed in this ark she would always have a possibility of change but once she was in the new house there she would sit for all the rest of her life there she would die Desperately she wanted to put it off against the chance of miracles While Kennicott was chattering about a patent swing door for the garage she saw the swing doors of a prison She never voluntarily returned to the project Aggrieved Kennicott stopped drawing plans and in ten days the new house was forgotten V Every year since their marriage Carol had longed for a trip through the East Every year Kennicott had talked of attending the American Medical Association convention and then afterwards we could do the East up brown I know New York clean through spent pretty near a week there but I would like to see New England and all these historic places and have some sea food He talked of it from February to May and in May he invariably decided that coming confinement cases or land deals would prevent his getting away from home base for very long THIS year and no sense going till we can do it right The weariness of dish washing had increased her desire to go She pictured herself looking at Emerson s manse bathing in a surf of jade and ivory wearing a trottoir and a summer fur meeting an aristocratic Stranger In the spring Kennicott had pathetically volunteered S pose you d like to get in a good long tour this summer but with Gould and Mac away and so many patients depending on me don t see how I can make it By golly I feel like a tightwad though not taking you Through all this restless July after she had tasted Bresnahan s disturbing flavor of travel and gaiety she wanted to go but she said nothing They spoke of and postponed a trip to the Twin Cities When she suggested as though it were a tremendous joke I think baby and I might up and leave you and run off to Cape Cod by ourselves his only reaction was Golly don t know but what you may almost have to do that if we don t get in a trip next year Toward the end of July he proposed Say the Beavers are holding a convention in Joralemon street fair and everything We might go down tomorrow And I d like to see doctor Calibree about some business Put in the whole day Might help some to make up for our trip Fine fellow doctor Calibree Joralemon was a prairie town of the size of Gopher Prairie Their motor was out of order and there was no passenger train at an early hour They went down by freight train after the weighty and conversational business of leaving Hugh with Aunt Bessie Carol was exultant over this irregular jaunting It was the first unusual thing except the glance of Bresnahan that had happened since the weaning of Hugh They rode in the caboose the small red cupola topped car jerked along at the end of the train It was a roving shanty the cabin of a land schooner with black oilcloth seats along the side and for desk a pine board to be let down on hinges Kennicott played seven up with the conductor and two brakemen Carol liked the blue silk kerchiefs about the brakemen s throats she liked their welcome to her and their air of friendly independence Since there were no sweating passengers crammed in beside her she reveled in the train s slowness She was part of these lakes and tawny wheat fields She liked the smell of hot earth and clean grease and the leisurely chug a chug chug a chug of the trucks was a song of contentment in the sun She pretended that she was going to the Rockies When they reached Joralemon she was radiant with holiday making Her eagerness began to lessen the moment they stopped at a red frame station exactly like the one they had just left at Gopher Prairie and Kennicott yawned Right on time Just in time for dinner at the Calibrees I phoned the doctor from G P that we d be here We ll catch the freight that gets in before twelve I told him He said he d meet us at the depot and take us right up to the house for dinner Calibree is a good man and you ll find his wife is a mighty brainy little woman bright as a dollar By golly there he is doctor Calibree was a squat clean shaven conscientious looking man of forty He was curiously like his own brown painted motor car with eye glasses for windshield Want you to meet my wife doctor Carrie make you quainted with doctor Calibree said Kennicott Calibree bowed quietly and shook her hand but before he had finished shaking it he was concentrating upon Kennicott with Nice to see you doctor Say don t let me forget to ask you about what you did in that exopthalmic goiter case that Bohemian woman at Wahkeenyan The two men on the front seat of the car chanted goiters and ignored her She did not know it She was trying to feed her illusion of adventure by staring at unfamiliar houses drab cottages artificial stone bungalows square painty stolidities with immaculate clapboards and broad screened porches and tidy grass plots Calibree handed her over to his wife a thick woman who called her dearie and asked if she was hot and visibly searching for conversation produced Let s see you and the doctor have a Little One haven t you At dinner missus Calibree served the corned beef and cabbage and looked steamy looked like the steamy leaves of cabbage The men were oblivious of their wives as they gave the social passwords of Main Street the orthodox opinions on weather crops and motor cars then flung away restraint and gyrated in the debauch of shop talk Stroking his chin drawling in the ecstasy of being erudite Kennicott inquired Say doctor what success have you had with thyroid for treatment of pains in the legs before child birth Carol did not resent their assumption that she was too ignorant to be admitted to masculine mysteries She was used to it But the cabbage and missus Calibree s monotonous I don t know what we re coming to with all this difficulty getting hired girls were gumming her eyes with drowsiness She sought to clear them by appealing to Calibree in a manner of exaggerated liveliness Doctor have the medical societies in Minnesota ever advocated legislation for help to nursing mothers Calibree slowly revolved toward her Uh I ve never uh never looked into it I don t believe much in getting mixed up in politics He turned squarely from her and peering earnestly at Kennicott resumed Doctor what s been your experience with unilateral pyelonephritis Buckburn of Baltimore advocates decapsulation and nephrotomy but seems to me Not till after two did they rise In the lee of the stonily mature trio Carol proceeded to the street fair which added mundane gaiety to the annual rites of the United and Fraternal Order of Beavers Beavers human Beavers were everywhere thirty second degree Beavers in gray sack suits and decent derbies more flippant Beavers in crash summer coats and straw hats rustic Beavers in shirt sleeves and frayed suspenders but whatever his caste symbols every Beaver was distinguished by an enormous shrimp colored ribbon lettered in silver Sir Knight and Brother U F O B Annual State Convention On the motherly shirtwaist of each of their wives was a badge Sir Knight s Lady The Duluth delegation had brought their famous Beaver amateur band in Zouave costumes of green velvet jacket blue trousers and scarlet fez The strange thing was that beneath their scarlet pride the Zouaves faces remained those of American business men pink smooth eye glassed and as they stood playing in a circle at the corner of Main Street and Second as they tootled on fifes or with swelling cheeks blew into cornets their eyes remained as owlish as though they were sitting at desks under the sign This Is My Busy Day Carol had supposed that the Beavers were average citizens organized for the purposes of getting cheap life insurance and playing poker at the lodge rooms every second Wednesday but she saw a large poster which proclaimed BEAVERS U F O B The greatest influence for good citizenship in the country The jolliest aggregation of red blooded open handed hustle em up good fellows in the world Joralemon welcomes you to her hospitable city Kennicott read the poster and to Calibree admired Strong lodge the Beavers Never joined Don t know but what I will Calibree adumbrated They re a good bunch Good strong lodge See that fellow there that s playing the snare drum He s the smartest wholesale grocer in Duluth they say Guess it would be worth joining Oh say are you doing much insurance examining They went on to the street fair Lining one block of Main Street were the attractions two hot dog stands a lemonade and pop corn stand a merry go round and booths in which balls might be thrown at rag dolls if one wished to throw balls at rag dolls The dignified delegates were shy of the booths but country boys with brickred necks and pale blue ties and bright yellow shoes who had brought sweethearts into town in somewhat dusty and listed Fords were wolfing sandwiches drinking strawberry pop out of bottles and riding the revolving crimson and gold horses They shrieked and giggled peanut roasters whistled the merry go round pounded out monotonous music the barkers bawled Here s your chance here s your chance come on here boy come on here give that girl a good time give her a swell time here s your chance to win a genuwine gold watch for five cents half a dime the twentieth part of a dollah The prairie sun jabbed the unshaded street with shafts that were like poisonous thorns the tinny cornices above the brick stores were glaring the dull breeze scattered dust on sweaty Beavers who crawled along in tight scorching new shoes up two blocks and back up two blocks and back wondering what to do next working at having a good time Carol s head ached as she trailed behind the unsmiling Calibrees along the block of booths She chirruped at Kennicott Let s be wild Let s ride on the merry go round and grab a gold ring Kennicott considered it and mumbled to Calibree Think you folks would like to stop and try a ride on the merry go round Calibree considered it and mumbled to his wife Think you d like to stop and try a ride on the merry go round missus Calibree smiled in a washed out manner and sighed Oh no I don t believe I care to much but you folks go ahead and try it Calibree stated to Kennicott No I don t believe we care to a whole lot but you folks go ahead and try it Kennicott summarized the whole case against wildness Let s try it some other time Carrie She gave it up She looked at the town She saw that in adventuring from Main Street Gopher Prairie to Main Street Joralemon she had not stirred There were the same two story brick groceries with lodge signs above the awnings the same one story wooden millinery shop the same fire brick garages the same prairie at the open end of the wide street the same people wondering whether the levity of eating a hot dog sandwich would break their taboos They reached Gopher Prairie at nine in the evening You look kind of hot said Kennicott Yes Joralemon is an enterprising town don t you think so She broke No I think it s an ash heap Why Carrie He worried over it for a week While he ground his plate with his knife as he energetically pursued fragments of bacon he peeped at her CHAPTER XXV CARRIE S all right She s finicky but she ll get over it But I wish she d hurry up about it What she can t understand is that a fellow practising medicine in a small town like this has got to cut out the highbrow stuff and not spend all his time going to concerts and shining his shoes Not but what he might be just as good at all these intellectual and art things as some other folks if he had the time for it doctor Will Kennicott was brooding in his office during a free moment toward the end of the summer afternoon He hunched down in his tilted desk chair undid a button of his shirt glanced at the state news in the back of the Journal of the American Medical Association dropped the magazine leaned back with his right thumb hooked in the arm hole of his vest and his left thumb stroking the back of his hair By golly she s taking an awful big chance though You d expect her to learn by and by that I won t be a parlor lizard She says we try to make her over Well she s always trying to make me over from a perfectly good M D into a damn poet with a socialist necktie She d have a fit if she knew how many women would be willing to cuddle up to Friend Will and comfort him if he d give em the chance There s still a few dames that think the old man isn t so darn unattractive I m glad I ve ducked all that woman game since I ve been married but Be switched if sometimes I don t feel tempted to shine up to some girl that has sense enough to take life as it is some frau that doesn t want to talk Longfellow all the time but just hold my hand and say You look all in honey Take it easy and don t try to talk Carrie thinks she s such a whale at analyzing folks Giving the town the once over Telling us where we get off Why she d simply turn up her toes and croak if she found out how much she doesn t know about the high old times a wise guy could have in this burg on the Q T if he wasn t faithful to his wife But I am At that no matter what faults she s got there s nobody here no nor in Minn aplus either that s as nice looking and square and bright as Carrie She ought to of been an artist or a writer or one of those things But once she took a shot at living here she ought to stick by it Pretty Lord yes But cold She simply doesn t know what passion is She simply hasn t got an i dea how hard it is for a full blooded man to go on pretending to be satisfied with just being endured It gets awful tiresome having to feel like a criminal just because I m normal She s getting so she doesn t even care for my kissing her Well I guess I can weather it same as I did earning my way through school and getting started in practise But I wonder how long I can stand being an outsider in my own home He sat up at the entrance of missus Dave Dyer She slumped into a chair and gasped with the heat He chuckled Well well Maud this is fine Where s the subscription list What cause do I get robbed for this trip I haven t any subscription list Will I want to see you professionally And you a Christian Scientist Have you given that up What next New Thought or Spiritualism No I have not given it up Strikes me it s kind of a knock on the sisterhood your coming to see a doctor No it isn t It s just that my faith isn t strong enough yet So there now And besides you ARE kind of consoling Will I mean as a man not just as a doctor You re so strong and placid He sat on the edge of his desk coatless his vest swinging open with the thick gold line of his watch chain across the gap his hands in his trousers pockets his big arms bent and easy As she purred he cocked an interested eye Maud Dyer was neurotic religiocentric faded her emotions were moist and her figure was unsystematic splendid thighs and arms with thick ankles and a body that was bulgy in the wrong places But her milky skin was delicious her eyes were alive her chestnut hair shone and there was a tender slope from her ears to the shadowy place below her jaw With unusual solicitude he uttered his stock phrase Well what seems to be the matter Maud I ve got such a backache all the time I m afraid the organic trouble that you treated me for is coming back Any definite signs of it N no but I think you d better examine me Nope Don t believe it s necessary Maud To be honest between old friends I think your troubles are mostly imaginary I can t really advise you to have an examination She flushed looked out of the window He was conscious that his voice was not impersonal and even She turned quickly Will you always say my troubles are imaginary Why can t you be scientific I ve been reading an article about these new nerve specialists and they claim that lots of imaginary ailments yes and lots of real pain too are what they call psychoses and they order a change in a woman s way of living so she can get on a higher plane Wait Wait Whoa up Wait now Don t mix up your Christian Science and your psychology They re two entirely different fads You ll be mixing in socialism next You re as bad as Carrie with your psychoses Why Good Lord Maud I could talk about neuroses and psychoses and inhibitions and repressions and complexes just as well as any damn specialist if I got paid for it if I was in the city and had the nerve to charge the fees that those fellows do If a specialist stung you for a hundred dollar consultation fee and told you to go to New York to duck Dave s nagging you d do it to save the hundred dollars But you know me I m your neighbor you see me mowing the lawn you figure I m just a plug general practitioner If I said Go to New York Dave and you would laugh your heads off and say Look at the airs Will is putting on What does he think he is As a matter of fact you re right You have a perfectly well developed case of repression of sex instinct and it raises the old Ned with your body What you need is to get away from Dave and travel yes and go to every dog gone kind of New Thought and Bahai and Swami and Hooptedoodle meeting you can find I know it well s you do But how can I advise it Dave would be up here taking my hide off I m willing to be family physician and priest and lawyer and plumber and wet nurse but I draw the line at making Dave loosen up on money Too hard a job in weather like this So savvy my dear Believe it will rain if this heat keeps But Will he d never give it to me on my say so He d never let me go away You know how Dave is so jolly and liberal in society and oh just LOVES to match quarters and such a perfect sport if he loses But at home he pinches a nickel till the buffalo drips blood I have to nag him for every single dollar Sure I know but it s your fight honey Keep after him He d simply resent my butting in He crossed over and patted her shoulder Outside the window beyond the fly screen that was opaque with dust and cottonwood lint Main Street was hushed except for the impatient throb of a standing motor car She took his firm hand pressed his knuckles against her cheek O Will Dave is so mean and little and noisy the shrimp You re so calm When he s cutting up at parties I see you standing back and watching him the way a mastiff watches a terrier He fought for professional dignity with Dave s not a bad fellow Lingeringly she released his hand Will drop round by the house this evening and scold me Make me be good and sensible And I m so lonely If I did Dave would be there and we d have to play cards It s his evening off from the store No The clerk just got called to Corinth mother sick Dave will be in the store till midnight Oh come on over There s some lovely beer on the ice and we can sit and talk and be all cool and lazy That wouldn t be wrong of us WOULD it No no course it wouldn t be wrong But still oughtn t to He saw Carol slim black and ivory cool scornful of intrigue All right But I ll be so lonely Her throat seemed young above her loose blouse of muslin and machine lace Tell you Maud I ll drop in just for a minute if I happen to be called down that way If you d like demurely O Will I just want comfort I know you re all married and my such a proud papa and of course now If I could just sit near you in the dusk and be quiet and forget Dave You WILL come Sure I will I ll expect you I ll be lonely if you don t come Good by He cursed himself Darned fool what d I promise to go for I ll have to keep my promise or she ll feel hurt She s a good decent affectionate girl and Dave s a cheap skate all right She s got more life to her than Carol has All my fault anyway Why can t I be more cagey like Calibree and McGanum and the rest of the doctors Oh I am but Maud s such a demanding idiot Deliberately bamboozling me into going up there tonight Matter of principle ought not to let her get away with it I won t go I ll call her up and tell her I won t go Me with Carrie at home finest little woman in the world and a messy minded female like Maud Dyer no SIR Though there s no need of hurting her feelings I may just drop in for a second to tell her I can t stay All my fault anyway ought never to have started in and jollied Maud along in the old days If it s my fault I ve got no right to punish Maud I could just drop in for a second and then pretend I had a country call and beat it Damn nuisance though having to fake up excuses Lord why can t the women let you alone Just because once or twice seven hundred million years ago you were a poor fool why can t they let you forget it Maud s own fault I ll stay strictly away Take Carrie to the movies and forget Maud But it would be kind of hot at the movies tonight He fled from himself He rammed on his hat threw his coat over his arm banged the door locked it tramped downstairs I won t go he said sturdily and as he said it he would have given a good deal to know whether he was going He was refreshed as always by the familiar windows and faces It restored his soul to have Sam Clark trustingly bellow Better come down to the lake this evening and have a swim doc Ain t you going to open your cottage at all this summer By golly we miss you He noted the progress on the new garage He had triumphed in the laying of every course of bricks in them he had seen the growth of the town His pride was ushered back to its throne by the respectfulness of Oley Sundquist Evenin doc The woman is a lot better That was swell medicine you gave her He was calmed by the mechanicalness of the tasks at home burning the gray web of a tent worm on the wild cherry tree sealing with gum a cut in the right front tire of the car sprinkling the road before the house The hose was cool to his hands As the bright arrows fell with a faint puttering sound a crescent of blackness was formed in the gray dust Dave Dyer came along Where going Dave Down to the store Just had supper But Thursday s your night off Sure but Pete went home His mother s supposed to be sick Gosh these clerks you get nowadays overpay em and then they won t work That s tough Dave You ll have to work clear up till twelve then Yup Better drop in and have a cigar if you re downtown Well I may at that May have to go down and see missus Champ Perry She s ailing So long Dave Kennicott had not yet entered the house He was conscious that Carol was near him that she was important that he was afraid of her disapproval but he was content to be alone When he had finished sprinkling he strolled into the house up to the baby s room and cried to Hugh Story time for the old man eh Carol was in a low chair framed and haloed by the window behind her an image in pale gold The baby curled in her lap his head on her arm listening with gravity while she sang from Gene Field Tis little Luddy Dud in the morning Tis little Luddy Dud at night And all day long Tis the same dear song Of that growing crowing knowing little sprite Kennicott was enchanted Maud Dyer I should say not When the current maid bawled up stairs Supper on de table Kennicott was upon his back flapping his hands in the earnest effort to be a seal thrilled by the strength with which his son kicked him He slipped his arm about Carol s shoulder he went down to supper rejoicing that he was cleansed of perilous stuff While Carol was putting the baby to bed he sat on the front steps Nat Hicks tailor and roue came to sit beside him Between waves of his hand as he drove off mosquitos Nat whispered Say doc you don t feel like imagining you re a bacheldore again and coming out for a Time tonight do you As how You know this new dressmaker missus Swiftwaite swell dame with blondine hair Well she s a pretty good goer Me and Harry Haydock are going to take her and that fat wren that works in the Bon Ton nice kid too on an auto ride tonight Maybe we ll drive down to that farm Harry bought We re taking some beer and some of the smoothest rye you ever laid tongue to I m not predicting none but if we don t have a picnic I ll miss my guess Go to it No skin off my ear Nat Think I want to be fifth wheel in the coach No but look here The little Swiftwaite has a friend with her from Winona dandy looker and some gay bird and Harry and me thought maybe you d like to sneak off for one evening No no Rats now doc forget your everlasting dignity You used to be a pretty good sport yourself when you were foot free It may have been the fact that missus Swiftwaite s friend remained to Kennicott an ill told rumor it may have been Carol s voice wistful in the pallid evening as she sang to Hugh it may have been natural and commendable virtue but certainly he was positive Nope I m married for keeps Don t pretend to be any saint Like to get out and raise Cain and shoot a few drinks But a fellow owes a duty Straight now won t you feel like a sneak when you come back to the missus after your jamboree Me My moral in life is What they don t know won t hurt em none The way to handle wives like the fellow says is to catch em early treat em rough and tell em nothing Well that s your business I suppose But I can t get away with it Besides that way I figure it this illicit love making is the one game that you always lose at If you do lose you feel foolish and if you win as soon as you find out how little it is that you ve been scheming for why then you lose worse than ever Nature stinging us as usual But at that I guess a lot of wives in this burg would be surprised if they knew everything that goes on behind their backs eh Nattie WOULD they Say boy If the good wives knew what some of the boys get away with when they go down to the Cities why they d throw a fit Sure you won t come doc Think of getting all cooled off by a good long drive and then the lov e ly Swiftwaite s white hand mixing you a good stiff highball Nope Nope Sorry Guess I won t grumbled Kennicott He was glad that Nat showed signs of going But he was restless He heard Carol on the stairs Come have a seat have the whole earth he shouted jovially She did not answer his joviality She sat on the porch rocked silently then sighed So many mosquitos out here You haven t had the screen fixed As though he was testing her he said quietly Head aching again Oh not much but This maid is SO slow to learn I have to show her everything I had to clean most of the silver myself And Hugh was so bad all afternoon He whined so Poor soul he was hot but he did wear me out Uh You usually want to get out Like to walk down to the lake shore The girl can stay home Or go to the movies Come on let s go to the movies Or shall we jump in the car and run out to Sam s for a swim If you don t mind dear I m afraid I m rather tired Why don t you sleep down stairs tonight on the couch Be cooler I m going to bring down my mattress Come on Keep the old man company Can t tell I might get scared of burglars Lettin little fellow like me stay all alone by himself It s sweet of you to think of it but I like my own room so much But you go ahead and do it dear Why don t you sleep on the couch instead of putting your mattress on the floor Well I believe I ll run in and read for just a second want to look at the last Vogue and then perhaps I ll go by by Unless you want me dear Of course if there s anything you really WANT me for No No Matter of fact I really ought to run down and see missus Champ Perry She s ailing So you skip in and May drop in at the drug store If I m not home when you get sleepy don t wait up for me He kissed her rambled off nodded to Jim Howland stopped indifferently to speak to missus Terry Gould But his heart was racing his stomach was constricted He walked more slowly He reached Dave Dyer s yard He glanced in On the porch sheltered by a wild grape vine was the figure of a woman in white He heard the swing couch creak as she sat up abruptly peered then leaned back and pretended to relax Be nice to have some cool beer Just drop in for a second he insisted as he opened the Dyer gate II missus Bogart was calling upon Carol protected by Aunt Bessie Smail Have you heard about this awful woman that s supposed to have come here to do dressmaking a missus Swiftwaite awful peroxide blonde moaned missus Bogart They say there s some of the awfullest goings on at her house mere boys and old gray headed rips sneaking in there evenings and drinking licker and every kind of goings on We women can t never realize the carnal thoughts in the hearts of men I tell you even though I been acquainted with Will Kennicott almost since he was a mere boy seems like I wouldn t trust even him Who knows what designin women might tempt him Especially a doctor with women rushin in to see him at his office and all You know I never hint around but haven t you felt that Carol was furious I don t pretend that Will has no faults But one thing I do know He s as simple hearted about what you call goings on as a babe And if he ever were such a sad dog as to look at another woman I certainly hope he d have spirit enough to do the tempting and not be coaxed into it as in your depressing picture Why what a wicked thing to say Carrie from Aunt Bessie No I mean it Oh of course I don t mean it But I know every thought in his head so well that he couldn t hide anything even if he wanted to Now this morning He was out late last night he had to go see missus Perry who is ailing and then fix a man s hand and this morning he was so quiet and thoughtful at breakfast and She leaned forward breathed dramatically to the two perched harpies What do you suppose he was thinking of What trembled missus Bogart Whether the grass needs cutting probably There there Don t mind my naughtiness I have some fresh made raisin cookies for you CHAPTER XXVI CAROL S liveliest interest was in her walks with the baby Hugh wanted to know what the box elder tree said and what the Ford garage said and what the big cloud said and she told him with a feeling that she was not in the least making up stories but discovering the souls of things They had an especial fondness for the hitching post in front of the mill It was a brown post stout and agreeable the smooth leg of it held the sunlight while its neck grooved by hitching straps tickled one s fingers Carol had never been awake to the earth except as a show of changing color and great satisfying masses she had lived in people and in ideas about having ideas but Hugh s questions made her attentive to the comedies of sparrows robins blue jays yellowhammers she regained her pleasure in the arching flight of swallows and added to it a solicitude about their nests and family squabbles She forgot her seasons of boredom She said to Hugh We re two fat disreputable old minstrels roaming round the world and he echoed her Roamin round roamin round The high adventure the secret place to which they both fled joyously was the house of Miles and Bea and Olaf Bjornstam Kennicott steadily disapproved of the Bjornstams He protested What do you want to talk to that crank for He hinted that a former Swede hired girl was low company for the son of doctor Will Kennicott She did not explain She did not quite understand it herself did not know that in the Bjornstams she found her friends her club her sympathy and her ration of blessed cynicism For a time the gossip of Juanita Haydock and the Jolly Seventeen had been a refuge from the droning of Aunt Bessie but the relief had not continued The young matrons made her nervous They talked so loud always so loud They filled a room with clashing cackle their jests and gags they repeated nine times over Unconsciously she had discarded the Jolly Seventeen Guy Pollock Vida and every one save missus doctor Westlake and the friends whom she did not clearly know as friends the Bjornstams To Hugh the Red Swede was the most heroic and powerful person in the world With unrestrained adoration he trotted after while Miles fed the cows chased his one pig an animal of lax and migratory instincts or dramatically slaughtered a chicken And to Hugh Olaf was lord among mortal men less stalwart than the old monarch King Miles but more understanding of the relations and values of things of small sticks lone playing cards and irretrievably injured hoops Carol saw though she did not admit that Olaf was not only more beautiful than her own dark child but more gracious Olaf was a Norse chieftain straight sunny haired large limbed resplendently amiable to his subjects Hugh was a vulgarian a bustling business man It was Hugh that bounced and said Let s play Olaf that opened luminous blue eyes and agreed All right in condescending gentleness If Hugh batted him and Hugh did bat him Olaf was unafraid but shocked In magnificent solitude he marched toward the house while Hugh bewailed his sin and the overclouding of august favor The two friends played with an imperial chariot which Miles had made out of a starch box and four red spools together they stuck switches into a mouse hole with vast satisfaction though entirely without known results Bea the chubby and humming Bea impartially gave cookies and scoldings to both children and if Carol refused a cup of coffee and a wafer of buttered knackebrod she was desolated Miles had done well with his dairy He had six cows two hundred chickens a cream separator a Ford truck In the spring he had built a two room addition to his shack That illustrious building was to Hugh a carnival Uncle Miles did the most spectacular unexpected things ran up the ladder stood on the ridge pole waving a hammer and singing something about To arms my citizens nailed shingles faster than Aunt Bessie could iron handkerchiefs and lifted a two by six with Hugh riding on one end and Olaf on the other Uncle Miles s most ecstatic trick was to make figures not on paper but right on a new pine board with the broadest softest pencil in the world There was a thing worth seeing The tools In his office Father had tools fascinating in their shininess and curious shapes but they were sharp they were something called sterized and they distinctly were not for boys to touch In fact it was a good dodge to volunteer I must not touch when you looked at the tools on the glass shelves in Father s office But Uncle Miles who was a person altogether superior to Father let you handle all his kit except the saws There was a hammer with a silver head there was a metal thing like a big L there was a magic instrument very precious made out of costly red wood and gold with a tube which contained a drop no it wasn t a drop it was a nothing which lived in the water but the nothing LOOKED like a drop and it ran in a frightened way up and down the tube no matter how cautiously you tilted the magic instrument And there were nails very different and clever big valiant spikes middle sized ones which were not very interesting and shingle nails much jollier than the fussed up fairies in the yellow book II While he had worked on the addition Miles had talked frankly to Carol He admitted now that so long as he stayed in Gopher Prairie he would remain a pariah Bea s Lutheran friends were as much offended by his agnostic gibes as the merchants by his radicalism And I can t seem to keep my mouth shut I think I m being a baa lamb and not springing any theories wilder than c a t spells cat but when folks have gone I re lize I ve been stepping on their pet religious corns Oh the mill foreman keeps dropping in and that Danish shoemaker and one fellow from Elder s factory and a few Svenskas but you know Bea big good hearted wench like her wants a lot of folks around likes to fuss over em never satisfied unless she tiring herself out making coffee for somebody Once she kidnapped me and drug me to the Methodist Church I goes in pious as Widow Bogart and sits still and never cracks a smile while the preacher is favoring us with his misinformation on evolution But afterwards when the old stalwarts were pumphandling everybody at the door and calling em Brother and Sister they let me sail right by with nary a clinch They figure I m the town badman Always will be I guess It ll have to be Olaf who goes on And sometimes Blamed if I don t feel like coming out and saying I ve been conservative Nothing to it Now I m going to start something in these rotten one horse lumber camps west of town But Bea s got me hypnotized Lord missus Kennicott do you re lize what a jolly square faithful woman she is And I love Olaf Oh well I won t go and get sentimental on you Course I ve had thoughts of pulling up stakes and going West Maybe if they didn t know it beforehand they wouldn t find out I d ever been guilty of trying to think for myself But oh I ve worked hard and built up this dairy business and I hate to start all over again and move Bea and the kid into another one room shack That s how they get us Encourage us to be thrifty and own our own houses and then by golly they ve got us they know we won t dare risk everything by committing lez what is it lez majesty I mean they know we won t be hinting around that if we had a company operative bank we could get along without Stowbody Well As long as I can sit and play pinochle with Bea and tell whoppers to Olaf about his daddy s adventures in the woods and how he snared a wapaloosie and knew Paul Bunyan why I don t mind being a bum It s just for them that I mind Say Say Don t whisper a word to Bea but when I get this addition done I m going to buy her a phonograph He did While she was busy with the activities her work hungry muscles found washing ironing mending baking dusting preserving plucking a chicken painting the sink tasks which because she was Miles s full partner were exciting and creative Bea listened to the phonograph records with rapture like that of cattle in a warm stable The addition gave her a kitchen with a bedroom above The original one room shack was now a living room with the phonograph a genuine leather upholstered golden oak rocker and a picture of Governor John Johnson In late July Carol went to the Bjornstams desirous of a chance to express her opinion of Beavers and Calibrees and Joralemons She found Olaf abed restless from a slight fever and Bea flushed and dizzy but trying to keep up her work She lured Miles aside and worried They don t look at all well What s the matter Their stomachs are out of whack I wanted to call in Doc Kennicott but Bea thinks the doc doesn t like us she thinks maybe he s sore because you come down here But I m getting worried I m going to call the doctor at once She yearned over Olaf His lambent eyes were stupid he moaned he rubbed his forehead Have they been eating something that s been bad for them she fluttered to Miles Might be bum water I ll tell you We used to get our water at Oscar Eklund s place over across the street but Oscar kept dinging at me and hinting I was a tightwad not to dig a well of my own One time he said Sure you socialists are great on divvying up other folks money and water I knew if he kept it up there d be a fuss and I ain t safe to have around once a fuss starts I m likely to forget myself and let loose with a punch in the snoot I offered to pay Oscar but he refused he d rather have the chance to kid me So I starts getting water down at missus Fageros s in the hollow there and I don t believe it s real good Figuring to dig my own well this fall One scarlet word was before Carol s eyes while she listened She fled to Kennicott s office He gravely heard her out nodded said Be right over He examined Bea and Olaf He shook his head Yes Looks to me like typhoid Golly I ve seen typhoid in lumber camps groaned Miles all the strength dripping out of him Have they got it very bad Oh we ll take good care of them said Kennicott and for the first time in their acquaintance he smiled on Miles and clapped his shoulder Won t you need a nurse demanded Carol Why To Miles Kennicott hinted Couldn t you get Bea s cousin Tina She s down at the old folks in the country Then let me do it Carol insisted They need some one to cook for them and isn t it good to give them sponge baths in typhoid Yes All right Kennicott was automatic he was the official the physician I guess probably it would be hard to get a nurse here in town just now missus Stiver is busy with an obstetrical case and that town nurse of yours is off on vacation ain t she All right Bjornstam can spell you at night All week from eight each morning till midnight Carol fed them bathed them smoothed sheets took temperatures Miles refused to let her cook Terrified pallid noiseless in stocking feet he did the kitchen work and the sweeping his big red hands awkwardly careful Kennicott came in three times a day unchangingly tender and hopeful in the sick room evenly polite to Miles Carol understood how great was her love for her friends It bore her through it made her arm steady and tireless to bathe them What exhausted her was the sight of Bea and Olaf turned into flaccid invalids uncomfortably flushed after taking food begging for the healing of sleep at night During the second week Olaf s powerful legs were flabby Spots of a viciously delicate pink came out on his chest and back His cheeks sank He looked frightened His tongue was brown and revolting His confident voice dwindled to a bewildered murmur ceaseless and racking Bea had stayed on her feet too long at the beginning The moment Kennicott had ordered her to bed she had begun to collapse One early evening she startled them by screaming in an intense abdominal pain and within half an hour she was in a delirium Till dawn Carol was with her and not all of Bea s groping through the blackness of half delirious pain was so pitiful to Carol as the way in which Miles silently peered into the room from the top of the narrow stairs Carol slept three hours next morning and ran back Bea was altogether delirious but she muttered nothing save Olaf ve have such a good time At ten while Carol was preparing an ice bag in the kitchen Miles answered a knock At the front door she saw Vida Sherwin Maud Dyer and missus Zitterel wife of the Baptist pastor They were carrying grapes and women s magazines magazines with high colored pictures and optimistic fiction We just heard your wife was sick We ve come to see if there isn t something we can do chirruped Vida Miles looked steadily at the three women You re too late You can t do nothing now Bea s always kind of hoped that you folks would come see her She wanted to have a chance and be friends She used to sit waiting for somebody to knock I ve seen her sitting here waiting Now Oh you ain t worth God damning He shut the door All day Carol watched Olaf s strength oozing He was emaciated His ribs were grim clear lines his skin was clammy his pulse was feeble but terrifyingly rapid It beat beat beat in a drum roll of death Late that afternoon he sobbed and died Bea did not know it She was delirious Next morning when she went she did not know that Olaf would no longer swing his lath sword on the door step no longer rule his subjects of the cattle yard that Miles s son would not go East to college Miles Carol Kennicott were silent They washed the bodies together their eyes veiled Go home now and sleep You re pretty tired I can t ever pay you back for what you done Miles whispered to Carol Yes But I ll be back here tomorrow Go with you to the funeral she said laboriously When the time for the funeral came Carol was in bed collapsed She assumed that neighbors would go They had not told her that word of Miles s rebuff to Vida had spread through town a cyclonic fury It was only by chance that leaning on her elbow in bed she glanced through the window and saw the funeral of Bea and Olaf There was no music no carriages There was only Miles Bjornstam in his black wedding suit walking quite alone head down behind the shabby hearse that bore the bodies of his wife and baby An hour after Hugh came into her room crying and when she said as cheerily as she could What is it dear he besought Mummy I want to go play with Olaf That afternoon Juanita Haydock dropped in to brighten Carol She said Too bad about this Bea that was your hired girl But I don t waste any sympathy on that man of hers Everybody says he drank too much and treated his family awful and that s how they got sick CHAPTER XXVII I A LETTER from Raymie Wutherspoon in France said that he had been sent to the front been slightly wounded been made a captain From Vida s pride Carol sought to draw a stimulant to rouse her from depression Miles had sold his dairy He had several thousand dollars To Carol he said good by with a mumbled word a harsh hand shake Going to buy a farm in northern Alberta far off from folks as I can get He turned sharply away but he did not walk with his former spring His shoulders seemed old It was said that before he went he cursed the town There was talk of arresting him of riding him on a rail It was rumored that at the station old Champ Perry rebuked him You better not come back here We ve got respect for your dead but we haven t got any for a blasphemer and a traitor that won t do anything for his country and only bought one Liberty Bond Some of the people who had been at the station declared that Miles made some dreadful seditious retort something about loving German workmen more than American bankers but others asserted that he couldn t find one word with which to answer the veteran that he merely sneaked up on the platform of the train He must have felt guilty everybody agreed for as the train left town a farmer saw him standing in the vestibule and looking out His house with the addition which he had built four months ago was very near the track on which his train passed When Carol went there for the last time she found Olaf s chariot with its red spool wheels standing in the sunny corner beside the stable She wondered if a quick eye could have noticed it from a train That day and that week she went reluctantly to Red Cross work she stitched and packed silently while Vida read the war bulletins And she said nothing at all when Kennicott commented From what Champ says I guess Bjornstam was a bad egg after all In spite of Bea don t know but what the citizens committee ought to have forced him to be patriotic let on like they could send him to jail if he didn t volunteer and come through for bonds and the Y M C A They ve worked that stunt fine with all these German farmers II She found no inspiration but she did find a dependable kindness in missus Westlake and at last she yielded to the old woman s receptivity and had relief in sobbing the story of Bea Guy Pollock she often met on the street but he was merely a pleasant voice which said things about Charles Lamb and sunsets Her most positive experience was the revelation of missus Flickerbaugh the tall thin twitchy wife of the attorney Carol encountered her at the drug store Walking snapped missus Flickerbaugh Why yes Humph Guess you re the only female in this town that retains the use of her legs Come home and have a cup o tea with me Because she had nothing else to do Carol went But she was uncomfortable in the presence of the amused stares which missus Flickerbaugh s raiment drew Today in reeking early August she wore a man s cap a skinny fur like a dead cat a necklace of imitation pearls a scabrous satin blouse and a thick cloth skirt hiked up in front Come in Sit down Stick the baby in that rocker Hope you don t mind the house looking like a rat s nest You don t like this town Neither do I said missus Flickerbaugh Why Course you don t Well then I don t But I m sure that some day I ll find some solution Probably I m a hexagonal peg Solution find the hexagonal hole Carol was very brisk How do you know you ever will find it There s missus Westlake She s naturally a big city woman she ought to have a lovely old house in Philadelphia or Boston but she escapes by being absorbed in reading You be satisfied to never do anything but read No but Heavens one can t go on hating a town always Why not I can I ve hated it for thirty two years I ll die here and I ll hate it till I die I ought to have been a business woman I had a good deal of talent for tending to figures All gone now Some folks think I m crazy Guess I am Sit and grouch Go to church and sing hymns Folks think I m religious Tut Trying to forget washing and ironing and mending socks Want an office of my own and sell things Julius never hear of it Too late Carol sat on the gritty couch and sank into fear Could this drabness of life keep up forever then Would she some day so despise herself and her neighbors that she too would walk Main Street an old skinny eccentric woman in a mangy cat s fur As she crept home she felt that the trap had finally closed She went into the house a frail small woman still winsome but hopeless of eye as she staggered with the weight of the drowsy boy in her arms She sat alone on the porch that evening It seemed that Kennicott had to make a professional call on missus Dave Dyer Under the stilly boughs and the black gauze of dusk the street was meshed in silence There was but the hum of motor tires crunching the road the creak of a rocker on the Howlands porch the slap of a hand attacking a mosquito a heat weary conversation starting and dying the precise rhythm of crickets the thud of moths against the screen sounds that were a distilled silence It was a street beyond the end of the world beyond the boundaries of hope Though she should sit here forever no brave procession no one who was interesting would be coming by It was tediousness made tangible a street builded of lassitude and of futility Myrtle Cass appeared with Cy Bogart She giggled and bounced when Cy tickled her ear in village love They strolled with the half dancing gait of lovers kicking their feet out sideways or shuffling a dragging jig and the concrete walk sounded to the broken two four rhythm Their voices had a dusky turbulence Suddenly to the woman rocking on the porch of the doctor s house the night came alive and she felt that everywhere in the darkness panted an ardent quest which she was missing as she sank back to wait for There must be something CHAPTER XXVIII IT WAS at a supper of the Jolly Seventeen in August that Carol heard of Elizabeth from missus Dave Dyer Carol was fond of Maud Dyer because she had been particularly agreeable lately had obviously repented of the nervous distaste which she had once shown Maud patted her hand when they met and asked about Hugh Kennicott said that he was kind of sorry for the girl some ways she s too darn emotional but still Dave is sort of mean to her He was polite to poor Maud when they all went down to the cottages for a swim Carol was proud of that sympathy in him and now she took pains to sit with their new friend missus Dyer was bubbling Oh have you folks heard about this young fellow that s just come to town that the boys call Elizabeth He s working in Nat Hicks s tailor shop I bet he doesn t make eighteen a week but my isn t he the perfect lady though He talks so refined and oh the lugs he puts on belted coat and pique collar with a gold pin and socks to match his necktie and honest you won t believe this but I got it straight this fellow you know he s staying at missus Gurrey s punk old boarding house and they say he asked missus Gurrey if he ought to put on a dress suit for supper Imagine Can you beat that And him nothing but a Swede tailor Erik Valborg his name is But he used to be in a tailor shop in Minneapolis they do say he s a smart needle pusher at that and he tries to let on that he s a regular city fellow They say he tries to make people think he s a poet carries books around and pretends to read em Myrtle Cass says she met him at a dance and he was mooning around all over the place and he asked her did she like flowers and poetry and music and everything he spieled like he was a regular United States Senator and Myrtle she s a devil that girl ha ha she kidded him along and got him going and honest what d you think he said He said he didn t find any intellectual companionship in this town Can you BEAT it Imagine And him a Swede tailor My And they say he s the most awful mollycoddle looks just like a girl The boys call him Elizabeth and they stop him and ask about the books he lets on to have read and he goes and tells them and they take it all in and jolly him terribly and he never gets onto the fact they re kidding him Oh I think it s just TOO funny The Jolly Seventeen laughed and Carol laughed with them missus Jack Elder added that this Erik Valborg had confided to missus Gurrey that he would love to design clothes for women Imagine missus Harvey Dillon had had a glimpse of him but honestly she d thought he was awfully handsome This was instantly controverted by missus B J Gougerling wife of the banker missus Gougerling had had she reported a good look at this Valborg fellow She and B J had been motoring and passed Elizabeth out by McGruder s Bridge He was wearing the awfullest clothes with the waist pinched in like a girl s He was sitting on a rock doing nothing but when he heard the Gougerling car coming he snatched a book out of his pocket and as they went by he pretended to be reading it to show off And he wasn t really good looking just kind of soft as B J had pointed out When the husbands came they joined in the expose My name is Elizabeth I m the celebrated musical tailor The skirts fall for me by the thou Do I get some more veal loaf merrily shrieked Dave Dyer He had some admirable stories about the tricks the town youngsters had played on Valborg They had dropped a decaying perch into his pocket They had pinned on his back a sign I m the prize boob kick me Glad of any laughter Carol joined the frolic and surprised them by crying Dave I do think you re the dearest thing since you got your hair cut That was an excellent sally Everybody applauded Kennicott looked proud She decided that sometime she really must go out of her way to pass Hicks s shop and see this freak II She was at Sunday morning service at the Baptist Church in a solemn row with her husband Hugh Uncle Whittier Aunt Bessie Despite Aunt Bessie s nagging the Kennicotts rarely attended church The doctor asserted Sure religion is a fine influence got to have it to keep the lower classes in order fact it s the only thing that appeals to a lot of those fellows and makes em respect the rights of property And I guess this theology is O K lot of wise old coots figured it all out and they knew more about it than we do He believed in the Christian religion and never thought about it he believed in the church and seldom went near it he was shocked by Carol s lack of faith and wasn t quite sure what was the nature of the faith that she lacked Carol herself was an uneasy and dodging agnostic When she ventured to Sunday School and heard the teachers droning that the genealogy of Shamsherai was a valuable ethical problem for children to think about when she experimented with Wednesday prayer meeting and listened to store keeping elders giving their unvarying weekly testimony in primitive erotic symbols and such gory Chaldean phrases as washed in the blood of the lamb and a vengeful God when missus Bogart boasted that through his boyhood she had made Cy confess nightly upon the basis of the Ten Commandments then Carol was dismayed to find the Christian religion in America in the twentieth century as abnormal as Zoroastrianism without the splendor But when she went to church suppers and felt the friendliness saw the gaiety with which the sisters served cold ham and scalloped potatoes when missus Champ Perry cried to her on an afternoon call My dear if you just knew how happy it makes you to come into abiding grace then Carol found the humanness behind the sanguinary and alien theology Always she perceived that the churches Methodist Baptist Congregational Catholic all of them which had seemed so unimportant to the judge s home in her childhood so isolated from the city struggle in saint Paul were still in Gopher Prairie the strongest of the forces compelling respectability This August Sunday she had been tempted by the announcement that the Reverend Edmund Zitterel would preach on the topic America Face Your Problems With the great war workmen in every nation showing a desire to control industries Russia hinting a leftward revolution against Kerensky woman suffrage coming there seemed to be plenty of problems for the Reverend mister Zitterel to call on America to face Carol gathered her family and trotted off behind Uncle Whittier The congregation faced the heat with informality Men with highly plastered hair so painfully shaved that their faces looked sore removed their coats sighed and unbuttoned two buttons of their uncreased Sunday vests Large bosomed white bloused hot necked spectacled matrons the Mothers in Israel pioneers and friends of missus Champ Perry waved their palm leaf fans in a steady rhythm Abashed boys slunk into the rear pews and giggled while milky little girls up front with their mothers self consciously kept from turning around The church was half barn and half Gopher Prairie parlor The streaky brown wallpaper was broken in its dismal sweep only by framed texts Come unto Me and The Lord is My Shepherd by a list of hymns and by a crimson and green diagram staggeringly drawn upon hemp colored paper indicating the alarming ease with which a young man may descend from Palaces of Pleasure and the House of Pride to Eternal Damnation But the varnished oak pews and the new red carpet and the three large chairs on the platform behind the bare reading stand were all of a rocking chair comfort Carol was civic and neighborly and commendable today She beamed and bowed She trolled out with the others the hymn How pleasant tis on Sabbath morn To gather in the church And there I ll have no carnal thoughts Nor sin shall me besmirch With a rustle of starched linen skirts and stiff shirt fronts the congregation sat down and gave heed to the Reverend mister Zitterel The priest was a thin swart intense young man with a bang He wore a black sack suit and a lilac tie He smote the enormous Bible on the reading stand vociferated Come let us reason together delivered a prayer informing Almighty God of the news of the past week and began to reason It proved that the only problems which America had to face were Mormonism and Prohibition Don t let any of these self conceited fellows that are always trying to stir up trouble deceive you with the belief that there s anything to all these smart aleck movements to let the unions and the Farmers Nonpartisan League kill all our initiative and enterprise by fixing wages and prices There isn t any movement that amounts to a whoop without it s got a moral background And let me tell you that while folks are fussing about what they call economics and socialism and science and a lot of things that are nothing in the world but a disguise for atheism the Old Satan is busy spreading his secret net and tentacles out there in Utah under his guise of Joe Smith or Brigham Young or whoever their leaders happen to be today it doesn t make any difference and they re making game of the Old Bible that has led this American people through its manifold trials and tribulations to its firm position as the fulfilment of the prophecies and the recognized leader of all nations Sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies the footstool of my feet said the Lord of Hosts Acts II the thirty fourth verse and let me tell you right now you got to get up a good deal earlier in the morning than you get up even when you re going fishing if you want to be smarter than the Lord who has shown us the straight and narrow way and he that passeth therefrom is in eternal peril and to return to this vital and terrible subject of Mormonism and as I say it is terrible to realize how little attention is given to this evil right here in our midst and on our very doorstep as it were it s a shame and a disgrace that the Congress of these United States spends all its time talking about inconsequential financial matters that ought to be left to the Treasury Department as I understand it instead of arising in their might and passing a law that any one admitting he is a Mormon shall simply be deported and as it were kicked out of this free country in which we haven t got any room for polygamy and the tyrannies of Satan And to digress for a moment especially as there are more of them in this state than there are Mormons though you never can tell what will happen with this vain generation of young girls that think more about wearing silk stockings than about minding their mothers and learning to bake a good loaf of bread and many of them listening to these sneaking Mormon missionaries and I actually heard one of them talking right out on a street corner in Duluth a few years ago and the officers of the law not protesting but still as they are a smaller but more immediate problem let me stop for just a moment to pay my respects to these Seventh Day Adventists Not that they are immoral I don t mean but when a body of men go on insisting that Saturday is the Sabbath after Christ himself has clearly indicated the new dispensation then I think the legislature ought to step in At this point Carol awoke She got through three more minutes by studying the face of a girl in the pew across a sensitive unhappy girl whose longing poured out with intimidating self revelation as she worshiped mister Zitterel Carol wondered who the girl was She had seen her at church suppers She considered how many of the three thousand people in the town she did not know to how many of them the Thanatopsis and the Jolly Seventeen were icy social peaks how many of them might be toiling through boredom thicker than her own with greater courage She examined her nails She read two hymns She got some satisfaction out of rubbing an itching knuckle She pillowed on her shoulder the head of the baby who after killing time in the same manner as his mother was so fortunate as to fall asleep She read the introduction title page and acknowledgment of copyrights in the hymnal She tried to evolve a philosophy which would explain why Kennicott could never tie his scarf so that it would reach the top of the gap in his turn down collar There were no other diversions to be found in the pew She glanced back at the congregation She thought that it would be amiable to bow to missus Champ Perry Her slow turning head stopped galvanized Across the aisle two rows back was a strange young man who shone among the cud chewing citizens like a visitant from the sun amber curls low forehead fine nose chin smooth but not raw from Sabbath shaving His lips startled her The lips of men in Gopher Prairie are flat in the face straight and grudging The stranger s mouth was arched the upper lip short He wore a brown jersey coat a delft blue bow a white silk shirt white flannel trousers He suggested the ocean beach a tennis court anything but the sun blistered utility of Main Street A visitor from Minneapolis here for business No He wasn t a business man He was a poet Keats was in his face and Shelley and Arthur Upson whom she had once seen in Minneapolis He was at once too sensitive and too sophisticated to touch business as she knew it in Gopher Prairie With restrained amusement he was analyzing the noisy mister Zitterel Carol was ashamed to have this spy from the Great World hear the pastor s maundering She felt responsible for the town She resented his gaping at their private rites She flushed turned away But she continued to feel his presence How could she meet him She must For an hour of talk He was all that she was hungry for She could not let him get away without a word and she would have to She pictured and ridiculed herself as walking up to him and remarking I am sick with the Village Virus Will you please tell me what people are saying and playing in New York She pictured and groaned over the expression of Kennicott if she should say Why wouldn t it be reasonable for you my soul to ask that complete stranger in the brown jersey coat to come to supper tonight She brooded not looking back She warned herself that she was probably exaggerating that no young man could have all these exalted qualities Wasn t he too obviously smart too glossy new Like a movie actor Probably he was a traveling salesman who sang tenor and fancied himself in imitations of Newport clothes and spoke of the swellest business proposition that ever came down the pike In a panic she peered at him No This was no hustling salesman this boy with the curving Grecian lips and the serious eyes She rose after the service carefully taking Kennicott s arm and smiling at him in a mute assertion that she was devoted to him no matter what happened She followed the Mystery s soft brown jersey shoulders out of the church Fatty Hicks the shrill and puffy son of Nat flapped his hand at the beautiful stranger and jeered How s the kid All dolled up like a plush horse today ain t we Carol was exceeding sick Her herald from the outside was Erik Valborg Elizabeth Apprentice tailor Gasoline and hot goose Mending dirty jackets Respectfully holding a tape measure about a paunch And yet she insisted this boy was also himself III They had Sunday dinner with the Smails in a dining room which centered about a fruit and flower piece and a crayon enlargement of Uncle Whittier Carol did not heed Aunt Bessie s fussing in regard to missus Robert B Schminke s bead necklace and Whittier s error in putting on the striped pants day like this She did not taste the shreds of roast pork She said vacuously Uh Will I wonder if that young man in the white flannel trousers at church this morning was this Valborg person that they re all talking about Yump That s him Wasn t that the darndest get up he had on Kennicott scratched at a white smear on his hard gray sleeve It wasn t so bad I wonder where he comes from He seems to have lived in cities a good deal Is he from the East The East Him Why he comes from a farm right up north here just this side of Jefferson I know his father slightly Adolph Valborg typical cranky old Swede farmer Oh really blandly Believe he has lived in Minneapolis for quite some time though Learned his trade there And I will say he s bright some ways Reads a lot Pollock says he takes more books out of the library than anybody else in town Huh He s kind of like you in that The Smails and Kennicott laughed very much at this sly jest Uncle Whittier seized the conversation That fellow that s working for Hicks Milksop that s what he is Makes me tired to see a young fellow that ought to be in the war or anyway out in the fields earning his living honest like I done when I was young doing a woman s work and then come out and dress up like a show actor Why when I was his age Carol reflected that the carving knife would make an excellent dagger with which to kill Uncle Whittier It would slide in easily The headlines would be terrible Kennicott said judiciously Oh I don t want to be unjust to him I believe he took his physical examination for military service Got varicose veins not bad but enough to disqualify him Though I will say he doesn t look like a fellow that would be so awful darn crazy to poke his bayonet into a Hun s guts Will PLEASE Well he don t Looks soft to me And they say he told Del Snafflin when he was getting a hair cut on Saturday that he wished he could play the piano Isn t it wonderful how much we all know about one another in a town like this said Carol innocently Kennicott was suspicious but Aunt Bessie serving the floating island pudding agreed Yes it is wonderful Folks can get away with all sorts of meannesses and sins in these terrible cities but they can t here I was noticing this tailor fellow this morning and when missus Riggs offered to share her hymn book with him he shook his head and all the while we was singing he just stood there like a bump on a log and never opened his mouth Everybody says he s got an idea that he s got so much better manners and all than what the rest of us have but if that s what he calls good manners I want to know Carol again studied the carving knife Blood on the whiteness of a tablecloth might be gorgeous Then Fool Neurotic impossibilist Telling yourself orchard fairy tales at thirty Dear Lord am I really THIRTY That boy can t be more than twenty five IV She went calling Boarding with the Widow Bogart was Fern Mullins a girl of twenty two who was to be teacher of English French and gymnastics in the high school this coming session Fern Mullins had come to town early for the six weeks normal course for country teachers Carol had noticed her on the street had heard almost as much about her as about Erik Valborg She was tall weedy pretty and incurably rakish Whether she wore a low middy collar or dressed reticently for school in a black suit with a high necked blouse she was airy flippant She looks like an absolute totty said all the missus Sam Clarks disapprovingly and all the Juanita Haydocks enviously That Sunday evening sitting in baggy canvas lawn chairs beside the house the Kennicotts saw Fern laughing with Cy Bogart who though still a junior in high school was now a lump of a man only two or three years younger than Fern Cy had to go downtown for weighty matters connected with the pool parlor Fern drooped on the Bogart porch her chin in her hands She looks lonely said Kennicott She does poor soul I believe I ll go over and speak to her I was introduced to her at Dave s but I haven t called Carol was slipping across the lawn a white figure in the dimness faintly brushing the dewy grass She was thinking of Erik and of the fact that her feet were wet and she was casual in her greeting Hello The doctor and I wondered if you were lonely Resentfully I am Carol concentrated on her My dear you sound so I know how it is I used to be tired when I was on the job I was a librarian What was your college I was Blodgett More interestedly I went to the U Fern meant the University of Minnesota You must have had a splendid time Blodgett was a bit dull Where were you a librarian challengingly saint Paul the main library Honest Oh dear I wish I was back in the Cities This is my first year of teaching and I m scared stiff I did have the best time in college dramatics and basket ball and fussing and dancing I m simply crazy about dancing And here except when I have the kids in gymnasium class or when I m chaperoning the basket ball team on a trip out of town I won t dare to move above a whisper I guess they don t care much if you put any pep into teaching or not as long as you look like a Good Influence out of school hours and that means never doing anything you want to This normal course is bad enough but the regular school will be FIERCE If it wasn t too late to get a job in the Cities I swear I d resign here I bet I won t dare to go to a single dance all winter If I cut loose and danced the way I like to they d think I was a perfect hellion poor harmless me Oh I oughtn t to be talking like this Fern you never could be cagey Don t be frightened my dear Doesn t that sound atrociously old and kind I m talking to you the way missus Westlake talks to me That s having a husband and a kitchen range I suppose But I feel young and I want to dance like a like a hellion too So I sympathize Fern made a sound of gratitude Carol inquired What experience did you have with college dramatics I tried to start a kind of Little Theater here It was dreadful I must tell you about it Two hours later when Kennicott came over to greet Fern and to yawn Look here Carrie don t you suppose you better be thinking about turning in I ve got a hard day tomorrow the two were talking so intimately that they constantly interrupted each other As she went respectably home convoyed by a husband and decorously holding up her skirts Carol rejoiced Everything has changed I have two friends Fern and But who s the other That s queer I thought there was Oh how absurd V She often passed Erik Valborg on the street the brown jersey coat became unremarkable When she was driving with Kennicott in early evening she saw him on the lake shore reading a thin book which might easily have been poetry She noted that he was the only person in the motorized town who still took long walks She told herself that she was the daughter of a judge the wife of a doctor and that she did not care to know a capering tailor She told herself that she was not responsive to men not even to Percy Bresnahan She told herself that a woman of thirty who heeded a boy of twenty five was ridiculous And on Friday when she had convinced herself that the errand was necessary she went to Nat Hicks s shop bearing the not very romantic burden of a pair of her husband s trousers Hicks was in the back room She faced the Greek god who in a somewhat ungodlike way was stitching a coat on a scaley sewing machine in a room of smutted plaster walls She saw that his hands were not in keeping with a Hellenic face They were thick roughened with needle and hot iron and plow handle Even in the shop he persisted in his finery He wore a silk shirt a topaz scarf thin tan shoes This she absorbed while she was saying curtly Can I get these pressed please Not rising from the sewing machine he stuck out his hand mumbled When do you want them Oh Monday The adventure was over She was marching out What name he called after her He had risen and despite the farcicality of doctor Will Kennicott s bulgy trousers draped over his arm he had the grace of a cat Kennicott Kennicott Oh Oh say you re missus doctor Kennicott then aren t you Yes She stood at the door Now that she had carried out her preposterous impulse to see what he was like she was cold she was as ready to detect familiarities as the virtuous Miss Ella Stowbody I ve heard about you Myrtle Cass was saying you got up a dramatic club and gave a dandy play I ve always wished I had a chance to belong to a Little Theater and give some European plays or whimsical like Barrie or a pageant He pronounced it pagent he rhymed pag with rag Carol nodded in the manner of a lady being kind to a tradesman and one of her selves sneered Our Erik is indeed a lost John Keats He was appealing Do you suppose it would be possible to get up another dramatic club this coming fall Well it might be worth thinking of She came out of her several conflicting poses and said sincerely There s a new teacher Miss Mullins who might have some talent That would make three of us for a nucleus If we could scrape up half a dozen we might give a real play with a small cast Have you had any experience Just a bum club that some of us got up in Minneapolis when I was working there We had one good man an interior decorator maybe he was kind of sis and effeminate but he really was an artist and we gave one dandy play But I Of course I ve always had to work hard and study by myself and I m probably sloppy and I d love it if I had training in rehearsing I mean the crankier the director was the better I d like it If you didn t want to use me as an actor I d love to design the costumes I m crazy about fabrics textures and colors and designs She knew that he was trying to keep her from going trying to indicate that he was something more than a person to whom one brought trousers for pressing He besought Some day I hope I can get away from this fool repairing when I have the money saved up I want to go East and work for some big dressmaker and study art drawing and become a high class designer Or do you think that s a kind of fiddlin ambition for a fellow I was brought up on a farm And then monkeyin round with silks I don t know What do you think Myrtle Cass says you re awfully educated I am Awfully Tell me Have the boys made fun of your ambition She was seventy years old and sexless and more advisory than Vida Sherwin Well they have at that They ve jollied me a good deal here and Minneapolis both They say dressmaking is ladies work But I was willing to get drafted for the war I tried to get in But they rejected me But I did try I thought some of working up in a gents furnishings store and I had a chance to travel on the road for a clothing house but somehow I hate this tailoring but I can t seem to get enthusiastic about salesmanship I keep thinking about a room in gray oatmeal paper with prints in very narrow gold frames or would it be better in white enamel paneling but anyway it looks out on Fifth Avenue and I m designing a sumptuous He made it sump too ous robe of linden green chiffon over cloth of gold You know tileul It s elegant What do you think Why not What do you care for the opinion of city rowdies or a lot of farm boys But you mustn t you really mustn t let casual strangers like me have a chance to judge you Well You aren t a stranger one way Myrtle Cass Miss Cass should say she s spoken about you so often I wanted to call on you and the doctor but I didn t quite have the nerve One evening I walked past your house but you and your husband were talking on the porch and you looked so chummy and happy I didn t dare butt in Maternally I think it s extremely nice of you to want to be trained in in enunciation by a stage director Perhaps I could help you I m a thoroughly sound and uninspired schoolma am by instinct quite hopelessly mature Oh you aren t EITHER She was not very successful at accepting his fervor with the air of amused woman of the world but she sounded reasonably impersonal Thank you Shall we see if we really can get up a new dramatic club I ll tell you Come to the house this evening about eight I ll ask Miss Mullins to come over and we ll talk about it VI He has absolutely no sense of humor Less than Will But hasn t he What is a sense of humor Isn t the thing he lacks the back slapping jocosity that passes for humor here Anyway Poor lamb coaxing me to stay and play with him Poor lonely lamb If he could be free from Nat Hickses from people who say dandy and bum would he develop I wonder if Whitman didn t use Brooklyn back street slang as a boy No Not Whitman He s Keats sensitive to silken things Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes as are the tiger moth s deep damask d wings Keats here A bewildered spirit fallen on Main Street And Main Street laughs till it aches giggles till the spirit doubts his own self and tries to give up the use of wings for the correct uses of a gents furnishings store Gopher Prairie with its celebrated eleven miles of cement walk I wonder how much of the cement is made out of the tombstones of John Keatses VII Kennicott was cordial to Fern Mullins teased her told her he was a great hand for running off with pretty school teachers and promised that if the school board should object to her dancing he would bat em one over the head and tell em how lucky they were to get a girl with some go to her for once But to Erik Valborg he was not cordial He shook hands loosely and said H are yuh Nat Hicks was socially acceptable he had been here for years and owned his shop but this person was merely Nat s workman and the town s principle of perfect democracy was not meant to be applied indiscriminately The conference on a dramatic club theoretically included Kennicott but he sat back patting yawns conscious of Fern s ankles smiling amiably on the children at their sport Fern wanted to tell her grievances Carol was sulky every time she thought of The Girl from Kankakee it was Erik who made suggestions He had read with astounding breadth and astounding lack of judgment His voice was sensitive to liquids but he overused the word glorious He mispronounced a tenth of the words he had from books but he knew it He was insistent but he was shy When he demanded I d like to stage Suppressed Desires by Cook and Miss Glaspell Carol ceased to be patronizing He was not the yearner he was the artist sure of his vision I d make it simple Use a big window at the back with a cyclorama of a blue that would simply hit you in the eye and just one tree branch to suggest a park below Put the breakfast table on a dais Let the colors be kind of arty and tea roomy orange chairs and orange and blue table and blue Japanese breakfast set and some place one big flat smear of black bang Oh Another play I wish we could do is Tennyson Jesse s The Black Mask I ve never seen it but Glorious ending where this woman looks at the man with his face all blown away and she just gives one horrible scream Good God is that your idea of a glorious ending bayed Kennicott That sounds fierce I do love artistic things but not the horrible ones moaned Fern Mullins Erik was bewildered glanced at Carol She nodded loyally At the end of the conference they had decided nothing CHAPTER XXIX SHE had walked up the railroad track with Hugh this Sunday afternoon She saw Erik Valborg coming in an ancient highwater suit tramping sullenly and alone striking at the rails with a stick For a second she unreasoningly wanted to avoid him but she kept on and she serenely talked about God whose voice Hugh asserted made the humming in the telegraph wires Erik stared straightened They greeted each other with Hello Hugh say how do you do to mister Valborg Oh dear me he s got a button unbuttoned worried Erik kneeling Carol frowned then noted the strength with which he swung the baby in the air May I walk along a piece with you I m tired Let s rest on those ties Then I must be trotting back They sat on a heap of discarded railroad ties oak logs spotted with cinnamon colored dry rot and marked with metallic brown streaks where iron plates had rested Hugh learned that the pile was the hiding place of Injuns he went gunning for them while the elders talked of uninteresting things The telegraph wires thrummed thrummed thrummed above them the rails were glaring hard lines the goldenrod smelled dusty Across the track was a pasture of dwarf clover and sparse lawn cut by earthy cow paths beyond its placid narrow green the rough immensity of new stubble jagged with wheat stacks like huge pineapples Erik talked of books flamed like a recent convert to any faith He exhibited as many titles and authors as possible halting only to appeal Have you read his last book Don t you think he s a terribly strong writer She was dizzy But when he insisted You ve been a librarian tell me do I read too much fiction she advised him loftily rather discursively He had she indicated never studied He had skipped from one emotion to another Especially she hesitated then flung it at him he must not guess at pronunciations he must endure the nuisance of stopping to reach for the dictionary I m talking like a cranky teacher she sighed No And I will study Read the damned dictionary right through He crossed his legs and bent over clutching his ankle with both hands I know what you mean I ve been rushing from picture to picture like a kid let loose in an art gallery for the first time You see it s so awful recent that I ve found there was a world well a world where beautiful things counted I was on the farm till I was nineteen Dad is a good farmer but nothing else Do you know why he first sent me off to learn tailoring I wanted to study drawing and he had a cousin that d made a lot of money tailoring out in Dakota and he said tailoring was a lot like drawing so he sent me down to a punk hole called Curlew to work in a tailor shop Up to that time I d only had three months schooling a year walked to school two miles through snow up to my knees and Dad never would stand for my having a single book except schoolbooks I never read a novel till I got Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall out of the library at Curlew I thought it was the loveliest thing in the world Next I read Barriers Burned Away and then Pope s translation of Homer Some combination all right When I went to Minneapolis just two years ago I guess I d read pretty much everything in that Curlew library but I d never heard of Rossetti or John Sargent or Balzac or Brahms But Yump I ll study Look here Shall I get out of this tailoring this pressing and repairing I don t see why a surgeon should spend very much time cobbling shoes But what if I find I can t really draw and design After fussing around in New York or Chicago I d feel like a fool if I had to go back to work in a gents furnishings store Please say haberdashery Haberdashery All right I ll remember He shrugged and spread his fingers wide She was humbled by his humility she put away in her mind to take out and worry over later a speculation as to whether it was not she who was naive She urged What if you do have to go back Most of us do We can t all be artists myself for instance We have to darn socks and yet we re not content to think of nothing but socks and darning cotton I d demand all I could get whether I finally settled down to designing frocks or building temples or pressing pants What if you do drop back You ll have had the adventure Don t be too meek toward life Go You re young you re unmarried Try everything Don t listen to Nat Hicks and Sam Clark and be a steady young man in order to help them make money You re still a blessed innocent Go and play till the Good People capture you But I don t just want to play I want to make something beautiful God And I don t know enough Do you get it Do you understand Nobody else ever has Do you understand Yes And so But here s what bothers me I like fabrics dinky things like that little drawings and elegant words But look over there at those fields Big New Don t it seem kind of a shame to leave this and go back to the East and Europe and do what all those people have been doing so long Being careful about words when there s millions of bushels off wheat here Reading this fellow Pater when I ve helped Dad to clear fields It s good to clear fields But it s not for you It s one of our favorite American myths that broad plains necessarily make broad minds and high mountains make high purpose I thought that myself when I first came to the prairie Big new Oh I don t want to deny the prairie future It will be magnificent But equally I m hanged if I want to be bullied by it go to war on behalf of Main Street be bullied and BULLIED by the faith that the future is already here in the present and that all of us must stay and worship wheat stacks and insist that this is God s Country and never of course do anything original or gay colored that would help to make that future Anyway you don t belong here Sam Clark and Nat Hicks that s what our big newness has produced Go Before it s too late as it has been for for some of us Young man go East and grow up with the revolution Then perhaps you may come back and tell Sam and Nat and me what to do with the land we ve been clearing if we ll listen if we don t lynch you first He looked at her reverently She could hear him saying I ve always wanted to know a woman who would talk to me like that Her hearing was faulty He was saying nothing of the sort He was saying Why aren t you happy with your husband I you He doesn t care for the blessed innocent part of you does he Erik you mustn t First you tell me to go and be free and then you say that I mustn t I know But you mustn t You must be more impersonal He glowered at her like a downy young owl She wasn t sure but she thought that he muttered I m damned if I will She considered with wholesome fear the perils of meddling with other people s destinies and she said timidly Hadn t we better start back now He mused You re younger than I am Your lips are for songs about rivers in the morning and lakes at twilight I don t see how anybody could ever hurt you Yes We better go He trudged beside her his eyes averted Hugh experimentally took his thumb He looked down at the baby seriously He burst out All right I ll do it I ll stay here one year Save Not spend so much money on clothes And then I ll go East to art school Work on the side tailor shop dressmaker s I ll learn what I m good for designing clothes stage settings illustrating or selling collars to fat men All settled He peered at her unsmiling Can you stand it here in town for a year With you to look at Please I mean Don t the people here think you re an odd bird They do me I assure you I don t know I never notice much Oh they do kid me about not being in the army especially the old warhorses the old men that aren t going themselves And this Bogart boy And mister Hicks s son he s a horrible brat But probably he s licensed to say what he thinks about his father s hired man He s beastly They were in town They passed Aunt Bessie s house Aunt Bessie and missus Bogart were at the window and Carol saw that they were staring so intently that they answered her wave only with the stiffly raised hands of automatons In the next block missus doctor Westlake was gaping from her porch Carol said with an embarrassed quaver I want to run in and see missus Westlake I ll say good by here She avoided his eyes missus Westlake was affable Carol felt that she was expected to explain and while she was mentally asserting that she d be hanged if she d explain she was explaining Hugh captured that Valborg boy up the track They became such good friends And I talked to him for a while I d heard he was eccentric but really I found him quite intelligent Crude but he reads reads almost the way doctor Westlake does That s fine Why does he stick here in town What s this I hear about his being interested in Myrtle Cass I don t know Is he I m sure he isn t He said he was quite lonely Besides Myrtle is a babe in arms Twenty one if she s a day Well Is the doctor going to do any hunting this fall II The need of explaining Erik dragged her back into doubting For all his ardent reading and his ardent life was he anything but a small town youth bred on an illiberal farm and in cheap tailor shops He had rough hands She had been attracted only by hands that were fine and suave like those of her father Delicate hands and resolute purpose But this boy powerful seamed hands and flabby will It s not appealing weakness like his but sane strength that will animate the Gopher Prairies Only Does that mean anything Or am I echoing Vida The world has always let strong statesmen and soldiers the men with strong voices take control and what have the thundering boobies done What is strength This classifying of people I suppose tailors differ as much as burglars or kings Erik frightened me when he turned on me Of course he didn t mean anything but I mustn t let him be so personal Amazing impertinence But he didn t mean to be His hands are FIRM I wonder if sculptors don t have thick hands too Of course if there really is anything I can do to HELP the boy Though I despise these people who interfere He must be independent III She wasn t altogether pleased the week after when Erik was independent and without asking for her inspiration planned the tennis tournament It proved that he had learned to play in Minneapolis that next to Juanita Haydock he had the best serve in town Tennis was well spoken of in Gopher Prairie and almost never played There were three courts one belonging to Harry Haydock one to the cottages at the lake and one a rough field on the outskirts laid out by a defunct tennis association Erik had been seen in flannels and an imitation panama hat playing on the abandoned court with Willis Woodford the clerk in Stowbody s bank Suddenly he was going about proposing the reorganization of the tennis association and writing names in a fifteen cent note book bought for the purpose at Dyer s When he came to Carol he was so excited over being an organizer that he did not stop to talk of himself and Aubrey Beardsley for more than ten minutes He begged Will you get some of the folks to come in and she nodded agreeably He proposed an informal exhibition match to advertise the association he suggested that Carol and himself the Haydocks the Woodfords and the Dillons play doubles and that the association be formed from the gathered enthusiasts He had asked Harry Haydock to be tentative president Harry he reported had promised All right You bet But you go ahead and arrange things and I ll O K em Erik planned that the match should be held Saturday afternoon on the old public court at the edge of town He was happy in being for the first time part of Gopher Prairie Through the week Carol heard how select an attendance there was to be Kennicott growled that he didn t care to go Had he any objections to her playing with Erik No sure not she needed the exercise Carol went to the match early The court was in a meadow out on the New Antonia road Only Erik was there He was dashing about with a rake trying to make the court somewhat less like a plowed field He admitted that he had stage fright at the thought of the coming horde Willis and missus Woodford arrived Willis in home made knickers and black sneakers through at the toe then doctor and missus Harvey Dillon people as harmless and grateful as the Woodfords Carol was embarrassed and excessively agreeable like the bishop s lady trying not to feel out of place at a Baptist bazaar They waited The match was scheduled for three As spectators there assembled one youthful grocery clerk stopping his Ford delivery wagon to stare from the seat and one solemn small boy tugging a smaller sister who had a careless nose I wonder where the Haydocks are They ought to show up at least said Erik Carol smiled confidently at him and peered down the empty road toward town Only heat waves and dust and dusty weeds At half past three no one had come and the grocery boy reluctantly got out cranked his Ford glared at them in a disillusioned manner and rattled away The small boy and his sister ate grass and sighed The players pretended to be exhilarated by practising service but they startled at each dust cloud from a motor car None of the cars turned into the meadow none till a quarter to four when Kennicott drove in Carol s heart swelled How loyal he is Depend on him He d come if nobody else did Even though he doesn t care for the game The old darling Kennicott did not alight He called out Carrie Harry Haydock phoned me that they ve decided to hold the tennis matches or whatever you call em down at the cottages at the lake instead of here The bunch are down there now Haydocks and Dyers and Clarks and everybody Harry wanted to know if I d bring you down I guess I can take the time come right back after supper Before Carol could sum it all up Erik stammered Why Haydock didn t say anything to me about the change Of course he s the president but Kennicott looked at him heavily and grunted I don t know a thing about it Coming Carrie I am not The match was to be here and it will be here You can tell Harry Haydock that he s beastly rude She rallied the five who had been left out who would always be left out Come on We ll toss to see which four of us play the Only and Original First Annual Tennis Tournament of Forest Hills Del Monte and Gopher Prairie Don t know as I blame you said Kennicott Well have supper at home then He drove off She hated him for his composure He had ruined her defiance She felt much less like Susan B Anthony as she turned to her huddled followers missus Dillon and Willis Woodford lost the toss The others played out the game slowly painfully stumbling on the rough earth muffing the easiest shots watched only by the small boy and his sniveling sister Beyond the court stretched the eternal stubble fields The four marionettes awkwardly going through exercises insignificant in the hot sweep of contemptuous land were not heroic their voices did not ring out in the score but sounded apologetic and when the game was over they glanced about as though they were waiting to be laughed at They walked home Carol took Erik s arm Through her thin linen sleeve she could feel the crumply warmth of his familiar brown jersey coat She observed that there were purple and red gold threads interwoven with the brown She remembered the first time she had seen it Their talk was nothing but improvisations on the theme I never did like this Haydock He just considers his own convenience Ahead of them the Dillons and Woodfords spoke of the weather and B J Gougerling s new bungalow No one referred to their tennis tournament At her gate Carol shook hands firmly with Erik and smiled at him Next morning Sunday morning when Carol was on the porch the Haydocks drove up We didn t mean to be rude to you dearie implored Juanita I wouldn t have you think that for anything We planned that Will and you should come down and have supper at our cottage No I m sure you didn t mean to be Carol was super neighborly But I do think you ought to apologize to poor Erik Valborg He was terribly hurt Oh Valborg I don t care so much what he thinks objected Harry He s nothing but a conceited buttinsky Juanita and I kind of figured he was trying to run this tennis thing too darn much anyway But you asked him to make arrangements I know but I don t like him Good Lord you couldn t hurt his feelings He dresses up like a chorus man and by golly he looks like one but he s nothing but a Swede farm boy and these foreigners they all got hides like a covey of rhinoceroses But he IS hurt Well I don t suppose I ought to have gone off half cocked and not jollied him along I ll give him a cigar He ll Juanita had been licking her lips and staring at Carol She interrupted her husband Yes I do think Harry ought to fix it up with him You LIKE him DON T you Carol Over and through Carol ran a frightened cautiousness Like him I haven t an i dea He seems to be a very decent young man I just felt that when he d worked so hard on the plans for the match it was a shame not to be nice to him Maybe there s something to that mumbled Harry then at sight of Kennicott coming round the corner tugging the red garden hose by its brass nozzle he roared in relief What d you think you re trying to do doc While Kennicott explained in detail all that he thought he was trying to do while he rubbed his chin and gravely stated Struck me the grass was looking kind of brown in patches didn t know but what I d give it a sprinkling and while Harry agreed that this was an excellent idea Juanita made friendly noises and behind the gilt screen of an affectionate smile watched Carol s face IV She wanted to see Erik She wanted some one to play with There wasn t even so dignified and sound an excuse as having Kennicott s trousers pressed when she inspected them all three pairs looked discouragingly neat She probably would not have ventured on it had she not spied Nat Hicks in the pool parlor being witty over bottle pool Erik was alone She fluttered toward the tailor shop dashed into its slovenly heat with the comic fastidiousness of a humming bird dipping into a dry tiger lily It was after she had entered that she found an excuse Erik was in the back room cross legged on a long table sewing a vest But he looked as though he were doing this eccentric thing to amuse himself Hello I wonder if you couldn t plan a sports suit for me she said breathlessly He stared at her he protested No I won t God I m not going to be a tailor with you Why Erik she said like a mildly shocked mother It occurred to her that she did not need a suit and that the order might have been hard to explain to Kennicott He swung down from the table I want to show you something He rummaged in the roll top desk on which Nat Hicks kept bills buttons calendars buckles thread channeled wax shotgun shells samples of brocade for fancy vests fishing reels pornographic post cards shreds of buckram lining He pulled out a blurred sheet of Bristol board and anxiously gave it to her It was a sketch for a frock It was not well drawn it was too finicking the pillars in the background were grotesquely squat But the frock had an original back very low with a central triangular section from the waist to a string of jet beads at the neck It s stunning But how it would shock missus Clark Yes wouldn t it You must let yourself go more when you re drawing Don t know if I can I ve started kind of late But listen What do you think I ve done this two weeks I ve read almost clear through a Latin grammar and about twenty pages of Caesar Splendid You are lucky You haven t a teacher to make you artificial You re my teacher There was a dangerous edge of personality to his voice She was offended and agitated She turned her shoulder on him stared through the back window studying this typical center of a typical Main Street block a vista hidden from casual strollers The backs of the chief establishments in town surrounded a quadrangle neglected dirty and incomparably dismal From the front Howland Gould s grocery was smug enough but attached to the rear was a lean to of storm streaked pine lumber with a sanded tar roof a staggering doubtful shed behind which was a heap of ashes splintered packing boxes shreds of excelsior crumpled straw board broken olive bottles rotten fruit and utterly disintegrated vegetables orange carrots turning black and potatoes with ulcers The rear of the Bon Ton Store was grim with blistered black painted iron shutters under them a pile of once glossy red shirt boxes now a pulp from recent rain As seen from Main Street Oleson McGuire s Meat Market had a sanitary and virtuous expression with its new tile counter fresh sawdust on the floor and a hanging veal cut in rosettes But she now viewed a back room with a homemade refrigerator of yellow smeared with black grease A man in an apron spotted with dry blood was hoisting out a hard slab of meat Behind Billy s Lunch the cook in an apron which must long ago have been white smoked a pipe and spat at the pest of sticky flies In the center of the block by itself was the stable for the three horses of the drayman and beside it a pile of manure The rear of Ezra Stowbody s bank was whitewashed and back of it was a concrete walk and a three foot square of grass but the window was barred and behind the bars she saw Willis Woodford cramped over figures in pompous books He raised his head jerkily rubbed his eyes and went back to the eternity of figures The backs of the other shops were an impressionistic picture of dirty grays drained browns writhing heaps of refuse Mine is a back yard romance with a journeyman tailor She was saved from self pity as she began to think through Erik s mind She turned to him with an indignant It s disgusting that this is all you have to look at He considered it Outside there I don t notice much I m learning to look inside Not awful easy Yes I must be hurrying As she walked home without hurrying she remembered her father saying to a serious ten year old Carol Lady only a fool thinks he s superior to beautiful bindings but only a double distilled fool reads nothing but bindings She was startled by the return of her father startled by a sudden conviction that in this flaxen boy she had found the gray reticent judge who was divine love perfect under standing She debated it furiously denied it reaffirmed it ridiculed it Of one thing she was unhappily certain there was nothing of the beloved father image in Will Kennicott V She wondered why she sang so often and why she found so many pleasant things lamplight seen though trees on a cool evening sunshine on brown wood morning sparrows black sloping roofs turned to plates of silver by moonlight Pleasant things small friendly things and pleasant places a field of goldenrod a pasture by the creek and suddenly a wealth of pleasant people Vida was lenient to Carol at the surgical dressing class missus Dave Dyer flattered her with questions about her health baby cook and opinions on the war missus Dyer seemed not to share the town s prejudice against Erik He s a nice looking fellow we must have him go on one of our picnics some time Unexpectedly Dave Dyer also liked him The tight fisted little farceur had a confused reverence for anything that seemed to him refined or clever He answered Harry Haydock s sneers That s all right now Elizabeth may doll himself up too much but he s smart and don t you forget it I was asking round trying to find out where this Ukraine is and darn if he didn t tell me What s the matter with his talking so polite Hell s bells Harry no harm in being polite There s some regular he men that are just as polite as women prett near Carol found herself going about rejoicing How neighborly the town is She drew up with a dismayed Am I falling in love with this boy That s ridiculous I m merely interested in him I like to think of helping him to succeed But as she dusted the living room mended a collar band bathed Hugh she was picturing herself and a young artistan Apollo nameless and evasive building a house in the Berkshires or in Virginia exuberantly buying a chair with his first check reading poetry together and frequently being earnest over valuable statistics about labor tumbling out of bed early for a Sunday walk and chattering where Kennicott would have yawned over bread and butter by a lake Hugh was in her pictures and he adored the young artist who made castles of chairs and rugs for him Beyond these playtimes she saw the things I could do for Erik and she admitted that Erik did partly make up the image of her altogether perfect artist In panic she insisted on being attentive to Kennicott when he wanted to be left alone to read the newspaper VI She needed new clothes Kennicott had promised We ll have a good trip down to the Cities in the fall and take plenty of time for it and you can get your new glad rags then But as she examined her wardrobe she flung her ancient black velvet frock on the floor and raged They re disgraceful Everything I have is falling to pieces There was a new dressmaker and milliner a missus Swiftwaite It was said that she was not altogether an elevating influence in the way she glanced at men that she would as soon take away a legally appropriated husband as not that if there WAS any mister Swiftwaite it certainly was strange that nobody seemed to know anything about him But she had made for Rita Gould an organdy frock and hat to match universally admitted to be too cunning for words and the matrons went cautiously with darting eyes and excessive politeness to the rooms which missus Swiftwaite had taken in the old Luke Dawson house on Floral Avenue With none of the spiritual preparation which normally precedes the buying of new clothes in Gopher Prairie Carol marched into missus Swiftwaite s and demanded I want to see a hat and possibly a blouse In the dingy old front parlor which she had tried to make smart with a pier glass covers from fashion magazines anemic French prints missus Swiftwaite moved smoothly among the dress dummies and hat rests spoke smoothly as she took up a small black and red turban I am sure the lady will find this extremely attractive It s dreadfully tabby and small towny thought Carol while she soothed I don t believe it quite goes with me It s the choicest thing I have and I m sure you ll find it suits you beautifully It has a great deal of chic Please try it on said missus Swiftwaite more smoothly than ever Carol studied the woman She was as imitative as a glass diamond She was the more rustic in her effort to appear urban She wore a severe high collared blouse with a row of small black buttons which was becoming to her low breasted slim neatness but her skirt was hysterically checkered her cheeks were too highly rouged her lips too sharply penciled She was magnificently a specimen of the illiterate divorcee of forty made up to look thirty clever and alluring While she was trying on the hat Carol felt very condescending She took it off shook her head explained with the kind smile for inferiors I m afraid it won t do though it s unusually nice for so small a town as this But it s really absolutely New Yorkish Well it You see I know my New York styles I lived in New York for years besides almost a year in Akron You did Carol was polite and edged away and went home unhappily She was wondering whether her own airs were as laughable as missus Swiftwaite s She put on the eye glasses which Kennicott had recently given to her for reading and looked over a grocery bill She went hastily up to her room to her mirror She was in a mood of self depreciation Accurately or not this was the picture she saw in the mirror Neat rimless eye glasses Black hair clumsily tucked under a mauve straw hat which would have suited a spinster Cheeks clear bloodless Thin nose Gentle mouth and chin A modest voile blouse with an edging of lace at the neck A virginal sweetness and timorousness no flare of gaiety no suggestion of cities music quick laughter I have become a small town woman Absolute Typical Modest and moral and safe Protected from life GENTEEL The Village Virus the village virtuousness My hair just scrambled together What can Erik see in that wedded spinster there He does like me Because I m the only woman who s decent to him How long before he ll wake up to me I ve waked up to myself Am I as old as as old as I am Not really old Become careless Let myself look tabby I want to chuck every stitch I own Black hair and pale cheeks they d go with a Spanish dancer s costume rose behind my ear scarlet mantilla over one shoulder the other bare She seized the rouge sponge daubed her cheeks scratched at her lips with the vermilion pencil until they stung tore open her collar She posed with her thin arms in the attitude of the fandango She dropped them sharply She shook her head My heart doesn t dance she said She flushed as she fastened her blouse At least I m much more graceful than Fern Mullins Heavens When I came here from the Cities girls imitated me Now I m trying to imitate a city girl CHAPTER XXX FERN Mullins rushed into the house on a Saturday morning early in September and shrieked at Carol School starts next Tuesday I ve got to have one more spree before I m arrested Let s get up a picnic down the lake for this afternoon Won t you come missus Kennicott and the doctor Cy Bogart wants to go he s a brat but he s lively I don t think the doctor can go sedately He said something about having to make a country call this afternoon But I d love to That s dandy Who can we get missus Dyer might be chaperon She s been so nice And maybe Dave if he could get away from the store How about Erik Valborg I think he s got lots more style than these town boys You like him all right don t you So the picnic of Carol Fern Erik Cy Bogart and the Dyers was not only moral but inevitable They drove to the birch grove on the south shore of Lake Minniemashie Dave Dyer was his most clownish self He yelped jigged wore Carol s hat dropped an ant down Fern s back and when they went swimming the women modestly changing in the car with the side curtains up the men undressing behind the bushes constantly repeating Gee hope we don t run into poison ivy Dave splashed water on them and dived to clutch his wife s ankle He infected the others Erik gave an imitation of the Greek dancers he had seen in vaudeville and when they sat down to picnic supper spread on a lap robe on the grass Cy climbed a tree to throw acorns at them But Carol could not frolic She had made herself young with parted hair sailor blouse and large blue bow white canvas shoes and short linen skirt Her mirror had asserted that she looked exactly as she had in college that her throat was smooth her collar bone not very noticeable But she was under restraint When they swam she enjoyed the freshness of the water but she was irritated by Cy s tricks by Dave s excessive good spirits She admired Erik s dance he could never betray bad taste as Cy did and Dave She waited for him to come to her He did not come By his joyousness he had apparently endeared himself to the Dyers Maud watched him and after supper cried to him Come sit down beside me bad boy Carol winced at his willingness to be a bad boy and come and sit at his enjoyment of a not very stimulating game in which Maud Dave and Cy snatched slices of cold tongue from one another s plates Maud it seemed was slightly dizzy from the swim She remarked publicly doctor Kennicott has helped me so much by putting me on a diet but it was to Erik alone that she gave the complete version of her peculiarity in being so sensitive so easily hurt by the slightest cross word that she simply had to have nice cheery friends Erik was nice and cheery Carol assured herself Whatever faults I may have I certainly couldn t ever be jealous I do like Maud she s always so pleasant But I wonder if she isn t just a bit fond of fishing for men s sympathy Playing with Erik and her married Well But she looks at him in that languishing swooning mid Victorian way Disgusting Cy Bogart lay between the roots of a big birch smoking his pipe and teasing Fern assuring her that a week from now when he was again a high school boy and she his teacher he d wink at her in class Maud Dyer wanted Erik to come down to the beach to see the darling little minnies Carol was left to Dave who tried to entertain her with humorous accounts of Ella Stowbody s fondness for chocolate peppermints She watched Maud Dyer put her hand on Erik s shoulder to steady herself Disgusting she thought Cy Bogart covered Fern s nervous hand with his red paw and when she bounced with half anger and shrieked Let go I tell you he grinned and waved his pipe a gangling twenty year old satyr Disgusting When Maud and Erik returned and the grouping shifted Erik muttered at Carol There s a boat on shore Let s skip off and have a row What will they think she worried She saw Maud Dyer peer at Erik with moist possessive eyes Yes Let s she said She cried to the party with the canonical amount of sprightliness Good by everybody We ll wireless you from China As the rhythmic oars plopped and creaked as she floated on an unreality of delicate gray over which the sunset was poured out thin the irritation of Cy and Maud slipped away Erik smiled at her proudly She considered him coatless in white thin shirt She was conscious of his male differentness of his flat masculine sides his thin thighs his easy rowing They talked of the library of the movies He hummed and she softly sang Swing Low Sweet Chariot A breeze shivered across the agate lake The wrinkled water was like armor damascened and polished The breeze flowed round the boat in a chill current Carol drew the collar of her middy blouse over her bare throat Getting cold Afraid we ll have to go back she said Let s not go back to them yet They ll be cutting up Let s keep along the shore But you enjoy the cutting up Maud and you had a beautiful time Why We just walked on the shore and talked about fishing She was relieved and apologetic to her friend Maud Of course I was joking I ll tell you Let s land here and sit on the shore that bunch of hazel brush will shelter us from the wind and watch the sunset It s like melted lead Just a short while We don t want to go back and listen to them No but She said nothing while he sped ashore The keel clashed on the stones He stood on the forward seat holding out his hand They were alone in the ripple lapping silence She rose slowly slowly stepped over the water in the bottom of the old boat She took his hand confidently Unspeaking they sat on a bleached log in a russet twilight which hinted of autumn Linden leaves fluttered about them I wish Are you cold now he whispered A little She shivered But it was not with cold I wish we could curl up in the leaves there covered all up and lie looking out at the dark I wish we could As though it was comfortably understood that he did not mean to be taken seriously Like what all the poets say brown nymph and faun No I can t be a nymph any more Too old Erik am I old Am I faded and small towny Why you re the youngest Your eyes are like a girl s They re so well I mean like you believed everything Even if you do teach me I feel a thousand years older than you instead of maybe a year younger Four or five years younger Anyway your eyes are so innocent and your cheeks so soft Damn it it makes me want to cry somehow you re so defenseless and I want to protect you and There s nothing to protect you against Am I young Am I Honestly Truly She betrayed for a moment the childish mock imploring tone that comes into the voice of the most serious woman when an agreeable man treats her as a girl the childish tone and childish pursed up lips and shy lift of the cheek Yes you are You re dear to believe it Will ERIK Will you play with me A lot Perhaps Would you really like to curl in the leaves and watch the stars swing by overhead I think it s rather better to be sitting here He twined his fingers with hers And Erik we must go back Why It s somewhat late to outline all the history of social custom I know We must Are you glad we ran away though Yes She was quiet perfectly simple But she rose He circled her waist with a brusque arm She did not resist She did not care He was neither a peasant tailor a potential artist a social complication nor a peril He was himself and in him in the personality flowing from him she was unreasoningly content In his nearness she caught a new view of his head the last light brought out the planes of his neck his flat ruddied cheeks the side of his nose the depression of his temples Not as coy or uneasy lovers but as companions they walked to the boat and he lifted her up on the prow She began to talk intently as he rowed Erik you ve got to work You ought to be a personage You re robbed of your kingdom Fight for it Take one of these correspondence courses in drawing they mayn t be any good in themselves but they ll make you try to draw and As they reached the picnic ground she perceived that it was dark that they had been gone for a long time What will they say she wondered The others greeted them with the inevitable storm of humor and slight vexation Where the deuce do you think you ve been You re a fine pair you are Erik and Carol looked self conscious failed in their effort to be witty All the way home Carol was embarrassed Once Cy winked at her That Cy the Peeping Tom of the garage loft should consider her a fellow sinner She was furious and frightened and exultant by turns and in all her moods certain that Kennicott would read her adventuring in her face She came into the house awkwardly defiant Her husband half asleep under the lamp greeted her Well well have nice time She could not answer He looked at her But his look did not sharpen He began to wind his watch yawning the old Welllllll guess it s about time to turn in That was all Yet she was not glad She was almost disappointed II missus Bogart called next day She had a hen like crumb pecking diligent appearance Her smile was too innocent The pecking started instantly Cy says you had lots of fun at the picnic yesterday Did you enjoy it Oh yes I raced Cy at swimming He beat me badly He s so strong isn t he Poor boy just crazy to get into the war too but This Erik Valborg was along wa n t he Yes I think he s an awful handsome fellow and they say he s smart Do you like him He seems very polite Cy says you and him had a lovely boat ride My that must have been pleasant Yes except that I couldn t get mister Valborg to say a word I wanted to ask him about the suit mister Hicks is making for my husband But he insisted on singing Still it was restful floating around on the water and singing So happy and innocent Don t you think it s a shame missus Bogart that people in this town don t do more nice clean things like that instead of all this horrible gossiping Yes Yes missus Bogart sounded vacant Her bonnet was awry she was incomparably dowdy Carol stared at her felt contemptuous ready at last to rebel against the trap and as the rusty goodwife fished again Plannin some more picnics she flung out I haven t the slightest idea Oh Is that Hugh crying I must run up to him But up stairs she remembered that missus Bogart had seen her walking with Erik from the railroad track into town and she was chilly with disquietude At the Jolly Seventeen two days after she was effusive to Maud Dyer to Juanita Haydock She fancied that every one was watching her but she could not be sure and in rare strong moments she did not care She could rebel against the town s prying now that she had something however indistinct for which to rebel In a passionate escape there must be not only a place from which to flee but a place to which to flee She had known that she would gladly leave Gopher Prairie leave Main Street and all that it signified but she had had no destination She had one now That destination was not Erik Valborg and the love of Erik She continued to assure herself that she wasn t in love with him but merely fond of him and interested in his success Yet in him she had discovered both her need of youth and the fact that youth would welcome her It was not Erik to whom she must escape but universal and joyous youth in class rooms in studios in offices in meetings to protest against Things in General But universal and joyous youth rather resembled Erik All week she thought of things she wished to say to him High improving things She began to admit that she was lonely without him Then she was afraid It was at the Baptist church supper a week after the picnic that she saw him again She had gone with Kennicott and Aunt Bessie to the supper which was spread on oilcloth covered and trestle supported tables in the church basement Erik was helping Myrtle Cass to fill coffee cups for the waitresses The congregation had doffed their piety Children tumbled under the tables and Deacon Pierson greeted the women with a rolling Where s Brother Jones sister where s Brother Jones Not going to be with us tonight Well you tell Sister Perry to hand you a plate and make em give you enough oyster pie Erik shared in the cheerfulness He laughed with Myrtle jogged her elbow when she was filling cups made deep mock bows to the waitresses as they came up for coffee Myrtle was enchanted by his humor From the other end of the room a matron among matrons Carol observed Myrtle and hated her and caught herself at it To be jealous of a wooden faced village girl But she kept it up She detested Erik gloated over his gaucheries his breaks she called them When he was too expressive too much like a Russian dancer in saluting Deacon Pierson Carol had the ecstasy of pain in seeing the deacon s sneer When trying to talk to three girls at once he dropped a cup and effeminately wailed Oh dear she sympathized with and ached over the insulting secret glances of the girls From meanly hating him she rose to compassion as she saw that his eyes begged every one to like him She perceived how inaccurate her judgments could be At the picnic she had fancied that Maud Dyer looked upon Erik too sentimentally and she had snarled I hate these married women who cheapen themselves and feed on boys But at the supper Maud was one of the waitresses she bustled with platters of cake she was pleasant to old women and to Erik she gave no attention at all Indeed when she had her own supper she joined the Kennicotts and how ludicrous it was to suppose that Maud was a gourmet of emotions Carol saw in the fact that she talked not to one of the town beaux but to the safe Kennicott himself When Carol glanced at Erik again she discovered that missus Bogart had an eye on her It was a shock to know that at last there was something which could make her afraid of missus Bogart s spying What am I doing Am I in love with Erik Unfaithful I I want youth but I don t want him I mean I don t want youth enough to break up my life I must get out of this Quick She said to Kennicott on their way home Will I want to run away for a few days Wouldn t you like to skip down to Chicago Still be pretty hot there No fun in a big city till winter What do you want to go for People To occupy my mind I want stimulus Stimulus He spoke good naturedly Who s been feeding you meat You got that stimulus out of one of these fool stories about wives that don t know when they re well off Stimulus Seriously though to cut out the jollying I can t get away Then why don t I run off by myself Why Tisn t the money you understand But what about Hugh Leave him with Aunt Bessie It would be just for a few days I don t think much of this business of leaving kids around Bad for em So you don t think I ll tell you I think we better stay put till after the war Then we ll have a dandy long trip No I don t think you better plan much about going away now So she was thrown at Erik III She awoke at ebb time at three of the morning woke sharply and fully and sharply and coldly as her father pronouncing sentence on a cruel swindler she gave judgment A pitiful and tawdry love affair No splendor no defiance A self deceived little woman whispering in corners with a pretentious little man No he is not He is fine Aspiring It s not his fault His eyes are sweet when he looks at me Sweet so sweet She pitied herself that her romance should be pitiful she sighed that in this colorless hour to this austere self it should seem tawdry Then in a very great desire of rebellion and unleashing of all her hatreds The pettier and more tawdry it is the more blame to Main Street It shows how much I ve been longing to escape Any way out Any humility so long as I can flee Main Street has done this to me I came here eager for nobilities ready for work and now Any way out I came trusting them They beat me with rods of dullness They don t know they don t understand how agonizing their complacent dullness is Like ants and August sun on a wound Tawdry Pitiful Carol the clean girl that used to walk so fast sneaking and tittering in dark corners being sentimental and jealous at church suppers At breakfast time her agonies were night blurred and persisted only as a nervous irresolution IV Few of the aristocrats of the Jolly Seventeen attended the humble folk meets of the Baptist and Methodist church suppers where the Willis Woodfords the Dillons the Champ Perrys Oleson the butcher Brad Bemis the tinsmith and Deacon Pierson found release from loneliness But all of the smart set went to the lawn festivals of the Episcopal Church and were reprovingly polite to outsiders The Harry Haydocks gave the last lawn festival of the season a splendor of Japanese lanterns and card tables and chicken patties and Neapolitan ice cream Erik was no longer entirely an outsider He was eating his ice cream with a group of the people most solidly in the Dyers Myrtle Cass Guy Pollock the Jackson Elders The Haydocks themselves kept aloof but the others tolerated him He would never Carol fancied be one of the town pillars because he was not orthodox in hunting and motoring and poker But he was winning approbation by his liveliness his gaiety the qualities least important in him When the group summoned Carol she made several very well taken points in regard to the weather Myrtle cried to Erik Come on We don t belong with these old folks I want to make you quainted with the jolliest girl she comes from Wakamin she s staying with Mary Howland Carol saw him being profuse to the guest from Wakamin She saw him confidentially strolling with Myrtle She burst out to missus Westlake Valborg and Myrtle seem to have quite a crush on each other missus Westlake glanced at her curiously before she mumbled Yes don t they I m mad to talk this way Carol worried She had regained a feeling of social virtue by telling Juanita Haydock how darling her lawn looked with the Japanese lanterns when she saw that Erik was stalking her Though he was merely ambling about with his hands in his pockets though he did not peep at her she knew that he was calling her She sidled away from Juanita Erik hastened to her She nodded coolly she was proud of her coolness Carol I ve got a wonderful chance Don t know but what some ways it might be better than going East to take art Myrtle Cass says I dropped in to say howdy to Myrtle last evening and had quite a long talk with her father and he said he was hunting for a fellow to go to work in the flour mill and learn the whole business and maybe become general manager I know something about wheat from my farming and I worked a couple of months in the flour mill at Curlew when I got sick of tailoring What do you think You said any work was artistic if it was done by an artist And flour is so important What do you think Wait Wait This sensitive boy would be very skilfully stamped into conformity by Lyman Cass and his sallow daughter but did she detest the plan for this reason I must be honest I mustn t tamper with his future to please my vanity But she had no sure vision She turned on him How can I decide It s up to you Do you want to become a person like Lym Cass or do you want to become a person like yes like me Wait Don t be flattering Be honest This is important I know I am a person like you now I mean I want to rebel Yes We re alike gravely Only I m not sure I can put through my schemes I really can t draw much I guess I have pretty fair taste in fabrics but since I ve known you I don t like to think about fussing with dress designing But as a miller I d have the means books piano travel I m going to be frank and beastly Don t you realize that it isn t just because her papa needs a bright young man in the mill that Myrtle is amiable to you Can t you understand what she ll do to you when she has you when she sends you to church and makes you become respectable He glared at her I don t know I suppose so You are thoroughly unstable What if I am Most fish out of water are Don t talk like missus Bogart How can I be anything but unstable wandering from farm to tailor shop to books no training nothing but trying to make books talk to me Probably I ll fail Oh I know it probably I m uneven But I m not unstable in thinking about this job in the mill and Myrtle I know what I want I want you Please please oh please I do I m not a schoolboy any more I want you If I take Myrtle it s to forget you Please please It s you that are unstable You talk at things and play at things but you re scared Would I mind it if you and I went off to poverty and I had to dig ditches I would not But you would I think you would come to like me but you won t admit it I wouldn t have said this but when you sneer at Myrtle and the mill If I m not to have good sensible things like those d you think I ll be content with trying to become a damn dressmaker after YOU Are you fair Are you No I suppose not Do you like me Do you Yes No Please I can t talk any more Not here missus Haydock is looking at us No nor anywhere O Erik I am fond of you but I m afraid What of Of Them Of my rulers Gopher Prairie My dear boy we are talking very foolishly I am a normal wife and a good mother and you are oh a college freshman You do like me I m going to make you love me She looked at him once recklessly and walked away with a serene gait that was a disordered flight Kennicott grumbled on their way home You and this Valborg fellow seem quite chummy Oh we are He s interested in Myrtle Cass and I was telling him how nice she is In her room she marveled I have become a liar I m snarled with lies and foggy analyses and desires I who was clear and sure She hurried into Kennicott s room sat on the edge of his bed He flapped a drowsy welcoming hand at her from the expanse of quilt and dented pillows Will I really think I ought to trot off to saint Paul or Chicago or some place I thought we settled all that few nights ago Wait till we can have a real trip He shook himself out of his drowsiness You might give me a good night kiss She did dutifully He held her lips against his for an intolerable time Don t you like the old man any more he coaxed He sat up and shyly fitted his palm about the slimness of her waist Of course I like you very much indeed Even to herself it sounded flat She longed to be able to throw into her voice the facile passion of a light woman She patted his cheek He sighed I m sorry you re so tired Seems like But of course you aren t very strong Yes Then you don t think you re quite sure I ought to stay here in town I told you so I certainly do She crept back to her room a small timorous figure in white I can t face Will down demand the right He d be obstinate And I can t even go off and earn my living again Out of the habit of it He s driving me I m afraid of what he s driving me to Afraid That man in there snoring in stale air my husband Could any ceremony make him my husband No I don t want to hurt him I want to love him I can t when I m thinking of Erik Am I too honest a funny topsy turvy honesty the faithfulness of unfaith I wish I had a more compartmental mind like men I m too monogamous toward Erik my child Erik who needs me Is an illicit affair like a gambling debt demands stricter honor than the legitimate debt of matrimony because it s not legally enforced That s nonsense I don t care in the least for Erik Not for any man I want to be let alone in a woman world a world without Main Street or politicians or business men or men with that sudden beastly hungry look that glistening unfrank expression that wives know If Erik were here if he would just sit quiet and kind and talk I could be still I could go to sleep I am so tired If I could sleep CHAPTER XXXI THEIR night came unheralded Kennicott was on a country call It was cool but Carol huddled on the porch rocking meditating rocking The house was lonely and repellent and though she sighed I ought to go in and read so many things to read ought to go in she remained Suddenly Erik was coming turning in swinging open the screen door touching her hand Erik Saw your husband driving out of town Couldn t stand it Well You mustn t stay more than five minutes Couldn t stand not seeing you Every day towards evening felt I had to see you pictured you so clear I ve been good though staying away haven t I And you must go on being good Why must I We better not stay here on the porch The Howlands across the street are such window peepers and missus Bogart She did not look at him but she could divine his tremulousness as he stumbled indoors A moment ago the night had been coldly empty now it was incalculable hot treacherous But it is women who are the calm realists once they discard the fetishes of the premarital hunt Carol was serene as she murmured Hungry I have some little honey colored cakes You may have two and then you must skip home Take me up and let me see Hugh asleep I don t believe Just a glimpse Well She doubtfully led the way to the hallroom nursery Their heads close Erik s curls pleasant as they touched her cheek they looked in at the baby Hugh was pink with slumber He had burrowed into his pillow with such energy that it was almost smothering him Beside it was a celluloid rhinoceros tight in his hand a torn picture of Old King Cole Shhh said Carol quite automatically She tiptoed in to pat the pillow As she returned to Erik she had a friendly sense of his waiting for her They smiled at each other She did not think of Kennicott the baby s father What she did think was that some one rather like Erik an older and surer Erik ought to be Hugh s father The three of them would play incredible imaginative games Carol You ve told me about your own room Let me peep in at it But you mustn t stay not a second We must go downstairs Yes Will you be good R reasonably He was pale large eyed serious You ve got to be more than reasonably good She felt sensible and superior she was energetic about pushing open the door Kennicott had always seemed out of place there but Erik surprisingly harmonized with the spirit of the room as he stroked the books glanced at the prints He held out his hands He came toward her She was weak betrayed to a warm softness Her head was tilted back Her eyes were closed Her thoughts were formless but many colored She felt his kiss diffident and reverent on her eyelid Then she knew that it was impossible She shook herself She sprang from him Please she said sharply He looked at her unyielding I am fond of you she said Don t spoil everything Be my friend How many thousands and millions of women must have said that And now you And it doesn t spoil everything It glorifies everything Dear I do think there s a tiny streak of fairy in you whatever you do with it Perhaps I d have loved that once But I won t It s too late But I ll keep a fondness for you Impersonal I will be impersonal It needn t be just a thin talky fondness You do need me don t you Only you and my son need me I ve wanted so to be wanted Once I wanted love to be given to me Now I ll be content if I can give Almost content We women we like to do things for men Poor men We swoop on you when you re defenseless and fuss over you and insist on reforming you But it s so pitifully deep in us You ll be the one thing in which I haven t failed Do something definite Even if it s just selling cottons Sell beautiful cottons caravans from China Carol Stop You do love me I do not It s just Can t you understand Everything crushes in on me so all the gaping dull people and I look for a way out Please go I can t stand any more Please He was gone And she was not relieved by the quiet of the house She was empty and the house was empty and she needed him She wanted to go on talking to get this threshed out to build a sane friendship She wavered down to the living room looked out of the bay window He was not to be seen But missus Westlake was She was walking past and in the light from the corner arc lamp she quickly inspected the porch the windows Carol dropped the curtain stood with movement and reflection paralyzed Automatically without reasoning she mumbled I will see him again soon and make him understand we must be friends But The house is so empty It echoes so II Kennicott had seemed nervous and absent minded through that supper hour two evenings after He prowled about the living room then growled What the dickens have you been saying to Ma Westlake Carol s book rattled What do you mean I told you that Westlake and his wife were jealous of us and here you been chumming up to them and From what Dave tells me Ma Westlake has been going around town saying you told her that you hate Aunt Bessie and that you fixed up your own room because I snore and you said Bjornstam was too good for Bea and then just recent that you were sore on the town because we don t all go down on our knees and beg this Valborg fellow to come take supper with us God only knows what else she says you said It s not true any of it I did like missus Westlake and I ve called on her and apparently she s gone and twisted everything I ve said Sure Of course she would Didn t I tell you she would She s an old cat like her pussyfooting hand holding husband Lord if I was sick I d rather have a faith healer than Westlake and she s another slice off the same bacon What I can t understand though She waited taut is whatever possessed you to let her pump you bright a girl as you are I don t care what you told her we all get peeved sometimes and want to blow off steam that s natural but if you wanted to keep it dark why didn t you advertise it in the Dauntless or get a megaphone and stand on top of the hotel and holler or do anything besides spill it to her I know You told me But she was so motherly And I didn t have any woman Vida s become so married and proprietary Well next time you ll have better sense He patted her head flumped down behind his newspaper said nothing more Enemies leered through the windows stole on her from the hall She had no one save Erik This kind good man Kennicott he was an elder brother It was Erik her fellow outcast to whom she wanted to run for sanctuary Through her storm she was to the eye sitting quietly with her fingers between the pages of a baby blue book on home dressmaking But her dismay at missus Westlake s treachery had risen to active dread What had the woman said of her and Erik What did she know What had she seen Who else would join in the baying hunt Who else had seen her with Erik What had she to fear from the Dyers Cy Bogart Juanita Aunt Bessie What precisely had she answered to missus Bogart s questioning All next day she was too restless to stay home yet as she walked the streets on fictitious errands she was afraid of every person she met She waited for them to speak waited with foreboding She repeated I mustn t ever see Erik again But the words did not register She had no ecstatic indulgence in the sense of guilt which is to the women of Main Street the surest escape from blank tediousness At five crumpled in a chair in the living room she started at the sound of the bell Some one opened the door She waited uneasy Vida Sherwin charged into the room Here s the one person I can trust Carol rejoiced Vida was serious but affectionate She bustled at Carol with Oh there you are dearie so glad t find you in sit down want to talk to you Carol sat obedient Vida fussily tugged over a large chair and launched out I ve been hearing vague rumors you were interested in this Erik Valborg I knew you couldn t be guilty and I m surer than ever of it now Here we are as blooming as a daisy How does a respectable matron look when she feels guilty Carol sounded resentful Why Oh it would show Besides I know that you of all people are the one that can appreciate doctor Will What have you been hearing Nothing really I just heard missus Bogart say she d seen you and Valborg walking together a lot Vida s chirping slackened She looked at her nails But I suspect you do like Valborg Oh I don t mean in any wrong way But you re young you don t know what an innocent liking might drift into You always pretend to be so sophisticated and all but you re a baby Just because you are so innocent you don t know what evil thoughts may lurk in that fellow s brain You don t suppose Valborg could actually think about making love to me Her rather cheap sport ended abruptly as Vida cried with contorted face What do you know about the thoughts in hearts You just play at reforming the world You don t know what it means to suffer There are two insults which no human being will endure the assertion that he hasn t a sense of humor and the doubly impertinent assertion that he has never known trouble Carol said furiously You think I don t suffer You think I ve always had an easy No you don t I m going to tell you something I ve never told a living soul not even Ray The dam of repressed imagination which Vida had builded for years which now with Raymie off at the wars she was building again gave way I was I liked Will terribly well One time at a party oh before he met you of course but we held hands and we were so happy But I didn t feel I was really suited to him I let him go Please don t think I still love him I see now that Ray was predestined to be my mate But because I liked him I know how sincere and pure and noble Will is and his thoughts never straying from the path of rectitude and If I gave him up to you at least you ve got to appreciate him We danced together and laughed so and I gave him up but This IS my affair I m NOT intruding I see the whole thing as he does because of all I ve told you Maybe it s shameless to bare my heart this way but I do it for him for him and you Carol understood that Vida believed herself to have recited minutely and brazenly a story of intimate love understood that in alarm she was trying to cover her shame as she struggled on Liked him in the most honorable way simply can t help it if I still see things through his eyes If I gave him up I certainly am not beyond my rights in demanding that you take care to avoid even the appearance of evil and She was weeping an insignificant flushed ungracefully weeping woman Carol could not endure it She ran to Vida kissed her forehead comforted her with a murmur of dove like sounds sought to reassure her with worn and hastily assembled gifts of words Oh I appreciate it so much and You are so fine and splendid and Let me assure you there isn t a thing to what you ve heard and Oh indeed I do know how sincere Will is and as you say so so sincere Vida believed that she had explained many deep and devious matters She came out of her hysteria like a sparrow shaking off rain drops She sat up and took advantage of her victory I don t want to rub it in but you can see for yourself now this is all a result of your being so discontented and not appreciating the dear good people here And another thing People like you and me who want to reform things have to be particularly careful about appearances Think how much better you can criticize conventional customs if you yourself live up to them scrupulously Then people can t say you re attacking them to excuse your own infractions To Carol was given a sudden great philosophical understanding an explanation of half the cautious reforms in history Yes I ve heard that plea It s a good one It sets revolts aside to cool It keeps strays in the flock To word it differently You must live up to the popular code if you believe in it but if you don t believe in it then you MUST live up to it I don t think so at all said Vida vaguely She began to look hurt and Carol let her be oracular III Vida had done her a service had made all agonizing seem so fatuous that she ceased writhing and saw that her whole problem was simple as mutton she was interested in Erik s aspiration interest gave her a hesitating fondness for him and the future would take care of the event But at night thinking in bed she protested I m not a falsely accused innocent though If it were some one more resolute than Erik a fighter an artist with bearded surly lips They re only in books Is that the real tragedy that I never shall know tragedy never find anything but blustery complications that turn out to be a farce No one big enough or pitiful enough to sacrifice for Tragedy in neat blouses the eternal flame all nice and safe in a kerosene stove Neither heroic faith nor heroic guilt Peeping at love from behind lace curtains on Main Street Aunt Bessie crept in next day tried to pump her tried to prime the pump by again hinting that Kennicott might have his own affairs Carol snapped Whatever I may do I ll have you to understand that Will is only too safe She wished afterward that she had not been so lofty How much would Aunt Bessie make of Whatever I may do When Kennicott came home he poked at things and hemmed and brought out Saw aunty this afternoon She said you weren t very polite to her Carol laughed He looked at her in a puzzled way and fled to his newspaper IV She lay sleepless She alternately considered ways of leaving Kennicott and remembered his virtues pitied his bewilderment in face of the subtle corroding sicknesses which he could not dose nor cut out Didn t he perhaps need her more than did the book solaced Erik Suppose Will were to die suddenly Suppose she never again saw him at breakfast silent but amiable listening to her chatter Suppose he never again played elephant for Hugh Suppose A country call a slippery road his motor skidding the edge of the road crumbling the car turning turtle Will pinned beneath suffering brought home maimed looking at her with spaniel eyes or waiting for her calling for her while she was in Chicago knowing nothing of it Suppose he were sued by some vicious shrieking woman for malpractice He tried to get witnesses Westlake spread lies his friends doubted him his self confidence was so broken that it was horrible to see the indecision of the decisive man he was convicted handcuffed taken on a train She ran to his room At her nervous push the door swung sharply in struck a chair He awoke gasped then in a steady voice What is it dear Anything wrong She darted to him fumbled for the familiar harsh bristly cheek How well she knew it every seam and hardness of bone and roll of fat Yet when he sighed This is a nice visit and dropped his hand on her thin covered shoulder she said too cheerily I thought I heard you moaning So silly of me Good night dear V She did not see Erik for a fortnight save once at church and once when she went to the tailor shop to talk over the plans contingencies and strategy of Kennicott s annual campaign for getting a new suit Nat Hicks was there and he was not so deferential as he had been With unnecessary jauntiness he chuckled Some nice flannels them samples heh Needlessly he touched her arm to call attention to the fashion plates and humorously he glanced from her to Erik At home she wondered if the little beast might not be suggesting himself as a rival to Erik but that abysmal bedragglement she would not consider She saw Juanita Haydock slowly walking past the house as missus Westlake had once walked past She met missus Westlake in Uncle Whittier s store and before that alert stare forgot her determination to be rude and was shakily cordial She was sure that all the men on the street even Guy Pollock and Sam Clark leered at her in an interested hopeful way as though she were a notorious divorcee She felt as insecure as a shadowed criminal She wished to see Erik and wished that she had never seen him She fancied that Kennicott was the only person in town who did not know all know incomparably more than there was to know about herself and Erik She crouched in her chair as she imagined men talking of her thick voiced obscene in barber shops and the tobacco stinking pool parlor Through early autumn Fern Mullins was the only person who broke the suspense The frivolous teacher had come to accept Carol as of her own youth and though school had begun she rushed in daily to suggest dances welsh rabbit parties Fern begged her to go as chaperon to a barn dance in the country on a Saturday evening Carol could not go The next day the storm crashed CHAPTER XXXII I CAROL was on the back porch tightening a bolt on the baby s go cart this Sunday afternoon Through an open window of the Bogart house she heard a screeching heard missus Bogart s haggish voice did too and there s no use your denying it no you don t you march yourself right straight out of the house never in my life heard of such never had nobody talk to me like walk in the ways of sin and nastiness leave your clothes here and heaven knows that s more than you deserve any of your lip or I ll call the policeman The voice of the other interlocutor Carol did not catch nor though missus Bogart was proclaiming that he was her confidant and present assistant did she catch the voice of missus Bogart s God Another row with Cy Carol inferred She trundled the go cart down the back steps and tentatively wheeled it across the yard proud of her repairs She heard steps on the sidewalk She saw not Cy Bogart but Fern Mullins carrying a suit case hurrying up the street with her head low The widow standing on the porch with buttery arms akimbo yammered after the fleeing girl And don t you dare show your face on this block again You can send the drayman for your trunk My house has been contaminated long enough Why the Lord should afflict me Fern was gone The righteous widow glared banged into the house came out poking at her bonnet marched away By this time Carol was staring in a manner not visibly to be distinguished from the window peeping of the rest of Gopher Prairie She saw missus Bogart enter the Howland house then the Casses Not till suppertime did she reach the Kennicotts The doctor answered her ring and greeted her Well well how s the good neighbor The good neighbor charged into the living room waving the most unctuous of black kid gloves and delightedly sputtering You may well ask how I am I really do wonder how I could go through the awful scenes of this day and the impudence I took from that woman s tongue that ought to be cut out Whoa Whoa Hold up roared Kennicott Who s the hussy Sister Bogart Sit down and take it cool and tell us about it I can t sit down I must hurry home but I couldn t devote myself to my own selfish cares till I d warned you and heaven knows I don t expect any thanks for trying to warn the town against her there s always so much evil in the world that folks simply won t see or appreciate your trying to safeguard them And forcing herself in here to get in with you and Carrie many s the time I ve seen her doing it and thank heaven she was found out in time before she could do any more harm it simply breaks my heart and prostrates me to think what she may have done already even if some of us that understand and know about things Whoa up Who are you talking about She s talking about Fern Mullins Carol put in not pleasantly Huh Kennicott was incredulous I certainly am flourished missus Bogart and good and thankful you may be that I found her out in time before she could get YOU into something Carol because even if you are my neighbor and Will s wife and a cultured lady let me tell you right now Carol Kennicott that you ain t always as respectful to you ain t as reverent you don t stick by the good old ways like they was laid down for us by God in the Bible and while of course there ain t a bit of harm in having a good laugh and I know there ain t any real wickedness in you yet just the same you don t fear God and hate the transgressors of his commandments like you ought to and you may be thankful I found out this serpent I nourished in my bosom and oh yes oh yes indeed my lady must have two eggs every morning for breakfast and eggs sixty cents a dozen and wa n t satisfied with one like most folks what did she care how much they cost or if a person couldn t make hardly nothing on her board and room in fact I just took her in out of charity and I might have known from the kind of stockings and clothes that she sneaked into my house in her trunk Before they got her story she had five more minutes of obscene wallowing The gutter comedy turned into high tragedy with Nemesis in black kid gloves The actual story was simple depressing and unimportant As to details missus Bogart was indefinite and angry that she should be questioned Fern Mullins and Cy had the evening before driven alone to a barn dance in the country Carol brought out the admission that Fern had tried to get a chaperon At the dance Cy had kissed Fern she confessed that Cy had obtained a pint of whisky he said that he didn t remember where he had got it missus Bogart implied that Fern had given it to him Fern herself insisted that he had stolen it from a farmer s overcoat which missus Bogart raged was obviously a lie He had become soggily drunk Fern had driven him home deposited him retching and wabbling on the Bogart porch Never before had her boy been drunk shrieked missus Bogart When Kennicott grunted she owned Well maybe once or twice I ve smelled licker on his breath She also with an air of being only too scrupulously exact granted that sometimes he did not come home till morning But he couldn t ever have been drunk for he always had the best excuses the other boys had tempted him to go down the lake spearing pickerel by torchlight or he had been out in a machine that ran out of gas Anyway never before had her boy fallen into the hands of a designing woman What do you suppose Miss Mullins could design to do with him insisted Carol missus Bogart was puzzled gave it up went on This morning when she had faced both of them Cy had manfully confessed that all of the blame was on Fern because the teacher his own teacher had dared him to take a drink Fern had tried to deny it Then gabbled missus Bogart then that woman had the impudence to say to me What purpose could I have in wanting the filthy pup to get drunk That s just what she called him pup I ll have no such nasty language in my house I says and you pretending and pulling the wool over people s eyes and making them think you re educated and fit to be a teacher and look out for young people s morals you re worse n any street walker I says I let her have it good I wa n t going to flinch from my bounden duty and let her think that decent folks had to stand for her vile talk Purpose I says Purpose I ll tell you what purpose you had Ain t I seen you making up to everything in pants that d waste time and pay attention to your impert nence Ain t I seen you showing off your legs with them short skirts of yours trying to make out like you was so girlish and la de da running along the street Carol was very sick at this version of Fern s eager youth but she was sicker as missus Bogart hinted that no one could tell what had happened between Fern and Cy before the drive home Without exactly describing the scene by her power of lustful imagination the woman suggested dark country places apart from the lanterns and rude fiddling and banging dance steps in the barn then madness and harsh hateful conquest Carol was too sick to interrupt It was Kennicott who cried Oh for God s sake quit it You haven t any idea what happened You haven t given us a single proof yet that Fern is anything but a rattle brained youngster I haven t eh Well what do you say to this I come straight out and I says to her Did you or did you not taste the whisky Cy had and she says I think I did take one sip Cy made me she said She owned up to that much so you can imagine Does that prove her a prostitute asked Carol Carrie Don t you never use a word like that again wailed the outraged Puritan Well does it prove her to be a bad woman that she took a taste of whisky I ve done it myself That s different Not that I approve your doing it What do the Scriptures tell us Strong drink is a mocker But that s entirely different from a teacher drinking with one of her own pupils Yes it does sound bad Fern was silly undoubtedly But as a matter of fact she s only a year or two older than Cy and probably a good many years younger in experience of vice That s not true She is plenty old enough to corrupt him The job of corrupting Cy was done by your sinless town five years ago missus Bogart did not rage in return Suddenly she was hopeless Her head drooped She patted her black kid gloves picked at a thread of her faded brown skirt and sighed He s a good boy and awful affectionate if you treat him right Some thinks he s terrible wild but that s because he s young And he s so brave and truthful why he was one of the first in town that wanted to enlist for the war and I had to speak real sharp to him to keep him from running away I didn t want him to get into no bad influences round these camps and then missus Bogart rose from her pitifulness recovered her pace then I go and bring into my own house a woman that s worse when all s said and done than any bad woman he could have met You say this Mullins woman is too young and inexperienced to corrupt Cy Well then she s too young and inexperienced to teach him too one or t other you can t have your cake and eat it So it don t make no difference which reason they fire her for and that s practically almost what I said to the school board Have you been telling this story to the members of the school board I certainly have Every one of em And their wives I says to them Tain t my affair to decide what you should or should not do with your teachers I says and I ain t presuming to dictate in any way shape manner or form I just want to know I says whether you re going to go on record as keeping here in our schools among a lot of innocent boys and girls a woman that drinks smokes curses uses bad language and does such dreadful things as I wouldn t lay tongue to but you know what I mean I says and if so I ll just see to it that the town learns about it And that s what I told Professor Mott too being superintendent and he s a righteous man not going autoing on the Sabbath like the school board members And the professor as much as admitted he was suspicious of the Mullins woman himself II Kennicott was less shocked and much less frightened than Carol and more articulate in his description of missus Bogart when she had gone Maud Dyer telephoned to Carol and after a rather improbable question about cooking lima beans with bacon demanded Have you heard the scandal about this Miss Mullins and Cy Bogart I m sure it s a lie Oh probably is Maud s manner indicated that the falsity of the story was an insignificant flaw in its general delightfulness Carol crept to her room sat with hands curled tight together as she listened to a plague of voices She could hear the town yelping with it every soul of them gleeful at new details panting to win importance by having details of their own to add How well they would make up for what they had been afraid to do by imagining it in another They who had not been entirely afraid but merely careful and sneaky all the barber shop roues and millinery parlor mondaines how archly they were giggling this second she could hear them at it with what self commendation they were cackling their suavest wit You can t tell ME she ain t a gay bird I m wise And not one man in town to carry out their pioneer tradition of superb and contemptuous cursing not one to verify the myth that their rough chivalry and rugged virtues were more generous than the petty scandal picking of older lands not one dramatic frontiersman to thunder with fantastic and fictional oaths What are you hinting at What are you snickering at What facts have you What are these unheard of sins you condemn so much and like so well No one to say it Not Kennicott nor Guy Pollock nor Champ Perry Erik Possibly He would sputter uneasy protest She suddenly wondered what subterranean connection her interest in Erik had with this affair Wasn t it because they had been prevented by her caste from bounding on her own trail that they were howling at Fern III Before supper she found by half a dozen telephone calls that Fern had fled to the Minniemashie House She hastened there trying not to be self conscious about the people who looked at her on the street The clerk said indifferently that he guessed Miss Mullins was up in Room thirty seven and left Carol to find the way She hunted along the stale smelling corridors with their wallpaper of cerise daisies and poison green rosettes streaked in white spots from spilled water their frayed red and yellow matting and rows of pine doors painted a sickly blue She could not find the number In the darkness at the end of a corridor she had to feel the aluminum figures on the door panels She was startled once by a man s voice Yep Whadyuh want and fled When she reached the right door she stood listening She made out a long sobbing There was no answer till her third knock then an alarmed Who is it Go away Her hatred of the town turned resolute as she pushed open the door Yesterday she had seen Fern Mullins in boots and tweed skirt and canary yellow sweater fleet and self possessed Now she lay across the bed in crumpled lavender cotton and shabby pumps very feminine utterly cowed She lifted her head in stupid terror Her hair was in tousled strings and her face was sallow creased Her eyes were a blur from weeping I didn t I didn t was all she would say at first and she repeated it while Carol kissed her cheek stroked her hair bathed her forehead She rested then while Carol looked about the room the welcome to strangers the sanctuary of hospitable Main Street the lucrative property of Kennicott s friend Jackson Elder It smelled of old linen and decaying carpet and ancient tobacco smoke The bed was rickety with a thin knotty mattress the sand colored walls were scratched and gouged in every corner under everything were fluffy dust and cigar ashes on the tilted wash stand was a nicked and squatty pitcher the only chair was a grim straight object of spotty varnish but there was an altogether splendid gilt and rose cuspidor She did not try to draw out Fern s story Fern insisted on telling it She had gone to the party not quite liking Cy but willing to endure him for the sake of dancing of escaping from missus Bogart s flow of moral comments of relaxing after the first strained weeks of teaching Cy promised to be good He was on the way out There were a few workmen from Gopher Prairie at the dance with many young farm people Half a dozen squatters from a degenerate colony in a brush hidden hollow planters of potatoes suspected thieves came in noisily drunk They all pounded the floor of the barn in old fashioned square dances swinging their partners skipping laughing under the incantations of Del Snafflin the barber who fiddled and called the figures Cy had two drinks from pocket flasks Fern saw him fumbling among the overcoats piled on the feedbox at the far end of the barn soon after she heard a farmer declaring that some one had stolen his bottle She taxed Cy with the theft he chuckled Oh it s just a joke I m going to give it back He demanded that she take a drink Unless she did he wouldn t return the bottle I just brushed my lips with it and gave it back to him moaned Fern She sat up glared at Carol Did you ever take a drink I have A few I d love to have one right now This contact with righteousness has about done me up Fern could laugh then So would I I don t suppose I ve had five drinks in my life but if I meet just one more Bogart and Son Well I didn t really touch that bottle horrible raw whisky though I d have loved some wine I felt so jolly The barn was almost like a stage scene the high rafters and the dark stalls and tin lanterns swinging and a silage cutter up at the end like some mysterious kind of machine And I d been having lots of fun dancing with the nicest young farmer so strong and nice and awfully intelligent But I got uneasy when I saw how Cy was So I doubt if I touched two drops of the beastly stuff Do you suppose God is punishing me for even wanting wine My dear missus Bogart s god may be Main Street s god But all the courageous intelligent people are fighting him though he slay us Fern danced again with the young farmer she forgot Cy while she was talking with a girl who had taken the University agricultural course Cy could not have returned the bottle he came staggering toward her taking time to make himself offensive to every girl on the way and to dance a jig She insisted on their returning Cy went with her chuckling and jigging He kissed her outside the door And to think I used to think it was interesting to have men kiss you at a dance She ignored the kiss in the need of getting him home before he started a fight A farmer helped her harness the buggy while Cy snored in the seat He awoke before they set out all the way home he alternately slept and tried to make love to her I m almost as strong as he is I managed to keep him away while I drove such a rickety buggy I didn t feel like a girl I felt like a scrubwoman no I guess I was too scared to have any feelings at all It was terribly dark I got home somehow But it was hard the time I had to get out and it was quite muddy to read a sign post I lit matches that I took from Cy s coat pocket and he followed me he fell off the buggy step into the mud and got up and tried to make love to me and I was scared But I hit him Quite hard And got in and so he ran after the buggy crying like a baby and I let him in again and right away again he was trying But no matter I got him home Up on the porch missus Bogart was waiting up You know it was funny all the time she was oh talking to me and Cy was being terribly sick I just kept thinking I ve still got to drive the buggy down to the livery stable I wonder if the livery man will be awake But I got through somehow I took the buggy down to the stable and got to my room I locked my door but missus Bogart kept saying things outside the door Stood out there saying things about me dreadful things and rattling the knob And all the while I could hear Cy in the back yard being sick I don t think I ll ever marry any man And then today She drove me right out of the house She wouldn t listen to me all morning Just to Cy I suppose he s over his headache now Even at breakfast he thought the whole thing was a grand joke I suppose right this minute he s going around town boasting about his conquest You understand oh DON T you understand I DID keep him away But I don t see how I can face my school They say country towns are fine for bringing up boys in but I can t believe this is me lying here and saying this I don t BELIEVE what happened last night Oh This was curious When I took off my dress last night it was a darling dress I loved it so but of course the mud had spoiled it I cried over it and No matter But my white silk stockings were all torn and the strange thing is I don t know whether I caught my legs in the briers when I got out to look at the sign post or whether Cy scratched me when I was fighting him off IV Sam Clark was president of the school board When Carol told him Fern s story Sam looked sympathetic and neighborly and missus Clark sat by cooing Oh isn t that too bad Carol was interrupted only when missus Clark begged Dear don t speak so bitter about pious people There s lots of sincere practising Christians that are real tolerant Like the Champ Perrys Yes I know Unfortunately there are enough kindly people in the churches to keep them going When Carol had finished missus Clark breathed Poor girl I don t doubt her story a bit and Sam rumbled Yuh sure Miss Mullins is young and reckless but everybody in town except Ma Bogart knows what Cy is But Miss Mullins was a fool to go with him But not wicked enough to pay for it with disgrace N no but Sam avoided verdicts clung to the entrancing horrors of the story Ma Bogart cussed her out all morning did she Jumped her neck eh Ma certainly is one hell cat Yes you know how she is so vicious Oh no her best style ain t her viciousness What she pulls in our store is to come in smiling with Christian Fortitude and keep a clerk busy for one hour while she picks out half a dozen fourpenny nails I remember one time Sam Carol was uneasy You ll fight for Fern won t you When missus Bogart came to see you did she make definite charges Well yes you might say she did But the school board won t act on them Guess we ll more or less have to But you ll exonerate Fern I ll do what I can for the girl personally but you know what the board is There s Reverend Zitterel Sister Bogart about half runs his church so of course he ll take her say so and Ezra Stowbody as a banker he has to be all hell for morality and purity Might s well admit it Carrie I m afraid there ll be a majority of the board against her Not that any of us would believe a word Cy said not if he swore it on a stack of Bibles but still after all this gossip Miss Mullins wouldn t hardly be the party to chaperon our basket ball team when it went out of town to play other high schools would she Perhaps not but couldn t some one else Why that s one of the things she was hired for Sam sounded stubborn Do you realize that this isn t just a matter of a job and hiring and firing that it s actually sending a splendid girl out with a beastly stain on her giving all the other Bogarts in the world a chance at her That s what will happen if you discharge her Sam moved uncomfortably looked at his wife scratched his head sighed said nothing Won t you fight for her on the board If you lose won t you and whoever agrees with you make a minority report No reports made in a case like this Our rule is to just decide the thing and announce the final decision whether it s unanimous or not Rules Against a girl s future Dear God Rules of a school board Sam Won t you stand by Fern and threaten to resign from the board if they try to discharge her Rather testy tired of so many subtleties he complained Well I ll do what I can but I ll have to wait till the board meets And I ll do what I can together with the secret admission Of course you and I know what Ma Bogart is was all Carol could get from Superintendent George Edwin Mott Ezra Stowbody the Reverend mister Zitterel or any other member of the school board Afterward she wondered whether mister Zitterel could have been referring to herself when he observed There s too much license in high places in this town though and the wages of sin is death or anyway bein fired The holy leer with which the priest said it remained in her mind She was at the hotel before eight next morning Fern longed to go to school to face the tittering but she was too shaky Carol read to her all day and by reassuring her convinced her own self that the school board would be just She was less sure of it that evening when at the motion pictures she heard missus Gougerling exclaim to missus Howland She may be so innocent and all and I suppose she probably is but still if she drank a whole bottle of whisky at that dance the way everybody says she did she may have forgotten she was so innocent Hee hee hee Maud Dyer leaning back from her seat put in That s what I ve said all along I don t want to roast anybody but have you noticed the way she looks at men When will they have me on the scaffold Carol speculated Nat Hicks stopped the Kennicotts on their way home Carol hated him for his manner of assuming that they two had a mysterious understanding Without quite winking he seemed to wink at her as he gurgled What do you folks think about this Mullins woman I m not strait laced but I tell you we got to have decent women in our schools D you know what I heard They say whatever she may of done afterwards this Mullins dame took two quarts of whisky to the dance with her and got stewed before Cy did Some tank that wren Ha ha ha Rats I don t believe it Kennicott muttered He got Carol away before she was able to speak She saw Erik passing the house late alone and she stared after him longing for the lively bitterness of the things he would say about the town Kennicott had nothing for her but Oh course ev body likes a juicy story but they don t intend to be mean She went up to bed proving to herself that the members of the school board were superior men It was Tuesday afternoon before she learned that the board had met at ten in the morning and voted to accept Miss Fern Mullins s resignation Sam Clark telephoned the news to her We re not making any charges We re just letting her resign Would you like to drop over to the hotel and ask her to write the resignation now we ve accepted it Glad I could get the board to put it that way It s thanks to you But can t you see that the town will take this as proof of the charges We re not making no charges whatever Sam was obviously finding it hard to be patient Fern left town that evening Carol went with her to the train The two girls elbowed through a silent lip licking crowd Carol tried to stare them down but in face of the impishness of the boys and the bovine gaping of the men she was embarrassed Fern did not glance at them Carol felt her arm tremble though she was tearless listless plodding She squeezed Carol s hand said something unintelligible stumbled up into the vestibule Carol remembered that Miles Bjornstam had also taken a train What would be the scene at the station when she herself took departure She walked up town behind two strangers One of them was giggling See that good looking wench that got on here The swell kid with the small black hat She s some charmer I was here yesterday before my jump to Ojibway Falls and I heard all about her Seems she was a teacher but she certainly was a high roller O boy high wide and fancy Her and couple of other skirts bought a whole case of whisky and went on a tear and one night darned if this bunch of cradle robbers didn t get hold of some young kids just small boys and they all got lit up like a White Way and went out to a roughneck dance and they say The narrator turned saw a woman near and not being a common person nor a coarse workman but a clever salesman and a householder lowered his voice for the rest of the tale During it the other man laughed hoarsely Carol turned off on a side street She passed Cy Bogart He was humorously narrating some achievement to a group which included Nat Hicks Del Snafflin Bert Tybee the bartender and A Tennyson O Hearn the shyster lawyer They were men far older than Cy but they accepted him as one of their own and encouraged him to go on It was a week before she received from Fern a letter of which this was a part of course my family did not really believe the story but as they were sure I must have done something wrong they just lectured me generally in fact jawed me till I have gone to live at a boarding house The teachers agencies must know the story man at one almost slammed the door in my face when I went to ask about a job at another the woman in charge was beastly Don t know what I will do Don t seem to feel very well May marry a fellow that s in love with me but he s so stupid that he makes me SCREAM Dear missus Kennicott you were the only one that believed me I guess it s a joke on me I was such a simp I felt quite heroic while I was driving the buggy back that night keeping Cy away from me I guess I expected the people in Gopher Prairie to admire me I did use to be admired for my athletics at the U just five months ago CHAPTER XXXIII FOR a month which was one suspended moment of doubt she saw Erik only casually at an Eastern Star dance at the shop where in the presence of Nat Hicks they conferred with immense particularity on the significance of having one or two buttons on the cuff of Kennicott s New Suit For the benefit of beholders they were respectably vacuous Thus barred from him depressed in the thought of Fern Carol was suddenly and for the first time convinced that she loved Erik She told herself a thousand inspiriting things which he would say if he had the opportunity for them she admired him loved him But she was afraid to summon him He understood he did not come She forgot her every doubt of him and her discomfort in his background Each day it seemed impossible to get through the desolation of not seeing him Each morning each afternoon each evening was a compartment divided from all other units of time distinguished by a sudden Oh I want to see Erik which was as devastating as though she had never said it before There were wretched periods when she could not picture him Usually he stood out in her mind in some little moment glancing up from his preposterous pressing iron or running on the beach with Dave Dyer But sometimes he had vanished he was only an opinion She worried then about his appearance Weren t his wrists too large and red Wasn t his nose a snub like so many Scandinavians Was he at all the graceful thing she had fancied When she encountered him on the street she was as much reassuring herself as rejoicing in his presence More disturbing than being unable to visualize him was the darting remembrance of some intimate aspect his face as they had walked to the boat together at the picnic the ruddy light on his temples neck cords flat cheeks On a November evening when Kennicott was in the country she answered the bell and was confused to find Erik at the door stooped imploring his hands in the pockets of his topcoat As though he had been rehearsing his speech he instantly besought Saw your husband driving away I ve got to see you I can t stand it Come for a walk I know People might see us But they won t if we hike into the country I ll wait for you by the elevator Take as long as you want to oh come quick In a few minutes she promised She murmured I ll just talk to him for a quarter of an hour and come home She put an her tweed coat and rubber overshoes considering how honest and hopeless are rubbers how clearly their chaperonage proved that she wasn t going to a lovers tryst She found him in the shadow of the grain elevator sulkily kicking at a rail of the side track As she came toward him she fancied that his whole body expanded But he said nothing nor she he patted her sleeve she returned the pat and they crossed the railroad tracks found a road clumped toward open country Chilly night but I like this melancholy gray he said Yes They passed a moaning clump of trees and splashed along the wet road He tucked her hand into the side pocket of his overcoat She caught his thumb and sighing held it exactly as Hugh held hers when they went walking She thought about Hugh The current maid was in for the evening but was it safe to leave the baby with her The thought was distant and elusive Erik began to talk slowly revealingly He made for her a picture of his work in a large tailor shop in Minneapolis the steam and heat and the drudgery the men in darned vests and crumpled trousers men who rushed growlers of beer and were cynical about women who laughed at him and played jokes on him But I didn t mind because I could keep away from them outside I used to go to the Art Institute and the Walker Gallery and tramp clear around Lake Harriet or hike out to the Gates house and imagine it was a chateau in Italy and I lived in it I was a marquis and collected tapestries that was after I was wounded in Padua The only really bad time was when a tailor named Finkelfarb found a diary I was trying to keep and he read it aloud in the shop it was a bad fight He laughed I got fined five dollars But that s all gone now Seems as though you stand between me and the gas stoves the long flames with mauve edges licking up around the irons and making that sneering sound all day aaaaah Her fingers tightened about his thumb as she perceived the hot low room the pounding of pressing irons the reek of scorched cloth and Erik among giggling gnomes His fingertip crept through the opening of her glove and smoothed her palm She snatched her hand away stripped off her glove tucked her hand back into his He was saying something about a wonderful person In her tranquillity she let the words blow by and heeded only the beating wings of his voice She was conscious that he was fumbling for impressive speech Say uh Carol I ve written a poem about you That s nice Let s hear it Damn it don t be so casual about it Can t you take me seriously My dear boy if I took you seriously I don t want us to be hurt more than more than we will be Tell me the poem I ve never had a poem written about me It isn t really a poem It s just some words that I love because it seems to me they catch what you are Of course probably they won t seem so to anybody else but Well Little and tender and merry and wise With eyes that meet my eyes Do you get the idea the way I do Yes I m terribly grateful And she was grateful while she impersonally noted how bad a verse it was She was aware of the haggard beauty in the lowering night Monstrous tattered clouds sprawled round a forlorn moon puddles and rocks glistened with inner light They were passing a grove of scrub poplars feeble by day but looming now like a menacing wall She stopped They heard the branches dripping the wet leaves sullenly plumping on the soggy earth Waiting waiting everything is waiting she whispered She drew her hand from his pressed her clenched fingers against her lips She was lost in the somberness I am happy so we must go home before we have time to become unhappy But can t we sit on a log for a minute and just listen No Too wet But I wish we could build a fire and you could sit on my overcoat beside it I m a grand fire builder My cousin Lars and me spent a week one time in a cabin way up in the Big Woods snowed in The fireplace was filled with a dome of ice when we got there but we chopped it out and jammed the thing full of pine boughs Couldn t we build a fire back here in the woods and sit by it for a while She pondered half way between yielding and refusal Her head ached faintly She was in abeyance Everything the night his silhouette the cautious treading future was as undistinguishable as though she were drifting bodiless in a Fourth Dimension While her mind groped the lights of a motor car swooped round a bend in the road and they stood farther apart What ought I to do she mused I think Oh I won t be robbed I AM good If I m so enslaved that I can t sit by the fire with a man and talk then I d better be dead The lights of the thrumming car grew magically were upon them abruptly stopped From behind the dimness of the windshield a voice annoyed sharp Hello there She realized that it was Kennicott The irritation in his voice smoothed out Having a walk They made schoolboyish sounds of assent Pretty wet isn t it Better ride back Jump up in front here Valborg His manner of swinging open the door was a command Carol was conscious that Erik was climbing in that she was apparently to sit in the back and that she had been left to open the rear door for herself Instantly the wonder which had flamed to the gusty skies was quenched and she was missus W P Kennicott of Gopher Prairie riding in a squeaking old car and likely to be lectured by her husband She feared what Kennicott would say to Erik She bent toward them Kennicott was observing Going to have some rain before the night s over all right Yes said Erik Been funny season this year anyway Never saw it with such a cold October and such a nice November Member we had a snow way back on October ninth But it certainly was nice up to the twenty first this month as I remember it not a flake of snow in November so far has there been But I shouldn t wonder if we d be having some snow most any time now Yes good chance of it said Erik Wish I d had more time to go after the ducks this fall By golly what do you think Kennicott sounded appealing Fellow wrote me from Man Trap Lake that he shot seven mallards and couple of canvas back in one hour That must have been fine said Erik Carol was ignored But Kennicott was blustrously cheerful He shouted to a farmer as he slowed up to pass the frightened team There we are schon gut She sat back neglected frozen unheroic heroine in a drama insanely undramatic She made a decision resolute and enduring She would tell Kennicott What would she tell him She could not say that she loved Erik DID she love him But she would have it out She was not sure whether it was pity for Kennicott s blindness or irritation at his assumption that he was enough to fill any woman s life which prompted her but she knew that she was out of the trap that she could be frank and she was exhilarated with the adventure of it while in front he was entertaining Erik Nothing like an hour on a duck pass to make you relish your victuals and Gosh this machine hasn t got the power of a fountain pen Guess the cylinders are jam cram full of carbon again Don t know but what maybe I ll have to put in another set of piston rings He stopped on Main Street and clucked hospitably There that ll give you just a block to walk G night Carol was in suspense Would Erik sneak away He stolidly moved to the back of the car thrust in his hand muttered Good night Carol I m glad we had our walk She pressed his hand The car was flapping on He was hidden from her by a corner drug store on Main Street Kennicott did not recognize her till he drew up before the house Then he condescended Better jump out here and I ll take the boat around back Say see if the back door is unlocked will you She unlatched the door for him She realized that she still carried the damp glove she had stripped off for Erik She drew it on She stood in the center of the living room unmoving in damp coat and muddy rubbers Kennicott was as opaque as ever Her task wouldn t be anything so lively as having to endure a scolding but only an exasperating effort to command his attention so that he would understand the nebulous things she had to tell him instead of interrupting her by yawning winding the clock and going up to bed She heard him shoveling coal into the furnace He came through the kitchen energetically but before he spoke to her he did stop in the hall did wind the clock He sauntered into the living room and his glance passed from her drenched hat to her smeared rubbers She could hear she could hear see taste smell touch his Better take your coat off Carrie looks kind of wet Yes there it was Well Carrie you better He chucked his own coat on a chair stalked to her went on with a rising tingling voice you better cut it out now I m not going to do the out raged husband stunt I like you and I respect you and I d probably look like a boob if I tried to be dramatic But I think it s about time for you and Valborg to call a halt before you get in Dutch like Fern Mullins did Do you Course I know all about it What d you expect in a town that s as filled with busybodies that have plenty of time to stick their noses into other folks business as this is Not that they ve had the nerve to do much tattling to me but they ve hinted around a lot and anyway I could see for myself that you liked him But of course I knew how cold you were I knew you wouldn t stand it even if Valborg did try to hold your hand or kiss you so I didn t worry But same time I hope you don t suppose this husky young Swede farmer is as innocent and Platonic and all that stuff as you are Wait now don t get sore I m not knocking him He isn t a bad sort And he s young and likes to gas about books Course you like him That isn t the real rub But haven t you just seen what this town can do once it goes and gets moral on you like it did with Fern You probably think that two young folks making love are alone if anybody ever is but there s nothing in this town that you don t do in company with a whole lot of uninvited but awful interested guests Don t you realize that if Ma Westlake and a few others got started they d drive you up a tree and you d find yourself so well advertised as being in love with this Valborg fellow that you d HAVE to be just to spite em Let me sit down was all Carol could say She drooped on the couch wearily without elasticity He yawned Gimme your coat and rubbers and while she stripped them off he twiddled his watch chain felt the radiator peered at the thermometer He shook out her wraps in the hall hung them up with exactly his usual care He pushed a chair near to her and sat bolt up He looked like a physician about to give sound and undesired advice Before he could launch into his heavy discourse she desperately got in Please I want you to know that I was going to tell you everything tonight Well I don t suppose there s really much to tell But there is I m fond of Erik He appeals to something in here She touched her breast And I admire him He isn t just a young Swede farmer He s an artist Wait now He s had a chance all evening to tell you what a whale of a fine fellow he is Now it s my turn I can t talk artistic but Carrie do you understand my work He leaned forward thick capable hands on thick sturdy thighs mature and slow yet beseeching No matter even if you are cold I like you better than anybody in the world One time I said that you were my soul And that still goes You re all the things that I see in a sunset when I m driving in from the country the things that I like but can t make poetry of Do you realize what my job is I go round twenty four hours a day in mud and blizzard trying my damnedest to heal everybody rich or poor You that re always spieling about how scientists ought to rule the world instead of a bunch of spread eagle politicians can t you see that I m all the science there is here And I can stand the cold and the bumpy roads and the lonely rides at night All I need is to have you here at home to welcome me I don t expect you to be passionate not any more I don t but I do expect you to appreciate my work I bring babies into the world and save lives and make cranky husbands quit being mean to their wives And then you go and moon over a Swede tailor because he can talk about how to put ruchings on a skirt Hell of a thing for a man to fuss over She flew out at him You make your side clear Let me give mine I admit all you say except about Erik But is it only you and the baby that want me to back you up that demand things from me They re all on me the whole town I can feel their hot breaths on my neck Aunt Bessie and that horrible slavering old Uncle Whittier and Juanita and missus Westlake and missus Bogart and all of them And you welcome them you encourage them to drag me down into their cave I won t stand it Do you hear Now right now I m done And it s Erik who gives me the courage You say he just thinks about ruches which do not usually go on skirts by the way I tell you he thinks about God the God that missus Bogart covers up with greasy gingham wrappers Erik will be a great man some day and if I could contribute one tiny bit to his success Wait wait wait now Hold up You re assuming that your Erik will make good As a matter of fact at my age he ll be running a one man tailor shop in some burg about the size of Schoenstrom He will not That s what he s headed for now all right and he s twenty five or six and What s he done to make you think he ll ever be anything but a pants presser He has sensitiveness and talent Wait now What has he actually done in the art line Has he done one first class picture or sketch d you call it Or one poem or played the piano or anything except gas about what he s going to do She looked thoughtful Then it s a hundred to one shot that he never will Way I understand it even these fellows that do something pretty good at home and get to go to art school there ain t more than one out of ten of em maybe one out of a hundred that ever get above grinding out a bum living about as artistic as plumbing And when it comes down to this tailor why can t you see you that take on so about psychology can t you see that it s just by contrast with folks like Doc McGanum or Lym Cass that this fellow seems artistic Suppose you d met up with him first in one of these reg lar New York studios You wouldn t notice him any more n a rabbit She huddled over folded hands like a temple virgin shivering on her knees before the thin warmth of a brazier She could not answer Kennicott rose quickly sat on the couch took both her hands Suppose he fails as he will Suppose he goes back to tailoring and you re his wife Is that going to be this artistic life you ve been thinking about He s in some bum shack pressing pants all day or stooped over sewing and having to be polite to any grouch that blows in and jams a dirty stinking old suit in his face and says Here you fix this and be blame quick about it He won t even have enough savvy to get him a big shop He ll pike along doing his own work unless you his wife go help him go help him in the shop and stand over a table all day pushing a big heavy iron Your complexion will look fine after about fifteen years of baking that way won t it And you ll be humped over like an old hag And probably you ll live in one room back of the shop And then at night oh you ll have your artist sure He ll come in stinking of gasoline and cranky from hard work and hinting around that if it hadn t been for you he d of gone East and been a great artist Sure And you ll be entertaining his relatives Talk about Uncle Whit You ll be having some old Axel Axelberg coming in with manure on his boots and sitting down to supper in his socks and yelling at you Hurry up now you vimmin make me sick Yes and you ll have a squalling brat every year tugging at you while you press clothes and you won t love em like you do Hugh up stairs all downy and asleep Please Not any more Her face was on his knee He bent to kiss her neck I don t want to be unfair I guess love is a great thing all right But think it would stand much of that kind of stuff Oh honey am I so bad Can t you like me at all I ve I ve been so fond of you She snatched up his hand she kissed it Presently she sobbed I won t ever see him again I can t now The hot living room behind the tailor shop I don t love him enough for that And you are Even if I were sure of him sure he was the real thing I don t think I could actually leave you This marriage it weaves people together It s not easy to break even when it ought to be broken And do you want to break it No He lifted her carried her up stairs laid her on her bed turned to the door Come kiss me she whimpered He kissed her lightly and slipped away For an hour she heard him moving about his room lighting a cigar drumming with his knuckles on a chair She felt that he was a bulwark between her and the darkness that grew thicker as the delayed storm came down in sleet II He was cheery and more casual than ever at breakfast All day she tried to devise a way of giving Erik up Telephone The village central would unquestionably listen in A letter It might be found Go to see him Impossible That evening Kennicott gave her without comment an envelope The letter was signed E V I know I can t do anything but make trouble for you I think I am going to Minneapolis tonight and from there as soon as I can either to New York or Chicago I will do as big things as I can I I can t write I love you too much God keep you Until she heard the whistle which told her that the Minneapolis train was leaving town she kept herself from thinking from moving Then it was all over She had no plan nor desire for anything When she caught Kennicott looking at her over his newspaper she fled to his arms thrusting the paper aside and for the first time in years they were lovers But she knew that she still had no plan in life save always to go along the same streets past the same people to the same shops III A week after Erik s going the maid startled her by announcing There s a mister Valborg down stairs say he vant to see you She was conscious of the maid s interested stare angry at this shattering of the calm in which she had hidden She crept down peeped into the living room It was not Erik Valborg who stood there it was a small gray bearded yellow faced man in mucky boots canvas jacket and red mittens He glowered at her with shrewd red eyes You de doc s wife Yes I m Adolph Valborg from up by Jefferson I m Erik s father Oh He was a monkey faced little man and not gentle What you done wit my son I don t think I understand you I t ink you re going to understand before I get t rough Where is he Why really I presume that he s in Minneapolis You presume He looked through her with a contemptuousness such as she could not have imagined Only an insane contortion of spelling could portray his lyric whine his mangled consonants He clamored Presume Dot s a fine word I don t want no fine words and I don t want no more lies I want to know what you KNOW See here mister Valborg you may stop this bullying right now I m not one of your farmwomen I don t know where your son is and there s no reason why I should know Her defiance ran out in face of his immense flaxen stolidity He raised his fist worked up his anger with the gesture and sneered You dirty city women wit your fine ways and fine dresses A father come here trying to save his boy from wickedness and you call him a bully By God I don t have to take nothin off you nor your husband I ain t one of your hired men For one time a woman like you is going to hear de trut about what you are and no fine city words to it needer Really mister Valborg What you done wit him Heh I ll yoost tell you what you done He was a good boy even if he was a damn fool I want him back on de farm He don t make enough money tailoring And I can t get me no hired man I want to take him back on de farm And you butt in and fool wit him and make love wit him and get him to run away You are lying It s not true that It s not true and if it were you would have no right to speak like this Don t talk foolish I know Ain t I heard from a fellow dot live right here in town how you been acting wit de boy I know what you done Walking wit him in de country Hiding in de woods wit him Yes and I guess you talk about religion in de woods Sure Women like you you re worse dan street walkers Rich women like you wit fine husbands and no decent work to do and me look at my hands look how I work look at those hands But you oh God no you mustn t work you re too fine to do decent work You got to play wit young fellows younger as you are laughing and rolling around and acting like de animals You let my son alone d you hear He was shaking his fist in her face She could smell the manure and sweat It ain t no use talkin to women like you Get no trut out of you But next time I go by your husband He was marching into the hall Carol flung herself on him her clenching hand on his hayseed dusty shoulder You horrible old man you ve always tried to turn Erik into a slave to fatten your pocketbook You ve sneered at him and overworked him and probably you ve succeeded in preventing his ever rising above your muck heap And now because you can t drag him back you come here to vent Go tell my husband go tell him and don t blame me when he kills you when my husband kills you he will kill you The man grunted looked at her impassively said one word and walked out She heard the word very plainly She did not quite reach the couch Her knees gave way she pitched forward She heard her mind saying You haven t fainted This is ridiculous You re simply dramatizing yourself Get up But she could not move When Kennicott arrived she was lying on the couch His step quickened What s happened Carrie You haven t got a bit of blood in your face She clutched his arm You ve got to be sweet to me and kind I m going to California mountains sea Please don t argue about it because I m going Quietly All right We ll go You and I Leave the kid here with Aunt Bessie Now Well yes just as soon as we can get away Now don t talk any more Just imagine you ve already started He smoothed her hair and not till after supper did he continue I meant it about California But I think we better wait three weeks or so till I get hold of some young fellow released from the medical corps to take my practice And if people are gossiping you don t want to give them a chance by running away Can you stand it and face em for three weeks or so Yes she said emptily IV People covertly stared at her on the street Aunt Bessie tried to catechize her about Erik s disappearance and it was Kennicott who silenced the woman with a savage Say are you hinting that Carrie had anything to do with that fellow s beating it Then let me tell you and you can go right out and tell the whole bloomin town that Carrie and I took Val took Erik riding and he asked me about getting a better job in Minneapolis and I advised him to go to it Getting much sugar in at the store now Guy Pollock crossed the street to be pleasant apropos of California and new novels Vida Sherwin dragged her to the Jolly Seventeen There with every one rigidly listening Maud Dyer shot at Carol I hear Erik has left town Carol was amiable Yes so I hear In fact he called me up told me he had been offered a lovely job in the city So sorry he s gone He would have been valuable if we d tried to start the dramatic association again Still I wouldn t be here for the association myself because Will is all in from work and I m thinking of taking him to California Juanita you know the Coast so well tell me would you start in at Los Angeles or San Francisco and what are the best hotels The Jolly Seventeen looked disappointed but the Jolly Seventeen liked to give advice the Jolly Seventeen liked to mention the expensive hotels at which they had stayed A meal counted as a stay Before they could question her again Carol escorted in with drum and fife the topic of Raymie Wutherspoon Vida had news from her husband He had been gassed in the trenches had been in a hospital for two weeks had been promoted to major was learning French She left Hugh with Aunt Bessie But for Kennicott she would have taken him She hoped that in some miraculous way yet unrevealed she might find it possible to remain in California She did not want to see Gopher Prairie again The Smails were to occupy the Kennicott house and quite the hardest thing to endure in the month of waiting was the series of conferences between Kennicott and Uncle Whittier in regard to heating the garage and having the furnace flues cleaned Did Carol Kennicott inquired wish to stop in Minneapolis to buy new clothes No I want to get as far away as I can as soon as I can Let s wait till Los Angeles Sure sure Just as you like Cheer up We re going to have a large wide time and everything ll be different when we come back VI Dusk on a snowy December afternoon The sleeper which would connect at Kansas City with the California train rolled out of saint Paul with a chick a chick chick a chick chick a chick as it crossed the other tracks It bumped through the factory belt gained speed Carol could see nothing but gray fields which had closed in on her all the way from Gopher Prairie Ahead was darkness For an hour in Minneapolis I must have been near Erik He s still there somewhere He ll be gone when I come back I ll never know where he has gone As Kennicott switched on the seat light she turned drearily to the illustrations in a motion picture magazine CHAPTER XXXIV 
1100_124547_000003_000000	train-clean-360	THEY journeyed for three and a half months 
none	none	They saw the Grand Canyon the adobe walls of Sante Fe and in a drive from El Paso into Mexico their first foreign land They jogged from San Diego and La Jolla to Los Angeles Pasadena Riverside through towns with bell towered missions and orange groves they viewed Monterey and San Francisco and a forest of sequoias They bathed in the surf and climbed foothills and danced they saw a polo game and the making of motion pictures they sent one hundred and seventeen souvenir post cards to Gopher Prairie and once on a dune by a foggy sea when she was walking alone Carol found an artist and he looked up at her and said Too damned wet to paint sit down and talk and so for ten minutes she lived in a romantic novel Her only struggle was in coaxing Kennicott not to spend all his time with the tourists from the ten thousand other Gopher Prairies In winter California is full of people from Iowa and Nebraska Ohio and Oklahoma who having traveled thousands of miles from their familiar villages hasten to secure an illusion of not having left them They hunt for people from their own states to stand between them and the shame of naked mountains they talk steadily in Pullmans on hotel porches at cafeterias and motion picture shows about the motors and crops and county politics back home Kennicott discussed land prices with them he went into the merits of the several sorts of motor cars with them he was intimate with train porters and he insisted on seeing the Luke Dawsons at their flimsy bungalow in Pasadena where Luke sat and yearned to go back and make some more money But Kennicott gave promise of learning to play He shouted in the pool at the Coronado and he spoke of though he did nothing more radical than speak of buying evening clothes Carol was touched by his efforts to enjoy picture galleries and the dogged way in which he accumulated dates and dimensions when they followed monkish guides through missions 
1100_124547_000005_000000	train-clean-360	She felt strong 
none	none	Whenever she was restless she dodged her thoughts by the familiar vagabond fallacy of running away from them of moving on to a new place and thus she persuaded herself that she was tranquil In March she willingly agreed with Kennicott that it was time to go home She was longing for Hugh They left Monterey on April first on a day of high blue skies and poppies and a summer sea As the train struck in among the hills she resolved I m going to love the fine Will Kennicott quality that there is in Gopher Prairie 
1100_124547_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The nobility of good sense 
none	none	It will be sweet to see Vida and Guy and the Clarks And I m going to see my baby All the words he ll be able to say now 
1100_124547_000007_000005	train-clean-360	It s a new start 
none	none	Everything will be different Thus on April first among dappled hills and the bronze of scrub oaks while Kennicott seesawed on his toes and chuckled Wonder what Hugh ll say when he sees us Three days later they reached Gopher Prairie in a sleet storm II No one knew that they were coming no one met them and because of the icy roads the only conveyance at the station was the hotel bus which they missed while Kennicott was giving his trunk check to the station agent the only person to welcome them Carol waited for him in the station among huddled German women with shawls and umbrellas and ragged bearded farmers in corduroy coats peasants mute as oxen in a room thick with the steam of wet coats the reek of the red hot stove the stench of sawdust boxes which served as cuspidors The afternoon light was as reluctant as a winter dawn This is a useful market center an interesting pioneer post but it is not a home for me meditated the stranger Carol Kennicott suggested I d phone for a flivver but it d take quite a while for it to get here Let s walk They stepped uncomfortably from the safety of the plank platform and balancing on their toes taking cautious strides ventured along the road The sleety rain was turning to snow The air was stealthily cold Beneath an inch of water was a layer of ice so that as they wavered with their suit cases they slid and almost fell 
1100_124547_000014_000003	train-clean-360	The wet snow drenched their gloves the water underfoot splashed their itching ankles 
1100_124547_000014_000004	train-clean-360	They scuffled inch by inch for three blocks 
none	none	In front of Harry Haydock s Kennicott sighed We better stop in here and phone for a machine She followed him like a wet kitten The Haydocks saw them laboring up the slippery concrete walk up the perilous front steps and came to the door chanting Well well well back again eh Say this is fine Have a fine trip My you look like a rose Carol How did you like the coast doc Well well well Where all did you go But as Kennicott began to proclaim the list of places achieved Harry interrupted with an account of how much he himself had seen two years ago When Kennicott boasted We went through the mission at Santa Barbara Harry broke in Yeh that s an interesting old mission Say I ll never forget that hotel there doc It was swell Why the rooms were made just like these old monasteries Juanita and I went from Santa Barbara to San Luis Obispo You folks go to San Luis Obispo No but Well you ought to gone to San Luis Obispo And then we went from there to a ranch least they called it a ranch Kennicott got in only one considerable narrative which began Say I never knew did you Harry that in the Chicago district the Kutz Kar sells as well as the Overland I never thought much of the Kutz But I met a gentleman on the train it was when we were pulling out of Albuquerque and I was sitting on the back platform of the observation car and this man was next to me and he asked me for a light and we got to talking and come to find out he came from Aurora and when he found out I came from Minnesota he asked me if I knew doctor Clemworth of Red Wing and of course while I ve never met him I ve heard of Clemworth lots of times and seems he s this man s brother Quite a coincidence Well we got to talking and we called the porter that was a pretty good porter on that car and we had a couple bottles of ginger ale and I happened to mention the Kutz Kar and this man seems he s driven a lot of different kinds of cars he s got a Franklin now and he said that he d tried the Kutz and liked it first rate Well when we got into a station I don t remember the name of it Carrie what the deuce was the name of that first stop we made the other side of Albuquerque well anyway I guess we must have stopped there to take on water and this man and I got out to stretch our legs and darned if there wasn t a Kutz drawn right up at the depot platform and he pointed out something I d never noticed and I was glad to learn about it seems that the gear lever in the Kutz is an inch longer Even this chronicle of voyages Harry interrupted with remarks on the advantages of the ball gear shift Kennicott gave up hope of adequate credit for being a traveled man and telephoned to a garage for a Ford taxicab while Juanita kissed Carol and made sure of being the first to tell the latest which included seven distinct and proven scandals about missus Swiftwaite and one considerable doubt as to the chastity of Cy Bogart They saw the Ford sedan making its way over the water lined ice through the snow storm like a tug boat in a fog 
1100_124547_000026_000001	train-clean-360	The driver stopped at a corner 
none	none	The car skidded it turned about with comic reluctance crashed into a tree and stood tilted on a broken wheel The Kennicotts refused Harry Haydock s not too urgent offer to take them home in his car if I can manage to get it out of the garage terrible day stayed home from the store but if you say so I ll take a shot at it Carol gurgled No I think we d better walk probably make better time and I m just crazy to see my baby With their suit cases they waddled on 
1100_124547_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Their coats were soaked through 
1100_124547_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Carol had forgotten her facile hopes 
none	none	She looked about with impersonal eyes But Kennicott through rain blurred lashes caught the glory that was Back Home She noted bare tree trunks black branches the spongy brown earth between patches of decayed snow on the lawns The vacant lots were full of tall dead weeds 
1100_124547_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Stripped of summer leaves the houses were hopeless temporary shelters 
1100_124547_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Kennicott chuckled By golly look down there 
none	none	Jack Elder must have painted his garage And look Martin Mahoney has put up a new fence around his chicken yard Say that s a good fence eh 
1100_124547_000030_000005	train-clean-360	Chicken tight and dog tight 
none	none	That s certainly a dandy fence Wonder how much it cost a yard Yes sir they been building right along even in winter Got more enterprise than these Californians Pretty good to be home eh She noted that all winter long the citizens had been throwing garbage into their back yards to be cleaned up in spring The recent thaw had disclosed heaps of ashes dog bones torn bedding clotted paint cans all half covered by the icy pools which filled the hollows of the yards The refuse had stained the water to vile colors of waste thin red sour yellow streaky brown Kennicott chuckled Look over there on Main Street 
1100_124547_000032_000001	train-clean-360	They got the feed store all fixed up and a new sign on it black and gold 
none	none	That ll improve the appearance of the block a lot She noted that the few people whom they passed wore their raggedest coats for the evil day They were scarecrows in a shanty town To think she marveled of coming two thousand miles past mountains and cities to get off here and to plan to stay here What conceivable reason for choosing this particular place She noted a figure in a rusty coat and a cloth cap 
1100_124547_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Kennicott chuckled Look who s coming 
none	none	It s Sam Clark Gosh all rigged out for the weather The two men shook hands a dozen times and in the Western fashion bumbled Well well well well you old hell hound you old devil how are you anyway You old horse thief maybe it ain t good to see you again While Sam nodded at her over Kennicott s shoulder she was embarrassed
1100_124547_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps I should never have gone away 
none	none	I m out of practise in lying 
1100_124547_000037_000002	train-clean-360	I wish they would get it over 
none	none	Just a block more and my baby They were home She brushed past the welcoming Aunt Bessie and knelt by Hugh As he stammered O mummy mummy don t go away Stay with me mummy she cried No I ll never leave you again He volunteered That s daddy By golly he knows us just as if we d never been away said Kennicott You don t find any of these California kids as bright as he is at his age When the trunk came they piled about Hugh the bewhiskered little wooden men fitting one inside another the miniature junk and the Oriental drum from San Francisco Chinatown the blocks carved by the old Frenchman in San Diego the lariat from San Antonio Will you forgive mummy for going away Will you she whispered Absorbed in Hugh asking a hundred questions about him had he had any colds did he still dawdle over his oatmeal what about unfortunate morning incidents she viewed Aunt Bessie only as a source of information and was able to ignore her hint pointed by a coyly shaken finger Now that you ve had such a fine long trip and spent so much money and all I hope you re going to settle down and be satisfied and not
1100_124547_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Does he like carrots yet replied Carol 
none	none	She was cheerful as the snow began to conceal the slatternly yards She assured herself that the streets of New York and Chicago were as ugly as Gopher Prairie in such weather she dismissed the thought But they do have charming interiors for refuge She sang as she energetically looked over Hugh s clothes The afternoon grew old and dark Aunt Bessie went home Carol took the baby into her own room The maid came in complaining I can t get no extra milk to make chipped beef for supper Hugh was sleepy and he had been spoiled by Aunt Bessie Even to a returned mother his whining and his trick of seven times snatching her silver brush were fatiguing As a background behind the noises of Hugh and the kitchen the house reeked with a colorless stillness From the window she heard Kennicott greeting the Widow Bogart as he had always done always every snowy evening Guess this ll keep up all night She waited There they were the furnace sounds unalterable eternal removing ashes shoveling coal Yes She was back home 
1100_124547_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Nothing had changed 
none	none	She had never been away California Had she seen it Had she for one minute left this scraping sound of the small shovel in the ash pit of the furnace But Kennicott preposterously supposed that she had Never had she been quite so far from going away as now when he believed she had just come back She felt oozing through the walls the spirit of small houses and righteous people At that instant she knew that in running away she had merely hidden her doubts behind the officious stir of travel Dear God don t let me begin agonizing again she sobbed Hugh wept with her Wait for mummy a second She hastened down to the cellar to Kennicott 
1100_124547_000051_000000	train-clean-360	He was standing before the furnace 
none	none	However inadequate the rest of the house he had seen to it that the fundamental cellar should be large and clean the square pillars whitewashed and the bins for coal and potatoes and trunks convenient A glow from the drafts fell on the smooth gray cement floor at his feet He was whistling tenderly staring at the furnace with eyes which saw the black domed monster as a symbol of home and of the beloved routine to which he had returned his gipsying decently accomplished his duty of viewing sights and curios performed with thoroughness Unconscious of her he stooped and peered in at the blue flames among the coals He closed the door briskly and made a whirling gesture with his right hand out of pure bliss He saw her Why hello old lady Pretty darn good to be back eh Yes she lied while she quaked Not now I can t face the job of explaining now He s been so good He trusts me And I m going to break his heart She smiled at him She tidied his sacred cellar by throwing an empty bluing bottle into the trash bin She mourned It s only the baby that holds me If Hugh died She fled upstairs in panic and made sure that nothing had happened to Hugh in these four minutes 
1100_124547_000055_000000	train-clean-360	She saw a pencil mark on a window sill 
none	none	She had made it on a September day when she had been planning a picnic for Fern Mullins and Erik Fern and she had been hysterical with nonsense had invented mad parties for all the coming winter She glanced across the alley at the room which Fern had occupied A rag of a gray curtain masked the still window She tried to think of some one to whom she wanted to telephone There was no one

none	none	A dozen times they told her how glad they were to have her back It is good to be wanted she thought It will drug me But Oh is all life always an unresolved But CHAPTER XXXV SHE tried to be content which was a contradiction in terms She fanatically cleaned house all April She knitted a sweater for Hugh She was diligent at Red Cross work She was silent when Vida raved that though America hated war as much as ever we must invade Germany and wipe out every man because it was now proven that there was no soldier in the German army who was not crucifying prisoners and cutting off babies hands Carol was volunteer nurse when missus Champ Perry suddenly died of pneumonia

none	none	Farmers coming in with sled loads of wheat complained that Champ could not read the scale that he seemed always to be watching some one back in the darkness of the bins He was seen slipping through alleys talking to himself trying to avoid observation creeping at last to the cemetery Once Carol followed him and found the coarse tobacco stained unimaginative old man lying on the snow of the grave his thick arms spread out across the raw mound as if to protect her from the cold her whom he had carefully covered up every night for sixty years who was alone there now uncared for

1246_124548_000004_000000	train-clean-100	She tried to have him appointed to the postmastership which since all the work was done by assistants was the one sinecure in town the one reward for political purity 
1246_124548_000004_000001	train-clean-100	But it proved that mister Bert Tybee the former bartender desired the postmastership

none	none	She set out for Washington in October just before the war ended She had determined on Washington because it was less intimidating than the obvious New York because she hoped to find streets in which Hugh could play and because in the stress of war work with its demand for thousands of temporary clerks she could be initiated into the world of offices Hugh was to go with her despite the wails and rather extensive comments of Aunt Bessie She wondered if she might not encounter Erik in the East but it was a chance thought soon forgotten III The last thing she saw on the station platform was Kennicott faithfully waving his hand his face so full of uncomprehending loneliness that he could not smile but only twitch up his lips She waved to him as long as she could and when he was lost she wanted to leap from the vestibule and run back to him She thought of a hundred tendernesses she had neglected 
512_124549_000050_000000	train-clean-360	She had her freedom and it was empty 
512_124549_000050_000001	train-clean-360	The moment was not the highest of her life but the lowest and most desolate which was altogether excellent for instead of slipping downward she began to climb 
none	none	She sighed I couldn t do this if it weren t for Will s kindness his giving me money But a second after I wonder how many women would always stay home if they had the money 
512_124549_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Hugh complained Notice me mummy

1246_124550_000001_000000	train-clean-100	CHAPTER XXXVII
none	none	 I SHE found employment in the Bureau of War Risk Insurance 
1246_124550_000003_000001	train-clean-100	Though the armistice with Germany was signed a few weeks after her coming to Washington the work of the bureau continued 
1246_124550_000003_000002	train-clean-100	She filed correspondence all day then she dictated answers to letters of inquiry 
1246_124550_000003_000003	train-clean-100	It was an endurance of monotonous details yet she asserted that she had found real work 
none	none	Disillusions she did have 
1246_124550_000004_000001	train-clean-100	She discovered that in the afternoon office routine stretches to the grave 
none	none	She discovered that an office is as full of cliques and scandals as a Gopher Prairie She discovered that most of the women in the government bureaus lived unhealthfully dining on snatches in their crammed apartments But she also discovered that business women may have friendships and enmities as frankly as men and may revel in a bliss which no housewife attains a free Sunday 
1246_124550_000004_000005	train-clean-100	It did not appear that the Great World needed her inspiration but she felt that her letters her contact with the anxieties of men and women all over the country were a part of vast affairs not confined to Main Street and a kitchen but linked with Paris Bangkok Madrid 
1246_124550_000005_000000	train-clean-100	She perceived that she could do office work without losing any of the putative feminine virtue of domesticity that cooking and cleaning when divested of the fussing of an Aunt Bessie take but a tenth of the time which in a Gopher Prairie it is but decent to devote to them 
1246_124550_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Not to have to apologize for her thoughts to the Jolly Seventeen not to have to report to Kennicott at the end of the day all that she had done or might do was a relief which made up for the office weariness 
1246_124550_000006_000001	train-clean-100	She felt that she was no longer one half of a marriage but the whole of a human being 
none	none	II 
1246_124550_000008_000000	train-clean-100	Washington gave her all the graciousness in which she had had faith white columns seen across leafy parks spacious avenues twisty alleys Daily she passed a dark square house with a hint of magnolias and a courtyard behind it and a tall curtained second story window through which a woman was always peering 
1246_124550_000008_000001	train-clean-100	The woman was mystery romance a story which told itself differently every day now she was a murderess now the neglected wife of an ambassador 
none	none	It was mystery which Carol had most lacked in Gopher Prairie where every house was open to view where every person was but too easy to meet where there were no secret gates opening upon moors over which one might walk by moss deadened paths to strange high adventures in an ancient garden As she flitted up Sixteenth Street after a Kreisler recital given late in the afternoon for the government clerks as the lamps kindled in spheres of soft fire as the breeze flowed into the street fresh as prairie winds and kindlier as she glanced up the elm alley of Massachusetts Avenue as she was rested by the integrity of the Scottish Rite Temple she loved the city as she loved no one save Hugh She encountered negro shanties turned into studios with orange curtains and pots of mignonette marble houses on New Hampshire Avenue with butlers and limousines and men who looked like fictional explorers and aviators Her days were swift and she knew that in her folly of running away she had found the courage to be wise She had a dispiriting first month of hunting lodgings in the crowded city She had to roost in a hall room in a moldy mansion conducted by an indignant decayed gentlewoman and leave Hugh to the care of a doubtful nurse But later she made a home III 
1246_124550_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Her first acquaintances were the members of the Tincomb Methodist Church a vast red brick tabernacle 
1246_124550_000012_000001	train-clean-100	Vida Sherwin had given her a letter to an earnest woman with eye glasses plaid silk waist and a belief in Bible Classes who introduced her to the Pastor and the Nicer Members of Tincomb 
1246_124550_000012_000002	train-clean-100	Carol recognized in Washington as she had in California a transplanted and guarded Main Street 
none	none	Two thirds of the church members had come from Gopher Prairies The church was their society and their standard they went to Sunday service Sunday School Christian Endeavor missionary lectures church suppers precisely as they had at home they agreed that ambassadors and flippant newspapermen and infidel scientists of the bureaus were equally wicked and to be avoided and by cleaving to Tincomb Church they kept their ideals from all contamination 
1246_124550_000013_000000	train-clean-100	They welcomed Carol asked about her husband gave her advice regarding colic in babies passed her the gingerbread and scalloped potatoes at church suppers and in general made her very unhappy and lonely so that she wondered if she might not enlist in the militant suffrage organization and be allowed to go to jail 
none	none	Always she was to perceive in Washington as doubtless she would have perceived in New York or London a thick streak of Main Street The cautious dullness of a Gopher Prairie appeared in boarding houses where ladylike bureau clerks gossiped to polite young army officers about the movies a thousand Sam Clarks and a few Widow Bogarts were to be identified in the Sunday motor procession in theater parties and at the dinners of State Societies to which the emigres from Texas or Michigan surged that they might confirm themselves in the faith that their several Gopher Prairies were notoriously a whole lot peppier and chummier than this stuck up East But she found a Washington which did not cleave to Main Street 
1246_124550_000016_000000	train-clean-100	Guy Pollock wrote to a cousin a temporary army captain a confiding and buoyant lad who took Carol to tea dances and laughed as she had always wanted some one to laugh about nothing in particular 
1246_124550_000016_000001	train-clean-100	The captain introduced her to the secretary of a congressman a cynical young widow with many acquaintances in the navy 
none	none	Through her Carol met commanders and majors newspapermen chemists and geographers and fiscal experts from the bureaus and a teacher who was a familiar of the militant suffrage headquarters 
1246_124550_000016_000003	train-clean-100	The teacher took her to headquarters 
none	none	Carol never became a prominent suffragist Indeed her only recognized position was as an able addresser of envelopes 
1246_124550_000016_000006	train-clean-100	But she was casually adopted by this family of friendly women who when they were not being mobbed or arrested took dancing lessons or went picnicking up the Chesapeake Canal or talked about the politics of the American Federation of Labor 
1246_124550_000017_000000	train-clean-100	With the congressman s secretary and the teacher Carol leased a small flat 
none	none	Here she found home her own place and her own people She had though it absorbed most of her salary an excellent nurse for Hugh 
1246_124550_000017_000003	train-clean-100	She herself put him to bed and played with him on holidays 
1246_124550_000017_000004	train-clean-100	There were walks with him there were motionless evenings of reading but chiefly Washington was associated with people scores of them sitting about the flat talking talking talking not always wisely but always excitedly It was not at all the artist s studio of which because of its persistence in fiction she had dreamed 
none	none	Most of them were in offices all day and thought more in card catalogues or statistics than in mass and color 
1246_124550_000017_000006	train-clean-100	But they played very simply and they saw no reason why anything which exists cannot also be acknowledged 
none	none	She was sometimes shocked quite as she had shocked Gopher Prairie by these girls with their cigarettes and elfish knowledge When they were most eager about soviets or canoeing she listened longed to have some special learning which would distinguish her and sighed that her adventure had come so late 
1246_124550_000018_000002	train-clean-100	Kennicott and Main Street had drained her self reliance the presence of Hugh made her feel temporary 
1246_124550_000018_000003	train-clean-100	Some day oh she d have to take him back to open fields and the right to climb about hay lofts 
none	none	But the fact that she could never be eminent among these scoffing enthusiasts did not keep her from being proud of them from defending them in imaginary conversations with Kennicott who grunted she could hear his voice They re simply a bunch of wild impractical theorists sittin round chewing the rag and I haven t got the time to chase after a lot of these fool fads I m too busy putting aside a stake for our old age 
1246_124550_000020_000000	train-clean-100	Most of the men who came to the flat whether they were army officers or radicals who hated the army had the easy gentleness the acceptance of women without embarrassed banter for which she had longed in Gopher Prairie 
1246_124550_000020_000001	train-clean-100	Yet they seemed to be as efficient as the Sam Clarks 
1246_124550_000020_000002	train-clean-100	She concluded that it was because they were of secure reputation not hemmed in by the fire of provincial jealousies 
1246_124550_000020_000003	train-clean-100	Kennicott had asserted that the villager s lack of courtesy is due to his poverty 
none	none	We re no millionaire dudes he boasted Yet these army and navy men these bureau experts and organizers of multitudinous leagues were cheerful on three or four thousand a year while Kennicott had outside of his land speculations six thousand or more and Sam had eight 
1246_124550_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Nor could she upon inquiry learn that many of this reckless race died in the poorhouse 
1246_124550_000021_000001	train-clean-100	That institution is reserved for men like Kennicott who after devoting fifty years to putting aside a stake incontinently invest the stake in spurious oil stocks 
none	none	IV She was encouraged to believe that she had not been abnormal in viewing Gopher Prairie as unduly tedious and slatternly 
1246_124550_000023_000001	train-clean-100	She found the same faith not only in girls escaped from domesticity but also in demure old ladies who tragically deprived of esteemed husbands and huge old houses yet managed to make a very comfortable thing of it by living in small flats and having time to read 
1246_124550_000024_000000	train-clean-100	But she also learned that by comparison Gopher Prairie was a model of daring color clever planning and frenzied intellectuality 
none	none	From her teacher housemate she had a sardonic description of a Middlewestern railroad division town of the same size as Gopher Prairie but devoid of lawns and trees a town where the tracks sprawled along the cinder scabbed Main Street and the railroad shops dripping soot from eaves and doorway rolled out smoke in greasy coils Other towns she came to know by anecdote a prairie village where the wind blew all day long and the mud was two feet thick in spring and in summer the flying sand scarred new painted houses and dust covered the few flowers set out in pots New England mill towns with the hands living in rows of cottages like blocks of lava 
1246_124550_000025_000002	train-clean-100	A rich farming center in New Jersey off the railroad furiously pious ruled by old men unbelievably ignorant old men sitting about the grocery talking of James G Blaine 
none	none	A Southern town full of the magnolias and white columns which Carol had accepted as proof of romance but hating the negroes obsequious to the Old Families 
1246_124550_000025_000004	train-clean-100	A Western mining settlement like a tumor 
none	none	A booming semi city with parks and clever architects visited by famous pianists and unctuous lecturers but irritable from a struggle between union labor and the manufacturers association so that in even the gayest of the new houses there was a ceaseless and intimidating heresy hunt V 
1246_124550_000027_000000	train-clean-100	The chart which plots Carol s progress is not easy to read 
none	none	The lines are broken and uncertain of direction often instead of rising they sink in wavering scrawls and the colors are watery blue and pink and the dim gray of rubbed pencil marks A few lines are traceable 
1246_124550_000028_000000	train-clean-100	Unhappy women are given to protecting their sensitiveness by cynical gossip by whining by high church and new thought religions or by a fog of vagueness 
none	none	Carol had hidden in none of these refuges from reality but she who was tender and merry had been made timorous by Gopher Prairie 
1246_124550_000028_000002	train-clean-100	Even her flight had been but the temporary courage of panic 
1246_124550_000028_000003	train-clean-100	The thing she gained in Washington was not information about office systems and labor unions but renewed courage that amiable contempt called poise 
1246_124550_000028_000004	train-clean-100	Her glimpse of tasks involving millions of people and a score of nations reduced Main Street from bloated importance to its actual pettiness 
1246_124550_000028_000005	train-clean-100	She could never again be quite so awed by the power with which she herself had endowed the Vidas and Blaussers and Bogarts 
none	none	From her work and from her association with women who had organized suffrage associations in hostile cities or had defended political prisoners she caught something of an impersonal attitude saw that she had been as touchily personal as Maud Dyer And why she began to ask did she rage at individuals 
1246_124550_000030_000001	train-clean-100	Not individuals but institutions are the enemies and they most afflict the disciples who the most generously serve them 
none	none	They insinuate their tyranny under a hundred guises and pompous names such as Polite Society the Family the Church Sound Business the Party the Country the Superior White Race and the only defense against them Carol beheld is unembittered laughter CHAPTER XXXVIII SHE had lived in Washington for a year She was tired of the office It was tolerable far more tolerable than housework but it was not adventurous She was having tea and cinnamon toast alone at a small round table on the balcony of Rauscher s Confiserie Four debutantes clattered in She had felt young and dissipated had thought rather well of her black and leaf green suit but as she watched them thin of ankle soft under the chin seventeen or eighteen at most smoking cigarettes with the correct ennui and talking of bedroom farces and their desire to run up to New York and see something racy she became old and rustic and plain and desirous of retreating from these hard brilliant children to a life easier and more sympathetic When they flickered out and one child gave orders to a chauffeur Carol was not a defiant philosopher but a faded government clerk from Gopher Prairie Minnesota She started dejectedly up Connecticut Avenue She stopped her heart stopped Coming toward her were Harry and Juanita Haydock She ran to them she kissed Juanita while Harry confided Hadn t expected to come to Washington had to go to New York for some buying didn t have your address along just got in this morning wondered how in the world we could get hold of you She was definitely sorry to hear that they were to leave at nine that evening and she clung to them as long as she could She took them to saint Mark s for dinner Stooped her elbows on the table she heard with excitement that Cy Bogart had the flu but of course he was too gol darn mean to die of it Will wrote me that mister Blausser has gone away How did he get on Fine Fine Great loss to the town There was a real public spirited fellow all right She discovered that she now had no opinions whatever about mister Blausser and she said sympathetically Will you keep up the town boosting campaign Harry fumbled Well we ve dropped it just temporarily but sure you bet Say did the doc write you about the luck B J Gougerling had hunting ducks down in Texas When the news had been told and their enthusiasm had slackened she looked about and was proud to be able to point out a senator to explain the cleverness of the canopied garden She fancied that a man with dinner coat and waxed mustache glanced superciliously at Harry s highly form fitting bright brown suit and Juanita s tan silk frock which was doubtful at the seams She glared back defending her own daring the world not to appreciate them Then waving to them she lost them down the long train shed She stood reading the list of stations Harrisburg Pittsburg Chicago Beyond Chicago She saw the lakes and stubble fields heard the rhythm of insects and the creak of a buggy was greeted by Sam Clark s Well well how s the little lady Nobody in Washington cared enough for her to fret about her sins as Sam did But that night they had at the flat a man just back from Finland II She was on the Powhatan roof with the captain At a table somewhat vociferously buying improbable soft drinks for two fluffy girls was a man with a large familiar back Oh I think I know him she murmured Who There Oh Bresnahan Percy Bresnahan Yes You ve met him What sort of a man is he He s a good hearted idiot I rather like him and I believe that as a salesman of motors he s a wonder But he s a nuisance in the aeronautic section Tries so hard to be useful but he doesn t know anything he doesn t know anything Rather pathetic rich man poking around and trying to be useful Do you want to speak to him No no I don t think so III She was at a motion picture show The film was a highly advertised and abysmal thing smacking of simpering hair dressers cheap perfume red plush suites on the back streets of tenderloins and complacent fat women chewing gum It pretended to deal with the life of studios The leading man did a portrait which was a masterpiece He also saw visions in pipe smoke and was very brave and poor and pure He had ringlets and his masterpiece was strangely like an enlarged photograph Carol prepared to leave On the screen in the role of a composer appeared an actor called Eric Valour She was startled incredulous then wretched Looking straight out at her wearing a beret and a velvet jacket was Erik Valborg He had a pale part which he played neither well nor badly She speculated I could have made so much of him She did not finish her speculation She went home and read Kennicott s letters They had seemed stiff and undetailed but now there strode from them a personality a personality unlike that of the languishing young man in the velvet jacket playing a dummy piano in a canvas room IV Kennicott first came to see her in November thirteen months after her arrival in Washington When he announced that he was coming she was not at all sure that she wished to see him She was glad that he had made the decision himself She had leave from the office for two days She watched him marching from the train solid assured carrying his heavy suit case and she was diffident he was such a bulky person to handle They kissed each other questioningly and said at the same time You re looking fine how s the baby and You re looking awfully well dear how is everything He grumbled I don t want to butt in on any plans you ve made or your friends or anything but if you ve got time for it I d like to chase around Washington and take in some restaurants and shows and stuff and forget work for a while She realized in the taxicab that he was wearing a soft gray suit a soft easy hat a flippant tie Like the new outfit Got em in Chicago Gosh I hope they re the kind you like They spent half an hour at the flat with Hugh She was flustered but he gave no sign of kissing her again As he moved about the small rooms she realized that he had had his new tan shoes polished to a brassy luster There was a recent cut on his chin He must have shaved on the train just before coming into Washington It was pleasant to feel how important she was how many people she recognized as she took him to the Capitol as she told him he asked and she obligingly guessed how many feet it was to the top of the dome as she pointed out Senator LaFollette and the vice president and at lunch time showed herself an habitue by leading him through the catacombs to the senate restaurant She realized that he was slightly more bald The familiar way in which his hair was parted on the left side agitated her She looked down at his hands and the fact that his nails were as ill treated as ever touched her more than his pleading shoe shine You d like to motor down to Mount Vernon this afternoon wouldn t you she said It was the one thing he had planned He was delighted that it seemed to be a perfectly well bred and Washingtonian thing to do He shyly held her hand on the way and told her the news they were excavating the basement for the new schoolbuilding Vida made him tired the way she always looked at the Maje poor Chet Dashaway had been killed in a motor accident out on the Coast He did not coax her to like him At Mount Vernon he admired the paneled library and Washington s dental tools She knew that he would want oysters that he would have heard of Harvey s apropos of Grant and Blaine and she took him there At dinner his hearty voice his holiday enjoyment of everything turned into nervousness in his desire to know a number of interesting matters such as whether they still were married But he did not ask questions and he said nothing about her returning He cleared his throat and observed Oh say been trying out the old camera Don t you think these are pretty good He tossed over to her thirty prints of Gopher Prairie and the country about Without defense she was thrown into it She remembered that he had lured her with photographs in courtship days she made a note of his sameness his satisfaction with the tactics which had proved good before but she forgot it in the familiar places She was seeing the sun speckled ferns among birches on the shore of Minniemashie wind rippled miles of wheat the porch of their own house where Hugh had played Main Street where she knew every window and every face She handed them back with praise for his photography and he talked of lenses and time exposures Dinner was over and they were gossiping of her friends at the flat but an intruder was with them sitting back persistent inescapable She could not endure it She stammered I had you check your bag at the station because I wasn t quite sure where you d stay I m dreadfully sorry we haven t room to put you up at the flat We ought to have seen about a room for you before Don t you think you better call up the Willard or the Washington now He peered at her cloudily Without words he asked without speech she answered whether she was also going to the Willard or the Washington But she tried to look as though she did not know that they were debating anything of the sort She would have hated him had he been meek about it But he was neither meek nor angry However impatient he may have been with her blandness he said readily Yes guess I better do that Excuse me a second Then how about grabbing a taxi Gosh isn t it the limit the way these taxi shuffers skin around a corner Got more nerve driving than I have and going up to your flat for a while Like to meet your friends must be fine women and I might take a look and see how Hugh sleeps Like to know how he breathes Don t think he has adenoids but I better make sure eh He patted her shoulder At the flat they found her two housemates and a girl who had been to jail for suffrage Kennicott fitted in surprisingly He laughed at the girl s story of the humors of a hunger strike he told the secretary what to do when her eyes were tired from typing and the teacher asked him not as the husband of a friend but as a physician whether there was anything to this inoculation for colds His colloquialisms seemed to Carol no more lax than their habitual slang Like an older brother he kissed her good night in the midst of the company He s terribly nice said her housemates and waited for confidences They got none nor did her own heart She could find nothing definite to agonize about She felt that she was no longer analyzing and controlling forces but swept on by them He came to the flat for breakfast and washed the dishes That was her only occasion for spite Back home he never thought of washing dishes She took him to the obvious sights the Treasury the Monument the Corcoran Gallery the Pan American Building the Lincoln Memorial with the Potomac beyond it and the Arlington hills and the columns of the Lee Mansion For all his willingness to play there was over him a melancholy which piqued her His normally expressionless eyes had depths to them now and strangeness As they walked through Lafayette Square looking past the Jackson statue at the lovely tranquil facade of the White House he sighed I wish I d had a shot at places like this When I was in the U I had to earn part of my way and when I wasn t doing that or studying I guess I was roughhousing My gang were a great bunch for bumming around and raising Cain Maybe if I d been caught early and sent to concerts and all that Would I have been what you call intelligent Oh my dear don t be humble You are intelligent For instance you re the most thorough doctor He was edging about something he wished to say He pounced on it You did like those pictures of G P pretty well after all didn t you Yes of course Wouldn t be so bad to have a glimpse of the old town would it No it wouldn t Just as I was terribly glad to see the Haydocks But please understand me That doesn t mean that I withdraw all my criticisms The fact that I might like a glimpse of old friends hasn t any particular relation to the question of whether Gopher Prairie oughtn t to have festivals and lamb chops Hastily No no Sure not I und stand But I know it must have been pretty tiresome to have to live with anybody as perfect as I was He grinned She liked his grin V He was thrilled by old negro coachmen admirals aeroplanes the building to which his income tax would eventually go a Rolls Royce Lynnhaven oysters the Supreme Court Room a New York theatrical manager down for the try out of a play the house where Lincoln died the cloaks of Italian officers the barrows at which clerks buy their box lunches at noon the barges on the Chesapeake Canal and the fact that District of Columbia cars had both District and Maryland licenses She resolutely took him to her favorite white and green cottages and Georgian houses He admitted that fanlights and white shutters against rosy brick were more homelike than a painty wooden box He volunteered I see how you mean They make me think of these pictures of an old fashioned Christmas Oh if you keep at it long enough you ll have Sam and me reading poetry and everything Oh say d I tell you about this fierce green Jack Elder s had his machine painted VI They were at dinner He hinted Before you showed me those places today I d already made up my mind that when I built the new house we used to talk about I d fix it the way you wanted it I m pretty practical about foundations and radiation and stuff like that but I guess I don t know a whole lot about architecture My dear it occurs to me with a sudden shock that I don t either Well anyway you let me plan the garage and the plumbing and you do the rest if you ever I mean if you ever want to Doubtfully That s sweet of you Look here Carrie you think I m going to ask you to love me I m not And I m not going to ask you to come back to Gopher Prairie She gaped It s been a whale of a fight But I guess I ve got myself to see that you won t ever stand G P unless you WANT to come back to it I needn t say I m crazy to have you But I won t ask you I just want you to know how I wait for you Every mail I look for a letter and when I get one I m kind of scared to open it I m hoping so much that you re coming back Evenings You know I didn t open the cottage down at the lake at all this past summer Simply couldn t stand all the others laughing and swimming and you not there I used to sit on the porch in town and I I couldn t get over the feeling that you d simply run up to the drug store and would be right back and till after it got dark I d catch myself watching looking up the street and you never came and the house was so empty and still that I didn t like to go in And sometimes I fell asleep there in my chair and didn t wake up till after midnight and the house Oh the devil Please get me Carrie I just want you to know how welcome you ll be if you ever do come But I m not asking you to You re It s awfully Nother thing I m going to be frank I haven t always been absolutely uh absolutely proper I ve always loved you more than anything else in the world you and the kid But sometimes when you were chilly to me I d get lonely and sore and pike out and Never intended She rescued him with a pitying It s all right Let s forget it But before we were married you said if your husband ever did anything wrong you d want him to tell you Did I I can t remember And I can t seem to think Oh my dear I do know how generously you re trying to make me happy The only thing is I can t think I don t know what I think Then listen Don t think Here s what I want you to do Get a two weeks leave from your office Weather s beginning to get chilly here Let s run down to Charleston and Savannah and maybe Florida A second honeymoon indecisively No Don t even call it that Call it a second wooing I won t ask anything I just want the chance to chase around with you I guess I never appreciated how lucky I was to have a girl with imagination and lively feet to play with So Could you maybe run away and see the South with me If you wanted to you could just you could just pretend you were my sister and I ll get an extra nurse for Hugh I ll get the best dog gone nurse in Washington VII It was in the Villa Margherita by the palms of the Charleston Battery and the metallic harbor that her aloofness melted When they sat on the upper balcony enchanted by the moon glitter she cried Shall I go back to Gopher Prairie with you Decide for me I m tired of deciding and undeciding No You ve got to do your own deciding As a matter of fact in spite of this honeymoon I don t think I want you to come home Not yet She could only stare I want you to be satisfied when you get there I ll do everything I can to keep you happy but I ll make lots of breaks so I want you to take time and think it over She was relieved She still had a chance to seize splendid indefinite freedoms She might go oh she d see Europe somehow before she was recaptured But she also had a firmer respect for Kennicott She had fancied that her life might make a story She knew that there was nothing heroic or obviously dramatic in it no magic of rare hours nor valiant challenge but it seemed to her that she was of some significance because she was commonplaceness the ordinary life of the age made articulate and protesting It had not occurred to her that there was also a story of Will Kennicott into which she entered only so much as he entered into hers that he had bewilderments and concealments as intricate as her own and soft treacherous desires for sympathy Thus she brooded looking at the amazing sea holding his hand VIII She was in Washington Kennicott was in Gopher Prairie writing as dryly as ever about water pipes and goose hunting and missus Fageros s mastoid She was talking at dinner to a generalissima of suffrage Should she return The leader spoke wearily My dear I m perfectly selfish I can t quite visualize the needs of your husband and it seems to me that your baby will do quite as well in the schools here as in your barracks at home Then you think I d better not go back Carol sounded disappointed It s more difficult than that When I say that I m selfish I mean that the only thing I consider about women is whether they re likely to prove useful in building up real political power for women And you Shall I be frank Remember when I say you I don t mean you alone I m thinking of thousands of women who come to Washington and New York and Chicago every year dissatisfied at home and seeking a sign in the heavens women of all sorts from timid mothers of fifty in cotton gloves to girls just out of Vassar who organize strikes in their own fathers factories All of you are more or less useful to me but only a few of you can take my place because I have one virtue only one I have given up father and mother and children for the love of God Here s the test for you Do you come to conquer the East as people say or do you come to conquer yourself It s so much more complicated than any of you know so much more complicated than I knew when I put on Ground Grippers and started out to reform the world The final complication in conquering Washington or conquering New York is that the conquerors must beyond all things not conquer It must have been so easy in the good old days when authors dreamed only of selling a hundred thousand volumes and sculptors of being feted in big houses and even the Uplifters like me had a simple hearted ambition to be elected to important offices and invited to go round lecturing But we meddlers have upset everything Now the one thing that is disgraceful to any of us is obvious success The Uplifter who is very popular with wealthy patrons can be pretty sure that he has softened his philosophy to please them and the author who is making lots of money poor things I ve heard em apologizing for it to the shabby bitter enders I ve seen em ashamed of the sleek luggage they got from movie rights Do you want to sacrifice yourself in such a topsy turvy world where popularity makes you unpopular with the people you love and the only failure is cheap success and the only individualist is the person who gives up all his individualism to serve a jolly ungrateful proletariat which thumbs its nose at him Carol smiled ingratiatingly to indicate that she was indeed one who desired to sacrifice but she sighed I don t know I m afraid I m not heroic I certainly wasn t out home Why didn t I do big effective Not a matter of heroism Matter of endurance Your Middlewest is double Puritan prairie Puritan on top of New England Puritan bluff frontiersman on the surface but in its heart it still has the ideal of Plymouth Rock in a sleet storm There s one attack you can make on it perhaps the only kind that accomplishes much anywhere you can keep on looking at one thing after another in your home and church and bank and ask why it is and who first laid down the law that it had to be that way If enough of us do this impolitely enough then we ll become civilized in merely twenty thousand years or so instead of having to wait the two hundred thousand years that my cynical anthropologist friends allow Easy pleasant lucrative home work for wives asking people to define their jobs That s the most dangerous doctrine I know Carol was mediating I will go back I will go on asking questions I ve always done it and always failed at it and it s all I can do I m going to ask Ezra Stowbody why he s opposed to the nationalization of railroads and ask Dave Dyer why a druggist always is pleased when he s called doctor and maybe ask missus Bogart why she wears a widow s veil that looks like a dead crow The woman leader straightened And you have one thing You have a baby to hug That s my temptation I dream of babies of a baby and I sneak around parks to see them playing The children in Dupont Circle are like a poppy garden And the antis call me unsexed Carol was thinking in panic Oughtn t Hugh to have country air I won t let him become a yokel I can guide him away from street corner loafing I think I can On her way home Now that I ve made a precedent joined the union and gone out on one strike and learned personal solidarity I won t be so afraid Will won t always be resisting my running away Some day I really will go to Europe with him or without him I ve lived with people who are not afraid to go to jail I could invite a Miles Bjornstam to dinner without being afraid of the Haydocks I think I could I ll take back the sound of Yvette Guilbert s songs and Elman s violin They ll be only the lovelier against the thrumming of crickets in the stubble on an autumn day I can laugh now and be serene I think I can Though she should return she said she would not be utterly defeated She was glad of her rebellion The prairie was no longer empty land in the sun glare it was the living tawny beast which she had fought and made beautiful by fighting and in the village streets were shadows of her desires and the sound of her marching and the seeds of mystery and greatness IX Her active hatred of Gopher Prairie had run out She saw it now as a toiling new settlement With sympathy she remembered Kennicott s defense of its citizens as a lot of pretty good folks working hard and trying to bring up their families the best they can She recalled tenderly the young awkwardness of Main Street and the makeshifts of the little brown cottages she pitied their shabbiness and isolation had compassion for their assertion of culture even as expressed in Thanatopsis papers for their pretense of greatness even as trumpeted in boosting She saw Main Street in the dusty prairie sunset a line of frontier shanties with solemn lonely people waiting for her solemn and lonely as an old man who has outlived his friends She remembered that Kennicott and Sam Clark had listened to her songs and she wanted to run to them and sing At last she rejoiced I ve come to a fairer attitude toward the town I can love it now She was perhaps rather proud of herself for having acquired so much tolerance She awoke at three in the morning after a dream of being tortured by Ella Stowbody and the Widow Bogart I ve been making the town a myth This is how people keep up the tradition of the perfect home town the happy boyhood the brilliant college friends We forget so I ve been forgetting that Main Street doesn t think it s in the least lonely and pitiful It thinks it s God s Own Country It isn t waiting for me It doesn t care But the next evening she again saw Gopher Prairie as her home waiting for her in the sunset rimmed round with splendor She did not return for five months more five months crammed with greedy accumulation of sounds and colors to take back for the long still days She had spent nearly two years in Washington When she departed for Gopher Prairie in June her second baby was stirring within her CHAPTER XXXIX SHE wondered all the way home what her sensations would be She wondered about it so much that she had every sensation she had imagined She was excited by each familiar porch each hearty Well well and flattered to be for a day the most important news of the community She bustled about making calls Juanita Haydock bubbled over their Washington encounter and took Carol to her social bosom This ancient opponent seemed likely to be her most intimate friend for Vida Sherwin though she was cordial stood back and watched for imported heresies In the evening Carol went to the mill The mystical Om Om Om of the dynamos in the electric light plant behind the mill was louder in the darkness Outside sat the night watchman Champ Perry He held up his stringy hands and squeaked We ve all missed you terrible Who in Washington would miss her Who in Washington could be depended upon like Guy Pollock When she saw him on the street smiling as always he seemed an eternal thing a part of her own self After a week she decided that she was neither glad nor sorry to be back She entered each day with the matter of fact attitude with which she had gone to her office in Washington It was her task there would be mechanical details and meaningless talk what of it The only problem which she had approached with emotion proved insignificant She had on the train worked herself up to such devotion that she was willing to give up her own room to try to share all of her life with Kennicott He mumbled ten minutes after she had entered the house Say I ve kept your room for you like it was I ve kind of come round to your way of thinking Don t see why folks need to get on each other s nerves just because they re friendly Darned if I haven t got so I like a little privacy and mulling things over by myself II She had left a city which sat up nights to talk of universal transition of European revolution guild socialism free verse She had fancied that all the world was changing She found that it was not In Gopher Prairie the only ardent new topics were prohibition the place in Minneapolis where you could get whisky at thirteen dollars a quart recipes for home made beer the high cost of living the presidential election Clark s new car and not very novel foibles of Cy Bogart Their problems were exactly what they had been two years ago what they had been twenty years ago and what they would be for twenty years to come With the world a possible volcano the husbandmen were plowing at the base of the mountain A volcano does occasionally drop a river of lava on even the best of agriculturists to their astonishment and considerable injury but their cousins inherit the farms and a year or two later go back to the plowing She was unable to rhapsodize much over the seven new bungalows and the two garages which Kennicott had made to seem so important Her intensest thought about them was Oh yes they re all right I suppose The change which she did heed was the erection of the schoolbuilding with its cheerful brick walls broad windows gymnasium classrooms for agriculture and cooking It indicated Vida s triumph and it stirred her to activity any activity She went to Vida with a jaunty I think I shall work for you And I ll begin at the bottom She did She relieved the attendant at the rest room for an hour a day Her only innovation was painting the pine table a black and orange rather shocking to the Thanatopsis She talked to the farmwives and soothed their babies and was happy Thinking of them she did not think of the ugliness of Main Street as she hurried along it to the chatter of the Jolly Seventeen She wore her eye glasses on the street now She was beginning to ask Kennicott and Juanita if she didn t look young much younger than thirty three The eye glasses pinched her nose She considered spectacles They would make her seem older and hopelessly settled No She would not wear spectacles yet But she tried on a pair at Kennicott s office They really were much more comfortable III doctor Westlake Sam Clark Nat Hicks and Del Snafflin were talking in Del s barber shop Well I see Kennicott s wife is taking a whirl at the rest room now said doctor Westlake He emphasized the now Del interrupted the shaving of Sam and with his brush dripping lather he observed jocularly What ll she be up to next They say she used to claim this burg wasn t swell enough for a city girl like her and would we please tax ourselves about thirty seven point nine and fix it all up pretty with tidies on the hydrants and statoos on the lawns Sam irritably blew the lather from his lips with milky small bubbles and snorted Be a good thing for most of us roughnecks if we did have a smart woman to tell us how to fix up the town Just as much to her kicking as there was to Jim Blausser s gassing about factories And you can bet missus Kennicott is smart even if she is skittish Glad to see her back doctor Westlake hastened to play safe So was I So was I She s got a nice way about her and she knows a good deal about books or fiction anyway Of course she s like all the rest of these women not solidly founded not scholarly doesn t know anything about political economy falls for every new idea that some windjamming crank puts out But she s a nice woman She ll probably fix up the rest room and the rest room is a fine thing brings a lot of business to town And now that missus Kennicott s been away maybe she s got over some of her fool ideas Maybe she realizes that folks simply laugh at her when she tries to tell us how to run everything Sure She ll take a tumble to herself said Nat Hicks sucking in his lips judicially As far as I m concerned I ll say she s as nice a looking skirt as there is in town But yow His tone electrified them Guess she ll miss that Swede Valborg that used to work for me They was a pair Talking poetry and moonshine If they could of got away with it they d of been so darn lovey dovey Sam Clark interrupted Rats they never even thought about making love Just talking books and all that junk I tell you Carrie Kennicott s a smart woman and these smart educated women all get funny ideas but they get over em after they ve had three or four kids You ll see her settled down one of these days and teaching Sunday School and helping at sociables and behaving herself and not trying to butt into business and politics Sure After only fifteen minutes of conference on her stockings her son her separate bedroom her music her ancient interest in Guy Pollock her probable salary in Washington and every remark which she was known to have made since her return the supreme council decided that they would permit Carol Kennicott to live and they passed on to a consideration of Nat Hicks s New One about the traveling salesman and the old maid IV For some reason which was totally mysterious to Carol Maud Dyer seemed to resent her return At the Jolly Seventeen Maud giggled nervously Well I suppose you found war work a good excuse to stay away and have a swell time Juanita Don t you think we ought to make Carrie tell us about the officers she met in Washington They rustled and stared Carol looked at them Their curiosity seemed natural and unimportant Oh yes yes indeed have to do that some day she yawned She no longer took Aunt Bessie Smail seriously enough to struggle for independence She saw that Aunt Bessie did not mean to intrude that she wanted to do things for all the Kennicotts Thus Carol hit upon the tragedy of old age which is not that it is less vigorous than youth but that it is not needed by youth that its love and prosy sageness so important a few years ago so gladly offered now are rejected with laughter She divined that when Aunt Bessie came in with a jar of wild grape jelly she was waiting in hope of being asked for the recipe After that she could be irritated but she could not be depressed by Aunt Bessie s simoom of questioning She wasn t depressed even when she heard missus Bogart observe Now we ve got prohibition it seems to me that the next problem of the country ain t so much abolishing cigarettes as it is to make folks observe the Sabbath and arrest these law breakers that play baseball and go to the movies and all on the Lord s Day Only one thing bruised Carol s vanity Few people asked her about Washington They who had most admiringly begged Percy Bresnahan for his opinions were least interested in her facts She laughed at herself when she saw that she had expected to be at once a heretic and a returned hero she was very reasonable and merry about it and it hurt just as much as ever Her baby born in August was a girl Carol could not decide whether she was to become a feminist leader or marry a scientist or both but did settle on Vassar and a tricolette suit with a small black hat for her Freshman year VI Hugh was loquacious at breakfast He desired to give his impressions of owls and F Street Don t make so much noise You talk too much growled Kennicott Carol flared Don t speak to him that way Why don t you listen to him He has some very interesting things to tell What s the idea Mean to say you expect me to spend all my time listening to his chatter Why not For one thing he s got to learn a little discipline Time for him to start getting educated I ve learned much more discipline I ve had much more education from him than he has from me What s this Some new fangled idea of raising kids you got in Washington Perhaps Did you ever realize that children are people That s all right I m not going to have him monopolizing the conversation No of course We have our rights too But I m going to bring him up as a human being He has just as many thoughts as we have and I want him to develop them not take Gopher Prairie s version of them That s my biggest work now keeping myself keeping you from educating him Well let s not scrap about it But I m not going to have him spoiled Kennicott had forgotten it in ten minutes and she forgot it this time VII The Kennicotts and the Sam Clarks had driven north to a duck pass between two lakes on an autumn day of blue and copper Kennicott had given her a light twenty gauge shotgun She had a first lesson in shooting in keeping her eyes open not wincing understanding that the bead at the end of the barrel really had something to do with pointing the gun She was radiant she almost believed Sam when he insisted that it was she who had shot the mallard at which they had fired together She sat on the bank of the reedy lake and found rest in missus Clark s drawling comments on nothing The brown dusk was still Behind them were dark marshes The plowed acres smelled fresh The lake was garnet and silver The voices of the men waiting for the last flight were clear in the cool air Mark left sang Kennicott in a long drawn call Three ducks were swooping down in a swift line The guns banged and a duck fluttered The men pushed their light boat out on the burnished lake disappeared beyond the reeds Their cheerful voices and the slow splash and clank of oars came back to Carol from the dimness In the sky a fiery plain sloped down to a serene harbor It dissolved the lake was white marble and Kennicott was crying Well old lady how about hiking out for home Supper taste pretty good eh I ll sit back with Ethel she said at the car It was the first time she had called missus Clark by her given name the first time she had willingly sat back a woman of Main Street I m hungry It s good to be hungry she reflected as they drove away She looked across the silent fields to the west She was conscious of an unbroken sweep of land to the Rockies to Alaska a dominion which will rise to unexampled greatness when other empires have grown senile Before that time she knew a hundred generations of Carols will aspire and go down in tragedy devoid of palls and solemn chanting the humdrum inevitable tragedy of struggle against inertia Let s all go to the movies tomorrow night Awfully exciting film said Ethel Clark Well I was going to read a new book but All right let s go said Carol VIII They re too much for me Carol sighed to Kennicott I ve been thinking about getting up an annual Community Day when the whole town would forget feuds and go out and have sports and a picnic and a dance But Bert Tybee why did you ever elect him mayor he s kidnapped my idea He wants the Community Day but he wants to have some politician give an address That s just the stilted sort of thing I ve tried to avoid He asked Vida and of course she agreed with him Kennicott considered the matter while he wound the clock and they tramped up stairs Yes it would jar you to have Bert butting in he said amiably Are you going to do much fussing over this Community stunt Don t you ever get tired of fretting and stewing and experimenting I haven t even started Look She led him to the nursery door pointed at the fuzzy brown head of her daughter Do you see that object on the pillow Do you know what it is It s a bomb to blow up smugness If you Tories were wise you wouldn t arrest anarchists you d arrest all these children while they re asleep in their cribs Think what that baby will see and meddle with before she dies in the year two thousand She may see an industrial union of the whole world she may see aeroplanes going to Mars Yump probably be changes all right yawned Kennicott She sat on the edge of his bed while he hunted through his bureau for a collar which ought to be there and persistently wasn t I ll go on always And I am happy But this Community Day makes me see how thoroughly I m beaten That darn collar certainly is gone for keeps muttered Kennicott and louder Yes I guess you I didn t quite catch what you said dear She patted his pillows turned down his sheets as she reflected But I have won in this I ve never excused my failures by sneering at my aspirations by pretending to have gone beyond them I do not admit that Main Street is as beautiful as it should be I do not admit that Gopher Prairie is greater or more generous than Europe I do not admit that dish washing is enough to satisfy all women I may not have fought the good fight but I have kept the faith Sure You bet you have said Kennicott Well good night Sort of feels to me like it might snow tomorrow Have to be thinking about putting up the storm windows pretty soon Say did you notice whether
