whom was born Jesus who is called Christ seventeen All the generations therefore from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations and from David unto the removal to Babylon fourteen generations and from the removal to Babylon unto the Christ fourteen generations eighteen Now the birth of Jesus Christ was after this manner His mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph before they came together she was found with child by the Holy Spirit nineteen And Joseph her husband being just and not willing to expose her openly one nineteen desired to put her away privately twenty But while he thought on these things behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph son of David fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit twenty one And she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins twenty two And all this has come to pass that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet saying twenty three Behold the virgin shall be with child And shall bring forth a son And they shall call his name Immanuel which is interpreted one twenty three God with us twenty four And Joseph awaking from sleep did as the angel of the Lord bade him and took to him his wife twenty five and he knew her not till she brought forth a son one twenty five and he called his name Jesus II AND Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem two saying Where is he that is born King of the Jews For we saw his star in the east and came to do him homage three And the king Herod hearing it was troubled and all Jerusalem with him four And having assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them where the Christ should be born five And they said to him In Bethlehem of Judaea for thus it is written by the prophet six And thou Bethlehem land of Judah Art by no means least among the princes of Judah For out of thee shall come forth a Governor Who shall rule my people Israel seven Then Herod having secretly called the wise men inquired of them exactly the time of the appearing of the star eight And he sent them to Bethlehem and said Go and inquire strictly concerning the child and when ye have found him bring me word again that I also may come and do him homage nine And they having heard the king departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the child was ten And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy eleven And coming into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother and fell down and did homage to him and opening their treasures they presented to him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh twelve And being warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod they departed into their own country by another way thirteen And when they had departed behold an angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream saying Arise and take the child and his mother and flee into Egypt and be there until I bring thee word for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him fourteen And he arose and took the child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt fifteen and was there until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet saying Out of Egypt I called my son sixteen Then Herod seeing that he was mocked by the wise men was exceedingly enraged and he sent forth and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem and in all its borders from two years old and under according to the time which he had exactly learned from the wise men seventeen Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet saying eighteen A voice was heard in Ramah Weeping and great mourning two eighteen Rachel weeping for her children And would not be comforted because they are not nineteen But when Herod was dead behold an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt twenty saying Arise and take the child and his mother and go into the land of Israel for they are dead who sought the child s life twenty one And he arose and took the child and his mother and came into the land of Israel twenty two But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judaea instead of Herod his father he was afraid to go thither and being warned by God in a dream he retired into the region of Galilee twenty three And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets He shall be called a Nazarene

none	none	IN those days comes John the Immerser preaching in the wilderness of Judaea two and saying Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand three For this is he that was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah saying The voice of one crying in the wilderness Prepare the way of the Lord Make straight his paths four And he John had his raiment of camel s hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his food was locusts and wild honey five Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judaea and all the region about the Jordan six and they were immersed by him in the Jordan confessing their sins seven But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion he said to them Brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the coming wrath eight Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance nine and think not to say within yourselves We have Abraham for our father for I say to you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham ten And already the axe is laid to the root of the trees therefore every tree that brings not forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire eleven I indeed immerse you in water unto repentance but he that comes after me is mightier than I whose sandals I am not worthy to bear he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire twelve whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the garner but the chaff he will burn up with fire unquenchable thirteen Then Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be immersed by him fourteen But John sought to hinder him saying I have need to be immersed by thee and dost thou come to me fifteen And Jesus answering said to him Suffer it now for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness Then he suffered him sixteen And having been immersed Jesus went up immediately from the water and lo the heavens were opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon him seventeen And lo a voice out of heaven saying This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased IV THEN Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil two And having fasted forty days and forty nights he afterwards hungered three And coming to him the tempter said If thou art the Son of God command that these stones become loaves of bread four But he answering said It is written Man shall not live on bread alone but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God five Then the Devil takes him into the holy city and sets him on the pinnacle of the temple six and says to him If thou art the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written He will give his angels command concerning thee And on their hands they will bear thee up Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone seven Jesus said to him Again it is written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God eight Again the Devil takes him into an exceedingly high mountain and shows him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them nine and says to him All these things I will give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me ten Then Jesus says to him Get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve eleven Then the Devil leaves him and behold angels came and ministered to him twelve And hearing that John was delivered up he retired into Galilee thirteen And leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is by the sea in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali fourteen that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet saying fifteen The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali By the way of the sea beyond the Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles sixteen The people that sat in darkness saw great light And to those sitting in the region and shadow of death light sprang up seventeen From that time Jesus began to preach and to say Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand eighteen And walking by the sea of Galilee he saw two brothers Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishermen nineteen And he says to them Come after me and I will make you fishers of men twenty And they immediately leaving the nets followed him twenty one And going on from thence he saw other two brothers James the son of Zebedee and John his brother in the ship with Zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them twenty two And they immediately leaving the ship and their father followed him twenty three And Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every infirmity among the people twenty four And his fame went forth into all Syria and they brought to him all that were sick taken with divers diseases and torments and possessed with demons and lunatic and palsied and he healed them twenty five And great multitudes followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from beyond the Jordan V AND seeing the multitudes he went up into the mountain and he having sat down his disciples came to him two And he opened his mouth and taught them saying three Happy the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven four Happy they that mourn for they shall be comforted five Happy the meek for they shall inherit the earth five five six Happy they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled seven Happy the merciful for they shall obtain mercy eight Happy the pure in heart for they shall see God nine Happy the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of God ten Happy they who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven eleven Happy are ye when they shall revile and persecute you and shall say all evil against you falsely five eleven for my sake twelve Rejoice and exult because great is your reward in heaven for so they persecuted the prophets that were before you thirteen Ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt become tasteless wherewith shall it be salted It is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot by men fourteen Ye are the light of the world A city that is set on a hill can not be hid fifteen Nor do they light a lamp and put it under the bushel but on the lamp stand and it shines to all that are in the house sixteen Thus let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven seventeen Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets I came not to destroy but to fulfill eighteen For verily I say to you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law till all be fulfilled nineteen Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever shall do and teach them he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven twenty For I say to you that except your righteousness shall exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven twenty one Ye heard that it was said to those five twenty one of old Thou shalt not kill and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment twenty two But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother without cause five twenty twoa shall be in danger of the judgment and whoever shall say to his brother Raca five twenty twob shall be in danger of the council and whoever shall say Thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire twenty three Therefore if thou bringest thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother has aught against thee twenty four leave there thy gift before the altar and go first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift twenty five Agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art in the way with him lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison twenty six Verily I say to thee thou shalt not come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing twenty seven Ye heard that it was said Thou shalt not commit adultery twenty eight But I say to you that every one who looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart twenty nine And if thy right eye causes thee to offend pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish and not thy whole body be cast into hell thirty And if thy right hand causes thee to offend cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish and not thy whole body be cast into hell thirty one And it was said Whoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement thirty two But I say to you that whoever shall put away his wife save for the cause of fornication makes her commit adultery and whoever shall marry her when put away commits adultery thirty three Again ye heard that it was said to those of old five thirty three Thou shalt not swear falsely but shalt perform to the Lord thine oaths thirty four But I say to you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is God s throne thirty five nor by the earth for it is his footstool nor by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great King thirty six Nor shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black thirty seven But let your word be Yea yea Nay nay for that which is more than these comes of evil thirty eight Ye heard that it was said An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth thirty nine But I say to you that ye resist not evil but whoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also forty And if any man will sue thee at the law and take thy coat let him have thy cloak also forty one And whoever shall compel thee to go one mile go with him two forty two Give to him that asks of thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away forty three Ye heard that it was said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and shalt hate thine enemy forty four But I say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you forty five that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven for he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust forty six For if ye love those who love you what reward have ye Do not also the publicans the same forty seven And if ye salute your brethren only what do ye that excels Do not also the heathen thus forty eight Be ye therefore perfect even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect VI TAKE heed that ye do not your righteousness before men to be seen by them otherwise ye have no reward with your Father who is in heaven two Therefore when thou doest alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men Verily I say to you they have in full their reward three But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does four that thine aims may be in secret and thy Father who sees in secret will himself reward thee five And when ye pray ye shall not be as the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen by men Verily I say to you they have in full their reward six But thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and having shut thy door pray to thy Father who is in secret and thy Father who sees in secret will reward thee seven But when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking eight Be not ye therefore like to them for your Father knows what things ye have need of before ye ask him nine Do ye therefore pray after this manner Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name ten Thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so also on the earth eleven Give us this day our daily bread six eleven twelve And forgive us our debts as also we forgave our debtors thirteen And bring us not into temptation but deliver us from evil six thirteen fourteen For if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you fifteen but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses sixteen And when ye fast be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to fast Verily I say to you they have in full their reward seventeen But thou when thou fastest anoint thy head and wash thy face eighteen that thou appear not to men to fast but to thy Father who is in secret and thy Father who sees in secret will reward thee nineteen Lay not up for yourselves treasures on the earth where moth and rust consume and where thieves break through and steal twenty But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break through nor steal twenty one For where your treasure is there will your heart be also twenty two The lamp of the body is the eye If therefore thine eye be single thy whole body will be light twenty three but if thine eye be evil thy whole body will be dark If therefore the light that is in thee is darkness how great the darkness twenty four No man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will hold to one and despise the other Ye can not serve God and Mammon twenty five For this cause I say to you take not thought for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor for your body what ye shall put on Is not the life more than food and the body than raiment twenty six Behold the birds of the air that they sow not nor reap nor gather into barns and your heavenly Father feeds them Are ye not much better than they twenty seven And which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature six twenty seven twenty eight And why take ye thought for raiment Consider the lilies of the field how they grow They toil not nor spin twenty nine and I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these thirty And if God so clothes the grass of the field which to day is and to morrow is cast into the oven will he not much more you ye of little faith thirty one Take not thought therefore saying What shall we eat or What shall we drink or Wherewith shall we be clothed thirty two For after all these do the Gentiles seek For your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these thirty three But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these shall be added to you thirty four Take not thought therefore for the morrow for the morrow will take thought for itself Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof VII JUDGE not that ye be not judged two For with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you three And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother s eye but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye four Or how wilt thou say to thy brother Let me cast out the mote from thine eye and behold the beam is in thine own eye five Hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then thou wilt see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother s eye six Give not that which is holy to the dogs nor cast your pearls before the swine lest they trample them with their feet and turn and rend you seven Ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened to you eight For every one that asks receives and he that seeks finds and to him that knocks it shall be opened nine Or what man is there of you of whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone ten And if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent eleven If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him twelve Therefore all things whatever ye would that men should do to you so also do ye to them for this is the law and the prophets thirteen Enter in through the strait gate because wide is the gate and broad the way that leads to destruction and many are they who go in thereat fourteen seven fourteen Because strait is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life and few are they who find it fifteen Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves sixteen Ye shall know them from their fruits Do men gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles seventeen So every good tree brings forth good fruit but the corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit eighteen A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit nor a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit nineteen Every tree that brings not forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire twenty So then from their fruits ye shall know them twenty one Not every one that says to me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that does the will of my Father who is in heaven twenty two Many will say to me in that day Lord Lord did we not prophesy in thy name and in thy name cast out demons and in thy name do many miracles twenty three And then will I profess to them I never knew you depart from me ye who work iniquity twenty four Every one therefore who hears these sayings of mine seven twenty four and does them I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock twenty five And the rain descended and the streams came and the winds blew and fell upon that house and it did not fall for it had been founded on the rock twenty six And every one who hears these sayings of mine and does them not shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house on the sand twenty seven And the rain descended and the streams came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it twenty eight And it came to pass when Jesus ended these sayings that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching twenty nine For he taught them as having authority and not as the scribes VIII WHEN he had come down from the mountain great multitudes followed him two And behold there came a leper and bowed down to him saying Lord if thou wilt thou canst cleanse me three And stretching forth his hand he touched him saying I will be thou cleansed And immediately his leprosy was cleansed four And Jesus says to him See thou tell no one but go show thyself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony to them five And as he entered into Capernaum there came to him a centurion beseeching him six and saying Lord my servant lies at home palsied grievously tormented seven And Jesus says to him I will come and heal him eight The centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof but only say in a word and my servant will be healed nine For I am a man under authority having soldiers under me and I say to this one Go and he goes and to another Come and he comes and to my servant Do this and he does it ten And Jesus hearing it marveled and said to those who followed Verily I say to you I found not so great faith even in Israel eleven And I say to you that many will come from the east and west and will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven twelve but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth thirteen And Jesus said to the centurion Go thy way and as thou didst believe be it done to thee And his servant was healed in that hour fourteen And Jesus coming into the house of Peter saw his mother in law lying and sick with fever fifteen And he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered to him sixteen When evening was come they brought to him many that were possessed with demons and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all that were sick seventeen that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet saying Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses eighteen And Jesus seeing great multitudes about him commanded to depart to the other side nineteen And a certain scribe came and said to him Teacher I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest twenty And Jesus says to him The foxes have holes and the birds of the air nests but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head twenty one And another of his disciples said to him Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father twenty two But Jesus said to him Follow me and let the dead bury their own dead twenty three And when he had entered into the ship his disciples followed him twenty four And behold there arose a great tempest in the sea so that the ship was covered by the waves but he was sleeping twenty five And the disciples came and awoke him saying Lord save us we perish twenty six And he says to them Why are ye fearful ye of little faith Then rising he rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm twenty seven And the men marveled saying What manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him twenty eight And when he had come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes eight twenty eight there met him two possessed with demons coming out of the tombs exceedingly fierce so that no one was able to pass by that way twenty nine And behold they cried out saying What have we to do with thee Son of God Camest thou hither to torment us before the time thirty And there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding And the demons besought him saying thirty one If thou cast us out send us away into the herd of swine thirty two And he said to them Go And they coming out went away into the swine and behold the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea and perished in the waters thirty three And the herdsmen fled and went away into the city and told every thing and what had befallen the possessed with demons thirty four And behold all the city came out to meet Jesus and seeing him they besought that he would depart from their borders IX AND entering into the ship he passed over and came to his own city two And behold they brought to him one that was palsied lying on a bed And Jesus seeing their faith said to the palsied man Child be of good cheer thy sins are forgiven three And behold certain of the scribes said within themselves This man blasphemes four And Jesus knowing their thoughts said Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts five For which is easier to say Thy sins are forgiven or to say Arise and walk six But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins then says he to the palsied man Arise take up thy bed and go to thy house seven And rising up he departed to his house eight And seeing it the multitudes feared and glorified God who gave such power to men nine And Jesus passing on from thence saw a man named Matthew sitting at the place of receiving custom and he says to him Follow me And he rose up and followed him ten And it came to pass that as he reclined at table in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and reclined at table with Jesus and his disciples eleven And the Pharisees seeing it said to his disciples Why does your teacher eat with the publicans and the sinners twelve And Jesus hearing it said They who are well need not a physician but they who are sick thirteen But go and learn what this means I desire mercy and not sacrifice for I came not to call righteous men but sinners fourteen Then come to him the disciples of John saying Why do we and the Pharisees fast often but thy disciples fast not fifteen And Jesus said to them Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn nine fifteen so long as the bridegroom is with them But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them and then they will fast sixteen And no one puts a piece of unfulled cloth on an old garment for that which fills it up takes from the garment and a worse rent is made seventeen Nor do they put new wine into old skins else the skins burst and the wine runs out and the skins are destroyed But they put new wine into new skins and both are preserved together eighteen While he was speaking these things to them behold there came a ruler and bowed down to him saying My daughter just now died but come and lay thy hand upon her and she will live nineteen And Jesus arose and was following him he and his disciples twenty And behold a woman having a flow of blood twelve years came behind and touched the fringe of his garment twenty one For she said within herself If I only touch his garment I shall be made whole twenty two And Jesus turning and seeing her said Daughter be of good cheer thy faith has made thee whole twenty three And the woman was made whole from that hour And Jesus coming into the house of the ruler and seeing the minstrels and the crowd making a noise twenty four said Give place for the maiden is not dead but is sleeping And they laughed him to scorn twenty five But when the crowd was put forth he went in and took hold of her hand and the maiden arose twenty six And this report went abroad into all that land twenty seven And as Jesus passed on from thence two blind men followed him crying and saying Have mercy on us Son of David twenty eight And when he had come into the house the blind men came to him And Jesus says to them Believe ye that I am able to do this They say to him Yea Lord twenty nine Then he touched their eyes saying According to your faith be it done to you thirty And their eyes were opened And Jesus sternly charged them saying Take heed let no one know it thirty one But they going out spread abroad his fame in all that country thirty two And as they were going out behold they brought to him a man dumb possessed with a demon thirty three And the demon being cast out the dumb spoke And the multitudes marveled saying It was never so seen in Israel thirty four But the Pharisees said He casts out the demons through the prince of the demons thirty five And Jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every infirmity thirty six And seeing the multitudes he was moved with compassion for them because they were harassed and scattered nine thirty six as sheep having no shepherd thirty seven Then he says to his disciples The harvest indeed is great but the laborers are few thirty eight Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest X AND calling to him his twelve disciples he gave them authority over unclean spirits so as to cast them out and to heal every sickness and every infirmity two And the names of the twelve apostles are these first Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother James the son of Zebedee and John his brother three Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the publican James the son of Alpheus and Lebbeus surnamed Thaddeus four Simon the Cananite ten four and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him five These twelve Jesus sent forth and charged them saying Go not into the way to the Gentiles and into a city of Samaritans enter not six But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel seven And as ye go preach saying The kingdom of heaven is at hand eight Heal the sick raise the dead ten eight cleanse lepers cast out demons Freely ye received freely give nine Provide not gold nor silver nor brass in your girdles ten nor bag for the journey nor two coats nor sandals nor staff for the laborer is worthy of his living eleven And into whatever city or village ye shall enter inquire who in it is worthy and there abide till ye go thence twelve But when ye come into the house salute it thirteen And if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you fourteen And whoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when ye go out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet fifteen Verily I say to you it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city sixteen Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be therefore wise as serpents and simple as doves seventeen But beware of men for they will deliver you up to councils and will scourge you in their synagogues eighteen and before governors also and kings will ye be brought for my sake for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles nineteen But when they deliver you up take not thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak twenty For it is not ye that speak but the Spirit of your Father that speaks in you twenty one And the brother will deliver up the brother to death and the father the child and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death twenty two And ye will be hated by all for my name s sake but he that has endured to the end the same shall be saved twenty three But when they persecute you in this city flee into the other for verily I say to you ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man come twenty four A disciple is not above the teacher nor a servant above his lord twenty five It is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher and the servant as his lord If they called the master of the house Beelzebul how much more those of his household twenty six Fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known twenty seven What I say to you in the darkness that speak ye in the light and what ye hear in the ear that proclaim upon the house tops twenty eight And be not afraid of those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell twenty nine Are not two sparrows sold for a penny And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father thirty But the very hairs of your head are all numbered thirty one Fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows thirty two Every one therefore who shall acknowledge me before men him will I also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven thirty three But whoever shall deny me before men him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven thirty four Think not that I came to send peace on the earth I came not to send peace but a sword thirty five For I came to set a man at variance with his father and a daughter with her mother and a bride with her mother in law thirty six and a man s foes will be they of his household thirty seven He that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me thirty eight And he that does not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me thirty nine He that finds his life shall lose it and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it forty He that receives you receives me and he that receives me receives him who sent me forty one He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet s reward and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man s reward forty two And whoever shall give to drink a cup of cold water only to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple verily I say to you he shall not lose his reward XI AND it came to pass when Jesus made an end of commanding his twelve disciples that he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities two And John having heard in the prison the works of the Christ sent by his disciples three and said to him Art thou he that comes or look we for another four And Jesus answering said to them Go and report to John what ye hear and see five The blind receive sight and the lame walk lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised and to the poor good tidings are published six And happy is he whoever shall not be offended at me seven And as these were departing Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John What went ye out into the wilderness to behold A reed shaken by the wind eight But what went ye out to see A man clothed in soft raiment Behold they who wear soft clothing are in king s houses nine But what went ye out to see A prophet eleven nine Yea I say to you and more than a prophet ten For this is he of whom it is written Behold I send forth my messenger before thy face Who shall prepare thy way before thee eleven Verily I say to you among those born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Immerser But he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he twelve And from the days of John the Immerser until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent seize upon it thirteen For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John fourteen And if ye are willing to receive it he is the Elijah that should come fifteen He that has ears to hear let him hear sixteen But to what shall I liken this generation It is like to children sitting in the markets who call to their fellows seventeen and say We piped to you and ye danced not we sang the lament and ye did not beat the breast eighteen For John came neither eating nor drinking and they say He has a demon nineteen The Son of man came eating and drinking and they say Behold a glutton and a wine drinker a friend of publicans and sinners But wisdom was justified on the part of her children twenty Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his miracles were done because they repented not twenty one Woe to thee Chorazin Woe to thee Bethsaida For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes twenty two But I say to you it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you twenty three And thou Capernaum eleven twenty threea that wast exalted to heaven shalt go down to the underworld eleven twenty threeb For if the miracles that were done in thee had been done in Sodom it would have remained until this day twenty four But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee twenty five At that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee O Father Lord of heaven and earth that thou didst hide these things from the wise and discerning and reveal them to babes twenty six yea O Father that so it seemed good in thy sight twenty seven All things were delivered to me by my Father and no one knows the Son but the Father nor does any one know the Father but the Son and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal him twenty eight Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest twenty nine Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest for your souls thirty For my yoke is easy and my burden light XII AT that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the grain fields and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears of grain and to eat two And the Pharisees seeing it said to him Behold thy disciples are doing that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath three And he said to them Have ye not read what David did when he hungered himself and those with him four how he entered into the house of God and ate the show bread which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him but for the priests alone five Or have ye not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless six But I say to you that a greater than the temple is here seven But if ye had known what this means I desire mercy and not sacrifice ye would not have condemned the blameless eight For the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath nine And departing from thence he went into their synagogue ten And behold there was a man having his hand withered And they asked him saying Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath that they might accuse him eleven And he said to them What man will there be of you that shall have one sheep and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath will not lay hold of it and raise it up twelve How much better then is a man than a sheep So that it is lawful to do well on the sabbath thirteen Then he says to the man Stretch forth thy hand And he stretched it forth and it was restored whole as the other fourteen And the Pharisees went out and took counsel against him how they might destroy him fifteen But Jesus knowing it withdrew from thence and great multitudes followed him and he healed them all sixteen And he charged them that they should not make him known seventeen that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet saying eighteen Behold my servant whom I chose My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased I will put my spirit upon him And he will declare judgment to the Gentiles nineteen He will not strive nor cry Nor will any one hear his voice in the streets twenty A bruised reed he will not break And smoking flax he will not quench Till he send forth judgment unto victory twenty one And in his name will Gentiles hope twenty two Then was brought to him one possessed with a demon blind and dumb and he healed him so that the blind and dumb both twelve twenty two spoke and saw twenty three And all the multitudes were amazed and said Is this the Son of David twenty four But the Pharisees hearing it said This man does not cast out the demons except through Beelzebul prince of the demons twenty five And Jesus knowing their thoughts said to them Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and any city or house divided against itself shall not stand twenty six And if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself how then shall his kingdom stand twenty seven And if I through Beelzebul cast out the demons through whom do your sons cast them out Therefore they shall be your judges twenty eight But if I through the Spirit of God cast out the demons then is the kingdom of God come near to you twenty nine Or how can any one enter into a strong man s house and seize upon his goods except he first bind the strong man And then he will plunder his house thirty He that is not with me is against me and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad thirty one Therefore I say to you every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to men but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven thirty two And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man it will be forgiven him but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit it will not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in that which is to come thirty three Either make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt for from the fruit the tree is known thirty four Brood of vipers How can ye being evil speak good things For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks thirty five The good man out of the good treasure sends forth good things and the evil man out of the evil treasure sends forth evil things thirty six But I say to you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment thirty seven For from thy words thou shalt be justified and from thy words thou shalt be condemned thirty eight Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered him saying Teacher we desire to see a sign from thee thirty nine But he answering said to them An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign and no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet forty For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth forty one Men of Nineveh will rise in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here forty two A queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here forty three But when the unclean spirit is gone out from the man he goes through dry places seeking rest and finds it not forty four Then he says I will return into my house from whence I came out and coming he finds it empty swept and set in order forty five Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first So shall it be also with this wicked generation forty six While he was yet speaking to the multitudes behold his mother and his brothers were standing without seeking to speak to him forty seven And one said to him Behold thy mother and thy brothers are standing without seeking to speak to thee forty eight But he answering said to him that told him Who is my mother and who are my brothers forty nine And stretching forth his hand toward his disciples he said Behold my mother and my brothers fifty For whoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven he is my brother and sister and mother XIII AND on that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea side two And great multitudes were gathered together to him so that he went into the ship and sat down and all the multitude stood on the beach three And he spoke many things to them in parables saying four Behold the sower went forth to sow And as he sowed some fell by the way side and the birds came and devoured them five And others fell on the rocky places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprang up because they had not depth of earth six And when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had not root they withered away seven And others fell upon the thorns and the thorns came up and choked them eight And others fell on the good ground and yielded fruit some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty nine He that has ears to hear let him hear thirteen nine ten And the disciples came and said to him Why dost thou speak to them in parables eleven And he answering said to them To you it is given thirteen eleven to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given twelve For whoever has to him shall be given and he shall have abundance but whoever has not even what he has shall be taken from him thirteen Therefore I speak to them in parables because seeing they see not and hearing they hear not nor understand fourteen And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says With the hearing ye will hear and will not understand And seeing ye will see and will not perceive fifteen For the heart of this people is become gross And their ears are dull of hearing And their eyes they have closed Lest haply they see with their eyes And hear with their ears And understand with their heart And turn and I shall heal them sixteen But happy are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear seventeen For verily I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what ye are beholding and did not see and to hear what ye are hearing and did not hear eighteen Hear therefore the parable of the sower nineteen When any one hears the word of the kingdom and understands not then comes the evil one and snatches away what was sown in his heart This is that which was sown by the way side twenty And that sown on the rocky places this is he that hears the word and immediately with joy receives it twenty one and has not root in himself but is only for a time and when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word immediately he is offended twenty two And that sown among the thorns this is he that hears the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and it becomes unfruitful twenty three And that sown on the good ground this is he that hears the word and understands who bears fruit and produces some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty twenty four Another parable he put forth to them saying The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seed in his field twenty five But while men slept his enemy came and sowed darnel among the wheat and went away twenty six And when the blade sprang up and produced fruit then appeared the darnel also twenty seven And the servants of the householder came and said to him Sir didst thou not sow good seed in thy field From whence then has it darnel twenty eight He said to them An enemy did this The servants said to him Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up twenty nine He said Nay lest while ye gather up the darnel ye root up the wheat with them thirty Let both grow together until the harvest And in time of harvest I will say to the reapers Gather up first the darnel and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn thirty one Another parable he put forth to them saying The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard which a man took and sowed in his field thirty two Which is the least indeed of all seeds but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches thirty three Another parable he spoke to them The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened thirty four All these things Jesus spoke to the multitudes in parables and without a parable he spoke nothing to them thirty five that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet saying I will open my mouth in parables I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world thirty six Then having sent away the multitudes thirteen thirty six he went into the house And his disciples came to him saying Explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field thirty seven And answering he said to them He that sows the good seed is the Son of man thirty eight The field is the world The good seed these are the sons of the kingdom but the darnel are the sons of the evil one thirty nine and the enemy that sowed them is the Devil The harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are angels forty As therefore the darnel are gathered up and are burned with fire so shall it be in the end of the world forty one The Son of man will send forth his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all the causes of offense and those who do iniquity forty two and will cast them into the furnace of fire there will be the wailing and the gnashing of teeth forty three Then will the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father He that has ears to hear let him hear thirteen forty three forty four Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a treasure hidden in the field which a man found and concealed and for joy thereof thirteen forty four he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field forty five Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant seeking goodly pearls forty six and having found one pearl of great price he went and sold all that he had and bought it forty seven Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a net cast into the sea and gathering together of every kind forty eight Which when it was filled they drew up upon the beach and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but cast the bad away forty nine So will it be in the end of the world The angels will go forth and will separate the wicked from among the just fifty and will cast them into the furnace of fire there will be the wailing and the gnashing of teeth fifty one Did ye understand all these things They say to him Yea Lord fifty two And he said to them Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like to a householder who brings forth out of his treasure new and old fifty three And it came to pass when Jesus finished these parables that he departed thence fifty four And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue so that they were astonished and said Whence has this man this wisdom and the miracles Is not this the carpenter s son fifty five Is not his mother called Mary and his brothers James and Joseph thirteen fifty five and Simon and Judas fifty six And his sisters are they not all with us Whence then has this man all these things fifty seven And they were offended at him But Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honor save in his own country and in his own house fifty eight And he did not many miracles there because of their unbelief XIV AT that time Herod the tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus two And he said to his servants This is John the Immerser he is risen from the dead and therefore do these powers fourteen two work in him three For Herod laid hold of John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother four For John said to him It is not lawful for thee to have her five And though desiring to put him to death he feared the multitude because they held him as a prophet six But when Herod s birthday was kept the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod seven Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask eight And she being urged on by her mother says Give me here on a platter the head of John the Immerser nine And the king was sorry but for the sake of the oath and of those who reclined at table with him he commanded it to be given ten And he sent and beheaded John in the prison eleven And his head was brought on a platter and was given to the damsel and she brought it to her mother twelve And his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and they went and reported it to Jesus thirteen And when Jesus heard it he withdrew from thence by ship into a desert place apart And the multitudes hearing of it followed him on foot from the cities fourteen And going forth he saw a great multitude and had compassion on them and he healed their sick fifteen And when it was evening his disciples came to him saying The place is desert and the time is already passed away dismiss the multitudes that they may go away into the villages and buy themselves victuals sixteen But Jesus said to them They need not go away give ye them to eat seventeen And they say to him We have here but five loaves and two fishes eighteen He said Bring them hither to me nineteen And he commanded that the multitudes should lie down on the grass and took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples and the disciples to the multitudes twenty And they all ate and were filled and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full twenty one And they who ate were about five thousand men besides women and children twenty two And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the ship and to go before him to the other side while he dismissed the multitudes twenty three And having dismissed the multitudes he went up into the mountain apart to pray and when evening was come he was there alone twenty four But the ship was already in the midst of the sea vexed by the waves for the wind was contrary twenty five And in the fourth watch of the night he went to them walking on the sea twenty six And the disciples seeing him walking on the sea were troubled saying It is a spectre And they cried out for fear twenty seven But straightway Jesus spoke to them saying Be of good cheer it is I be not afraid twenty eight And Peter answering him said Lord if it is thou bid me come to thee on the water twenty nine And he said Come And coming down from the ship Peter walked on the water to go to Jesus thirty But seeing the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried out saying Lord save me thirty one And immediately Jesus stretching forth his hand took hold of him and said to him Thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt thirty two And when they had entered into the ship the wind ceased thirty three And those in the ship came and worshiped him fourteen thirty three saying Of a truth thou art the Son of God thirty four And passing over they came into the land of Gennesaret thirty five And the men of that place knowing him sent out into all that country round and brought to him all that were diseased thirty six and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment and as many as touched were made whole XV THEN there come to Jesus the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem saying two Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders For they wash not their hands when they eat bread three And he answering said to them Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition four For God commanded saying fifteen four Honor thy father and mother and he that curses father or mother let him surely die five But ye say Whoever says to his father or his mother It is a gift whatever thou mightest be profited with from me six shall not honor his father or his mother and ye made the word of God fifteen six of no effect for the sake of your tradition seven Hypocrites Well did Isaiah prophesy of you saying eight This people honor me with their lips But their heart is far from me nine But in vain they worship me Teaching as doctrines commandments of men ten And calling to him the multitude he said to them Hear and understand eleven Not that which enters into the mouth defiles the man but that which comes out of the mouth this defiles the man twelve Then came to him his disciples and said to him Knowest thou that the Pharisees when they heard the saying were offended thirteen And he answering said Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not shall be rooted up fourteen Let them alone they are blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both will fall into the ditch fifteen And Peter answering said to him Explain to us this parable sixteen And he said Are ye also even yet without understanding seventeen Do ye not yet understand that whatever enters into the mouth goes into the belly and is cast out into the drain eighteen But the things that proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart and they defile the man nineteen For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witnessings blasphemies twenty These are the things that defile the man but to eat with unwashen hands defiles not the man twenty one And Jesus going forth from thence withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon twenty two And behold a woman of Canaan coming out from those borders cried to him saying Have mercy on me O Lord Son of David my daughter is grievously possessed with a demon twenty three But he answered her not a word And his disciples came and besought him saying Dismiss her because she cries after us twenty four But he answering said I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel twenty five But she came and bowed down to him saying Lord help me twenty six But he answering said It is not good to take the children s bread and cast it to the dogs twenty seven And she said Yea Lord for the dogs also eat of the crumbs that fall from their masters table twenty eight Then Jesus answering said to her O woman great is thy faith be it done to thee as thou wilt And her daughter was healed from that hour twenty nine And departing from thence Jesus came near to the sea of Galilee and going up into the mountain he sat down there thirty And great multitudes came to him having with them lame blind dumb maimed and many others and laid them down at his feet and he healed them thirty one so that the multitudes wondered when they saw the dumb speaking the maimed whole the lame walking and the blind seeing and they glorified the God of Israel thirty two And Jesus having called to him his disciples said I have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and I will not dismiss them fasting lest they faint in the way thirty three And his disciples say to him Whence should we have so many loaves in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude thirty four And Jesus says to them How many loaves have ye And they said Seven and a few little fishes thirty five And he commanded the multitudes to lie down on the ground thirty six And he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and broke and gave to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude thirty seven And they all ate and were filled And they took up of the fragments that remained seven baskets full thirty eight And they who ate were four thousand men besides women and children thirty nine And dismissing the multitudes he entered into the ship and came into the borders of Magdala XVI AND the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him and tempting desired him to show them a sign from heaven two And he answering said to them When it is evening ye say Fair weather for the sky is red three And in the morning A storm to day for the sky is red and lowering Ye know how to discern the face of the sky but can ye not the signs of the times four An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign and no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah And he left them and departed five And coming to the other side his disciples forgot to take bread six And Jesus said to them Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees seven And they reasoned among themselves saying Because we took no bread eight And Jesus knowing it said Ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye took no bread nine Do ye not yet understand nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets ye took up ten Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets ye took up eleven How is it that ye do not understand that I spoke not to you of bread But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees twelve Then they understood that he did not bid them beware of the leaven of bread but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees thirteen And having come into the region of Caesarea Philippi Jesus asked his disciples saying Who do men say that the Son of man is sixteen thirteen fourteen And they said Some John the Immerser and others Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets fifteen He says to them But who do ye say that I am sixteen And Simon Peter answering said Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God seventeen And Jesus answering said to him Happy art thou Simon Bar jonah sixteen seventeen for flesh and blood did not reveal it to thee but my Father who is in heaven eighteen And I also say to thee that thou art Peter sixteen eighteena and upon this rock I will build my church sixteen eighteenb and the gates of the underworld shall not prevail against it nineteen And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven twenty Then he charged his disciples that they should tell no one that he is the Christ twenty one From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be put to death and rise on the third day twenty two And Peter taking him aside began to rebuke him saying Be it far from thee Lord this shall not be to thee twenty three But he turned and said to Peter Get thee behind me Satan sixteen twenty three thou art an offense to me for thou thinkest not the things of God but those of men twenty four Then Jesus said to his disciples If any one will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me twenty five For whoever will save his life shall lose it and whoever may lose his life for my sake shall find it twenty six For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and forfeit his soul Or what shall a man give as an exchange sixteen twenty six for his soul twenty seven For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels and then he will reward each one according to his works twenty eight Verily I say to you there are some of those standing here who shall not taste death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom XVII AND after six days Jesus takes with him Peter and James and John his brother and brings them up into a high mountain apart two And he was transfigured before them and his face shone as the sun and his garments became white as the light three And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him four And Peter answering said to Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here If thou wilt let us make here three tents one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elijah five While he was yet speaking behold a bright cloud overshadowed them And behold a voice out of the cloud saying This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him six And the disciples hearing it fell on their face and were exceedingly afraid seven And Jesus coming to them touched them and said Arise and be not afraid eight And lifting up their eyes they saw no one save Jesus only nine And as they came down out of the mountain Jesus charged them saying Tell no one the vision until the Son of man is risen from the dead ten And his disciples asked him saying Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come eleven And he answering said Elijah indeed comes and will restore all things twelve But I say to you that Elijah is already come and they knew him not but did with him whatever they would So also is the Son of man about to suffer by them thirteen Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Immerser fourteen And when they were come to the multitude there came to him a man kneeling down to him and saying fifteen Lord have mercy on my son for he is lunatic and is sorely afflicted for ofttimes he falls into the fire and oft into the water sixteen And I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him seventeen And Jesus answering said O faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you How long shall I bear with you Bring him hither to me eighteen And Jesus rebuked him and the demon went out from him and the child was cured from that hour nineteen Then the disciples coming to Jesus apart said Why could not we cast him out twenty And he said to them Because of your want of faith For verily I say to you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard ye shall say to this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible to you twenty one But this kind goes not forth except by prayer and fasting twenty two And while they abode in Galilee Jesus said to them The Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men twenty three and they will put him to death and he will rise on the third day And they were exceedingly sorrowful twenty four And they having come to Capernaum those who received the half shekel came to Peter and said Does not your teacher pay the half shekel seventeen twenty four twenty five He says Yes And when he came into the house Jesus anticipated him saying What thinkest thou Simon Of whom do the kings of the earth take customs or tribute Of their sons or of strangers twenty six He says to him Of strangers Jesus said to him Then are the sons free twenty seven But that we may not offend them go to the sea and cast a hook and take the fish that first comes up and opening its mouth thou wilt find a shekel that take and give to them for me and thee XVIII AT that time came the disciples to Jesus saying Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven two And Jesus calling a little child to him placed it in the midst of them three and said Verily I say to you if ye do not turn and become as the little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven four Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven five And whoever shall receive one such little child in my name receives me six But whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to offend it were better for him that an upper millstone were hanged about his neck and he were plunged in the depth of the sea seven Woe to the world for causes of offense For it must needs be that causes of offense come but woe to that man through whom the cause of offense comes eight But if thy hand or thy foot causes thee to offend cut it off and cast it from thee It is better for thee to enter into life lame or maimed than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the everlasting fire nine And if thine eye causes thee to offend pluck it out and cast it from thee It is better for thee to enter into life with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire ten Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for I say to you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven eleven For the Son of man came to save that which was lost twelve What think ye If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them is gone astray does he not leave the ninety and nine upon the mountains and go and seek that which is gone astray thirteen And if it be that he find it verily I say to you he rejoices over it more than over the ninety and nine that went not astray fourteen So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish fifteen But if thy brother shall sin against thee go show him his fault between thee and him alone If he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother sixteen But if he hear not take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established seventeen And if he shall neglect to hear them tell it to the church and if he neglect to hear the church also let him be to thee as a heathen and a publican eighteen Verily I say to you Whatever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven nineteen Again I say to you that if two of you shall agree on earth concerning any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven twenty For where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them twenty one Then Peter came to him and said Lord how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him Until seven times twenty two Jesus says to him I say not to thee until seven times but until seventy times seven twenty three Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king who desired to make a reckoning with his servants twenty four And when he had begun to reckon there was brought to him one who owed ten thousand talents eighteen twenty four twenty five But as he was not able to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made twenty six The servant therefore falling prostrated himself before him saying Have patience with me and I will pay thee all twenty seven And the lord of that servant moved with compassion released him and forgave him the debt twenty eight But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denaries eighteen twenty eight and laying hold of him he took him by the throat saying Pay me that thou owest twenty nine Therefore his fellow servant fell down and besought him saying Have patience with me and I will pay thee thirty And he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt thirty one And his fellow servants seeing what was done were very sorry and came and disclosed to their lord all that was done thirty two Then having called him his lord says to him Thou wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou besoughtest me thirty three Shouldest not thou also have had pity on thy fellow servant as I too had pity on thee thirty four And his lord was angry and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due to him thirty five So also will my heavenly Father do to you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother XIX AND it came to pass when Jesus finished these sayings that he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judaea beyond the Jordan two And great multitudes followed him and he healed them there three And the Pharisees came to him tempting him and saying Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause four And he answering said to them Have ye not read that he who made them nineteen four from the beginning made them male and female five and said For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall be one flesh six So that they are no longer two but one flesh What therefore God joined together let not man put asunder seven They say to him Why then did Moses command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away eight He says to them Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so nine And I say to you that whoever shall put away his wife except for fornication and shall marry another commits adultery and whoever marries her when put away commits adultery ten His disciples say to him If the case of the man with the woman is so it is not good to marry eleven But he said to them Not all can receive this saying but they to whom it is given twelve For there are eunuchs who were so born from the mother s womb and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven He that is able to receive it let him receive it thirteen Then were brought to him little children that he might put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them fourteen But Jesus said Suffer the little children and forbid them not to come to me for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven fifteen And he laid his hands on them and departed thence sixteen And behold one came to him and said Teacher what good shall I do that I may have eternal life seventeen And he said to him Why dost thou ask me concerning good One is the Good But if thou desirest to enter into life keep the commandments eighteen He says to him Which Jesus said Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness nineteen Honor thy father and thy mother and Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself twenty The young man says to him All these I kept what do I yet lack twenty one Jesus said to him If thou desirest to be perfect go sell what thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me twenty two But when the young man heard this saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions twenty three And Jesus said to his disciples Verily I say to you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven twenty four And again I say to you It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God twenty five And the disciples hearing it were exceedingly amazed saying Who then can be saved twenty six But Jesus looking on them said to them With men this is impossible but with God all things are possible twenty seven Then Peter answering said to him Behold we forsook all and followed thee what then shall we have twenty eight And Jesus said to them Verily I say to you that ye who followed me in the renovation when the Son of man shall sit on his throne of glory shall also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel twenty nine And every one who forsook houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name s sake shall receive manifold more and shall inherit everlasting life thirty But many first will be last and last first XX FOR the kingdom of heaven is like to a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard two And having agreed with the laborers for a denary twenty two a day he sent them into his vineyard three And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place four And to them he said Go ye also into the vineyard and whatever is right I will give you And they went their way five Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise six And about the eleventh he went out and found others standing and says to them Why stand ye here all the day idle seven They say to him Because no one hired us He says to them Go ye also into the vineyard eight And when evening was come the lord of the vineyard says to his steward Call the laborers and pay them the hire beginning from the last unto the first nine And they of the eleventh hour came and received every man a denary ten But when the first came they supposed that they should receive more and they also received each one a denary eleven And on receiving it they murmured against the householder twelve saying These last labored one hour and thou madest them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the burning heat thirteen But he answering said to one of them Friend I do thee no wrong Didst thou not agree with me for a denary fourteen Take what is thine and go But I will give to this last even as to thee fifteen Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own Is thine eye evil because I am good sixteen So will the last be first and the first last for many are called but few are chosen seventeen And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart and in the way he said to them eighteen Behold we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes and they will condemn him to death nineteen and will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify and on the third day he will rise again twenty Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons bowing down and asking a certain thing of him twenty one And he said to her What wilt thou She says to him Command that these my two sons shall sit one on thy right hand and one on thy left in thy kingdom twenty two But Jesus answering said Ye know not what ye ask Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of They say to him We are able twenty three And he says to them Ye shall drink indeed of my cup but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but is for them for whom it has been prepared by my Father twenty four And the ten hearing it were much displeased with the two brothers twenty five But Jesus having called them to him said Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that are great exercise authority over them twenty six Not so shall it be among you twenty seven but whoever would become great among you let him be your minister and whoever would be first among you let him be your servant twenty eight even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many twenty nine And as they were going forth from Jericho a great multitude followed him thirty And behold two blind men sitting by the way side hearing that Jesus was passing by cried saying Have mercy on us O Lord Son of David thirty one And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace But they cried the more saying Have mercy on us O Lord Son of David thirty two And Jesus stood still and called them and said What will ye that I shall do to you thirty three They say to him Lord that our eyes may be opened thirty four And Jesus moved with compassion touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him XXI AND when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the mount of the Olives Jesus sent forth two disciples two saying to them Go into the village over against you and straightway ye will find an ass tied and a colt with her loose and bring them to me three And if any one say aught to you ye shall say The Lord has need of them and straightway he will send them four Now all this has been done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet saying five Say to the daughter of Zion Behold thy King comes to thee Meek and mounted upon an ass And upon a colt the foal of a beast of burden six And the disciples having gone and done as Jesus commanded them seven brought the ass and the colt and put on them their garments and he sat thereon eight And most of the multitude spread their own garments in the way and others cut down branches from the trees and strewed in the way nine And the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying Hosanna twenty one nine to the Son of David Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord Hosanna in the highest ten And as he entered into Jerusalem all the city was moved saying Who is this eleven And the multitudes said This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee twelve And Jesus entered into the temple of God and cast out all that sold and bought in the temple and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves thirteen And he says to them It is written My house shall be called a house of prayer But ye make it a den of robbers fourteen And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them fifteen But the chief priests and the scribes seeing the wonders that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying Hosanna to the Son of David were much displeased sixteen and said to him Dost thou hear what these say And Jesus says to them Yea did ye never read From the mouth of babes and sucklings thou preparedst praise seventeen And leaving them he went forth out of the city into Bethany and lodged there eighteen And in the morning as he was returning into the city he hungered nineteen And seeing a fig tree by the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only And he says to it Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward forever And immediately the fig tree withered away twenty And the disciples seeing it wondered saying How did the fig tree immediately wither away twenty one And Jesus answering said to them Verily I say to you if ye have faith and do not doubt not only shall ye do what is done to the fig tree but even if ye say to this mountain be thou taken up and cast into the sea it shall be done twenty two And all things whatever ye ask in prayer believing ye shall receive twenty three And when he had come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said By what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority twenty four And Jesus answering said to them I also will ask you one thing which if ye tell me I too will tell you by what authority I do these things twenty five John s immersion whence was it From heaven or from men And they reasoned among themselves saying If we say From heaven he will say to us Why then did ye not believe him twenty six But if we say From men we fear the multitude for all hold John as a prophet twenty seven And they answered Jesus saying We do not know And he said to them Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these things twenty eight But what think ye A man had two sons and he came to the first and said Son go work to day in the vineyard twenty nine And he answering said I will not but afterward he repented and went thirty And he came to the other twenty one thirty and said likewise And he answering said I will sir and went not thirty one Which of the two did the father s will They say to him The first twenty one thirty one Jesus says to them Verily I say to you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you thirty two For John came to you in the way of righteousness and ye did not believe him but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that ye might believe him thirty three Hear another parable There was a householder who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husband men and went abroad thirty four And when the season of fruits drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen to receive his fruits thirty five And the husbandmen taking his servants beat one and killed another and stoned another thirty six Again he sent other servants more than the first and they did to them likewise thirty seven And afterward he sent to them his son saying They will reverence my son thirty eight But the husbandmen seeing the son said among themselves This is the heir come let us kill him and have his inheritance thirty nine And taking him they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him forty When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes what will he do to those husbandmen forty one They say to him He will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out the vineyard to other husbandmen who will deliver over to him the fruits in their seasons forty two Jesus says to them Did ye never read in the Scriptures The stone which the builders disallowed The same is become the head of the corner This is from the Lord And is wonderful in our eyes forty three Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof forty four And he that falls upon this stone will be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder forty five And the chief priests and Pharisees hearing his parables knew that he spoke of them forty six And they sought to lay hold of him but feared the multitudes since they held him as a prophet XXII AND Jesus answering spoke to them again in parables saying two The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king who made a marriage for his son three And he sent forth his servants to call those who were bidden to the wedding and they would not come four Again he sent forth other servants saying Tell those who are bidden Behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come to the marriage five But they made light of it and went away one to his farm another to his merchandise six And the rest laid hold of his servants and ill treated and slew them seven And the king hearing it was angry and sending forth his armies he destroyed those murderers and burned up their city eight Then he says to his servants The wedding is ready but they who were bidden were not worthy nine Go therefore into the thoroughfares and as many as ye find bid to the marriage ten And those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests eleven And the king coming in to view the guests saw there a man not clothed with a wedding garment twelve and he says to him Friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment And he was speechless thirteen Then the king said to the attendants Bind him hand and foot and cast him forth into the outer darkness There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth fourteen For many are called but few are chosen fifteen Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare him with a word twenty two fifteen sixteen And they send out to him their disciples with the Herodians saying Teacher we know that thou art true and teachest the way of God in truth neither carest thou for any one for thou regardest not the person of men seventeen Tell us therefore what thinkest thou Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not eighteen But Jesus knowing their wickedness said Why tempt ye me hypocrites nineteen Show me the tribute money And they brought to him a denary twenty two nineteen twenty And he says to them Whose is this image and the inscription twenty one They say to him Caesar s Then says he to them Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar s and to God the things that are God s twenty two And hearing it they wondered and left him and went away twenty three On that day came to him Sadducees who say that there is no resurrection and asked him twenty four saying Teacher Moses said If any one die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother twenty five Now there were with us seven brothers and the first married and died and having no seed left his wife to his brother twenty six Likewise the second also and the third unto the seventh twenty seven And last of all the woman died also twenty eight In the resurrection therefore of which of the seven shall she be wife For they all had her twenty nine Jesus answering said to them Ye err not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God thirty For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven thirty one But concerning the resurrection of the dead have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God saying thirty two I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob God is not the God of the dead but of the living thirty three And the multitudes hearing it were astonished at his teaching thirty four And the Pharisees hearing that he had put the Sadducees to silence collected together thirty five and one of them a lawyer asked tempting him and saying thirty six Teacher what commandment is great in the law thirty seven Jesus said to him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind thirty eight This is the great and first commandment thirty nine And the second is like to it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self forty On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets forty one While the Pharisees were collected together Jesus asked them forty two saying What think ye concerning the Christ Of whom is he the son They say to him Of David forty three He says to them How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord saying forty four The Lord said to my Lord Sit on my right hand Till I put thine enemies under thy feet forty five If then David calls him Lord how is he his son forty six And no one was able to answer him a word nor durst any one from that day question him any more XXIII THEN Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples two saying The scribes and the Pharisees sat down in Moses seat three All therefore whatever they bid you do and observe but do not according to their works for they say and do not four For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on men s shoulders but will not move them with their finger five But all their works they do to be seen by men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the fringes six and love the first place at feasts and the first seats in the synagogues seven and the greetings in the markets and to be called by men Rabbi Rabbi twenty three seven eight But be not ye called Rabbi for one is your Teacher and all ye are brethren nine And call not any your father on the earth for one is your Father he who is in heaven ten Neither be called leaders for one is your leader the Christ eleven But the greatest of you shall be your servant twelve And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted thirteen But woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye go not in nor suffer those who are entering to go in twenty three thirteen fifteen Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because ye traverse sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more a child of hell than yourselves sixteen Woe to you blind guides who say Whoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is bound seventeen Fools and blind for which is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold eighteen And Whoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it he is bound nineteen Fools and blind for which is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift twenty He therefore who swears by the altar swears by it and by all things thereon twenty one And he that swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells therein twenty two And he that swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits thereon twenty three Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because ye pay tithe of the mint and the dill and the cumin and omitted the weightier things of the law judgment and mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not leave those undone twenty four Blind guides that strain out the gnat and swallow the camel twenty five Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because ye cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter but within they are full of rapacity and excess twenty six Blind Pharisee Cleanse first the inside of the cup and the platter that its outside also may become clean twenty seven Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because ye are like to whited sepulchres which outwardly indeed appear beautiful but within are full of bones of the dead and of all uncleanness twenty eight So also ye outwardly indeed appear righteous to men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity twenty nine Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the righteous and say thirty If we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets thirty one So that ye witness to yourselves that ye are sons of those who killed the prophets thirty two and fill ye up the measure of your fathers thirty three Serpents Brood of vipers How can ye escape the judgment of hell thirty four Therefore behold I send forth to you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them ye will kill and crucify and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city thirty five that on you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah whom ye slew between the temple and the altar thirty six Verily I say to you all these things shall come upon this generation thirty seven Jerusalem Jerusalem that killest the prophets and stonest those sent to her how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings and ye would not thirty eight Behold your house is left to you desolate thirty nine For I say to you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord XXIV AND Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple two And he answering said to them See ye not all these things Verily I say to you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down three And as he sat on the mount of the Olives the disciples came to him privately saying Tell us when will these things be and what is the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world four And Jesus answering said to them Take heed lest any one lead you astray five For many will come in my name saying I am the Christ and will lead astray many six And ye will hear of wars and rumors of wars Take heed be not troubled for all must come to pass twenty four six but not yet is the end seven For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places eight But all these are the beginning of sorrows nine Then will they deliver you up unto affliction and will kill you and ye will be hated by all nations for my name s sake ten And then will many be offended and will deliver up one another and will hate one another eleven And many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray twelve And because iniquity abounds the love of the many will become cold thirteen But he that has endured to the end the same shall be saved fourteen And this good news of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a testimony to all nations and then shall come the end fifteen When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation spoken of through Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place let him that reads mark sixteen then let those in Judaea flee to the mountains he that is upon the house seventeen let him not come down to take the things out of his house eighteen and he that is in the field let him not turn back to take his garments nineteen But woe to those who are with child and to those who give suck in those days twenty And pray that your flight be not in winter nor on a sabbath twenty one For then will be great affliction such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now no nor shall be twenty two And unless those days were shortened no flesh would be saved but for the sake of the chosen those days shall be shortened twenty three Then if any one say to you Lo here is the Christ or Here believe it not twenty four For there will arise false Christs and false prophets and will show great signs and wonders so as if possible to lead even the chosen astray twenty five Behold I have told you before twenty six If therefore they say to you Behold he is in the desert go not forth Behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not twenty seven For as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines even unto the west so shall be the coming of the Son of man twenty eight For wherever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together twenty nine And immediately after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of heaven shall be shaken thirty And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth twenty four thirty mourn and shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory thirty one And he will send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his chosen from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other thirty two And learn the parable from the fig tree When its branch is already become tender and puts forth leaves ye know that the summer is near thirty three So also ye when ye see all these things know that it is near at the doors thirty four Verily I say to you this generation shall not pass till all these things are done thirty five Heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away thirty six But of that day and hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven but my Father only thirty seven But as the days of Noah so shall be also the coming of the Son of man thirty eight For as they were in the days before the flood eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark thirty nine and knew not until the flood came and took all away so shall be also the coming of the Son of man forty Then shall there be two men in the field one is taken and one is left forty one two women grinding at the mill one is taken and one is left forty two Watch therefore for ye know not in what day twenty four forty two your Lord comes forty three But know this that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken through forty four Therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man comes forty five Who then is the faithful and wise servant whom his lord set over his household to give them their food in due season forty six Happy that servant whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing forty seven Verily I say to you that he will set him over all his goods forty eight But if that evil servant shall say in his heart My lord delays his coming forty nine and shall begin to beat his fellow servants and shall eat and drink with the drunken fifty the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looks not for it and in an hour when he is not aware fifty one and will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth XXV THEN shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom two And five of them were wise and five foolish three The foolish taking their lamps took no oil with them four but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps five While the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept six And at midnight a cry was made Behold the bridegroom Go out to meet him seven Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps eight And the foolish said to the wise Give us of your oil for our lamps are going out nine But the wise answered saying Not so there will not be enough for us and you Go rather to those who sell and buy for yourselves ten And while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they who were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut eleven And afterward come also the rest of the virgins saying Lord Lord open to us twelve But he answering said Verily I say to you I know you not thirteen Watch therefore because ye know not the day nor the hour fourteen For as a man going abroad called his own servants and delivered to them his goods fifteen and to one gave five talents to another two and to another one to each according to his own ability and straightway went abroad sixteen And he that received the five talents went and traded with them and gained other five talents seventeen Likewise also he that received the two gained other two eighteen But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth and hid his lord s money nineteen After a long time the lord of those servants comes and reckons with them twenty And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents saying Lord thou deliveredst to me five talents behold I gained other five talents beside them twenty one His lord said to him Well done good and faithful servant thou wast faithful over a little I will set thee over much Enter thou into the joy of thy lord twenty two And he also that received the two talents came and said Lord thou deliveredst to me two talents behold I gained other two talents beside them twenty three His lord said to him Well done good and faithful servant thou wast faithful over a little I will set thee over much Enter thou into the joy of thy lord twenty four And he also that received the one talent came and said Lord I knew thee that thou art a hard man reaping where thou didst not sow and gathering where thou strewedst not twenty five And fearing I went and hid thy talent in the earth Lo thou hast thine own twenty six And his lord answering said to him Wicked and slothful servant Thou knewest that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I strewed not twenty seven Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and when I came I should have received my own with interest twenty eight Take therefore the talent from him and give to him that has the ten talents twenty nine For to every one that has shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that has not even what he has shall be taken away thirty And cast forth the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth thirty one And when the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the angels with him then will he sit on his throne of glory thirty two And before him shall be gathered all the nations and he will divide them one from another as the shepherd divides the sheep from the goats thirty three And he will set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left thirty four Then will the King say to those on his right hand Come blessed of my Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world thirty five For I was hungry and ye gave me to eat I was thirsty and ye gave me drink I was a stranger and ye took me in thirty six naked and ye clothed me I was sick and ye visited me I was in prison and ye came to me thirty seven Then will the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee hungering and fed thee or thirsting and gave thee drink thirty eight And when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee thirty nine And when saw we thee sick or in prison and came to thee forty And the King will answer and say to them Verily I say to you inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of these my brethren ye did it to me forty one Then will he say also to those on the left hand Depart from me accursed into the everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels forty two For I was hungry and ye did not give me to eat I was thirsty and ye did not give me drink forty three I was a stranger and ye did not take me in naked and ye did not clothe me sick and in prison and ye did not visit me forty four Then will they also answer saying Lord when saw we thee hungering or thirsting or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to thee forty five Then will he answer them saying Verily I say to you inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me forty six And these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into everlasting life XXVI AND it came to pass when Jesus finished all these sayings he said to his disciples two Ye know that after two days comes the passover and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified three Then assembled together the chief priests and the elders of the people in the court of the high priest who was called Caiaphas four and consulted together that they might take Jesus by craft and put him to death five But they said Not at the feast that there may not be a tumult among the people six And Jesus being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper seven there came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he reclined at table eight And his disciples seeing it were displeased saying To what purpose is this waste nine For this might have been sold for much and given to the poor ten And Jesus knowing it said to them Why trouble ye the woman For she wrought a good work upon me eleven For the poor ye have always with you but me ye have not always twelve For she in pouring this ointment on my body did it to prepare me for burial thirteen Verily I say to you wherever this good news shall be preached in the whole world this also that she did shall be told for a memorial of her fourteen Then one of the twelve called Judas Iscariot went to the chief priests fifteen and said What will ye give me and I will deliver him to you And they weighed out to him thirty pieces of silver sixteen And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him up seventeen And on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus saying to him Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover eighteen And he said Go into the city to such a man and say to him The Teacher says my time is at hand I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples nineteen And the disciples did as Jesus directed them and made ready the passover twenty And when evening was come he reclined at table with the twelve twenty one And as they were eating he said Verily I say to you that one of you will betray me twenty two And they were exceedingly sorrowful and began to say to him each one Lord is it I twenty three And he answering said He that dipped his hand with me in the dish the same will betray me twenty four The Son of man goes indeed as it is written of him but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed It were good for him if that man had not been born twenty five And Judas his betrayer answering said Rabbi is it I He says to him Thou saidst it twenty six And as they were eating Jesus took the loaf twenty six twenty six and blessed and broke and gave to the disciples and said Take eat this is my body twenty seven And he took the cup and gave thanks and gave to them saying Drink all ye of it twenty eight For this is my blood of the new covenant twenty six twenty eight which is shed for many for remission of sins twenty nine And I say to you that I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father thirty And having sung they went out into the mount of the Olives thirty one Then Jesus says to them All ye will be offended because of me this night For it is written I will smite the Shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad thirty two But after I have risen I will go before you into Galilee thirty three Peter answering said to him Though all shall be offended because of thee I will never be offended thirty four Jesus said to him Verily I say to thee that this night before a cock crows thou wilt thrice deny me thirty five Peter says to him Even though I should die with thee I will not deny thee Likewise also said all the disciples thirty six Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane and says to the disciples Sit ye here while I go yonder and pray thirty seven And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee he began to be sorrowful and to be troubled thirty eight Then says he to them My soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death Tarry ye here and watch with me thirty nine And going forward a little he fell on his face praying and saying My Father if it is possible let this cup pass away from me But yet not as I will but as thou wilt forty And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping and he says to Peter Were ye so unable to watch with me one hour forty one Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak forty two Again a second time he went away and prayed saying My Father if this can not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done forty three And coming he again found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy forty four And leaving them he went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words forty five Then he comes to his disciples and says to them Do ye sleep the remaining time and take your rest twenty six forty five Behold the hour is at hand and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners forty six Rise let us be going Behold he is at hand that betrays me forty seven And while he was yet speaking behold Judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people forty eight And his betrayer gave them a sign saying Whom I shall kiss that is he hold him fast forty nine And forthwith he came to Jesus and said Hail Rabbi and kissed him fifty And Jesus said to him Friend wherefore art thou come Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and held him fast fifty one And behold one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and striking the servant of the high priest took off his ear fifty two Then says Jesus to him Put back thy sword into its place for all they who take the sword shall perish with the sword fifty three Thinkest thou that I can not now pray to my Father and he will send twenty six fifty three me more than twelve legions of angels fifty four How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be fifty five In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to take me I sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye did not lay hold of me fifty six But all this has been done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled Then the disciples all forsook him and fled fifty seven And they who laid hold of Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled fifty eight And Peter followed him afar off unto the court of the high priest and entering in he sat with the servants to see the end fifty nine And the chief priests and the elders and all the council sought false witness against Jesus that they might put him to death sixty and found none though many false witnesses came But at last came two sixty one and said This man said I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days sixty two And the high priest arose and said to him Answerest thou nothing What do these witness against thee sixty three But Jesus was silent And the high priest answering said to him I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ the Son of God sixty four Jesus says to him Thou saidst it But I say to you hereafter ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven sixty five Then the high priest rent his clothes saying He blasphemed What further need have we of witnesses Behold ye now heard his blasphemy sixty six What think ye They answering said He is guilty of death sixty seven Then they spit in his face and buffeted him and others smote him sixty eight saying Prophesy to us O Christ who is he that struck thee sixty nine And Peter was sitting without in the court And a damsel came to him saying Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean seventy But he denied before all saying I know not what thou sayest seventy one And he having gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said to those who were there This man also was with Jesus the Nazarene seventy two And again he denied with an oath I do not know the man seventy three And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter Surely thou also art one of them for thy speech betrays thee seventy four Then he began to invoke curses and to swear I do not know the man And immediately a cock crowed seventy five And Peter remembered the word of Jesus when he said Before a cock crows thou wilt thrice deny me And he went out and wept bitterly XXVII AND when morning came all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus so as to put him to death two And having bound him they led him away and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate the governor three Then Judas who betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repenting brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders four saying I sinned in betraying innocent blood And they said What is it to us Look thou to it five And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple he departed and he went away and hanged himself six And the chief priests took the silver pieces and said It is not lawful to put them into the treasury since it is the price of blood seven And they took counsel and bought with them the potter s field to bury strangers in eight Wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day nine Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet saying And they took the thirty pieces of silver The price of him that was priced Whom they of the sons of Israel did price ten And gave them for the potter s field as the Lord appointed to me eleven And Jesus stood before the governor And the governor questioned him saying Art thou the king of the Jews And Jesus said to him Thou sayest it twelve And when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders he made no answer thirteen Then says Pilate to him Hearest thou not what things they witness against thee fourteen And he made him no answer not even to one word so that the governor greatly wondered fifteen Now at the feast the governor was wont to release to the multitude one prisoner whom they would sixteen And they had then a noted prisoner called Barabbas seventeen When therefore they were assembled Pilate said to them Whom will ye that I release to you Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ eighteen For he knew that through envy they delivered him up nineteen And as he sat on the judgment seat his wife sent to him saying Have nothing to do with that just man for I suffered much this day in a dream because of him twenty And the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and should destroy Jesus twenty one And the governor answering said to them Which of the two will ye that I release to you And they said Barabbas twenty two Pilate says to them What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ They all say to him Let him be crucified twenty three And the governor said What evil then did he But they cried the more saying Let him be crucified twenty four And Pilate seeing that it avails nothing but rather that a tumult is made took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just man Look ye to it twenty five And all the people answering said His blood be on us and on our children twenty six Then he released to them Barabbas but Jesus having scourged him he delivered up to be crucified twenty seven Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Pretorium and gathered to him the whole band twenty eight And they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe twenty nine And having platted a crown of thorns they put it on his head and a reed in his right hand and bowing the knee before him they mocked him saying Hail King of the Jews thirty And they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head thirty one And when they had mocked him they took off the robe from him and put on him his own garments and led him away to crucify him thirty two And as they came out they found a man of Cyrene Simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross thirty three And having come to a place called Golgotha which is called Place of a skull thirty four they gave him vinegar to drink twenty seven thirty four mingled with gall and tasting it he would not drink thirty five And having crucified him they divided his garments among them casting lots thirty six And sitting down they watched him there thirty seven And they set up over his head his accusation written THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS thirty eight Two robbers are then crucified with him one on the right hand and one on the left thirty nine And those passing by reviled him wagging their heads forty and saying Thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself If thou art the Son of God come down from the cross forty one Likewise also the chief priests mocking with the scribes and elders said forty two Others he saved himself he can not save If he is King of Israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe on him forty three He trusts in God let him now deliver him if he desires him for he said I am the Son of God forty four And also the robbers who were crucified with him reproached him with the same thing forty five And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour forty six And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli lema sabachthani That is My God my God why didst thou forsake me forty seven Some of those standing there hearing it said This man calls for Elijah twenty seven forty seven forty eight And straightway one of them ran and took a sponge and having filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed gave him to drink forty nine But the rest said Let alone let us see whether Elijah comes to save him fifty And Jesus again crying with a loud voice yielded up his spirit fifty one And behold the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth quaked and the rocks were rent fifty two and the tombs were opened and many bodies of the saints who have fallen asleep arose fifty three and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection went into the holy city and appeared to many fifty four And the centurion and they that with him were watching Jesus on seeing the earthquake and the things that were done were exceedingly afraid saying Truly this was the Son of God fifty five And many women were there beholding afar off they who followed Jesus from Galilee ministering to him fifty six among whom was Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joses and the mother of the sons of Zebedee fifty seven And evening having come there came a rich man from Arimathaea named Joseph who also himself was a disciple of Jesus fifty eight This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus Then Pilate commanded that the body should be given up fifty nine And taking the body Joseph wrapped it in a clean linen cloth sixty and laid it in his own new tomb which he hewed out in the rock And having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb he departed sixty one And Mary the Magdalene was there and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre sixty two And on the morrow which is after the preparation the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate sixty three saying Sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive After three days I will rise sixty four Command therefore that the sepulchre be made secure until the third day lest his disciples come and steal him away and say to the people He is risen from the dead and the last error will be worse than the first sixty five Pilate said to them Ye have a watch go make secure as ye know how sixty six And they went and made the sepulchre secure sealing the stone in connection with the watch XXVIII AND late in the sabbath as it was dawning into the first day of the week came Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary to view the sepulchre two And behold there was a great earthquake For an angel of the Lord descending out of heaven came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it three His countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow four and for fear of him the keepers shook and became as dead men five And the angel answering said to the women Fear not ye for I know that ye are seeking Jesus who was crucified six He is not here for he is risen as he said Come hither see the place where the Lord lay seven And go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead And behold he goes before you into Galilee there ye shall see him Behold I told you eight And going out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy they ran to bring his disciples word nine And behold Jesus met them saying All hail And they coming to him laid hold of his feet and worshiped him ten Then Jesus says to them Be not afraid go bear word to my brethren to go away into Galilee and there they shall see me eleven And as they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that were done twelve And having assembled with the elders and taken counsel they gave much money to the soldiers thirteen saying Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept fourteen And if this shall be heard by the governor twenty eight fourteen we will persuade him and make you secure fifteen And they taking the money did as they were taught And this saying was reported abroad among the Jews until this day sixteen And the eleven disciples went away into Galilee into the mountain where Jesus had appointed them seventeen And seeing him they worshiped him but some doubted eighteen And Jesus came and spoke to them saying All power was given to me in heaven and on earth nineteen Go therefore and disciple all the nations immersing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit twenty teaching them to observe all things whatever I commanded you And behold I am with you alway unto the end of the world THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MARK I THE beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ Son of God two as it is written in Isaiah the prophet Behold I send forth my messenger before thy face who shall prepare thy way three the voice of one crying in the wilderness Prepare the way of the Lord make straight his paths four John came immersing in the wilderness and preaching the immersion of repentance unto remission of sins five And there went out to him all the country of Judaea and all they of Jerusalem and they were immersed by him in the river Jordan confessing their sins six And John was clothed with camel s hair and with a leathern girdle about his loins and ate locusts and wild honey seven And he preached saying There comes after me he that is mightier than I the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loose eight I indeed immersed you in water but he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit nine And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was immersed by John in the Jordan ten And straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens parted and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him eleven And there came a voice out of heaven Thou art my beloved son in thee I am well pleased twelve And immediately the Spirit drives him forth into the wilderness thirteen And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan and was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered to him fourteen And after John was delivered up Jesus came into Galilee publishing the good news of the kingdom of God one fourteen fifteen and saying The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand repent and believe in the good news sixteen And walking by the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew Simon s brother casting a net in the sea for they were fishermen seventeen And Jesus said to them Come after me and I will cause you to become fishers of men eighteen And immediately leaving the nets they followed him nineteen And going a little further he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother who also were in the ship mending the nets twenty And straightway he called them and leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants they went after him twenty one And they enter into Capernaum and straightway on the sabbath he went into the synagogue and taught twenty two And they were astonished at his teaching for he taught them as having authority and not as the scribes twenty three And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit And he cried out twenty four saying What have we to do with thee one twenty four Jesus Nazarene Didst thou come to destroy us I know thee who thou art the Holy One of God twenty five And Jesus rebuked him saying Hold thy peace and come out of him twenty six And the unclean spirit tearing him and crying with a loud voice came out of him twenty seven And they were all amazed so that they questioned among themselves saying What is this one twenty seven A new teaching with authority And he commands the unclean spirits and they obey him twenty eight And immediately his fame spread abroad into all the surrounding region of Galilee twenty nine And immediately having come out of the synagogue they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John thirty And the mother in law of Simon was lying sick with fever and immediately they tell him concerning her thirty one And he came and raised her up taking hold of her hand and immediately the fever left her and she ministered to them thirty two And evening having come when the sun set they brought to him all that were sick and those possessed with demons thirty three And all the city was gathered together at the door thirty four And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases and cast out many demons and suffered not the demons to speak because they knew him thirty five And rising very early by night he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed thirty six And Simon and they who were with him followed after him thirty seven And having found him they say to him All are seeking thee thirty eight And he says to them Let us go elsewhere into the neighboring towns that I may preach there also for for this I came forth thirty nine And he was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee and casting out the demons forty And there came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying to him If thou wilt thou canst cleanse me forty one And Jesus moved with compassion stretched forth his hand and touched him and says to him I will be thou cleansed forty two And immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed forty three And sternly charging him he forthwith sent him away forty four and says to him See thou say nothing to any one but go show thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing what Moses commanded for a testimony to them forty five But he going forth began to publish it much and to spread abroad the report so that he could no longer openly enter into a city but was without in desert places And they came to him from every quarter II AND again he entered into Capernaum after some days and it was heard that he is in the house two And straightway many were gathered together so that there was no longer room not even at the door and he spoke the word to them three And they come to him bringing one that was palsied borne by four four And not being able to come near him on account of the multitude they uncovered the roof where he was and having broken it up they let down the bed whereon the palsied man lay five And Jesus seeing their faith says to the palsied man Child thy sins are forgiven six But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts seven Why does this man speak thus He blasphemes Who can forgive sins but one God eight And Jesus immediately perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves said to them Why reason ye these things in your hearts nine Which is easier to say to the palsied man Thy sins are forgiven or to say Arise and take up thy bed and walk ten But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins he says to the palsied man eleven I say to thee arise take up thy bed and go to thy house twelve And he arose and immediately taking up the bed went forth before all so that all were amazed and glorified God saying We never saw it thus thirteen And he went forth again by the sea side and all the multitude came to him and he taught them fourteen And passing along he saw Levi the son of Alpheus sitting at the place of receiving custom and said to him Follow me And rising up he followed him fifteen And it came to pass as he reclined at table in his house that many publicans and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him sixteen And the scribes and the Pharisees seeing him eating with the sinners and publicans said to his disciples How is it that he eats and drinks with the sinners and the publicans seventeen And Jesus hearing it says to them They who are well need not a physician but they who are sick I came not to call righteous men but sinners eighteen And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting two eighteen and they come and say to him Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not nineteen And Jesus said to them Can the sons of the bridechamber fast two nineteen while the bridegroom is with them So long as they have the bridegroom with them they can not fast twenty But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them and then they will fast in that day twenty one No one sews a piece of unfulled cloth upon an old garment else the new filling up of the old takes from it and a worse rent is made twenty two And no one puts new wine into old skins else the wine bursts the skins and the wine is destroyed and the skins two twenty two twenty three And it came to pass that he went through the grain fields on the sabbath and his disciples began to go forward two twenty three plucking the ears of grain twenty four And the Pharisees said to him Behold why do they on the sabbath that which is not lawful twenty five And he said to them Did ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered himself and they who were with him twenty six how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest and ate the show bread which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests and gave also to those who were with him twenty seven And he said to them The sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath twenty eight So that the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath III AND he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there having his hand withered two And they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbath that they might accuse him three And he says to the man having the withered hand Arise and come into the midst four And he says to them Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath or to do evil to save life or to kill But they were silent five And looking round on them with anger being grieved for their hardness of heart he says to the man Stretch forth thy hand And he stretched it forth and his hand was restored six And going out the Pharisees immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him how they might destroy him seven And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea And a great multitude from Galilee followed and from Judaea eight and from Jerusalem and from Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and they about Tyre and Sidon a great multitude hearing what great things he did came to him nine And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude that they might not throng him ten For he healed many so that they pressed upon him to touch him as many as had plagues eleven And the unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried saying Thou art the Son of God twelve And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known thirteen And he goes up into the mountain and calls to him whom he would and they went to him fourteen And he appointed twelve that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach fifteen and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons sixteen And Simon he surnamed Peter seventeen and James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James and he surnamed them Boanerges which is Sons of thunder eighteen and Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew and Matthew and Thomas and James the son of Alpheus and Thaddeus and Simon the Cananite three eighteen nineteen and Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him And they come into the house twenty And the multitude comes together again so that they could not even eat bread twenty one And hearing of it his kinsmen went out to lay hold of him for they said He is beside himself twenty two And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said He has Beelzebul and through the prince of the demons he casts out the demons twenty three And calling them to him he said to them in parables How can Satan cast out Satan twenty four And if a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom can not stand twenty five And if a house be divided against itself that house can not stand twenty six And if Satan rose up against himself and is divided he can not stand but has an end twenty seven No one can enter into a strong man s house and plunder his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will plunder his house twenty eight Verily I say to you all sins will be forgiven the sons of men and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme twenty nine But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness forever but is guilty of eternal sin thirty because they said He has an unclean spirit thirty one And his brothers and his mother come and standing without they sent to him calling him thirty two And a crowd was sitting about him and they say to him Behold thy mother and thy brothers without are seeking thee thirty three And he answered them saying Who is my mother or my brothers thirty four And looking round on those who sat about him he said Behold my mother and my brothers thirty five For whoever shall do the will of God he is my brother and sister and mother IV AND he began again to teach by the sea side And there was gathered to him a very great multitude so that he entered into a ship and sat down in the sea and all the multitude was by the sea on the land two And he taught them many things in parables and said to them in his teaching three Hearken behold the sower went forth to sow four And it came to pass as he sowed one fell by the way side and the birds came and devoured it five And another fell on the rocky ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up because it had not depth of earth six But when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had not root it withered away seven And another fell among the thorns and the thorns came up and choked it and it yielded no fruit eight And another fell into the good ground and yielded fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth thirty and sixty and a hundredfold nine And he said He that has ears to hear let him hear ten And when he was alone they who were about him with the twelve asked him concerning the parables eleven And he said to them To you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God but to those who are without all things are done in parables twelve that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest haply they should turn and be forgiven thirteen And he says to them Know ye not this parable And how will ye know all the parables fourteen The sower sows the word fifteen And these are they by the way side where the word is sown and when they hear Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in them sixteen And these are they likewise that are sown on the rocky places who when they hear the word immediately receive it with gladness seventeen and have no root in themselves but are only for a time Afterward when affliction or persecution arises because of the word immediately they are offended eighteen And others are they that are sown among the thorns These are they that hear the word nineteen and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becomes unfruitful twenty And these are they that are sown on the good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit in thirty and in sixty and in a hundredfold twenty one And he said to them Is the lamp brought that it may be put under the bushel or under the bed Is it not that it may be put on the lamp stand twenty two For nothing is hidden but it shall be manifested nor was done in secret but that it should come abroad twenty three If any one has ears to hear let him hear twenty four And he said to them Take heed what ye hear With what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you and there shall be added to you twenty five For he that has to him shall be given and he that has not even what he has shall be taken from him twenty six And he said So is the kingdom of God as when a man has cast the seed upon the earth twenty seven and sleeps and rises night and day and the seed sprouts and grows up he knows not how twenty eight For the earth brings forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear then the full grain in the ear twenty nine But when the fruit permits immediately he puts forth the sickle because the harvest is come thirty And he said How shall we liken the kingdom of God or in what comparison shall we set it forth thirty one As a grain of mustard which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that are in the earth thirty two And when it is sown it grows up and becomes greater than all the herbs and shoots out great branches so that the birds of the air can lodge under its shadow thirty three And with many such parables he spoke the word to them as they were able to hear thirty four But without a parable he spoke not to them and in private he explained all things to his disciples thirty five And on that day when evening was come he says to them Let us pass over to the other side thirty six And dismissing the multitude they take him as he was in the ship And there were also other ships with him thirty seven And there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that the ship was already becoming filled thirty eight And he was in the stern on the cushion sleeping And they awake him and say to him Teacher carest thou not that we perish thirty nine And awaking he rebuked the wind and said to the sea Peace be still And the wind ceased and there was a great calm forty And he said to them Why are ye so fearful How is it that ye have no faith forty one And they feared exceedingly and said one to another Who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him V AND they came to the other side of the sea into the country of the Gerasenes two And when he had come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit three who had his dwelling in the tombs and no one could any longer bind him not even with chains four Because he had often been bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been torn asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces and no one could tame him five And always night and day he was in the tombs and in the mountains crying out and cutting himself with stones six But seeing Jesus afar off he ran and bowed down to him seven and cried with a loud voice and said What have I to do with thee Jesus Son of the most high God I adjure thee by God do not torment me eight For he said to him Come forth unclean spirit out of the man nine And he asked him What is thy name And he says to him My name is Legion because we are many ten And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country eleven And there was there by the mountain a great herd of swine feeding twelve And all the demons besought him saying Send us into the swine that we may enter into them thirteen And immediately Jesus gave them leave And coming out the unclean spirits entered into the swine And the herd rushed down the steep into the sea about two thousand and were choked in the sea fourteen And they who fed them fled and reported it in the city and in the country And they came to see what it was that was done fifteen And they come to Jesus and see him who was possessed with demons sitting clothed and in his right mind him who had the legion and they were afraid sixteen And they who saw it related to them how it befell him who was possessed with demons and concerning the swine seventeen And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders eighteen And as he was entering into the ship he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him nineteen And he suffered him not but says to him Go into thy house to thy friends and announce to them how great things the Lord has done for thee and had compassion on thee twenty And he departed and began to publish in the Decapolis how great things Jesus did for him and all wondered twenty one And Jesus having passed over again in the ship to the other side a great multitude was gathered to him and he was by the sea twenty two And there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name And seeing him he fell at his feet twenty three and besought him much saying My little daughter lies at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and live twenty four And he went with him and a great multitude was following him and thronging him twenty five And a certain woman who had a flow of blood twelve years twenty six and had suffered much by many physicians and spent all that she had and was not at all benefited but rather grew worse twenty seven hearing of Jesus came in the crowd behind and touched his garment twenty eight For she said If I touch even his garments I shall be made whole twenty nine And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she perceived in her body that she was healed of that plague thirty And immediately Jesus perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him turned about in the crowd and said Who touched my garments thirty one And his disciples said to him Thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou Who touched me thirty two And he looked around to see her who had done this thirty three But the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done to her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth thirty four And he said to her Daughter thy faith has made thee whole go in peace and be healed of thy plague thirty five While he was yet speaking they come from the ruler of the synagogue s house saying Thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the Teacher any further thirty six And Jesus overhearing the word that was spoken says to the ruler of the synagogue Be not afraid only believe thirty seven And he suffered no one to follow with him save Peter and James and John the brother of James thirty eight And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and he sees a tumult and those who wept and wailed greatly thirty nine And entering in he says to them Why do ye make a tumult and weep The child is not dead but is sleeping forty And they laughed him to scorn But he putting them all out takes the father of the child and the mother and those who were with him and enters in where the child was forty one And taking the hand of the child he says to her Talitha kumi which is interpreted Damsel I say to thee arise forty two And straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was of the age of twelve years And they were astonished with a great astonishment forty three And he charged them strictly that no one should know this And he commanded that something should be given her to eat VI AND he went out from thence and came into his own country and his disciples follow him two And when the sabbath was come he began to teach in the synagogue And many hearing were astonished saying From whence has this man these things And what is the wisdom which is given him and such miracles wrought by his hands three Is not this the carpenter the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon And are not his sisters here with us And they were offended at him four And Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and among his own kindred and in his own house five And he was not able to do any miracle there save that he laid his hands on a few sick and healed them six And he marveled because of their unbelief And he went about the surrounding villages teaching seven And he called to him the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them authority over the unclean spirits eight and commanded them that they should take nothing for the way save a staff only no bread no bag no money in their girdle nine but that they be shod with sandals and Put not on two coats ten And he said to them Wherever ye enter into a house there abide till ye depart from thence eleven And whatever place shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony to them six eleven twelve And they went out and preached that men should repent thirteen And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them fourteen And the king Herod heard of it for his name was spread abroad and he said John the Immerser is risen from the dead and therefore do these powers work in him fifteen Others said It is Elijah And others said It is a prophet like any one of the prophets sixteen But Herod hearing of it said John whom I beheaded is risen from the dead seventeen For he Herod sent forth and laid hold of John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother because he had married her eighteen For John said to Herod It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother s wife nineteen And Herodias was angry with him and desired to put him to death and she could not twenty for Herod feared John knowing that he was a just and holy man and he observed him six twenty and hearing him did many things and heard him gladly twenty one And a convenient day having come when Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles and for the chief captains and the first men of Galilee twenty two and the daughter of Herodias having come in and danced it pleased Herod and those reclining at table with him and the king said to the damsel Ask of me whatever thou wilt and I will give it thee twenty three And he swore to her Whatever thou shalt ask of me I will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom twenty four And she going out said to her mother What shall I ask And she said The head of John the Immerser twenty five And straightway she came in with haste to the king and asked saying I will that immediately thou give me on a platter the head of John the Immerser twenty six And the king became very sorrowful but for the sake of his oath and of those reclining with him he would not reject her twenty seven And immediately the king sent one of the guard and commanded to bring his head And he went and beheaded him in the prison twenty eight and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the damsel and the damsel gave it to her mother twenty nine And his disciples hearing of it came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb thirty And the apostles gather together unto Jesus and they reported to him all things both what they did and what they taught thirty one And he said to them Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest awhile for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure even to eat thirty two And they departed into a desert place by ship privately thirty three And they saw them departing and many knew them and ran together there on foot from all the cities and came before them thirty four And going forth he saw a great multitude and had compassion on them because they were as sheep having no shepherd and he began to teach them many things thirty five And the day being now far spent his disciples come to him and say The place is desert and the time is now far passed thirty six Dismiss them that they may go away into the surrounding fields and villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat thirty seven He answering said to them Give ye them to eat And they say to him Shall we go and buy two hundred denaries worth of bread and give them to eat thirty eight He says to them How many loaves have ye Go and see And when they knew they say Five and two fishes thirty nine And he commanded them to make all lie down by companies on the green grass forty And they lay down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties forty one And taking the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke the loaves and gave to the disciples to set before them and the two fishes he divided among them all forty two And they all ate and were filled forty three And they took up fragments filling twelve baskets and part of the fishes forty four And they who ate of the loaves were five thousand men forty five And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the ship and to go before to the other side to Bethsaida while he dismissed the multitude forty six And having taken leave of them he went away into the mountain to pray forty seven And when evening was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he was alone on the land forty eight And he saw them distressed in rowing for the wind was contrary to them And about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them walking on the sea and would have passed by them forty nine And they seeing him walking on the sea supposed it was a spectre and cried out fifty for all saw him and were troubled And immediately he talked with them and says to them Be of good cheer it is I be not afraid fifty one And he went up to them into the ship and the wind ceased And they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered fifty two For they considered not the loaves for their heart was hardened fifty three And passing over they came to the land of Gennesaret and anchored there fifty four And when they had come out of the ship immediately recognizing him fifty five they ran through all that region and began to carry about on beds those who were sick where they heard he was fifty six And wherever he entered into villages or cities or fields they laid the sick in the marketplaces and besought him that they might touch if it were but the fringe of his garment And as many as touched him were made whole VII AND there come together to him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes who came from Jerusalem two And seeing some of his disciples eating bread with defiled that is unwashen hands they found fault three For the Pharisees and all the Jews except they carefully wash their hands do not eat holding the tradition of the elders four And coming from the market except they immerse themselves they do not eat And there are many other things which they received to hold immersions of cups and pots and brazen vessels and couches five And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with defiled hands six And he said to them Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you hypocrites as it is written This people honor me with their lips But their heart is far from me seven But in vain they worship me Teaching as doctrines commandments of men eight For laying aside the commandment of God ye hold the tradition of men immersions of pots and cups and many other such things ye do nine And he said to them Well do ye reject the commandment of God that ye may keep your own tradition ten For Moses said Honor thy father and thy mother and he that curses father or mother let him surely die eleven But ye say If a man say to his father or his mother It is Corban that is a gift whatever thou mightest be profited with from me seven eleven twelve and ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother thirteen annulling the word of God by your tradition which ye handed down And many such things ye do fourteen And again calling to him the multitude he said to them Hearken to me every one and understand fifteen There is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but the things that come out of him these are they that defile the man sixteen If any one has ears to hear let him hear seventeen And when he entered into the house from the multitude his disciples asked him concerning the parable eighteen And he says to them Are ye so without understanding also Do ye not perceive that whatever from without enters into the man can not defile him nineteen Because it enters not into his heart but into the belly and goes out into the drain cleansing all food twenty And he said That which comes out of the man that defiles the man twenty one For from within out of the heart of men come forth evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders twenty two thefts covetousness wickedness deceit wantonness an evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness twenty three All these evil things come forth from within and defile the man twenty four And rising up he departed thence into the borders of Tyre and Sidon and entering into a house he desired that no one should know it And he could not be hidden twenty five For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit hearing of him came and fell at his feet twenty six The woman was a Greek a Syrophenician by nation and she besought him that he would cast out the demon from her daughter twenty seven And he said to her Let the children first be filled for it is not good to take the children s bread and cast it to the dogs twenty eight And she answered and said to him Yea Lord for the dogs under the table eat of the children s crumbs twenty nine And he said to her For this saying go thy way the demon has gone out of thy daughter thirty And departing to her house she found the little child laid on the bed and the demon gone out thirty one And again going forth out of the borders of Tyre he came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee through the midst of the borders of Decapolis thirty two And they bring to him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon him thirty three And taking him aside from the multitude he put his fingers into his ears and spitting touched his tongue thirty four and looking up to heaven he sighed and says to him Ephphatha that is Be opened thirty five And straightway his ears were opened and the bond of his tongue was loosed and he spoke plainly thirty six And he charged them that they should tell no one But the more he charged them the more abundantly they published it thirty seven and were beyond measure astonished saying He has done all things well he makes both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak VIII IN those days there being a very great multitude and they having nothing to eat he called to him his disciples and says to them two I have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat three and if I dismiss them fasting to their own houses they will faint by the way and some of them have come from afar four And his disciples answered him From whence will one be able to satisfy these men with bread here in a wilderness five And he asked them How many loaves have ye And they said Seven six And he commanded the multitude to lie down on the ground And he took the seven loaves and gave thanks and broke and gave to his disciples to set before them and they set them before the multitude seven And they had a few small fishes and having blessed them he commanded to set these also before them eight And they ate and were filled and they took up of the fragments that were left seven baskets nine And they were about four thousand And he dismissed them ten And straightway entering into the ship with his disciples he came into the region of Dalmanutha eleven And the Pharisees came out and began to question with him seeking of him a sign from heaven tempting him twelve And sighing deeply in his spirit he says Why does this generation seek a sign Verily I say to you there shall no sign be given to this generation thirteen And leaving them he entered again into the ship and departed to the other side fourteen And they forgot to take bread and they had none in the ship with them except one loaf fifteen And he charged them saying Take heed beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod sixteen And they reasoned among themselves saying It is because we have no bread seventeen And Jesus knowing it says to them Why reason ye because ye have no bread Do ye not yet perceive nor understand Have ye your heart yet hardened eighteen Having eyes do ye not see And having ears do ye not hear And do ye not remember nineteen When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up They say to him Twelve twenty And when the seven among the four thousand how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up And they said Seven twenty one And he said to them How is it that ye do not understand twenty two And they come to Bethsaida And they bring to him a blind man and beseech him to touch him twenty three And taking the blind man by the hand he led him forth out of the village and spitting in his eyes and putting his hands on him he asked him if he beheld anything twenty four And looking up he said I behold men for I see them as trees walking twenty five Then again he put his hands on his eyes and he saw clearly and he was restored and saw all things distinctly twenty six And he sent him away to his house saying Go not even into the village nor tell it to any in the village twenty seven And Jesus went out and his disciples into the villages of Caesarea Philippi And in the way he asked his disciples saying to them Who do men say that I am twenty eight And they answered him saying John the Immerser and others Elijah and others one of the prophets twenty nine And he asked them But who do ye say that I am And Peter answering says to him Thou art the Christ thirty And he charged them that they should tell no one concerning him thirty one And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again thirty two And he spoke that saying openly And Peter taking him aside began to rebuke him thirty three But he turning about and seeing his disciples rebuked Peter saying Get thee behind me Satan for thou thinkest not the things of God but those of men thirty four And calling to him the multitude with his disciples he said to them Whoever desires to follow after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me thirty five For whoever will save his life shall lose it but whoever shall lose his life for the sake of me and of the glad tidings shall save it thirty six For what will it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul thirty seven Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his soul thirty eight For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him will also the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels IX AND he said to them Verily I say to you that there are some of those standing here who shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of God already come with power two And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter and James and John and brings them up into a high mountain apart by themselves And he was transfigured before them three And his garments became shining exceeding white as snow such as no fuller on earth can whiten four And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses and they were talking with Jesus five And Peter answering said to Jesus Master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tents one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elijah six For he knew not what to say for they were sore afraid seven And there came a cloud overshadowing them and a voice came out of the cloud This is my beloved Son hear ye him eight And suddenly looking around they no longer saw any one but Jesus only with themselves nine And as they came down from the mountain he charged them that they should relate what they had seen to no one except when the Son of man shall have risen from the dead ten And they kept the saying questioning among themselves what is the rising from the dead eleven And they asked him saying Why say the scribes that Elijah must first come twelve And he said to them Elijah indeed comes first and restores all things And how is it written of the Son of man That he must suffer many things and be set at naught thirteen But I say to you that Elijah also has come and they did to him whatever they would as it is written of him fourteen And coming to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them and scribes questioning with them fifteen And straightway all the multitude seeing him were greatly amazed and running to him saluted him sixteen And he asked them What question ye with them seventeen And one of the multitude answered him Teacher I brought to thee my son having a dumb spirit eighteen And wherever it lays hold of him it tears him and he foams and gnashes his teeth and he pines away And I spoke to thy disciples that they should cast it out and they could not nineteen And he answering says to them O faithless generation how long shall I be with you How long shall I bear with you Bring him to me twenty And they brought him to him And seeing him straightway the spirit rent him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming twenty one And he asked his father How long is it since this came upon him And he said From a child twenty two And ofttimes it cast him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him But if thou art able to do anything have compassion on us and help us twenty three Jesus said to him If thou art able All things are possible to the believing twenty four And straightway the father of the child cried out and said I believe help thou my unbelief twenty five And Jesus seeing that a multitude came running together rebuked the unclean spirit saying to him Dumb and deaf spirit I charge thee come out of him and enter into him no more twenty six And crying out and rending him sorely it came out of him And he became as one dead so that many said He is dead twenty seven But Jesus taking him by the hand raised him and he stood up twenty eight And when he had come into the house his disciples asked him privately Why could not we cast it out twenty nine And he said to them This kind can go out by nothing except by prayer and fasting thirty And going forth from thence they passed through Galilee and he would not that any one should know it thirty one For he taught his disciples and said to them The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men and they will kill him and when he is killed after three days he will rise again thirty two But they understood not the saying and were afraid to ask him thirty three And they came to Capernaum And having come into the house he inquired of them Of what were ye reasoning among yourselves by the way thirty four But they were silent for by the way they had disputed with one another who was greatest thirty five And sitting down he called the twelve and says to them If any one desires to be first he shall be last of all and servant of all thirty six And taking a child he placed it in the midst of them and folding it in his arms he said to them thirty seven Whoever shall receive one of such children in my name receives me and whoever shall receive me receives not me but him who sent me thirty eight And John answered him saying Teacher we saw one casting out demons in thy name who follows not us and we forbade him because he follows not us thirty nine But Jesus said Forbid him not for there is no one who shall do a miracle in my name and can lightly speak evil of me forty For he that is not against us is for us forty one For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in that name that ye are Christ s verily I say to you he shall not lose his reward forty two And whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to offend it is better for him that an upper millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea forty three And if thy hand cause thee to offend cut it off It is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having the two hands to go into hell into the fire that is unquenchable forty four where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched forty five And if thy foot cause thee to offend cut it off It is better for thee to enter into life lame than having the two feet to be cast into hell into the fire that is unquenchable forty six where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched forty seven And if thine eye cause thee to offend pluck it out It is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire forty eight where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched forty nine For every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt fifty Salt is good but if the salt become saltless wherewith will ye season it Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another X AND rising up he goes thence into the borders of Judaea and the further side of the Jordan And again the multitudes come together to him and as he was wont he again taught them two And the Pharisees came to him and asked him if it is lawful for a man to put away a wife tempting him three And he answering said to them What did Moses command you four And they said Moses permitted to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away five And Jesus answering said to them For your hardness of heart he wrote you this command six But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female seven For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall be one flesh eight So that they are no longer two but one flesh nine What therefore God joined together let not man put asunder ten And in the house his disciples asked him again concerning this eleven And he says to them Whoever shall put away his wife and marry another commits adultery against her twelve And if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she commits adultery thirteen And they brought little children to him that he might touch them and the disciples rebuked those who brought them fourteen But Jesus seeing it was much displeased and said to them Suffer the little children to come to me forbid them not for to such belongs the kingdom of God fifteen Verily I say to you whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall not enter therein sixteen And he folded them in his arms put his hands on them and blessed them seventeen And as he was going forth into the way there came one running and kneeling to him and asked him Good Teacher what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life eighteen And Jesus said to him Why callest thou me good There is none good but one God nineteen Thou knowest the commandments Do not commit adultery Do not kill Do not steal Do not bear false witness Defraud not Honor thy father and mother twenty And he answering said to him Teacher all these I kept from my youth twenty one And Jesus beholding him loved him and said to him One thing thou lackest go sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me twenty two And he became sad at that saying and went away sorrowful for he had great possessions twenty three And looking around Jesus says to his disciples How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God twenty four And the disciples were astonished at his words But Jesus answering again says to them Children how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God twenty five It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God twenty six And they were exceedingly amazed saying among themselves Who then can be saved twenty seven And Jesus looking on them says With men it is impossible but not with God for with God all things are possible twenty eight Peter began to say to him Lo we forsook all and followed thee twenty nine And Jesus answering said Verily I say to you there is no one who forsook house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for the sake of me and of the glad tidings thirty but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life thirty one But many first will be last and the last first thirty two And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem And Jesus was going before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were afraid And again he took with him the twelve and began to say to them what things should happen to him thirty three Behold we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and to the scribes and they will condemn him to death and will deliver him up to the Gentiles thirty four and they will mock him and scourge him and spit upon him and will kill him and after three days he will rise again thirty five And James and John the sons of Zebedee come to him saying Teacher we desire that thou shouldst do for us whatever we shall ask thirty six And he said to them What do ye desire that I should do for you thirty seven They said to him Grant to us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy glory thirty eight And Jesus said to them Ye know not what ye ask Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink or to endure the immersion which I endure thirty nine And they said to him We are able And Jesus said to them Ye shall indeed drink the cup that I drink and endure the immersion which I endure forty But to sit on my right hand or on the left is not mine to give but is for them for whom it has been prepared forty one And the ten hearing it began to be much displeased with James and John forty two And Jesus calling them to him says to them Ye know that they who are accounted to rule ten forty two over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise authority over them forty three But it is not so among you But whoever would become great among you shall be your minister forty four and whoever would become chiefest of you shall be servant of all forty five For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many forty six And they come to Jericho And as he was going forth from Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude the son of Timaeus Bartimaeus a blind beggar was sitting by the way side forty seven And hearing that it is Jesus the Nazarene he began to cry out and say Son of David Jesus have mercy on me forty eight And many rebuked him that he should hold his peace But he cried all the more Son of David have mercy on me forty nine And Jesus stood still and said Call him And they call the blind man saying to him Be of good cheer rise he calls thee fifty And he casting away his garment leaped up and came to Jesus fifty one And Jesus answering said to him What wilt thou that I should do to thee The blind man said to him Lord that I may receive sight fifty two And Jesus said to him Go thy way thy faith has made thee whole And immediately he received sight and followed him in the way XI AND when they come near to Jerusalem to Bethphage and Bethany at the mount of the Olives he sends forth two of his disciples two and says to them Go into the village over against you and immediately on entering into it ye will find a colt tied whereon no man has sat loose and bring him three And if any one say to you Why do ye this say The Lord has need of him and straightway he will send him hither four And they departed and found a colt tied by the door without on the street and they loose him five And some of those standing there said to them What do ye loosing the colt six And they said to them as Jesus commanded and they let them go seven And they bring the colt to Jesus and cast their garments on him and he sat upon him eight And many spread their garments in the way and others branches cutting them from the fields eleven eight nine And they that went before and they that followed cried Hosanna blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord ten blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David Hosanna in the highest eleven And he entered into Jerusalem and into the temple and having looked around on all things the evening being now come he went out to Bethany with the twelve twelve And on the morrow when they had come out from Bethany he was hungry thirteen And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if haply he might find anything thereon And coming to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season of figs fourteen And answering he said to it Let no one eat fruit from thee henceforth forever And his disciples heard it fifteen And they come into Jerusalem And entering into the temple he began to cast out those who sold and bought in the temple and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves sixteen and suffered not that any one should carry a vessel through the temple seventeen And he taught saying to them Is it not written My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations But ye have made it a den of robbers eighteen And the chief priests and the scribes heard it And they sought how they might destroy him for they feared him for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching nineteen And when it became late he went forth out of the city twenty And passing by in the morning they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots twenty one And Peter calling to remembrance says to him Master behold the fig tree which thou didst curse is withered away twenty two And Jesus answering says to them Have faith in God twenty three Verily I say to you that whoever shall say to this mountain Be thou taken up and cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that what he says comes to pass he shall have it twenty four Therefore I say to you All things whatever ye ask when ye pray believe that ye received and ye shall have them twenty five And when ye stand praying forgive if ye have aught against any one that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses twenty six But if ye do not forgive neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses eleven twenty six twenty seven And they come again into Jerusalem And as he was walking in the temple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders twenty eight And they said to him By what authority doest thou these things And who gave thee this authority to do these things twenty nine And Jesus answering said to them I also will ask you one thing and answer me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things thirty John s immersion was it from heaven or from men Answer me thirty one And they reasoned among themselves saying thirty two If we say from heaven he will say why then did ye not believe him But shall we say from men They feared the people for all held that John was verily a prophet thirty three And answering they say to Jesus We do not know And Jesus says to them Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these things XII AND he began to speak to them in parables A man planted a vineyard and set a hedge about it and dug a wine vat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went abroad two And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard three And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty four And again he sent to them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully treated five And he sent another and him they killed and many others beating some and killing some six Having yet therefore one beloved son he sent him also to them last saying They will reverence my son seven But those husbandmen said among themselves This is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours eight And they took and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard nine What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do He will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard to others ten And have ye not read this scripture The stone which the builders disallowed The same is become the head of the corner eleven This is from the Lord and is wonderful in our eyes twelve And they sought to lay hold of him but feared the people for they knew that he spoke the parable against them and they left him and went away thirteen And they send to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to entrap him with a word fourteen And they come and say to him Teacher we know that thou art true and carest for no one for thou regardest not the person of men but teachest the way of God in truth Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not fifteen Shall we give or shall we not give But he knowing their hypocrisy said to them Why tempt ye me Bring me a denary twelve fifteen that I may see it sixteen And they brought it And he says to them Whose is this image and the inscription And they said to him Caesar s seventeen And Jesus answering said to them Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar s and to God the things that are God s And they marveled at him eighteen And there come to him Sadducees who say there is no resurrection And they asked him saying nineteen Teacher Moses wrote to us that if one s brother die and leave a wife behind and leave no children his brother should take the wife and raise up seed to his brother twenty There were seven brothers and the first took a wife and dying left no seed twenty one And the second took her and died and he also left no seed and the third likewise twenty two And the seven took her and left no seed Last of all the woman died also twenty three In the resurrection therefore when they shall rise again of which of them shall she be wife For the seven had her for a wife twenty four Jesus answering said to them Do ye not therefore err because ye know not the Scriptures nor the power of God twenty five For when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as angels who are in heaven twenty six And concerning the dead that they rise have ye not read in the book of Moses at The Bush how God spoke to him saying I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob twenty seven He is not God of the dead but of the living Ye greatly err twenty eight And one of the scribes came to him and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he answered them well asked him Which commandment is first of all twenty nine And Jesus answered him First is Hear O Israel the Lord is our God the Lord is one thirty and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength This is the first commandment thirty one Second is this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself There is no other commandment greater than these thirty two And the scribe said to him Well Teacher thou saidst truly that he is one and there is no other beside him thirty three and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices thirty four And Jesus seeing that he answered intelligently said to him Thou art not far from the kingdom of God And no one dared any longer to question him thirty five And Jesus answering said while teaching in the temple How say the scribes that the Christ is son of David thirty six For David himself said in the Holy Spirit The LORD said to my Lord Sit on my right hand Till I put thy enemies under thy feet thirty seven David himself calls him Lord and whence is he his son And the great multitude heard him gladly thirty eight And he said to them in his teaching Beware of the scribes who love to go about in long robes and love greetings in the markets thirty nine and the first seats in the synagogues and the first places at the feasts forty who devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers these shall receive greater condemnation forty one And sitting over against the treasury he beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much forty two And one poor widow came and cast in two mites which are a farthing forty three And calling to him his disciples he said to them Verily I say to you that this poor widow cast in more than all who are casting into the treasury forty four For all cast in out of their abundance but she out of her want cast in all that she had her whole living XIII AND as he went out of the temple one of his disciples says to him Teacher see what manner of stones and what manner of buildings two And Jesus said to him Seest thou these great buildings There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down three And as he was sitting on the mount of the Olives over against the temple Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately four Tell us when will these things be And what is the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished five And Jesus began to say to them Take heed lest any one lead you astray six For many will come in my name saying I am he and will lead many astray seven And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars be not troubled for it must come to pass but not yet is the end eight For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be earthquakes in divers places and there will be famines and commotions these are the beginning of sorrows nine But do ye take heed to yourselves for they will deliver you up to councils and in the synagogues ye will be beaten and ye will be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony to them ten And the good news must first be preached among all the nations eleven But when they lead you away to deliver you up take not thought beforehand what ye shall speak nor premeditate but whatever shall be given you in that hour that speak for it is not ye that speak but the Holy Spirit twelve And the brother will deliver up the brother to death and the father the child and children will rise up against parents and will put them to death thirteen And ye will be hated by all for my name s sake but he that has endured unto the end the same shall be saved fourteen But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not let him that reads mark then let those in Judaea flee to the mountains fifteen And he that is upon the house let him not go down into the house nor enter in to take anything out of his house sixteen And he that is in the field let him not turn back to take his garment seventeen But woe to those who are with child and to those who give suck in those days eighteen And pray that it be not in the winter nineteen For in those days will be affliction such as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now neither shall be twenty And if the Lord had not shortened those days no flesh would have been saved but for the sake of the chosen whom he chose he shortened the days twenty one And then if any one say to you Lo here is the Christ or Lo there believe not twenty two For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show signs and wonders so as to lead if possible even the chosen astray twenty three But do ye take heed I have foretold you all twenty four But in those days after that affliction the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light twenty five and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken twenty six And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory twenty seven And then will he send forth the angels and gather together his chosen from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven twenty eight And learn the parable from the fig tree When its branch is already become tender and puts forth leaves ye know that summer is near twenty nine So also ye when ye see these things come to pass know that it is near at the doors thirty Verily I say to you that this generation shall not pass till all these things are done thirty one Heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away thirty two But of that day or hour no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the Son but the Father thirty three Take heed watch for ye know not when the time is thirty four As a man who is abroad having left his house and given authority to his servants to each one his work also commanded the porter that he should watch thirty five watch therefore for ye know not when the master of the house comes at evening or at midnight or at the cock crowing or in the morning thirty six lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping thirty seven And what I say to you I say to all Watch XIV TWO days after was the passover and the feast of unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft and put him to death two For they said Not at the feast lest there shall be a tumult of the people three And he being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper as he was reclining at table there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of pure spikenard very precious and she broke the box and poured it on his head four And there were some that were much displeased among themselves and said Why was this waste of the ointment made five For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denaries and given to the poor And they murmured at her six And Jesus said Let her alone why do ye trouble her She wrought a good work on me seven For the poor ye have always with you and when ye will ye can do good to them but me ye have not always eight She did what she could she beforehand anointed my body for the preparation for burial nine Verily I say to you wherever the good news shall be preached in the whole world this also that she did shall be told for a memorial of her ten And Judas Iscariot one of the twelve went to the chief priests to deliver him up to them eleven And they when they heard it were glad and promised to give him money And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him up twelve And on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread when they killed the passover his disciples say to him Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover thirteen And he sends forth two of his disciples and says to them Go into the city and there will meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him fourteen And where he shall go in say to the master of the house The Teacher says Where is the guest chamber in which I may eat the passover with my disciples fifteen And he will show you a large upper room furnished ready there prepare for us sixteen And his disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he said to them and they made ready the passover seventeen And at evening he comes with the twelve eighteen And as they were reclining at table and eating Jesus said Verily I say to you that one of you will betray me one that eats with me nineteen And they began to be sorrowful and to say to him one by one Is it I And another said Is it I twenty And he answering said to them It is one of the twelve one that dips with me into the dish twenty one The Son of man indeed goes as it is written of him but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed It were good for him if that man had not been born twenty two And as they were eating Jesus taking a loaf blessed and broke and gave it to them and said Take it this is my body twenty three And taking the cup he gave thanks and gave it to them and they all drank of it twenty four And he said to them This is my blood of the covenant which is shed for many twenty five Verily I say to you I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God twenty six And having sung they went out into the mount of the Olives twenty seven And Jesus says to them All ye will be offended because it is written I will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered twenty eight But after I am risen I will go before you into Galilee twenty nine And Peter said to him Though all shall be offended yet will not I thirty And Jesus says to him Verily I say to thee that thou this day in this night before a cock crows twice wilt thrice deny me thirty one But he said the more vehemently If I should die with thee I will not deny thee Likewise also said they all thirty two And they come to a place which was named Gethsemane And he says to his disciples Sit ye here while I shall pray thirty three And he takes with him Peter and James and John and began to be sore amazed and to be troubled thirty four And he says to them My soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death tarry here and watch thirty five And going forward a little he fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him thirty six And he said Abba Father all things are possible to thee take away this cup from me but not what I will but what thou wilt thirty seven And he comes and finds them sleeping And he says to Peter Simon sleepest thou Couldest thou not watch one hour thirty eight Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak thirty nine And again he went away and prayed saying the same words forty And returning he found them again sleeping for their eyes were heavy and they knew not what to answer him forty one And he comes the third time and says to them Do ye sleep the remaining time and take your rest fourteen forty one It is enough the hour is come behold the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners forty two Rise let us go behold he that betrays me is at hand forty three And immediately while he was yet speaking comes Judas one of the twelve and with him a multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders forty four And his betrayer had given them a signal saying Whom I shall kiss that is he lay hold of him and lead him away securely forty five And coming he goes straightway to him and says Master Master and kissed him forty six And they laid their hands on him and held him fast forty seven And one of those standing by drew his sword and smote the servant of the high priest and took off his ear forty eight And Jesus answering said to them Came ye out as against a robber with swords and staves to take me forty nine I was daily with you in the temple teaching and ye did not lay hold of me but that the Scriptures might be fulfilled fifty And all forsook him and fled fifty one And there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth cast about his naked body and the young men lay hold of him fifty two And leaving behind the linen cloth he fled from them naked fifty three And they led Jesus away to the high priest and with him assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes fifty four And Peter followed him afar off even into the court of the high priest and was sitting with the officers and warming himself at the fire fifty five And the chief priests and all the council sought for testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death and they found none fifty six For many bore false witness against him but their testimonies agreed not together fifty seven And certain ones rose up and bore false witness against him saying fifty eight We heard him say I will destroy this temple that is made with hands and in three days I will build another made without hands fifty nine And not even so did their testimony agree sixty And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus saying Answerest thou nothing What do these witness against thee sixty one But he was silent and answered nothing Again the high priest asked him and said to him Art thou the Christ the Son of the Blessed sixty two And Jesus said I am and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven sixty three And the high priest rending his clothes says What further need have we of witnesses sixty four Ye heard the blasphemy What think ye And they all condemned him to be guilty of death sixty five And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and buffet him and say to him Prophesy And the officers with blows took him in charge sixty six And Peter being below in the court there comes one of the maid servants of the high priest sixty seven and seeing Peter warming himself she looked upon him and said Thou also wast with Jesus the Nazarene sixty eight But he denied saying I do not know nor do I understand what thou sayest And he went out into the fore court and a cock crowed sixty nine And the maid servant seeing him began again to say to those standing by This is one of them seventy And he again denied it And a little after they that stood by said again to Peter Surely thou art one of them for thou art a Galilaean seventy one But he began to invoke curses and to swear I do not know this man of whom ye speak seventy two And a cock crowed a second time And Peter remembered the word how Jesus said to him Before a cock crows twice thou wilt thrice deny me And as he thought thereon he wept XV AND straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole council having held a consultation bound Jesus and carried him away and delivered him up to Pilate two And Pilate asked him Art thou the King of the Jews And he answering said to him Thou sayest it three And the chief priests accused him of many things four And Pilate asked him again saying Answerest thou nothing Behold what things they testify against thee five But Jesus no longer made any answer so that Pilate marveled six And at the feast he released to them one prisoner whomsoever they asked seven And there was the one called Barabbas bound with his companions in sedition who in the sedition had committed murder eight And coming up the multitude began to make request according as he had always done for them nine And Pilate answered them saying Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews ten For he knew that through envy the chief priests had delivered him up eleven But the chief priests stirred up the multitude that he should rather release to them Barabbas twelve And Pilate answering said again to them What will ye then that I shall do to him whom ye call the King of the Jews thirteen And they cried again Crucify him fourteen And Pilate said to them What evil then has he done And they cried the more exceedingly Crucify him fifteen And Pilate wishing to satisfy the multitude released to them Barabbas and he delivered up Jesus after scourging him to be crucified sixteen And the soldiers led him away into the court which is Praetorium and they call together the whole band seventeen And they clothe him with purple and having platted a crown of thorns they put it on him eighteen And they began to salute him Hail King of the Jews nineteen And they smote him on the head with a reed and spit upon him and kneeling down did homage to him twenty And when they had mocked him they took off the purple from him and put on him his own garments And they lead him out to crucify him twenty one And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian who was passing by coming from the country the father of Alexander and Rufus to bear his cross twenty two And they bring him to the place Golgotha which is interpreted Place of a skull twenty three And they gave him wine mingled with myrrh but he took it not twenty four And having crucified him they divide his garments casting lots upon them what any one should take twenty five And it was the third hour and they crucified him twenty six And the inscription of the accusation against him was written over THE KING OF THE JEWS twenty seven And with him they crucify two robbers one on his right hand and one on his left twenty eight And the scripture was fulfilled which says And he was reckoned with transgressors twenty nine And they that passed by railed at him wagging their heads and saying Aha thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days thirty save thyself and come down from the cross thirty one Likewise also the chief priests mocking one with another together with the scribes said Others he saved himself he can not save thirty two Let the Christ the King of Israel come down now from the cross that we may see and believe And they that were crucified with him reproached him thirty three And when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour thirty four And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eloi Eloi lama sabachthani Which is interpreted My God my God why didst thou forsake me thirty five And some of those standing by hearing it said Behold he calls Elijah thirty six And one ran and filled a sponge with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink saying Let alone let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down thirty seven And Jesus uttering a loud cry expired thirty eight And the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom thirty nine And the centurion who was standing near over against him seeing that he so cried out and expired said Truly this man was the Son of God forty And there were also women looking on afar off among whom was also Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses and Salome forty one who also when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered to him and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem forty two And evening having now come since it was the preparation which is the day before the sabbath fifteen forty two forty three Joseph from Arimathaea an honorable counselor who also was himself waiting for the kingdom of God came and went in boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus forty four And Pilate marveled if he were already dead and calling to him the centurion he asked him if he had been long dead forty five And having learned it from the centurion he gave the dead body to Joseph forty six And having bought fine linen and taken him down he wrapped him in the linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre forty seven And Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid XVI AND the sabbath being past Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices that they might come and anoint him two And very early on the first day of the week they come to the sepulchre when the sun was risen three And they said to one another Who will roll away the stone for us out of the door of the sepulchre four And looking up they see that the stone has been rolled away For it was very great five And entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a white robe and they were affrighted six And he says to them Be not affrighted Ye are seeking Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified He is risen he is not here Behold the place where they laid him seven But go say to his disciples and to Peter that he goes before you into Galilee There shall ye see him as he said to you eight And they went out and fled from the sepulchre for trembling and astonishment seized them And they said nothing to any one for they were afraid nine And having risen early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary the Magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons ten She went and reported it to those who had been with him as they mourned and wept eleven And they hearing that he is alive and was seen by her believed not twelve After that he appeared in another form to two of them as they walked going into the country thirteen They also went and reported it to the rest nor did they believe them fourteen Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they reclined at table and upbraided their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not those who saw him after he was risen fifteen And he said to them Go into all the world and preach the good news to every creature sixteen He that believes and is immersed shall be saved but he that believes not shall be condemned seventeen And these signs shall accompany those who have believed in my name they shall cast out demons they shall speak with new tongues eighteen they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover nineteen The Lord therefore after he had spoken to them was taken up into heaven and sat down on the right hand of God twenty and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that followed THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE I FORASMUCH as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a narration concerning the things fully believed among us one one two as they who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us three it seemed good to me also having accurately traced all from the very first to write to thee in order most excellent Theophilus four that thou mightest know the certainty concerning those things one four wherein thou wast instructed five There was in the days of Herod the king of Judaea a certain priest Zachariah by name of the course of Abijah and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elisabeth six And they were both righteous before God walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless seven And they had no child because Elisabeth was barren and they both were now far advanced in years eight And it came to pass that while he executed the priest s office before God in the order of his course nine it fell to his lot according to the custom of the priest s office to burn incense going into the temple of the Lord ten And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense eleven And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense twelve And Zachariah seeing him was troubled and fear fell upon him thirteen But the angel said to him Fear not Zachariah for thy prayer was heard and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John fourteen And thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth fifteen For he shall be great before the Lord and he shall not drink wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother s womb sixteen And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God seventeen And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a prepared people for the Lord eighteen And Zachariah said to the angel Whereby shall I know this For I am an old man and my wife is far advanced in years nineteen And the angel answering said to him I am Gabriel that stands in the presence of God and I was sent to speak to thee and to bring thee these glad tidings twenty And behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou didst not believe thy words which shall be fulfilled in their season twenty one And the people were waiting for Zachariah and they were wondering at his long tarrying in the temple twenty two And when he came out he was not able to speak to them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple and he was making signs to them and remained speechless twenty three And it came to pass when the days of his ministration were completed that he departed to his own house twenty four And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived and she hid herself five months saying twenty five Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men twenty six And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth twenty seven to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the virgin s name was Mary twenty eight And the angel coming in to her said Hail highly favored The Lord is with thee Blessed art thou among women twenty nine And she was troubled at the saying and was considering what manner of salutation this might be thirty And the angel said to her Fear not Mary for thou didst find favor with God thirty one And behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus thirty two He shall be great and shall be called Son of the Highest and the Lord God will give to him the throne of David his father thirty three and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end thirty four Then said Mary to the angel How shall this be seeing that I know not a man thirty five And the angel answering said to her The Holy Spirit will come upon thee and the power of the Highest will overshadow thee therefore also the Holy One that is born shall be called the Son of God thirty six And behold Elisabeth thy kinswoman she also has conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who is called barren thirty seven For with God nothing shall be one thirty seven impossible thirty eight And Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord let it be to me according to thy word And the angel departed from her thirty nine And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of Judah forty and entered into the house of Zachariah and saluted Elisabeth forty one And it came to pass as Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary that the babe leaped in her womb and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit forty two And she spoke out with a loud voice and said Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb forty three And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me forty four For behold as the voice of thy salutation came into my ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy forty five And happy is she who believed that there shall be one forty five a fulfillment of the things told her from the Lord forty six And Mary said My soul magnifies the Lord forty seven and my spirit rejoiced in God my Savior forty eight Because he looked upon the low estate of his handmaid for behold henceforth all generations will call me happy forty nine Because the Mighty One did great things for me and holy is his name fifty And his mercy is from generation to generation to those who fear him fifty one He wrought might with his arm he scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts fifty two He cast down princes from thrones and exalted those of low degree fifty three The hungry he filled with good and the rich he sent empty away fifty four He helped Israel his servant to remember mercy fifty five as he spoke to our fathers for Abraham and for his seed forever fifty six And Mary abode with her about three months and returned to her own house fifty seven Now Elisabeth s full time came that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son fifty eight And her neighbors and her kindred heard that the Lord showed great mercy toward her and they rejoiced with her fifty nine And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they called him Zachariah after the name of his father sixty And his mother answered and said Nay but he shall be called John sixty one And they said to her There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name sixty two And they made signs to his father how he would have him called sixty three And asking for a writing tablet he wrote saying His name is John And they all wondered sixty four And his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue was loosed and he spoke blessing God sixty five And fear came on all that dwelt around them And all these things one sixty five were told abroad in all the hill country of Judaea sixty six And all who heard laid them up in their hearts saying What then will this child be And the hand of the Lord was with him sixty seven And Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied saying sixty eight Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel that he visited and wrought redemption for his people sixty nine and raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant seventy as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets of old seventy one salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us seventy two to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant seventy three the oath which he swore to Abraham our father seventy four to grant to us that without fear being rescued from the hand of our enemies we should serve him seventy five in holiness and righteousness before him all our days seventy six And also thou O child shalt be called Prophet of the Highest for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways seventy seven in order to give knowledge of salvation to his people in remission of their sins seventy eight through the tender mercies of our God whereby the dayspring from on high visited us seventy nine to give light to those sitting in darkness and the shadow of death in order to guide our feet into the way of peace eighty And the child grew and became strong in spirit and was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel II AND it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered two This registering was the first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria three And all went to be registered each one to his own city four And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judaea to the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and family of David five to be registered with Mary his betrothed wife who was with child six And so it was that while they were there the days were completed that she should bring forth seven And she brought forth her first born son and wrapped him in swathing bands and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn eight And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field and keeping watch over their flock by night nine And behold an angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone around them and they were sore afraid ten And the angel said to them Fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people eleven For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior who is Christ the Lord twelve And this shall be to you the sign Ye will find a babe wrapped in swathing bands lying in a manger thirteen And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying fourteen Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace good will among men fifteen And it came to pass when the angels were gone away from them into heaven that the shepherds said one to another Let us go now unto Bethlehem and see this thing that is come to pass which the Lord made known to us sixteen And they came with haste and found both Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in the manger seventeen And having seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child eighteen And all that heard wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds nineteen And Mary kept all these things two nineteen pondering them in her heart twenty And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all that they heard and saw as it was told to them twenty one And when eight days were completed for circumcising him his name was called Jesus the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb twenty two And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were completed they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord twenty three as it is written in the law of the Lord Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord twenty four and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord A pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons twenty five And behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and this man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was upon him twenty six And it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord twenty seven And he came by the Spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law twenty eight then he took him into his arms and blessed God and said twenty nine Now Lord thou lettest thy servant depart in peace according to thy word thirty because my eyes saw thy salvation thirty one which thou preparedst before the face of all the peoples thirty two a light for a revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel thirty three And his father and mother wondered at the things spoken of him thirty four And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother Behold this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel and for a sign that shall be spoken against thirty five and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed thirty six And there was Anna a prophetess daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher She was of great age and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity thirty seven and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years who departed not from the temple serving day and night with fastings and prayers thirty eight And she coming up at that very time likewise gave thanks to the Lord and spoke of him to all that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem thirty nine And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord they returned into Galilee to their own city Nazareth forty And the child grew and became strong being filled with wisdom and the favor of God was upon him forty one And his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover forty two And when he was twelve years old they having gone up according to the custom of the feast forty three and completed the days as they returned Jesus the child remained behind in Jerusalem And his parents knew it not forty four but supposing that he was in the company went a day s journey and sought him among their kindred and acquaintance forty five and not finding him they returned to Jerusalem seeking him forty six And it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers both hearing them and asking them questions forty seven And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers forty eight And seeing him they were amazed And his mother said to him Child why didst thou thus deal with us Behold thy father and I sought thee sorrowing forty nine And he said to them How is it that ye sought me Did ye not know that I must be in my Father s house two forty nine fifty And they understood not the saying which he spoke to them fifty one And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject to them And his mother kept all these sayings in her heart fifty two And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men III NOW in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judaea and Herod tetrarch of Galilee and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and of the region of Trachonitis and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene two when Annas was high priest and Caiaphas the word of God came to John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness three And he came into all the country about the Jordan preaching the immersion of repentance unto remission of sins four as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet The voice of one crying in the wilderness Prepare the way of the Lord Make straight his paths five Every valley shall be filled And every mountain and hill shall be brought low And the crooked shall be straight And the rough ways smooth six And all flesh shall see the salvation of God seven He said therefore to the multitudes that came out to be immersed by him Brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the coming wrath eight Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves We have Abraham for our father for I say to you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham nine And now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees Every tree therefore that brings not forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire ten And the multitudes asked him saying What then shall we do eleven He answering says to them He that has two coats let him impart to him that has none and he that has food let him do likewise twelve And there came also publicans to be immersed and they said to him Teacher what shall we do thirteen And he said to them Exact no more than that which is appointed you fourteen And soldiers also asked him saying What shall we also do And he said to them Do violence to no one neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wages three fourteen fifteen And while the people were in expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John whether he himself were not the Christ sixteen John answered them all saying I indeed immerse you in water but there comes he that is mightier than I the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loose he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire seventeen whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor and will gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he will burn up with fire unquenchable eighteen And with many other exhortations he published the good tidings to the people nineteen But Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him on account of Herodias the wife of his brother and for all the evils which Herod did twenty added to all this also that he shut up John in prison twenty one Now it came to pass when all the people had been immersed that as Jesus having also been immersed was praying the heaven was opened twenty two and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily shape as a dove upon him and there came a voice out of heaven Thou art my beloved Son in thee I am well pleased twenty three And Jesus himself was when he began three twenty three about thirty years of age being the son as was supposed of Joseph the son of Heli twenty four the son of Matthat the son of Levi the son of Melchi the son of Janna the son of Joseph twenty five the son of Matthias the son of Amos the son of Nahum the son of Esli the son of Naggai twenty six the son of Maath the son of Mattathias the son of Shimei the son of Joseph the son of Judah twenty seven the son of Joanna the son of Reza the son of Zerubbabel the son of Salathiel the son of Neri twenty eight the son of Melchi the son of Addi the son of Cosam the son of Elmodam the son of Er twenty nine the son of Joses the son of Eliezer the son of Jorim the son of Matthat the son of Levi thirty the son of Simeon the son of Judah the son of Joseph the son of Jonan the son of Eliakim thirty one the son of Meleah the son of Mainan the son of Mattatha the son of Nathan the son of David thirty two the son of Jesse the son of Obed the son of Boaz the son of Salmon the son of Nahon thirty three the son of Amminadab the son of Ram the son of Hezron the son of Pharez the son of Judah thirty four the son of Jacob the son of Isaac the son of Abraham the son of Terah the son of Nahor thirty five the son of Serug the son of Reu the son of Peleg the son of Eber the son of Salah thirty six the son of Cainan the son of Arphaxad the son of Shem the son of Noah the son of Lamech thirty seven the son of Methuselah the son of Enoch the son of Jared the son of Mehalaleel the son of Cainan thirty eight the son of Enos the son of Seth the son of Adam the son of God IV AND Jesus full of the Holy Spirit returned from the Jordan and he was led in the Sprit into the wilderness two forty days tempted by the Devil And he ate nothing in those days and when they were ended he hungered three And the Devil said to him If thou art the Son of God command this stone that it become bread four And Jesus answered him saying It is written Man shall not live on bread alone five And the Devil leading him up into a high mountain showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time six And the Devil said to him All this power will I give thee and the glory of them because it has been delivered to me and I give it to whomsoever I will seven If thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine eight And Jesus answering said to him It is written Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve nine And he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him If thou art the Son of God cast thyself down from hence ten For it is written He will give his angels command concerning thee to keep thee eleven and on their hands they shall bear thee up lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone twelve And Jesus answering said to him It is said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God thirteen And having finished every temptation the Devil departed from him for a season fourteen And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee and there went out a report concerning him through all the surrounding country fifteen And he taught in their synagogues being honored by all sixteen And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up And as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and he stood up to read seventeen And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah And unrolling the book he found the place where it was written eighteen The Spirit of the Lord is upon me Because he anointed me to publish good tidings to the poor He has sent me to proclaim deliverance to the captives And recovering of sight to the blind To send the oppressed away free nineteen To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord twenty And rolling up the book he gave it again to the servant and sat down And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him twenty one And he began to say to them To day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears twenty two And all bore witness to him and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth And they said Is not this Joseph s son twenty three And he said to them Ye will surely say to me this proverb Physician heal thyself Whatever we heard done in Capernaum do also here in thy country twenty four And he said Verily I say to you no prophet is accepted in his own country twenty five But I tell you of a truth there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when there was a great famine throughout all the land twenty six and to none of them was Elijah sent but unto Zarephath of Sidonia to a woman that was a widow twenty seven And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet and none of them was cleansed but only Naaman the Syrian twenty eight And all in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath twenty nine And they rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built to cast him down headlong thirty But he passing through the midst of them went away thirty one And he came down to Capernaum a city of Galilee And he was teaching them on the sabbath thirty two and they were astonished at his teaching because his word was with power thirty three And in the synagogue there was a man having a spirit of an unclean demon and he cried out with a loud voice thirty four saying Ah what have we to do with thee Jesus of Nazareth Didst thou come to destroy us I know thee who thou art the Holy One of God thirty five And Jesus rebuked him saying Hold thy peace and come out from him And the demon throwing him in the midst came out from him doing him no harm thirty six And amazement came on all and they spoke with one another saying What is this word that with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out thirty seven And there went out a rumor concerning him into every place of the country around thirty eight And he rose up and went from the synagogue and entered into the house of Simon And the mother in law of Simon was seized with a violent fever four thirty eight and they besought him for her thirty nine And standing over her he rebuked the fever and it left her and immediately she arose and ministered to them forty Now when the sun was setting all that had any sick with divers diseases brought them to him and he laid his hands on each one of them and healed them forty one And demons also came out from many crying out and saying Thou art the Son of God And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak because they knew that he was the Christ forty two And when it was day he went out and went into a desert place And the multitudes sought him and came to him and stayed him that he should not depart from them forty three And he said to them I must publish the good news of the kingdom of God to other cities also because for this I was sent forth forty four And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee V AND it came to pass as the multitude pressed upon him to hear the word of God and he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret two that he saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing the nets three And entering into one of the ships which was Simon s he asked him to put out a little from the land And sitting down he taught the multitudes out of the ship four And when he ceased speaking he said to Simon Put out into the deep and do ye let down your nets for a draught five And Simon answering said to him Master we toiled all night and took nothing but at thy word I will let down the net six And having done this they inclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net began to break seven And they beckoned to their partners in the other ship to come and help them And they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink eight And Simon Peter seeing it fell down at the knees of Jesus saying Depart from me for I am a sinful man O Lord nine For astonishment had seized him and all that were with him at the draught of the fishes which they had taken ten and likewise also James and John sons of Zebedee who were partners with Simon And Jesus said to Simon Fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men eleven And having brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him twelve And it came to pass when he was in one of the cities that there was a man full of leprosy And seeing Jesus he fell on his face and besought him saying Lord if thou wilt thou canst cleanse me thirteen And stretching forth his hand he touched him saying I will be thou cleansed And immediately the leprosy departed from him fourteen And he charged him to tell no one But go and show thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing as Moses commanded for a testimony to them fifteen But all the more went abroad the report concerning him and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed of their infirmities sixteen And he was wont to retire into the solitary places and pray seventeen And it came to pass on a certain day that he was teaching and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem and there was power of the Lord for healing them eighteen And behold men brought on a bed a man who was palsied and they sought to bring him in and to lay him before him nineteen And not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went upon the housetop and let him down through the tiling with the couch into the midst before Jesus twenty And seeing their faith he said Man thy sins are forgiven thee twenty one And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason saying Who is this that speaks blasphemies Who can forgive sins but God alone twenty two But Jesus perceiving their thoughts answering said to them What reason ye in your hearts twenty three Which is easier to say Thy sins are forgiven thee or to say Arise and walk twenty four But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on the earth to forgive sins he said to the palsied man I say to thee arise and taking up thy couch go to thy house twenty five And immediately standing up before them he took up that whereon he lay and departed to his house glorifying God twenty six And they were all amazed and they glorified God and were filled with fear saying We have seen strange things to day twenty seven And after these things he went forth and saw a publican named Levi sitting at the place of receiving custom and he said to him Follow me twenty eight And leaving all he arose and followed him twenty nine And Levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was a great company of publicans and of others who reclined at the table with them thirty And the Pharisees and their scribes five thirty murmured against his disciples saying Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners thirty one And Jesus answering said to them They who are well need not a physician but they who are sick thirty two I have not come to call righteous men but sinners to repentance thirty three And they said to him Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers and likewise those of the Pharisees but thine eat and drink thirty four And he said to them Can ye make the sons of the bridechamber fast five thirty four while the bridegroom is with them thirty five But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them then shall they fast in those days thirty six And he spoke also a parable to them No one rends a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment else both the new will make a rent and the piece from the new agrees not with the old thirty seven And no one puts new wine into old skins else the new wine will burst the skins and will itself be poured out and the skins will perish thirty eight But new wine must be put into new skins and both are preserved together five thirty eight thirty nine And no one having drunk old wine straightway desires new for he says The old is better five thirty nine VI AND it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first six one that he was going through grain fields and his disciples plucked and ate the ears of grain rubbing them with their hands two And some of the Pharisees said Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath three And Jesus answering them said And have ye not read this what David did when he hungered himself and they who were with him four how he went into the house of God and took and ate the show bread and gave to those who were with him which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone five And he said to them The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath six And it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught And there was a man whose right hand was withered seven And the scribes and Pharisees were watching whether he would heal on the sabbath that they might find an accusation against him eight But he knew their thoughts and said to the man having the withered hand Arise and stand forth in the midst And he rose up and stood nine Then said Jesus to them I will ask you what is lawful six nine on the sabbath to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it ten And looking round on them all he said to him Stretch forth thy hand And he did so and his hand was restored eleven And they were filled with madness and conferred one with another as to what they should do to Jesus twelve And it came to pass in those days that he went out into the mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God thirteen And when it was day he called to him his disciples And having chosen from them twelve whom he named also apostles fourteen Simon whom he also named Peter and Andrew his brother and James and John and Philip and Bartholomew fifteen and Matthew and Thomas James the son of Alpheus and Simon called Zelotes sixteen and Judas brother of James and Judas Iscariot who became a betrayer seventeen and having come down with them he stood on a plain and a company of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judaea and Jerusalem and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases eighteen and those vexed by unclean spirits were healed nineteen and all the multitude sought to touch him because power went out from him and healed them all twenty And he lifting up his eyes on his disciples said Happy are ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God twenty one Happy are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled Happy are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh twenty two Happy are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from them and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the sake of the Son of man twenty three Rejoice in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the same manner did their fathers to the prophets twenty four But woe to you that are rich for ye have received your consolation twenty five Woe to you that are full for ye shall hunger Woe to you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep twenty six Woe when all men shall speak well of you for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets twenty seven But I say to you who hear Love your enemies do good to those who hate you twenty eight bless those who curse you pray for those who abuse you six twenty eight twenty nine To him who smites thee on the cheek offer also the other and him who takes away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also thirty Give to every one that asks of thee and of him who takes away thy goods demand them not again thirty one And as ye would that men should do to you do ye also in like manner to them thirty two For if ye love those who love you what thanks have ye For even the sinners love those who love them thirty three And if ye do good to those who do good to you what thanks have ye For even the sinners do the same thirty four And if ye lend to those of whom ye hope to receive what thanks have ye And sinners lend to sinners that they may receive as much in return thirty five But love your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing in return and your reward shall be great and ye shall be sons of the Highest for he is kind to the unthankful and evil thirty six Be ye merciful as your Father also is merciful thirty seven And judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned acquit and ye shall be acquitted thirty eight Give and it shall be given to you good measure pressed down shaken together running over shall they give into your bosom For with the same measure with which ye mete it shall be measured to you again thirty nine And he spoke also a parable to them Can the blind lead the blind Shall they not both fall into the ditch forty A disciple is not above the teacher but every one shall be perfected as his teacher forty one And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother s eye but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye forty two How canst thou say to thy brother Brother let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye Hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine eye and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother s eye forty three For there is no good tree that bears corrupt fruit nor corrupt tree that bears good fruit forty four For every tree is known from its own fruit For from thorns they do not gather figs nor from a bramble bush do they harvest grapes forty five The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good and the evil out of the evil brings forth that which is evil for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks forty six And why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say forty seven Every one that comes to me and hears my sayings and does them I will show you to whom he is like forty eight He is like a man building a house who digged deep and laid a foundation on the rock And when a flood arose the stream burst upon that house and could not shake it because it was well builded forty nine But he that hears and does not is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation on which the stream burst and immediately it fell six forty nine and the ruin of that house was great VII WHEN he completed all his sayings in the hearing of the people he entered into Capernaum two And a certain centurion s servant who was dear to him was sick and about to die three And having heard concerning Jesus he sent to him elders of the Jews asking him that he would come and heal his servant four And they coming to Jesus besought him earnestly saying He is worthy that thou shouldst do this for him five for he loves our nation and himself built our synagogue six And Jesus went with them And when he was now not far from the house the centurion sent friends to him saying to him Lord trouble not thyself for I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof seven Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee but say with a word and my servant will be healed eight For I am a man placed under authority having soldiers under me and I say to this one Go and he goes and to another Come and he comes and to my servant Do this and he does it nine And Jesus hearing these things marveled at him and turning said to the multitude that followed him I say to you I found not so great faith even in Israel ten And they who were sent returning to the house found the servant whole that had been sick eleven And it came to pass the day after that he went into a city called Nain and many of his disciples went with him and a great multitude twelve And as he came near to the gate of the city behold a dead man was carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and a great multitude of the city was with her thirteen And seeing her the Lord had compassion on her and said to her Weep not fourteen And he came and touched the bier and they who bore it stood still And he said Young man I say to thee arise fifteen And the dead sat up and began to speak And he gave him to his mother sixteen And fear seized on all and they glorified God saying A great prophet has arisen among us and God has visited his people seventeen And this report went forth in all Judaea concerning him and in all the country around eighteen And the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things nineteen And John calling to him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus saying Art thou he that comes or look we for another twenty And coming to him the men said John the Immerser has sent us to thee saying Art thou he that comes or look we for another twenty one And in that very hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits and on many blind he bestowed sight twenty two And answering he said to them Go and report to John what ye saw and heard that the blind receive sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised to the poor good tidings are published twenty three And happy is he whoever shall not be offended at me twenty four And when the messengers of John had departed he began to say to the multitudes concerning John What went ye out into the wilderness to behold A reed shaken by the wind twenty five But what went ye out to see A man clothed in soft raiment Behold they who are gorgeously appareled and live delicately are in kings palaces twenty six But what went ye out to see A prophet Yea I say to you and much more than a prophet twenty seven This is he of whom it is written Behold I send forth my messenger before thy face Who shall prepare thy way before thee twenty eight For I say to you among those born of women no one is a greater prophet than John but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he twenty nine And all the people hearing it and the publicans justified God having been immersed with John s immersion thirty But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God toward themselves not having been immersed by him thirty one To what then shall I liken the men of this generation And to what are they like thirty two They are like to children sitting in the market and calling to one another saying We piped to you and ye danced not we sang the lament to you and ye wept not thirty three For John the Immerser has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine and ye say He has a demon thirty four The Son of man has come eating and drinking and ye say Behold a glutton and a wine drinker a friend of publicans and sinners thirty five But wisdom was justified on the part of all her children thirty six And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him And entering into the house of the Pharisee he reclined at table thirty seven And behold a woman who was a sinner in the city learning that he is reclining at table in the house of the Pharisee brought an alabaster box of ointment thirty eight and standing behind at his feet weeping began to wet his feet with tears and wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment thirty nine And seeing it the Pharisee who had bidden him spoke within himself saying This man if he were a prophet would know who and what sort of woman this is that touches him for she is a sinner forty And Jesus answering said to him Simon I have somewhat to say to thee And he says Teacher say on forty one A certain money lender had two debtors The one owed five hundred denaries seven forty one and the other fifty forty two And they having nothing to pay he forgave them both Which of them therefore tell me will love him most forty three Simon answering said I suppose he to whom he forgave most And he said to him Thou didst rightly judge forty four And turning to the woman he said to Simon Seest thou this woman I entered into thy house thou gayest me no water for my feet but she has wet my feet with tears and wiped them with her hair forty five Thou gavest me no kiss but she from the time I came in ceased not to kiss my feet forty six My head with oil thou didst not anoint but she anointed my feet with ointment forty seven Wherefore I say to thee her many sins are forgiven for she loved much But to whom little is forgiven the same loves little forty eight And he said to her Thy sins are forgiven forty nine And they who reclined with him began to say within themselves Who is this that also forgives sins fifty And he said to the woman Thy faith has saved thee go in peace VIII AND it came to pass afterward that he journeyed through every city and village preaching and publishing the good news of the kingdom of God and with him the twelve two and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities Mary called the Magdalene from whom had gone out seven demons three and Joanna wife of Chuza Herod s steward and Susanna and many others who ministered to them of their substance four And a great multitude coming together of those also who came to him out of every city he spoke by a parable five The sower went forth to sow his seed And as he sowed one fell by the way side and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it six And another fell upon the rock and springing up it withered away because it had no moisture seven And another fell among the thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it eight And another fell into the good ground and sprang up and bore fruit a hundredfold And saying these things he cried He that has ears to hear let him hear nine And his disciples asked him what this parable was ten And he said To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to the rest in parables that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand eleven Now the parable is this The seed is the word of God twelve Those by the way side are they that hear after that comes the Devil and takes away the word from their heart that they may not believe and be saved thirteen Those on the rock are they who when they hear with joy receive the word and these have no root who for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away fourteen And that which fell among the thorns these are they who have heard and going forth are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of life and bring no fruit to perfection fifteen But that in the good ground these are they who in an honest and good heart having heard hold fast the word and bring forth fruit with patience sixteen No one having lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed but puts it on a lamp stand that they who enter in may behold the light seventeen For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest nor hidden that shall not be known and come abroad eighteen Take heed therefore how ye hear For whoever has to him shall be given and whoever has not even what he seems to have shall be taken from him nineteen And his mother and his brothers came to him and they could not come near him on account of the multitude twenty And it was told him saying Thy mother and thy brothers are standing without desiring to see thee twenty one And he answering said to them My mother and my brothers are these who hear and do the word of God twenty two And it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples And he said to them Let us go over to the other side of the lake And they launched forth twenty three And as they were sailing he fell asleep And there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they began to be filled and were in jeopardy twenty four And coming to him they awoke him saying Master Master we perish And he rising rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm twenty five And he said to them Where is your faith And they fearing wondered saying one to another Who then is this that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him twenty six And they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes which is over against Galilee twenty seven And when he had gone forth upon the land there met him a certain man out of the city who had demons a long time and wore no clothing and abode not in a house but in the tombs twenty eight And seeing Jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said What have I to do with thee Jesus Son of the most high God I beseech thee do not torment me twenty nine For he commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man For of a long time it had seized him and he was bound being secured with chains and fetters and bursting the bands he was driven by the demon into the deserts thirty And Jesus asked him saying What is thy name And he said Legion because many demons had entered into him thirty one And he besought him that he would not command them to go away into the abyss thirty two And there was a herd of many swine feeding in the mountain and they besought him that he would permit them to enter into them And he permitted them thirty three And going out of the man the demons entered into the swine and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake and were choked thirty four And seeing what was done the herdsmen fled and reported it in the city and in the country thirty five And they went out to see what was done And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid thirty six They also who saw it reported to them how he that was possessed by demons was healed thirty seven And the whole multitude of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes besought him to depart from them for they were seized with great fear And he entering into the ship returned thirty eight And the man out of whom the demons had gone besought him that he might be with him But he sent him away saying thirty nine Return into thy house and relate how great things God did for thee And he departed and published through the whole city how great things Jesus did for him forty And it came to pass when Jesus returned that the multitude received him for they were all waiting for him forty one And behold there came a man whose name was Jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and falling at the feet of Jesus he besought him that he would come into his house forty two for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age and she was dying And as he went the multitudes thronged him forty three And a woman having a flow of blood twelve years who had spent all her living on physicians and could not be healed by any one forty four came up behind and touched the fringe of his garment and immediately her flow of blood ceased forty five And Jesus said Who is it that touched me And when all denied it Peter and those with him said Master the multitudes throng thee and press thee and sayest thou Who is it that touched me forty six And Jesus said Some one touched me for I perceived that power has gone out from me forty seven And the woman seeing that she was not concealed came trembling and falling down before him declared before all the people for what cause she touched him and how she was healed immediately forty eight And he said to her Daughter thy faith has made thee whole go in peace forty nine While he was yet speaking there comes one from the ruler of the synagogue s house saying to him Thy daughter is dead trouble not the Teacher fifty But Jesus hearing it answered him Fear not only believe and she shall be restored fifty one And entering into the house he suffered no one to go in with him save Peter and James and John and the father of the maiden and the mother fifty two And all were weeping and bewailing her And he said Weep not she is not dead but is sleeping fifty three And they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead fifty four And he taking hold of her by the hand called saying Maiden arise fifty five And her spirit returned and she immediately arose and he commanded that food should be given her fifty six And her parents were astonished But he charged them to tell no one what was done IX AND having called the twelve together he gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases two And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick three And he said to them Take nothing for the journey neither staff nor bag nor bread nor money nor have two coats apiece four And into whatever house ye enter there abide and thence depart five And whoever will not receive you when ye go out from that city shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them six And going forth they went through the villages publishing the good news and healing everywhere seven And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things that were done And he was perplexed because it was said by some John has risen from the dead eight and by some Elijah has appeared and by others One of the old prophets has risen again nine And Herod said John I beheaded but who is this of whom I hear such things And he desired to see him ten And the apostles returning related to him all that they did And taking them with him he retired privately to a city called Bethsaida eleven And the multitudes when they knew it followed him And receiving them he spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God and healed those who had need of healing twelve And the day began to decline And the twelve came and said to him Dismiss the multitude that they may go into the villages around and the fields and lodge and find food for here we are in a desert place thirteen And he said to them Do ye give them to eat And they said We have not more than five loaves and two fishes except we should go and buy food for all this people fourteen For they were about five thousand men And he said to his disciples Make them lie down in companies of fifty fifteen And they did so and made them all lie down sixteen And taking the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed them and broke and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude seventeen And they ate and were all filled And there were taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets eighteen And it came to pass as he was alone praying that his disciples were with him and he asked them saying Who do the multitudes say that I am nineteen They answering said John the Immerser and others Elijah and others that one of the old prophets has risen again twenty And he said to them But who do ye say that I am Peter answering said The Christ of God twenty one And strictly charging them he commanded them to say this to no one twenty two saying The Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected on the part of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and rise on the third day twenty three And he said to all If any one will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me twenty four For whoever will save his life shall lose it and whoever may lose his life for my sake the same shall save it twenty five For what is a man profited when he has gained the whole world and lost or forfeited himself twenty six For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his glory and in that of the Father and of the holy angels twenty seven And I say to you of a truth there are some of those standing here who shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God twenty eight And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings that he took with him Peter and John and James and went up into the mountain to pray twenty nine And it came to pass while he was praying that the appearance of his countenance became changed and his raiment white and glistening thirty And behold two men were talking with him who were Moses and Elijah thirty one who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem thirty two But Peter and they who were with him were heavy with sleep and awaking they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him thirty three And it came to pass that as they were departing from him Peter said to Jesus Master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tents one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elijah not knowing what he said thirty four While he said this there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud thirty five And there came a voice out of the cloud saying This is my chosen Son hear ye him thirty six And when the voice had come Jesus was found alone And they kept silent and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen thirty seven And it came to pass on the next day when they had come down from the mountain that a great multitude met him thirty eight And behold a man from the multitude cried saying Teacher I beseech thee look upon my son for he is my only child thirty nine And behold a spirit takes him and he suddenly cries out and it tears him with foaming and hardly departs from him bruising him forty And I entreated thy disciples to cast him out and they could not forty one And Jesus answering said O faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you and bear with you Bring hither thy son forty two And while he was yet coming the demon threw him down and tore him And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and gave him back to his father forty three And all were amazed at the mighty power of God But while all were wondering at all things which Jesus did he said to his disciples forty four Do ye let these words sink into your ears for the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men forty five But they understood not this saying and it was hidden from them that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him concerning that saying forty six And there arose in them the thought nine forty six which of them was greatest forty seven And Jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and placed it by him forty eight and said to them Whoever shall receive this child in my name receives me and whoever shall receive me receives him who sent me for he that is least among you all the same is great forty nine And John answering said Master we saw one casting out demons in thy name and we forbade him because he follows not with us fifty And Jesus said to him Forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us fifty one And it came to pass when the days were being completed that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem fifty two And he sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him fifty three And they did not receive him because his face was directed toward Jerusalem fifty four And his disciples James and John seeing it said Lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them as also Elijah did fifty five And he turned and rebuked them and said Ye know not nine fifty five of what spirit ye are fifty six And they went to another village fifty seven And as they were going in the way a certain one said to him I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest fifty eight And Jesus said to him The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the Son of man has not where to lay his head fifty nine And he said to another Follow me But he said Lord permit me first to go and bury my father sixty And he said to him Let the dead bury their own dead but do thou go and announce the kingdom of God sixty one And another also said I will follow thee Lord but first permit me to bid farewell to those in my house sixty two And Jesus said to him No one having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God X AFTER these things the Lord appointed also seventy others and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself was about to come two And he said to them The harvest indeed is great but the laborers are few Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest three Go your ways behold I send you forth as lambs among wolves four Carry neither purse nor bag nor sandals and salute no one by the way five And into whatever house ye enter first say Peace be to this house six And if a son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it and if not it shall return to you seven And in that house remain eating and drinking such things as they give ten seven for the laborer is worthy of his hire Go not from house to house eight And into whatever city ye enter and they receive you eat what is set before you nine and heal the sick that are therein and say to them The kingdom of God has come nigh unto you ten But into whatever city ye enter and they receive you not go out into the streets of the same and say eleven Even the dust of your city that cleaves to our feet we wipe off to you ten eleven yet know this that the kingdom of God has come nigh twelve I say to you that it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city thirteen Woe to thee Chorazin Woe to thee Bethsaida For if the miracles had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you they would long ago have repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes fourteen But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you fifteen And thou Capernaum that art exalted to heaven shalt be brought down to the underworld sixteen He that hears you hears me and he that rejects you rejects me and he that rejects me rejects him who sent me seventeen And the seventy returned with joy saying Lord even the demons are subjected to us in thy name eighteen And he said to them I beheld Satan fall as lightning from heaven nineteen Behold I have given you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall hurt you twenty But yet rejoice not in this that the spirits are subjected to you but rejoice that your names are written in heaven twenty one In that hour he rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of heaven and earth that thou didst hide these things from the wise and discerning and reveal them to babes yea O Father that so it seemed good in thy sight twenty two All things were delivered to me by my Father and no one knows who the Son is but the Father and who the Father is but the Son and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal him twenty three And turning to the disciples he said privately Happy are the eyes that behold what ye are beholding twenty four For I say to you that many prophets and kings desired to see what ye are beholding and saw not and to hear what ye are hearing and heard not twenty five And behold a certain lawyer stood up tempting him saying Teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal life twenty six He said to him What is written in the law How readest thou twenty seven And he answering said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself twenty eight And he said to him Thou answeredst rightly This do and thou shalt live twenty nine But he desiring to justify himself said to Jesus Who then is my neighbor thirty And Jesus answering said A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers who stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead thirty one And by chance a certain priest was going down that way and seeing him he passed by on the other side thirty two And in like manner also a Levite arriving at the place came and saw and passed by on the other side thirty three And a certain Samaritan as he was journeying came where he was and seeing him had compassion thirty four and coming to him bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and setting him on his own beast he brought him to an inn and took care of him thirty five And on the morrow when he departed he took out two denaries ten thirty five and gave to the host and said Take care of him and whatever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee thirty six Which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbor to him that fell among the robbers thirty seven And he said He that had mercy on him And Jesus said to him Go and do thou likewise thirty eight And it came to pass as they were going that he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house thirty nine And she had a sister called Mary who also sat at the feet of Jesus and heard his word forty But Martha was encumbered with much serving and she came to him and said Lord dost thou not care that my sister left me to serve alone Bid her therefore that she help me forty one And Jesus answering said to her Martha Martha thou art anxious and troubled about many things forty two But one thing is needful and Mary chose the good part which shall not be taken away from her XI AND it came to pass that as he was in a certain place praying when he ceased one of his disciples said to him Lord teach us to pray as also John taught his disciples two And he said to them When ye pray say Father hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come three Give us day by day our daily bread eleven three four And forgive us our sins for we ourselves forgive every one indebted to us And bring us not into temptation five And he said to them Who of you shall have a friend and shall go to him at midnight and say to him six Friend lend me three loaves for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey and I have nothing to set before him seven and he from within shall answer and say Trouble me not the door is already shut and my children with me are in bed I can not rise and give thee eight I say to you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needs nine I also say to you Ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened to you ten For every one that asks receives and he that seeks finds and to him that knocks it shall be opened eleven And what father is there among you of whom if his son ask bread he will give him a stone or a fish will instead of a fish give him a serpent twelve Or if he shall ask an egg will he give him a scorpion thirteen If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him fourteen And he was casting out a demon and it was dumb And it came to pass when the demon was gone out that the dumb man spoke and the multitudes wondered fifteen But some of them said He casts out the demons through Beelzebul the prince of the demons sixteen And others tempting sought of him a sign from heaven seventeen But he knowing their thoughts said to them Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house divided against a house falls eleven seventeen eighteen And if Satan also is divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand because ye say that I cast out the demons through Beelzebul nineteen And if I through Beelzebul cast out the demons through whom do your sons cast them out Therefore they shall be your judges twenty But if with the finger of God I cast out the demons then is the kingdom of God come near to you twenty one When a strong man armed keeps his palace his goods are in peace twenty two But when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he takes away his whole armor wherein he trusted and divides his spoils twenty three He that is not with me is against me and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad twenty four When the unclean spirit is gone out from the man he goes through dry places seeking rest and not finding it he says I will return into my house whence I came out twenty five And coming he finds it swept and set in order twenty six Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first twenty seven And it came to pass as he was saying these things that a certain woman lifting up her voice from the multitude said to him Happy the womb that bore thee and breasts which thou didst suck twenty eight And he said Yea rather Happy they who hear the word of God and keep it twenty nine And the multitudes gathering more and more he began to say This generation is an evil generation It seeks a sign and no sign shall be given it but the sign of Jonah thirty For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites so shall also the Son of man be to this generation thirty one A queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them because she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here thirty two Men of Nineveh will rise in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here thirty three No one having lighted a lamp puts it in a secret place or under the bushel but on the lamp stand that they who come in may see the light thirty four The lamp of the body is thine eye When thine eye is single thy whole body also is light but when it is evil thy body also is dark thirty five Take heed therefore lest the light that is in thee is darkness eleven thirty five thirty six If therefore thy whole body is light having no part dark it shall be all light as when the lamp with its bright shining gives thee light thirty seven And as he was speaking a Pharisee asked him to dine with him and he went in and reclined at table thirty eight And the Pharisee seeing it wondered that he did not first immerse himself before dinner thirty nine And the Lord said to him Now ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter but your inward part is full of rapacity and wickedness forty Fools Did not he who made the outside make the inside also forty one But give that which ye have in alms eleven forty one and behold all things are clean to you forty two But woe to you Pharisees because ye pay tithe of mint and rue and every herb and pass by judgment and the love of God These ought ye to have done and not leave those undone forty three Woe to you Pharisees because ye love the first seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the markets forty four Woe to you because ye are as tombs that appear not and men walking over them know it not forty five And a certain one of the lawyers answering says to him Teacher in saying these things thou reproachest us also forty six And he said Woe to you lawyers also because ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers forty seven Woe to you because ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and your fathers killed them forty eight So then ye bear witness to and approve the deeds of your fathers because they indeed killed them and ye build their sepulchres eleven forty eight forty nine Therefore also said the wisdom of God I will send them prophets and apostles and some of them they will slay and persecute fifty that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation fifty one from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah who perished between the altar and the temple Verily I say to you it shall be required of this generation fifty two Woe to you lawyers because ye took away the key of knowledge ye entered not in yourselves and those who were entering in ye hindered fifty three And as he said these things to them the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently and to provoke him to speak of many things eleven fifty three fifty four lying in wait for him seeking to catch something out of his mouth that they might accuse him XII IN the mean time the multitude having gathered together in tens of thousands so that they trod one upon another he began first to say to his disciples Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy two For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed nor hidden that shall not be known three Wherefore whatever ye said in the darkness shall be heard in the light and what ye spoke in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed on the house tops four And I say to you my friends be not afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do five But I will warn you whom ye shall fear fear him who after he has killed has power to cast into hell yea I say to you fear him six Are not five sparrows sold for two pence And not one of them is forgotten before God seven But even the hairs of your head are all numbered Fear not ye are of more value than many sparrows eight And I say to you Every one that shall acknowledge me before men him will the Son of man also acknowledge before the angels of God nine but he that denied me before men shall be denied before the angels of God ten And every one that shall speak a word against the Son of man it will be forgiven him but to him that blasphemes against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven eleven And when they bring you to the synagogues and magistrates and authorities take not thought how or what ye shall answer or what ye shall say twelve For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say thirteen And a certain one of the multitude said to him Teacher speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me fourteen And he said to him Man who made me a judge or a divider over you fifteen And he said to them Take heed and beware of all covetousness because a man s life consists not in the abundance of his possessions sixteen And he spoke a parable to them saying The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully seventeen And he thought within himself saying What shall I do because I have not where to store my fruits eighteen And he said This will I do I will pull down my barns and will build greater and there I will store all my fruits and my goods nineteen And I will say to my soul Soul thou hast many goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink be merry twenty But God said to him Fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee and whose shall those things be which thou didst provide twenty one So is he that lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God twenty two And he said to his disciples Therefore I say to you take not thought for the life what ye shall eat nor for the body what ye shall put on twenty three The life is more than food and the body than raiment twenty four Consider the ravens that they sow not nor reap which have neither storehouse nor barn and God feeds them How much better are ye than the birds twenty five And which of you by taking thought can add a cubit to his stature twelve twenty five twenty six If therefore ye can not do even that which is least why take ye thought for the rest twenty seven Consider the lilies how they grow they toil not nor spin and I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these twenty eight And if God so clothes the grass which to day is in the field and to morrow is cast into the oven how much more you ye of little faith twenty nine And ye seek not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink and be not of a doubtful mind thirty For all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your Father knows that ye have need of these thirty one But seek his kingdom and these things shall be added to you thirty two Fear not little flock for it is your Father s good pleasure to give you the kingdom thirty three Sell what ye have and give alms provide yourselves purses that wax not old a treasure unfailing in the heavens where a thief approaches not nor moth corrupts thirty four For where your treasure is there will your heart be also thirty five Let your loins be girded about and your lamps burning thirty six and ye like men waiting for their lord when he shall return from the wedding that when he comes and knocks they may open to him immediately thirty seven Happy those servants whom their lord when he comes shall find watching Verily I say to you that he will gird himself and make them recline at table and will come forth and serve them thirty eight And if he shall come in the second watch or in the third watch and find it so happy are those servants thirty nine And this know that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief is coming he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through forty Be ye also ready for at an hour when ye think not the Son of man comes forty one And Peter said to him Lord speakest thou this parable to us or also to all forty two And the Lord said Who then is the faithful the wise steward whom his lord will set over his household to give the portion of food in due season forty three Happy that servant whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing forty four Of a truth I say to you that he will make him ruler over all his goods forty five But if that servant say in his heart My lord delays his coming and shall begin to beat the men servants and maidservants and to eat and drink and to be drunken forty six the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looks not for it and in an hour when he is not aware and will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the faithless forty seven And that servant who knew his lord s will and prepared not nor did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes forty eight but he that knew not and did things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few For to whomsoever much was given of him much will be required and to whom they committed much of him they will require the more forty nine I came to send fire upon the earth and what will I if it is already kindled twelve forty nine fifty But I have an immersion to undergo and how am I straitened till it be accomplished fifty one Suppose ye that I came to give peace in the earth I tell you nay but only division fifty two For from this time forth five in one house will be divided three against two and two against three fifty three They will be divided father against son and son against father mother against the daughter and daughter against the mother mother in law against her daughter in law and daughter in law against the mother in law fifty four And he said also to the multitudes When ye see the cloud rising from the west straightway ye say A shower is coming and so it comes to pass fifty five And when ye see a south wind blowing ye say There will be heat and it comes to pass fifty six Hypocrites Ye know how to judge of the face of the earth and the sky but how is it that ye know not how to judge of this time fifty seven And why even of yourselves do ye not judge what is right fifty eight For when thou art going with thine adversary to the magistrate on the way give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him lest he drag thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the exactor and the exactor cast thee into prison fifty nine I say to thee thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last mite XIII THERE were present at that season some who brought him word concerning the Galilaeans whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices two And answering he said to them Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans because they have suffered such things three I tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all in like manner perish four Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and slew them suppose ye that they were sinners above all the men who dwell in Jerusalem five I tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all in like manner perish six He spoke also this parable A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came seeking fruit thereon and found none seven And he said to the vine dresser Behold three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none Cut it down why does it also encumber thirteen seven the ground eight And he answering says to him Lord let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it and cast in manure nine And if it bear fruit and if not hereafter thou shalt cut it down thirteen nine ten And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath eleven And behold there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and wholly unable to raise herself up twelve And Jesus seeing her called her to him and said to her Woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity thirteen And he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified God fourteen And the ruler of the synagogue answering being indignant because Jesus healed on the sabbath said to the multitude There are six days in which it is proper to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath fifteen And the Lord answered him and said Hypocrites Does not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or ass from the manger and lead him away to water him sixteen And ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound lo eighteen years to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath seventeen And as he said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him eighteen He said therefore To what is the kingdom of God like And to what shall I liken it nineteen It is like to a grain of mustard which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and became a great tree and the birds of the air lodged in its branches twenty And again he said To what shall I liken the kingdom of God twenty one It is like to leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened twenty two And he went through cities and villages teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem twenty three And a certain one said to him Lord are there few that are saved twenty four And he said to them Strive to enter in through the strait gate for many I say to you will seek to enter in and will not be able twenty five When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying Lord open to us and he answering shall say to you I know you not whence ye are twenty six then will ye begin to say We ate and drank in thy presence and thou didst teach in our streets twenty seven And he will say I tell you I know not whence ye are depart from me all workers of unrighteousness twenty eight There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and yourselves thrust out twenty nine And they will come from east and west and from north and south and will recline at table in the kingdom of God thirty And behold there are last who will be first and there are first who will be last thirty one On that day there came certain Pharisees saying to him Depart and go hence for Herod desires to kill thee thirty two And he said to them Go tell that fox Behold I cast out demons and perform cures to day and to morrow and the third day I am perfected thirty three But yet I must go to day and to morrow and the day following because it may not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem thirty four Jerusalem Jerusalem that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen her brood under her wings and ye would not thirty five Behold your house is left to you desolate And I say to you Ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord XIV AND it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the chief of the Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath that they watched him two And behold there was a certain man before him who had the dropsy three And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees saying Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath or not And they were silent four And taking hold of him he healed him and let him go five And to them he said Who is there of you whose ox or ass fourteen five shall fall into a pit and he will not straightway draw him up on the sabbath day six And they could not answer him again to these things seven And he spoke a parable to those who were bidden when he marked how they chose out the first places saying to them eight When thou art bidden by any one to a wedding recline not in the first place at table lest one more honorable than thou may have been bidden by him nine and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee Give place to this man and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place ten But when thou art bidden go and recline in the lowest place that when he that bade thee comes he may say to thee Friend go up higher Then shalt thou have honor in the presence of those who recline at table with thee eleven For every one that exalts himself shall be humbled and he that humbles himself shall be exalted twelve And he said also to him who bade him When thou makest a dinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brothers nor thy kinsmen nor rich neighbors lest they also bid thee again and a recompense be made thee thirteen But when thou makest a feast call the poor the maimed the lame the blind fourteen And happy shalt thou be because they can not recompense thee for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the righteous fifteen And a certain one of those who reclined at table with him hearing these things said to him Happy is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God sixteen And he said to him A certain man made a great supper and bade many seventeen And he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to those who were bidden Come for all things are now ready eighteen And they all with one mind began fourteen eighteen to excuse themselves The first said to him I bought a piece of ground and I must needs go out and see it I pray thee let me be excused nineteen And another said I bought five yoke of oxen and I am going to make trial of them I pray thee let me be excused twenty And another said I married a wife and therefore I can not come twenty one And the servant came and reported these things to his lord Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and maimed and lame and blind twenty two And the servant said Lord it is done as thou didst command and yet there is room twenty three And the Lord said to the servant Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them fourteen twenty three to come in that my house may be filled twenty four for I say to you that none of those men who were bidden shall taste of my supper twenty five And great multitudes were going with him and turning he said to them twenty six If any one comes to me and hates not his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters and even his own life besides he can not be my disciple twenty seven And whoever does not bear his cross and come after me can not be my disciple twenty eight For who of you intending to build a tower does not first sit down and count the cost whether he has sufficient to finish it twenty nine Lest haply when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish all that behold begin to mock him thirty saying This man began to build and was not able to finish thirty one Or what king going to make war against another king does not first sit down and consult whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand thirty two Else while he is yet a great way off he sends an embassy and desires conditions of peace thirty three So then whoever of you forsakes not all that he has can not be my disciple thirty four Salt therefore is good but if even the salt has become tasteless wherewith shall it be seasoned thirty five It is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill they cast it out He that has ears to hear let him hear XV AND there were drawing near to him all the publicans and the sinners to hear him two And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured saying This man receives sinners and eats with them three And he spoke this parable to them saying four What man of you having a hundred sheep and having lost one of them does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he finds it five And having found it he lays it on his shoulders rejoicing six And coming home he calls together his friends and neighbors saying to them Rejoice with me because I found my sheep which was lost seven I say to you that so there will be joy in heaven over one sinner that repents more than over ninety and nine just persons who have no need of repentance eight Or what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully till she finds it nine And having found it she calls her friends and neighbors together saying Rejoice with me because I found the piece which I lost ten So I say to you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents eleven And he said A certain man had two sons twelve And the younger of them said to his father Father give me the portion of the property that falls to me And he divided to them his living thirteen And not many days after the younger son gathered all together and went abroad into a far country and there wasted his substance in riotous living fourteen And when he had spent all there arose a grievous famine in that country and he began to be in want fifteen And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine sixteen And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks which the swine ate and no one gave to him seventeen And coming to himself he said How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare and I perish here with hunger eighteen I will arise and go to my father and will say to him Father I sinned against heaven and before thee nineteen I am no longer worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants twenty And he arose and came to his father But when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him twenty one And the son said to him Father I sinned against heaven and before thee I am no longer worthy to be called thy son twenty two But the father said to his servants Bring forth a robe the best and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet twenty three and bring the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry twenty four Because this my son was dead and is alive again was lost and is found And they began to be merry twenty five Now his elder son was in the field And as he came and drew near to the house he heard music and dancing twenty six And calling to him one of the servants he inquired what these things meant twenty seven And he said to him Thy brother is come and thy father killed the fatted calf because he received him back safe and sound twenty eight And he was angry and would not go in and his father came out and entreated him twenty nine And he answering said to his father Lo so many years do I serve thee and never transgressed thy command and to me thou never gayest a kid that I might make merry with my friends thirty But when this thy son came who devoured thy living with harlots thou didst kill for him the fatted calf thirty one And he said to him Child thou art ever with me and all that I have is thine thirty two It was meet that we should make merry and be glad because this thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found XVI AND he said also to the disciples There was a certain rich man who had a steward and the same was accused to him as wasting his goods two And having called him he said to him What is this that I hear of thee Give account of thy stewardship for thou canst be no longer steward three And the steward said within himself What shall I do for my master takes away from me the stewardship I am not able to dig to beg I am ashamed four I am resolved what to do that when I am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses five And having called to him each one of his master s debtors he said to the first How much owest thou to my master six And he said A hundred measures of oil And he said to him Take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty seven Then he said to another And how much owest thou And he said A hundred measures of wheat And he said to him Take thy bill and write fourscore eight And the master commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely because the sons of this world are in their generation wiser than the sons of light nine And I say to you Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness that when it fails they may receive you into the everlasting habitations ten He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much eleven If therefore ye were not faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will entrust to you the true riches twelve And if ye were not faithful in that which is another s who will give to you your own thirteen No servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will hold to one and despise the other Ye can not serve God and Mammon fourteen And the Pharisees also who were covetous heard all these things and they derided him fifteen And he said to them Ye are they who justify themselves before men but God knows your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination before God sixteen The law and the prophets were until John from that time the good news of the kingdom of God is published and every man presses into it seventeen And it is easier that heaven and earth should pass away than that one tittle of the law should fail eighteen Every one who puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery and he who marries her when put away from a husband commits adultery nineteen There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day twenty And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus who was laid at his gate full of sores twenty one and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man s table Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores twenty two And it came to pass that the beggar died and he was borne away by the angels into Abraham s bosom The rich man also died and was buried twenty three and in the underworld lifting up his eyes being in torments he sees Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom twenty four And he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this flame twenty five But Abraham said Child remember that in thy lifetime thou receivedst thy good things in full and Lazarus in like manner his evil things but now here he is comforted and thou art tormented twenty six And besides all this between us and you a great gulf is fixed that they who would pass from hence to you may not be able nor those from thence pass over to us twenty seven And he said I pray thee therefore father that thou wouldst send him to my father s house twenty eight For I have five brothers that he may testify to them that they may not also come into this place of torment twenty nine Abraham says to him They have Moses and the prophets let them hear them thirty And he said Nay father Abraham but if one should go to them from the dead they will repent thirty one And he said to him If they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one should rise from the dead XVII AND he said to his disciples It is impossible that causes of offense should not come but woe to him through whom they come two It were better for him that a mill stone were placed about his neck and he were thrown into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to offend three Take heed to yourselves If thy brother sin rebuke him and if he repent forgive him four And if he sin against thee seven times in the day and seven times turn to thee saying I repent thou shalt forgive him five And the apostles said to the Lord Increase our faith six And the Lord said If ye had faith as a grain of mustard ye would say to this sycamine tree Be thou plucked up by the root and planted in the sea and it would have obeyed you seven And who of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say to him immediately when he has come in from the field Come and recline at table eight and will not rather say to him Make ready wherewith I may sup and gird thyself and serve me till I have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink nine Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded I think not ten So also ye when ye shall have done all the things that were commanded you say We are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do eleven And it came to pass as he was going to Jerusalem that he went through the midst of Samaria and Galilee twelve And as he was entering into a certain village there met him ten leprous men who stood afar off thirteen And they lifted up their voice saying Jesus Master have mercy on us fourteen And seeing it he said to them Go show yourselves to the priests And it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed fifteen And one of them seeing that he was healed turned back with a loud voice glorifying God sixteen and fell down on his face at his feet giving thanks to him and he was a Samaritan seventeen And Jesus answering said Were not the ten cleansed And where are the nine eighteen Were none found returning to give glory to God except this stranger nineteen And he said to him Arise and go thy faith has made thee whole twenty And being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come he answered them and said The kingdom of God comes not with observation twenty one nor shall they say Lo here or Lo there for behold the kingdom of God is within you seventeen twenty one twenty two And he said to the disciples Days will come when ye will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man and ye will not see it twenty three And they will say to you See here or See there go not away and follow not twenty four For as the lightning that lightens out of the one part under heaven shines unto the other part under heaven so will the Son of man be in his day twenty five But first he must suffer many things and be rejected on the part of this generation twenty six And as it was in the days of Noah so will it be also in the days of the Son of man twenty seven They ate they drank they married they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed all twenty eight In like manner also as it was in the days of Lot they ate they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded twenty nine but the same day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed all thirty After the same manner will it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed thirty one In that day he who shall be on the house top and his goods in the house let him not come down to take them away and he that is in the field let him likewise not turn back thirty two Remember Lot s wife thirty three Whoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whoever may lose his life shall preserve it thirty four I say to you in that night there will be two men in one bed one will be taken and the other will be left thirty five Two women will be grinding together one will be taken and the other left thirty seven And they answering say to him Where Lord And he said to them Where the body is there also will the eagles be gathered together XVIII AND he spoke also a parable to them to the end that they ought always to pray and not to faint two saying There was in a certain city a certain judge who feared not God nor regarded man three And there was a widow in that city and she came to him saying Avenge me of my adversary four And he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself Though I fear not God nor regard man five yet because this widow troubles me I will avenge her lest continually coming she weary me six And the Lord said Hear what the unjust judge says seven And will not God avenge his chosen who cry to him day and night though he is long suffering in respect to them eight I say to you that he will avenge them speedily But yet when the Son of man comes will he find faith on the earth nine And he spoke this parable to some who trust in themselves that they are righteous and despise others ten Two men went up into the temple to pray one a Pharisee and the other a publican eleven The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I am not as other men extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican twelve I fast twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possess eighteen twelve thirteen And the publican standing afar off would not even lift up his eyes to heaven but smote upon his breast saying God be merciful to me the sinner fourteen I say to you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other For every one that exalts himself shall be humbled and he that humbles himself shall be exalted fifteen And they brought to him also infants that he might touch them and the disciples seeing it rebuked them sixteen But Jesus calling them to him said Suffer the little children to come to me and forbid them not for to such belongs the kingdom of God seventeen Verily I say to you whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall not enter therein eighteen And a certain ruler asked him saying Good Teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal life nineteen And Jesus said to him Why dost thou call me good None is good save one God twenty Thou knowest the commandments Do not commit adultery Do not kill Do not steal Do not bear false witness Honor thy father and thy mother twenty one And he said All these I kept from my youth twenty two And Jesus hearing it said to him Yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me twenty three And hearing this he became very sorrowful for he was exceedingly rich twenty four And Jesus seeing him became very sorrowful said How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God twenty five For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God twenty six And they who heard it said And who can be saved twenty seven And he said The things that are impossible with men are possible with God twenty eight And Peter said Lo we forsook all and followed thee twenty nine And he said to them Verily I say to you there is no one that forsook house or parents or brothers or wife or children for the sake of the kingdom of God thirty who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting thirty one And taking with him the twelve he said to them Behold we are going up to Jerusalem and all the things written by the prophets for the Son of man shall be accomplished thirty two For he will be delivered to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon thirty three and they will scourge him and put him to death and on the third day he will rise again thirty four And they understood none of these things and this saying was hidden from them and they knew not the things that were said thirty five And it came to pass that as he came near to Jericho a certain blind man was sitting by the way side begging thirty six And hearing a multitude passing by he inquired what this was thirty seven And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth is passing by thirty eight And he called aloud saying Jesus Son of David have mercy on me thirty nine And they who went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace But he cried much the more Son of David have mercy on me forty And Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to him And when he was come near he asked him forty one saying What wilt thou that I shall do to thee And he said Lord that I may receive sight forty two And Jesus said to him Receive sight thy faith has made thee whole forty three And immediately he received sight and followed him glorifying God And all the people seeing it gave praise to God XIX AND having entered in he was passing through Jericho two And behold there was a man named Zaccheus and he was a chief publican and this man was rich three And he sought to see Jesus who he was and he could not on account of the multitude because he was small in stature four And running before he climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him because by that way he was to pass through five And Jesus when he came to the place looked up and saw him and said to him Zaccheus make haste and come down for to day I must abide at thy house six And he made haste and came down and received him joyfully seven And seeing it they all murmured saying that he went in to be a guest with a sinner eight And Zaccheus stood up and said to the Lord Behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I took aught from any one by false accusation I restore fourfold nine And Jesus said to him This day is salvation come to this house inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham ten For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost eleven And as they were hearing these things he added and spoke a parable because he was nigh to Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear twelve He said therefore A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return thirteen And having called his ten servants he gave them ten pounds and said to them Traffic till I come fourteen But his citizens hated him and sent an embassy after him saying We will not have this man to reign over us fifteen And it came to pass when he had returned having received the kingdom that he commanded these servants to be called to him to whom he gave the money that he might know what each gained by trading sixteen And the first came saying Lord thy pound gained ten pounds seventeen And he said to him Well done good servant because thou wast faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities eighteen And the second came saying Lord thy pound made five pounds nineteen And he said also to this man And be thou over five cities twenty And another came saying Lord behold thy pound which I kept laid up in a napkin twenty one For I feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest up what thou layedst not down and reapest what thou didst not sow twenty two And he says to him Out of thy mouth will I judge thee wicked servant Thou knewest that I was an austere man taking up what I laid not down and reaping what I did not sow twenty three Why then didst thou not put my money into the bank and I at my coming should have required it with interest twenty four And he said to those standing by Take from him the pound and give it to him that has the ten pounds twenty five And they said to him Lord he has ten pounds twenty six For I say to you that to every one that has shall be given and from him that has not even what he has shall be taken away twenty seven But those my enemies who would not that I should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me twenty eight And having spoken these things he went before going up to Jerusalem twenty nine And it came to pass as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the mount called Olivet that he sent forth two of his disciples thirty saying Go into the opposite village in which as ye are entering ye will find a colt tied whereon no man ever sat loose and bring him thirty one And if any one ask you why do ye loose him thus shall ye say to him Because the Lord has need of him thirty two And they that were sent forth departed and found even as he said to them thirty three And as they were loosing the colt its owners said to them Why loose ye the colt thirty four And they said The Lord has need of him thirty five And they brought him to Jesus and having cast their garments upon the colt they set Jesus thereon thirty six And as he went they spread their garments in the way thirty seven And as he was drawing near just at the descent of the mount of the Olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles which they saw thirty eight saying Blessed be the King who comes in the name of the Lord Peace in heaven and glory in the highest thirty nine And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him Teacher rebuke thy disciples forty And answering he said to them I tell you that if these shall hold their peace the stones will cry out forty one And when he came near as he saw the city he wept over it forty two saying If even thou hadst known at least in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace But now they are hidden from thine eyes forty three For days will come upon thee that thine enemies will cast up a mound about thee and compass thee round and shut thee in on every side forty four and will level thee with the ground and thy children within thee and will not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation forty five And entering into the temple he began to cast out those who sold forty six saying to them It is written And my house shall be a house of prayer but ye made it a den of robbers forty seven And he was teaching daily in the temple and the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people were seeking to destroy him forty eight and could not find what they might do for all the people hung listening upon him XX AND it came to pass on one of the days as he was teaching the people in the temple and publishing the good news that the chief priests and the scribes came to him with the elders two and spoke to him saying Tell us by what authority doest thou these things Or who is he that gave thee this authority three And he answering said to them I also will ask you one thing and tell it me four John s immersion was it from heaven or from men five And they reasoned with themselves saying If we say From heaven he will say Why then did ye not believe him six But if we say From men all the people will stone us for they are persuaded that John was a prophet seven And they answered that they knew not whence it was eight And Jesus said to them Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these things nine And he began to speak to the people this parable A man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen and went abroad for a long time ten And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty eleven And again he sent another servant and him also having beaten and treated him shamefully they sent away empty twelve And again he sent a third and they wounded him also and cast him out thirteen And the lord of the vineyard said What shall I do I will send my beloved son perhaps seeing him they will reverence him fourteen But when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselves saying This is the heir come let us kill him that the inheritance may become ours fifteen So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them sixteen He will come and destroy these husbandmen and will give the vineyard to others And hearing it they said Far be it seventeen And he looking on them said What then is this that is written The stone which the builders disallowed The same is become the head of the corner eighteen Every one that falls upon that stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder nineteen And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that hour and they feared the people for they knew that he spoke this parable against them twenty And watching him twenty twenty they sent forth spies feigning themselves to be just men that they might take hold of his words in order to deliver him up to the magistracy and to the authority of the governor twenty one And they asked him saying Teacher we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly and regardest not the person of any but teachest the way of God truly twenty two Is it lawful that we should give tribute to Caesar or not twenty three And perceiving their craftiness he said to them twenty four Show me a denary twenty twenty four Whose image and inscription has it And answering they said Caesar s twenty five And he said to them Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar s and to God the things that are God s twenty six And they could not take hold of his words before the people and they marveled at his answer and held their peace twenty seven And some of the Sadducees who deny that there is a resurrection coming to him asked him twenty eight saying Teacher Moses wrote to us if a man s brother die having a wife and he die childless that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother twenty nine There were therefore seven brothers and the first took a wife and died childless thirty and the second and the third took her thirty one and in like manner also the seven left no children and died thirty two At last the woman also died thirty three In the resurrection therefore of which of them is she wife For the seven had her for a wife thirty four And Jesus answering said to them The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage thirty five But they who are accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage thirty six for neither can they die any more for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God being sons of the resurrection thirty seven Now that the dead are raised even Moses showed at The Bush when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob thirty eight For he is not a God of the dead but of the living for to him all live thirty nine And some of the scribes answering said Teacher thou saidst well forty For they no longer dared to ask him any question forty one And he said to them How say they that the Christ is son of David forty two And David himself says in the book of Psalms The LORD said to my Lord Sit on my right hand forty three Till I make thine enemies thy footstool forty four David therefore calls him Lord and how is he his son forty five And in the hearing of all the multitude he said to his disciples forty six Beware of the scribes who desire to go about in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the first seats in the synagogues and the first places at feasts forty seven who devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers These shall receive greater condemnation XXI AND looking up he saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury two And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites three And he said Of a truth I say to you that this poor widow cast in more than all four For all these out of their abundance cast into the offerings but she out of her want cast in all the living that she had five And as some were saying of the temple that it has been adorned with beautiful stones and offerings he said six As for these things which ye behold days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down seven And they asked him saying Teacher when therefore will these things be and what will be the sign when these things are about to come to pass eight And he said Take heed that ye be not led astray For many will come in my name saying I am he and the time is at hand Go not after them nine And when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is not immediately ten Then said he to them Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom eleven and there will be great earthquakes and in divers places famines and pestilences and there will be great portents and signs from heaven twelve And before all these they will lay their hands on you and persecute you delivering you up into synagogues and prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my name s sake thirteen And it shall turn out to you for a testimony fourteen Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answer fifteen For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay or withstand sixteen And ye will be delivered up both by parents and brothers and kindred and friends and some of you they will cause to be put to death seventeen And ye will be hated by all for my name s sake eighteen And there shall not a hair of your head perish nineteen In your patience possess your souls twenty one nineteen twenty And when ye shall see Jerusalem encompassed by armies then know that its desolation is at hand twenty one Then let those in Judaea flee into the mountains and let those in the midst of it depart out and let those in the fields not enter into it twenty two Because these are the days of vengeance that all the things which are written may be fulfilled twenty three Woe to those who are with child and to those who give suck in those days For there shall be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people twenty four And they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all the nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled twenty five And there shall be signs in the sun and moon and stars and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and waves twenty six men s hearts failing them for fear and for looking for those things that are coming on the world for the powers of heaven shall be shaken twenty seven And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory twenty eight And when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption is drawing nigh twenty nine And he spoke to them a parable Behold the fig tree and all the trees thirty When they already shoot forth seeing it ye know of yourselves that the summer is already near thirty one So also ye when ye see these things coming to pass know that the kingdom of God is near thirty two Verily I say to you this generation shall not pass away till all shall have come to pass thirty three Heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away thirty four And take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and that day come upon you unawares thirty five For as a snare shall it come on all that dwell on the face of the whole earth thirty six And watch in every time praying that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of man thirty seven And in the daytime he was teaching in the temple and at night he went out and abode in the mount that is called Olivet thirty eight And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him XXII NOW the feast of unleavened bread was drawing near which is called the Passover two and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might kill him for they feared the people three And Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot being of the number of the twelve four And he went away and consulted with the chief priests and captains how he might deliver him up to them five And they were glad and covenanted to give him money six And he promised and sought opportunity to deliver him up to them in the absence of the multitude seven And the day of unleavened bread came when the passover must be killed eight And he sent away Peter and John saying Go and prepare us the passover that we may eat it nine And they said to him Where wilt thou that we prepare ten And he said to them Behold when ye have entered into the city there will meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him into the house where he enters in eleven And ye shall say to the master of the house The Teacher says to thee Where is the guestchamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples twelve And he will show you a large upper room furnished there make ready thirteen And they went away and found as he had said to them And they made ready the passover fourteen And when the hour came he reclined at table and the apostles with him fifteen And he said to them I earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer sixteen For I say to you I shall eat of it no more until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God seventeen And having received a cup he gave thanks and said Take this and divide it among yourselves eighteen For I say to you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come nineteen And taking a loaf he gave thanks and broke it and gave to them saying This is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me twenty And the cup in like manner after supper saying This cup is the new covenant in my blood which is shed for you twenty one But behold the hand of him that betrays me is with me on the table twenty two For the Son of man indeed goes as it was determined but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed twenty three And they began to inquire among themselves who then it might be that should do this thing twenty four And there arose also a contention among them which of them should be accounted the greatest twenty five And he said to them The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and they who exercise authority over them are called benefactors twenty six But ye are not so but let the greatest among you become as the younger and he that is chief as he that serves twenty seven For which is greater he that reclines at table or he that serves Is not he that reclines at table But I am in the midst of you as he that serves twenty eight Ye are they who have continued with me in my temptations twenty nine and I appoint to you a kingdom as my Father appointed to me thirty that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel thirty one And the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan asked for you to sift as the wheat thirty two But I prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and thou when thou hast turned strengthen thy brethren thirty three And he said to him Lord I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death thirty four And he said I say to thee Peter a cock will not crow this day till thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me thirty five And he said to them When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals lacked ye anything And they said Nothing thirty six Therefore said he to them But now he that has a purse let him take it and likewise a bag and he that has not let him sell his garment and buy a sword thirty seven For I say to you that yet this which is written must be accomplished in me And he was reckoned among transgressors for the things concerning me have an end twenty two thirty seven thirty eight And they said Lord behold here are two swords And he said It is enough thirty nine And going out he went as he was wont to the mount of the Olives and his disciples also followed him forty And when he was at the place he said to them Pray that ye enter not into temptation forty one And he withdrew from them about a stone s throw and kneeling down he prayed forty two saying Father if thou art willing to remove this cup from me Yet not my will but thine be done forty three And there appeared to him an angel from heaven strengthening him forty four And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground forty five And rising up from prayer and coming to the disciples he found them sleeping from sorrow forty six And he said to them Why sleep ye Arise and pray that ye enter not into temptation forty seven While he was yet speaking behold a multitude and he that was called Judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss him forty eight But Jesus said to him Judas betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss forty nine And they who were about him seeing what would follow said to him Lord shall we smite with the sword fifty And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest and took off his right ear fifty one And Jesus answering said Suffer thus far And he touched his ear and healed him fifty two And Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders who were come to him Have ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves fifty three When I was daily with you in the temple ye stretched not forth your hands against me But this is your hour and the power of darkness fifty four And they took him and led him away and brought him into the house of the high priest And Peter followed afar off fifty five And they having kindled a fire in the midst of the court and sat down together Peter sat down among them fifty six And a certain maid seeing him as he sat by the fire and looking intently upon him said This man also was with him fifty seven And he denied him saying Woman I do not know him fifty eight And after a little while another seeing him said Thou also art of them And Peter said Man I am not fifty nine And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed saying Of a truth this one also was with him for he is a Galilaean sixty And Peter said Man I know not what thou sayest And immediately while he was yet speaking a cock crowed sixty one And the Lord turning looked upon Peter And Peter remembered the word of the Lord how he said to him Before a cock crows this day thou wilt deny me thrice sixty two And Peter went out and wept bitterly sixty three And the men who held Jesus mocked him beating him sixty four and having blindfolded him they asked him saying Prophesy who is it that smote thee sixty five And many other things they said reviling him sixty six And when it was day the elders of the people twenty two sixty six and the chief priests and scribes came together and they brought him up into their council saying sixty seven If thou art the Christ tell us And he said to them If I tell you ye will not believe sixty eight And if I ask ye will not answer sixty nine But henceforth shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God seventy And they all said Art thou then the Son of God And he said to them Ye say it for I am seventy one And they said Why need we any further witness For we ourselves heard it from his own mouth XXIII AND the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto Pilate two And they began to accuse him saying We found this man perverting our nation and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar saying that he himself is Christ a king three And Pilate asked him saying Art thou the King of the Jews And he answering said to him Thou sayest it four And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes I find no fault in this man five And they were the more violent saying He stirs up the people teaching throughout all Judaea beginning from Galilee unto this place six When Pilate heard of Galilee he asked if the man is a Galilaean seven And learning that he belonged to Herod s jurisdiction he sent him up to Herod who also was himself in Jerusalem at that time eight And Herod when he saw Jesus rejoiced greatly for he had desired for a long time to see him because he had heard concerning him and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him nine And he questioned him in many words but he answered him nothing ten And the chief priests and scribes stood vehemently accusing him eleven And Herod with his men of war set him at naught and mocked him and arraying him in a gorgeous robe sent him back to Pilate twelve And Pilate and Herod on that day became friends with each other for before they were at enmity between themselves thirteen And Pilate having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people fourteen said to them Ye brought to me this man as one perverting the people and behold I having examined him before you found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him fifteen No nor yet Herod for I sent you up to him and behold nothing worthy of death has been done by him sixteen I will therefore chastise and release him seventeen twenty three seventeen eighteen And they cried out all at once saying Away with this man and release to us Barabbas nineteen who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into prison twenty Again therefore Pilate spoke to them desiring to release Jesus twenty one But they cried saying Crucify crucify him twenty two And a third time he said to them What evil then has this man done I found no cause of death in him I will therefore chastise and release him twenty three And they were urgent with loud voices requiring that he should be crucified And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed twenty four And Pilate gave sentence that what they required should be done twenty five And he released him who for sedition and murder was cast into prison whom they required but Jesus he delivered up to their will twenty six And as they led him away they laid hold of one Simon a Cyrenian coming from the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after Jesus twenty seven And there followed him a great company of the people and of women who also bewailed and lamented him twenty eight But Jesus turning to them said Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children twenty nine For behold days are coming in which they shall say Happy the barren and wombs that never bore and breasts that never gave suck thirty Then shall they begin to say to the mountains Fall on us and to the hills Cover us thirty one For if they do these things in the green tree what shall be done in the dry thirty two And there were also two others malefactors led with him to be put to death thirty three And when they had gone away to the place which is called A Skull there they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the left thirty four And Jesus said Father forgive them for they know not what they do And they divided his garments casting lots thirty five And the people stood beholding And the rulers also scoffed saying Others he saved let him save himself if he is the Christ the chosen of God thirty six And the soldiers also coming to him mocked him offering him vinegar thirty seven and saying If thou art the King of the Jews save thyself thirty eight And there was an inscription written over him THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS thirty nine And one of the malefactors who were hanged railed at him saying If thou art the Christ save thyself and us forty But the other answering rebuked him saying Dost thou not even fear God seeing thou art in the same condemnation forty one And we indeed justly for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds but this man did nothing amiss forty two And he said to Jesus Remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom forty three And Jesus said to him Verily I say to thee to day thou shalt be with me in paradise forty four And it was about the sixth hour and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour forty five And the sun was darkened and the vail of the temple was rent in the midst forty six And Jesus crying with a loud voice said Father into thy hands I commit my spirit And having said this he expired forty seven And the centurion seeing what was done glorified God saying Verily this man was righteous forty eight And all the multitudes who had come together to that sight having beheld the things that were done returned beating their breasts forty nine And all his acquaintance were standing afar off and women who had followed him from Galilee beholding these things fifty And behold a man named Joseph a counselor a good and just man fifty one he had not consented to their counsel and deed from Arimathaea a city of the Jews who was waiting for the kingdom of God fifty two this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus fifty three And taking it down he wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in the rock where no one was yet laid fifty four And it was the day of preparation and the sabbath drew on fifty five And the women also who had come with him out of Galilee followed after and viewed the sepulchre and how his body was laid fifty six And returning they prepared spices and ointments and on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment XXIV NOW on the first day of the week very early in the morning they came to the sepulchre bringing the spices which they prepared two And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre three And entering in they found not the body of the Lord Jesus four And it came to pass that as they were much perplexed concerning this behold two men stood by them in shining garments five And they being afraid and bowing their faces to the earth they said to them Why seek ye the living among the dead six He is not here but is risen Remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee seven saying The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise again eight And they remembered his words nine And returning from the sepulchre they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest ten And it was Mary the Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who said these things to the apostles eleven And their words seemed to them as idle talk and they believed them not twelve But Peter rose up and ran to the sepulchre and stooping down he beholds the linen cloths lying by themselves and he departed to his home wondering at that which was come to pass thirteen And behold two of them were going on that same day to a village called Emmaus distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem fourteen And they were conversing together concerning all these things that had taken place fifteen And it came to pass that while they were conversing and reasoning Jesus himself drew near and went with them sixteen But their eyes were holden that they should not know him seventeen And he said to them What communications are these that ye have one with another as ye walk and are sad eighteen And one whose name was Cleopas answering said to him Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things that have come to pass there in these days nineteen And he said to them What things And they said to him The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people twenty and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death and crucified him twenty one But we were hoping that it was he who was to redeem Israel But indeed beside all this to day is the third day since these things were done twenty two Yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished who were early at the sepulchre twenty three and not finding his body came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who say that he is alive twenty four And some of those who were with us went away to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women said but him they saw not twenty five Then he said to them O foolish and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken twenty six Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory twenty seven And beginning from Moses and all the prophets he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself twenty eight And they drew near to the village whither they were going and he made as though he would go further twenty nine But they constrained him saying Abide with us for it is toward evening and the day has declined And he went in to abide with them thirty And it came to pass that as he was reclining at table with them he took bread and blessed it and breaking gave to them thirty one And their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight thirty two And they said one to another Did not our heart burn within us while he talked to us in the way and while he opened to us the Scriptures thirty three And rising up in the same hour they returned to Jerusalem and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together thirty four saying The Lord is risen indeed and he appeared to Simon thirty five And they related what things were done in the way and how he became known by them in the breaking of bread thirty six And while they were speaking these things he himself stood in the midst of them and says to them Peace be to you thirty seven But they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they beheld a spirit thirty eight And he said to them Why are ye troubled And wherefore do thoughts arise in your hearts thirty nine See my hands and my feet that it is I myself Handle me and see for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me have forty And having said this he showed them his hands and his feet forty one And while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said to them Have ye here anything to eat forty two And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb forty three And he took and ate it before them forty four And he said to them These are my words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses and the prophets and psalms concerning me forty five Then he opened their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures forty six And he said to them Thus it is written that the Christ should suffer and should rise from the dead on the third day forty seven and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all the nations beginning at Jerusalem forty eight Ye are witnesses of these things forty nine And behold I send forth the promise of my Father upon you But do ye tarry in the city until ye are endued with power from on high fifty And he led them out as far as to Bethany and lifting up his hands he blessed them fifty one And it came to pass while he blessed them that he parted from them and was borne up into heaven fifty two And they having worshiped him returned to Jerusalem with great joy fifty three and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOHN I IN the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God two The same was in the beginning with God three All things were made by him one three and without him was nothing made that has been made four In him was life and the life was the light of men five And the light shines in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not six There was a man sent from God whose name was John seven The same came for witness to bear witness of the light that through him all might believe eight He was not the light but came to bear witness of the light nine There was the true light which lights every man that comes into the world ten He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not eleven He came to his own and his own received him not twelve But as many as received him to them he gave power to become children of God to those who believe on his name thirteen who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God fourteen And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us one fourteen and we beheld his glory a glory as of the only begotten from the Father full of grace and truth fifteen John bore witness of him and cried saying This was he of whom I said He that comes after me is preferred before me because he was before me one fifteen sixteen Because out of his fullness we all received and grace for grace seventeen For the law was given through Moses grace and truth came through Jesus Christ eighteen No one has ever seen God the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father he declared him nineteen And this is the witness of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him Who art thou twenty And he confessed and denied not and he confessed I am not the Christ twenty one And they asked him What then Art thou Elijah And he says I am not Art thou the Prophet And he answered No twenty two They said therefore to him Who art thou that we may give an answer to those who sent us What sayest thou of thyself twenty three He said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness Make straight the way of the Lord as said Isaiah the prophet twenty four And they who were sent were of the Pharisees twenty five And they asked him and said to him Why then dost thou immerse if thou art not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet twenty six John answered them saying I immerse in water There stands one in the midst of you whom ye know not twenty seven he who comes after me the latchet of whose sandal I am not worthy to loose twenty eight These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan where John was immersing twenty nine On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him and says Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world thirty This is he of whom I said After me comes a man who is preferred before me because he was before me one thirty thirty one And I knew him not but that he might be made manifest to Israel for this I came immersing in water thirty two And John bore witness saying I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven and it abode upon him thirty three And I knew him not but he who sent me to immerse in water the same said to me Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him the same is he who immerses in the Holy Spirit thirty four And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God thirty five Again on the morrow John was standing and two of his disciples thirty six and looking upon Jesus as he walked he says Behold the Lamb of God thirty seven And the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus thirty eight And Jesus turning and beholding them following says to them What seek ye They said to him Rabbi which interpreted means Teacher where dost thou abide thirty nine He says to them Come and ye shall see They came and saw where he abode and they abode with him that day It was about the tenth hour forty Andrew the brother of Simon Peter was one of the two who heard it from John and followed him forty one He first finds his brother Simon and says to him We have found the Messiah which is interpreted Christ forty two And he brought him to Jesus Jesus beholding him said Thou art Simon the son of Jonah thou shalt be called Cephas which is interpreted Peter one forty two forty three On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee And he finds Philip and Jesus says to him Follow me forty four Now Philip was from Bethsaida of the city of Andrew and Peter forty five Philip finds Nathanael and says to him We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets wrote Jesus the son of Joseph who is from Nazareth forty six And Nathanael said to him Can any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip says to him Come and see forty seven Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and says of him Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile forty eight Nathanael says to him Whence knowest thou me Jesus answered and said to him Before Philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree I saw thee forty nine Nathanael answered Rabbi thou art the Son of God thou art the King of Israel fifty Jesus answered and said to him Because I said to thee I saw thee under the fig tree believest thou Thou shalt see greater things than these fifty one And he says to him Verily verily I say to you henceforth one fifty one ye shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man II AND on the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there two And Jesus also was bidden and his disciples to the marriage three And wine having failed the mother of Jesus says to him They have no wine four Jesus says to her Woman what have I to do with thee My hour is not yet come five His mother says to the servants Whatever he says to you do it six Now there were set there six water pots of stone after the Jewish custom of purifying containing two or three firkins two six apiece seven Jesus says to them Fill the water pots with water And they filled them up to the brim eight And he says to them Draw out now and bear to the ruler of the feast And they bore it nine When the ruler of the feast tasted the water that was made wine and he knew not whence it was but the servants who had drawn the water knew the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom ten and says to him Every man sets forth the good wine first and when they have drunk freely then that which is worse Thou hast kept the good wine until now eleven This beginning of the signs Jesus wrought in Cana of Galilee and manifested his glory and his disciples believed on him twelve After this he went down to Capernaum he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples and they abode there not many days thirteen And the passover of the Jews was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem fourteen And he found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves and the money changers sitting fifteen And having made a scourge of small cords he drove all out of the temple both the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables sixteen and to those who sold doves he said Take these things hence make not my Father s house a house of merchandise seventeen And his disciples remembered that it is written for thy house consumes me eighteen The Jews therefore answered and said to him What sign dost thou show to us seeing that thou doest these things nineteen Jesus answered and said to them Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up twenty Therefore said the Jews Forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou raise it up in three days twenty one But he said it of the temple of his body twenty two When therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he said this and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus spoke twenty three And when he was in Jerusalem at the passover on the feast day many believed on his name beholding his signs which he wrought twenty four But Jesus did not trust himself to them because he knew all men twenty five and had no need that any one should testify of man for he himself knew what was in man III THERE was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews two The same came to him by night and said to him Rabbi we know that thou hast come a teacher from God for no one can do these signs which thou doest except God be with him three Jesus answered and said to him Verily verily I say to thee except a man be born again three three he can not see the kingdom of God four Nicodemus says to him How can a man be born when he is old Can he enter the second time into his mother s womb and be born five Jesus answered Verily verily I say to thee except a man be born of water and the Spirit he can not enter into the kingdom of God six That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit seven Marvel not that I said to thee Ye must be born again eight The wind blows where it will and thou hearest the sound thereof but knowest not whence it comes and whither it goes So is every one that is born of the Spirit nine Nicodemus answered and said to him How can these things be ten Jesus answered and said to him Art thou the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things eleven Verily verily I say to thee we speak that which we know and testify that which we have seen and ye receive not our testimony twelve If I told you the earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if I tell you the heavenly things thirteen And no one has ascended up into heaven but he who came down out of heaven the Son of man who is in heaven fourteen And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the Son of man be lifted up fifteen that every one who believes on him may have everlasting life sixteen For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whoever believes on him should not perish but may have everlasting life seventeen For God sent not his Son into the world to judge the world but that the world through him might be saved eighteen He that believes on him is not judged but he that believes not has already been judged because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God nineteen And this is the judgment that light has come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light for their deeds were evil twenty For every one that does evil hates the light and comes not to the light lest his deeds should be reproved twenty one But he that does the truth comes to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God twenty two After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea and there he remained with them and immersed twenty three And John also was immersing in Aenon near to Salim because there was much water there and they came and were immersed twenty four For John was not yet cast into prison twenty five There arose therefore a question on the part of John s disciples with a Jew about purification twenty six And they came to John and said to him Rabbi he who was with thee beyond the Jordan to whom thou hast borne witness behold he immerses and all come to him twenty seven John answered and said A man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven twenty eight Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said I am not the Christ but I am sent before him twenty nine He that has the bride is the bridegroom But the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom s voice This my joy therefore is made full thirty He must increase but I must decrease thirty one He that comes from above is above all he that is from the earth is of the earth and speaks of the earth he that comes from heaven is above all thirty two And what he has seen and heard that he testifies and his testimony no one receives thirty three He that received his testimony has set his seal That God is true thirty four For he whom God sent forth speaks the words of God for he gives not three thirty four the Spirit by measure thirty five The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand thirty six He that believes on the Son has everlasting life and he that believes not the Son shall not see life but the wrath of God abides on him IV WHEN therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus made and immersed more disciples than John two though Jesus himself immersed not but his disciples three he left Judaea and departed again into Galilee four And he must go through Samaria five He comes therefore to a city of Samaria called Sychar four five near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph six And Jacob s well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with the journey sat down thus on the well It was about the sixth hour seven There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus says to her Give me to drink eight For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food nine The Samaritan woman therefore says to him How is it that thou being a Jew askest drink of me being a Samaritan woman For Jews do not associate with Samaritans ten Jesus answered and said to her If thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that says to thee Give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water eleven The woman says to him Sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep From whence then hast thou the living water twelve Art thou greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle thirteen Jesus answered and said to her Every one that drinks of this water shall thirst again fourteen But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life fifteen The woman says to him Sir give me this water that I may not thirst nor come hither to draw sixteen Jesus says to her Go call thy husband and come hither seventeen The woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus says to her Thou saidst well I have no husband eighteen For thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband That thou hast spoken truly nineteen The woman says to him Sir I perceive that thou art a prophet twenty Our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship twenty one Jesus says to her Woman believe me an hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father twenty two Ye worship that which ye know not we worship that which we know because salvation is of the Jews twenty three But an hour is coming and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth for such the Father seeks to worship him twenty four God is spirit and they that worship him must worship in spirit and in truth twenty five The woman says to him I know that Messiah comes who is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things twenty six Jesus says to her I that speak to thee am he twenty seven And upon this came his disciples and they marveled that he talked with the woman four twenty seven Yet no one said What seekest thou or Why talkest thou with her twenty eight The woman then left her water pot and went away into the city and she says to the men twenty nine Come see a man who told me all things that ever I did Is this the Christ thirty Then they went out of the city and came to him thirty one In the mean while the disciples prayed him saying Master eat thirty two But he said to them I have food to eat that ye know not of thirty three Therefore said the disciples one to another Has any one brought him aught to eat thirty four Jesus says to them My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work thirty five Do ye not say that there are yet four months and then comes the harvest Behold I say to you lift up your eyes and look on the fields that they are already white for harvest thirty six And he that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto life eternal that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together thirty seven And herein is the true saying One sows and another reaps thirty eight I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored Other men have labored and ye have entered into their labor thirty nine And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman who testified He told me all that ever I did forty When therefore the Samaritans came to him they besought him to remain with them And he remained there two days forty one And far more believed because of his word forty two and said to the woman We no longer believe because of thy saying for we ourselves have heard and know that this is in truth the Savior of the world forty three And after the two days he departed thence and went into Galilee forty four For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country forty five When therefore he came into Galilee the Galilaeans received him having seen all that he did in Jerusalem at the feast for they also went to the feast forty six So he came again into Cana of Galilee where he made the water wine And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick in Capernaum forty seven He having heard that Jesus is come out of Judaea into Galilee went to him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was about to die forty eight Jesus therefore said to him Except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe forty nine The nobleman says to him Sir come down ere my child die fifty Jesus says to him Go thy way thy son lives And the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and he went his way fifty one And as he was now going down his servants met him and brought word saying Thy child lives fifty two He inquired of them therefore the hour when he began to amend And they said to him Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him fifty three The father knew therefore that it was in the same hour in which Jesus said to him Thy son lives And he himself believed and his whole house fifty four This second sign Jesus wrought when he had come out of Judaea into Galilee V AFTER these things there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem two And there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches three In these lay a multitude of the infirm of blind lame withered waiting for the moving of the water four For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water He therefore who first went in after the troubling of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had five four five And a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty and eight years six Jesus seeing this man lying and knowing that he had been already a long time thus says to him Dost thou desire to be made whole seven The infirm man answered him Sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another goes down before me eight Jesus says to him Rise take up thy bed and walk nine And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked And on that day was the sabbath ten The Jews therefore said to him that was cured It is the sabbath it is not lawful for thee to carry the bed eleven He answered them He who made me whole the same said to me Take up thy bed and walk twelve They asked him therefore Who is the man that said to thee Take up thy bed and walk thirteen And he who was healed knew not who it was for Jesus conveyed himself away there being a multitude in the place fourteen Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple And he said to him Behold thou hast been made whole sin no more lest something worse befall thee fifteen The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who made him whole sixteen And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus because he did these things on the sabbath seventeen But Jesus answered them My Father works hitherto and I work eighteen For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only broke the sabbath but also called God his Father making himself equal with God nineteen Jesus therefore answered and said to them Verily verily I say to you the Son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the Father do for what things soever he does these also does the Son in like manner twenty For the Father loves the Son and shows him all things that he himself does and greater works than these will he show him that ye may marvel twenty one For as the Father raises up the dead and quickens them so also the Son quickens whom he will twenty two For neither does the Father judge any one but all judgment he has given to the Son twenty three that all may honor the Son as they honor the Father He that honors not the Son honors not the Father who sent him twenty four Verily verily I say to you he that hears my word and believes him who sent me has everlasting life and comes not into judgment but has passed out of death into life twenty five Verily verily I say to you an hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live twenty six For as the Father has life in himself so he gave also to the Son to have life in himself twenty seven And he gave him authority to execute judgment also because he is a son of man twenty eight Marvel not at this for an hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice twenty nine and shall come forth they that did good to the resurrection of life and they that did evil to the resurrection of judgment thirty I can of myself do nothing As I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me thirty one If I bear witness of myself my witness is not true thirty two There is another that bears witness of me and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true thirty three Ye have sent to John and he has borne witness to the truth thirty four But I receive the witness not from man but these things I say that ye might be saved thirty five He was the burning and shining lamp and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light thirty six But I have greater witness than that of John for the works which the Father gave me to finish the works themselves that I do bear witness of me that the Father has sent me thirty seven And the Father who sent me he has borne witness of me Ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor have ye seen his shape thirty eight And ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he sent him ye believe not thirty nine Search five thirty nine the Scriptures because in them ye think ye have eternal life and these are they that testify of me forty and ye will not come to me that ye may have life forty one I receive not honor from men forty two But I know you that ye have not the love of God in you forty three I have come in my Father s name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive forty four How can ye believe receiving honor from one another and the honor that is from God alone ye seek not forty five Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father there is one that accuses you Moses in whom ye have placed your hope forty six For if ye believed Moses ye would believe me for he wrote of me forty seven But if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words VI AFTER these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee which is the sea of Tiberias two And a great multitude followed him because they saw the signs which he wrought on the sick three And Jesus went up into the mountain and there he sat with his disciples four And the passover the feast of the Jews was near five Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great multitude is coming to him says to Philip Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat six And this he said to try him for he himself knew what he was about to do seven Philip answered him Two hundred denaries worth of bread is not sufficient for them that each one may take a little eight One of his disciples Andrew the brother of Simon Peter says to him nine There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many ten Jesus said Make the men lie down Now there was much grass in the place So the men lay down in number about five thousand eleven And Jesus took the loaves and having given thanks he distributed to those who were lying down and likewise of the fishes as much as they desired twelve When they were filled he said to his disciples Gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost thirteen Therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above to those who had eaten fourteen The men therefore seeing the sign that Jesus wrought said This is of a truth the Prophet that comes into the world fifteen Jesus therefore knowing that they were about to come and take him by force to make him a king withdrew again into the mountain himself alone sixteen And when evening came his disciples went down to the sea seventeen and entering into the ship were going over the sea to Capernaum And it was now dark and Jesus had not come to them eighteen and as a strong wind was blowing the sea began to rise nineteen When therefore they had rowed about twenty five or thirty furlongs they see Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the ship and they were afraid twenty But he says to them It is I be not afraid twenty one They therefore willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they were going twenty two On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea seeing that there was no other boat there but one and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the ship but his disciples went away alone twenty three but there came other boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate bread when the Lord had given thanks twenty four when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not there nor his disciples they themselves entered into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking for Jesus twenty five And having found him on the other side of the sea they said to him Rabbi when camest thou hither twenty six Jesus answered them and said Verily verily I say to you ye seek me not because ye saw signs but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled twenty seven Work not for the food that perishes but for the food that endures unto everlasting life which the Son of man will give to you for him the Father God has sealed twenty eight Therefore they said to him What shall we do that we may work the works of God twenty nine Jesus answered and said to them This is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he sent thirty They therefore said to him What sign doest thou then that we may see and believe thee What dost thou work thirty one Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness as it is written He gave them bread from heaven to eat thirty two Jesus therefore said to them Verily verily I say to you Moses has not given you the bread from heaven but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven thirty three For the bread of God is that which six thirty three comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world thirty four They therefore said to him Lord evermore give us this bread thirty five Jesus said to them I am the bread of life He that comes to me shall never hunger and he that believes on me shall never thirst thirty six But I said to you that ye have also seen me and do not believe thirty seven All that the Father gives me will come to me and him that comes to me I will not cast out thirty eight Because I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me thirty nine And this is the will of him who sent me that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up at the last day forty For this is the will of my Father that every one who sees the Son and believes on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day forty one The Jews therefore murmured at him because he said I am the bread that came down out of heaven forty two And they said Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know How then does this man say I have come down out of heaven forty three Jesus answered and said to them Murmur not among yourselves forty four No one can come to me except the Father who sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day forty five It is written in the prophets And they shall all be taught of God Every one that has heard from the Father and has learned comes to me forty six Not that any one has seen the Father save he who is from God he has seen the Father forty seven Verily verily I say to you he that believes on me has everlasting life forty eight I am the bread of life forty nine Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and are dead fifty This is the bread that comes down out of heaven that one may eat thereof and not die fifty one I am the living bread that came down out of heaven If any one eat of this bread he shall live forever yea and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world fifty two The Jews therefore contended with one another saying How can this man give us his flesh to eat fifty three Jesus therefore said to them Verily verily I say to you except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you fifty four He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day fifty five For my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink fifty six He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and I in him fifty seven As the living Father has sent me and I live because of the Father so he that eats me he also shall live because of me fifty eight This is the bread that came down out of heaven Not as your fathers ate the manna and are dead he that eats of this bread shall live forever fifty nine These things he said in the synagogue while teaching in Capernaum sixty Many therefore of his disciples when they heard it said This is a hard saying who can hear it sixty one But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this said to them Does this offend you sixty two What then if ye behold the Son of man ascending up where he was before sixty three It is the spirit that makes alive the flesh profits nothing the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life sixty four But there are some of you that believe not For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who it was that should betray him sixty five And he said For this cause I have said to you that no one can come to me except it be given him from the Father sixty six From this time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him sixty seven Jesus said therefore to the twelve Will ye also go away sixty eight Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go Thou hast words of eternal life sixty nine And we believe and know that thou art the Holy One of God seventy Jesus answered them Did I not choose you the twelve and one of you is a devil seventy one He spoke of Judas Iscariot son of Simon for he it was that would betray him being one of the twelve VII AND after these things Jesus walked in Galilee for he would not walk in Judaea because the Jews were seeking to kill him two Now the feast of the Jews the feast of tabernacles was at hand three His brothers therefore said to him Depart hence and go into Judaea that thy disciples also may behold thy works that thou doest four For no one does anything in secret and he himself seeks to be known openly If thou doest these things manifest thyself to the world five For neither did his brothers believe on him six Jesus therefore says to them My time is not yet come but your time is always ready seven The world can not hate you but me it hates because I testify of it that its works are evil eight Go ye up to the feast I go not up to this feast because my time is not yet fully come nine Having said these things to them he remained in Galilee ten But when his brothers were gone up to the feast then he also went up not openly but as it were in secret eleven The Jews therefore sought him at the feast and said Where is he twelve And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him Some said He is a good man others said Nay but he misleads the multitude thirteen No one however spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews fourteen But when it was already the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught fifteen And the Jews wondered saying How knows this man letters having never learned sixteen Jesus therefore answered them and said My teaching is not mine but his who sent me seventeen If any one desires to do his will he shall know of the teaching whether it is of God or whether I speak from myself eighteen He that speaks from himself seeks his own glory but he that seeks the glory of him who sent him the same is true and there is no unrighteousness in him nineteen Has not Moses given you the law and none of you keeps the law Why do ye seek to kill me twenty The multitude answered and said Thou hast a demon who seeks to kill thee twenty one Jesus answered and said to them I did one work and ye all marvel twenty two Moses has for this cause given you circumcision not that it is of Moses but of the fathers and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man twenty three If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken are ye angry at me because I made a man altogether whole on the sabbath twenty four Judge not according to appearance but judge the righteous judgment twenty five Then said some of those of Jerusalem Is not this he whom they seek to kill twenty six But lo he speaks boldly and they say nothing to him Did the rulers know seven twenty six in truth that this is the Christ twenty seven But we know this man whence he is but when the Christ comes no one knows whence he is twenty eight Jesus therefore cried teaching in the temple and saying Ye both know me and ye know whence I am and I have not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not twenty nine I know him because I am from him and he sent me thirty Therefore they sought to seize him and no one laid hands on him because his hour had not yet come thirty one But of the multitude many believed on him and said When the Christ comes will he work more signs than these which this man wrought thirty two The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize him thirty three Jesus therefore said Yet a little while I am with you and I go to him who sent me thirty four Ye will seek me and shall not find me and where I am ye can not come thirty five The Jews said therefore among themselves Whither will this man go that we shall not find him Will he go to those dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks thirty six What is this saying that he said Ye will seek me and shall not find me and where I am ye can not come thirty seven In the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying If any one thirst let him come to me and drink thirty eight He that believes on me as said the Scripture out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water thirty nine And this he spoke concerning the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified forty Some of the multitude therefore hearing the words said Of a truth this is the Prophet forty one Others said This is the Christ But some said Does the Christ then come out of Galilee forty two Did not the Scripture say that the Christ comes of the seed of David and from the town of Bethlehem where David was forty three A division therefore arose among the multitude because of him forty four And some of them desired to seize him but no one laid hands on him forty five The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees and they said to them Why did ye not bring him forty six The officers answered Never man spoke like this man seven forty seven forty seven The Pharisees answered them Are ye also led astray forty eight Did any of the rulers believe on him or of the Pharisees forty nine But this multitude that know not the law are accursed fifty Nicodemus says to them he who came to him by night being one of them fifty one Does our law judge a man except it first hear from him and know what he does fifty two They answered and said to him Art thou also of Galilee Search and see that out of Galilee arises no prophet seven fifty two fifty three seven fifty three And each one went to his house VIII JESUS went to the mount of the Olives two And early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came to him and having sat down he was teaching them three And the scribes and the Pharisees bring to him a woman taken in adultery and having placed her in the midst four they say to him Teacher this woman was taken in adultery in the very act five Now in the law Moses commanded us that such should be stoned what then dost thou say six This they said tempting him that they might have whereof to accuse him But Jesus having stooped down was writing with his finger in the ground seven And as they continued asking him raising himself up he said to them He that is without sin among you let him first cast the stone at her eight And again stooping down he wrote in the ground nine And they hearing it and being convicted by their conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest unto the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst ten And Jesus raising himself up and seeing none but the woman said to her Woman where are they thine accusers Did no one condemn thee eleven She said No one Lord And Jesus said to her Neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more twelve Again therefore Jesus spoke to them saying I am the light of the world he that follows me shall not walk in the darkness but shall have the light of life thirteen The Pharisees therefore said to him Thou bearest witness of thyself thy witness is not true fourteen Jesus answered and said to them Though I bear witness of myself my witness is true because I know whence I came and whither I go but ye know not whence I come or whither I go fifteen Ye judge according to the flesh I judge no one sixteen And even if I judge my judgment is true because I am not alone but I and the Father who sent me seventeen It is written also in your law that the witness of two men is true eighteen I am one that bear witness of myself and the Father who sent me bears witness of me nineteen They said therefore to him Where is thy Father Jesus answered Ye know neither me nor my Father If ye knew me ye would know my Father also twenty These words he spoke in the treasury while teaching in the temple and no one laid hands on him because his hour had not yet come twenty one Again therefore he said to them I go away and ye will seek me and shall die in your sin Whither I go ye can not come twenty two The Jews therefore said Will he kill himself because he says Whither I go ye can not come twenty three And he said to them Ye are from beneath I am from above Ye are of this world I am not of this world twenty four I said therefore to you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that I am he ye shall die in your sins twenty five Therefore they said to him Who art thou And Jesus said to them That which I also say to you from the beginning twenty six I have many things to say and to judge concerning you But he who sent me is true and the things which I heard from him these I speak to the world twenty seven They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father twenty eight Therefore Jesus said to them When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man then ye shall know that I am he and of myself I do nothing but as the Father taught me those things I speak twenty nine And he who sent me is with me He has not left me alone because I do always the things that please him thirty As he spoke these words many believed on him thirty one Jesus therefore said to those Jews who have believed him If ye continue in my word ye are truly my disciples thirty two and ye shall know the truth and the truth will make you free thirty three They answered him We are Abraham s seed and have never been in bondage to any one How sayest thou Ye shall be made free thirty four Jesus answered them Verily verily I say to you every one who commits sin is a servant of sin thirty five And the servant abides not in the house forever thirty six The Son abides forever if therefore the Son shall make you free ye will be free indeed thirty seven I know that ye are Abraham s seed but ye seek to kill me because my word has no place in you thirty eight I speak what I have seen with my Father and ye therefore do what ye have heard from your father thirty nine They answered and said to him Our father is Abraham Jesus says to them If ye were children of Abraham ye would do the works of Abraham forty But now ye seek to kill me a man who has spoken to you the truth which I heard from God This Abraham did not forty one Ye do the works of your father They said to him We were not born of fornication we have one father God forty two Jesus said to them If God were your father ye would love me for from God I came forth and am come neither have I come of myself but he sent me forty three Why do ye not understand my speech Because ye can not hear my word forty four Ye are of your father the Devil and the lusts of your father ye will do He was a murderer from the beginning and abides not in the truth because truth is not in him When he speaks a lie he speaks of his own because he is a liar and the father of it forty five And because I speak the truth ye believe me not forty six Which of you convicts me of sin If I speak truth why do ye not believe me forty seven He that is of God hears God s words ye therefore hear not because ye are not of God forty eight The Jews answered and said to him Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a demon forty nine Jesus answered I have not a demon but I honor my Father and ye dishonor me fifty And I seek not my own glory there is one that seeks and judges fifty one Verily verily I say to you if any one keep my saying he shall not see death forever fifty two The Jews said to him Now we know that thou hast a demon Abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest If a man keep my saying he shall not taste of death forever fifty three Art thou greater than our father Abraham who is dead And the prophets are dead Whom makest thou thyself fifty four Jesus answered If I honor myself my honor is nothing It is my Father that honors me of whom ye say that he is your God fifty five And ye know him not but I know him And if I say I know him not I shall be a liar like to you But I know him and I keep his word fifty six Abraham your father rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad fifty seven The Jews therefore said to him Thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen Abraham fifty eight Jesus said to them Verily verily I say to you before Abraham was I am fifty nine They took up stones therefore to cast at him But Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple IX AND passing along he saw a man blind from his birth two And his disciples asked him saying Master who sinned this man or his parents that he should be born blind three Jesus answered Neither this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him four I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day Night is coming when none can work five As long as I am in the world I am the light of the world six Having thus spoken he spit on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay seven and said to him Go wash in the pool of Siloam which is interpreted Sent He went away therefore and washed and came seeing eight The neighbors therefore and they who before had seen him that he was a beggar said Is not this he that sits and begs nine Some said This is he and others He is like him he said I am he ten Therefore they said to him How were thine eyes opened eleven He answered A man called Jesus made clay and anointed mine eyes and said to me Go to the pool of Siloam and wash And I went away and washed and received sight twelve They said to him Where is he He said I know not thirteen They bring to the Pharisees him who before was blind fourteen And it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes fifteen Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received sight He said to them He put clay upon mine eyes and I washed and do see sixteen Therefore some of the Pharisees said This man is not from God because he keeps not the sabbath Others said How can a man that is a sinner do such signs And there was a division among them seventeen They say to the blind man again What sayest thou of him seeing that he opened thine eyes He said He is a Prophet eighteen The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he was blind and received sight until they called the parents of him that received sight nineteen And they asked them saying Is this your son who ye say was born blind How then does he now see twenty His parents answered them and said We know that this is our son and that he was born blind twenty one But by what means he now sees we know not or who opened his eyes we know not He is of age ask him He shall speak for himself twenty two These words spoke his parents because they feared the Jews for the Jews had agreed already that if any one acknowledged him as Christ he should be put out of the synagogue twenty three Therefore his parents said He is of age ask him twenty four They therefore called a second time the man that was blind and said to him Give glory to God we know that this man is a sinner twenty five He answered therefore Whether he is a sinner I know not one thing I know that whereas I was blind now I see twenty six They therefore said to him What did he to thee How opened he thine eyes twenty seven He answered them I told you already and ye did not hear Wherefore would ye hear again Will ye also become his disciples twenty eight They reviled him and said Thou art his disciple but we are Moses disciples twenty nine We know that God has spoken to Moses but this man we know not whence he is thirty The man answered and said to them Why herein is a marvelous thing that ye know not whence he is and he opened mine eyes thirty one Now we know that God hears not sinners But if any one is a worshiper of God and does his will him he hears thirty two Since the world began it was not heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind thirty three If this man were not from God he could do nothing thirty four They answered and said to him Thou wast altogether born in sins and dost thou teach us And they cast him out thirty five Jesus heard that they cast him out and finding him he said to him Dost thou believe on the Son of God thirty six He answered and said Who then is he Lord that I may believe on him thirty seven And Jesus said to him Thou hast both seen him and he it is that talks with thee thirty eight And he said Lord I believe And he worshiped him thirty nine And Jesus said For judgment came I into this world that they who see not may see and that they who see may become blind forty And some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these words and said to him Are we also blind forty one Jesus said to them If ye were blind ye would not have sin But now ye say We see Your sin remains X VERILY verily I say to you He that enters not through the door into the sheepfold but climbs up some other way the same is a thief and a robber two But he that enters in through the door is a shepherd of the sheep three To him the porter opens and the sheep hear his voice and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out four And when he has put forth all his own he goes before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice five And a stranger they will not follow but will flee from him because they know not the voice of strangers six This parable spoke Jesus to them but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them seven Therefore said Jesus to them again Verily verily I say to you I am the door of the sheep eight All who came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them nine I am the door If any one enter in through me he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture ten The thief comes not but to steal and to kill and to destroy I came that they may have life and that they may have it abundantly eleven I am the good shepherd The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep twelve But he that is a hireling and not a shepherd whose own the sheep are not sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees and the wolf catches them and scatters the sheep thirteen The hireling flees because he is a hireling and cares not for the sheep fourteen I am the good shepherd and I know mine and am known by mine fifteen as the Father knows me and I know the Father and I lay down my life for the sheep sixteen And other sheep I have which are not of this fold Them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one flock one shepherd seventeen For this the Father loves me because I lay down my life that I may take it again eighteen No one takes it from me but I lay it down of myself I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it again This commandment I received from my Father nineteen Again there arose a division among the Jews because of these words twenty And many of them said He has a demon and is mad why do ye hear him twenty one Others said These are not the words of one that has a demon Can a demon open the eyes of the blind twenty two And there came the feast of the dedication in Jerusalem and it was winter twenty three And Jesus was walking in the temple in the porch of Solomon twenty four The Jews therefore came around him and said to him How long dost thou hold us in doubt ten twenty four If thou art the Christ tell us plainly twenty five Jesus answered them I told you and ye do not believe The works that I do in my Father s name these bear witness of me twenty six But ye do not believe for ye are not of my sheep as I said to you twenty seven My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me twenty eight and I give to them eternal life and they shall never perish nor shall any one pluck them out of my hand twenty nine My Father who has given them to me is greater than all and no one is able to pluck them out of my Father s hand thirty I and the Father are one thirty one The Jews therefore took up stones again to stone him thirty two Jesus answered them Many good works have I showed you from my Father for which of those works do ye stone me thirty three The Jews answered him For a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because thou being man makest thyself God thirty four Jesus answered them Is it not written in your law I said Ye are gods thirty five If he called them gods to whom the word of God came and the Scripture can not be broken thirty six say ye of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world Thou blasphemest because I said I am the Son of God thirty seven If I do not the works of my Father believe me not thirty eight But if I do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may learn and know that the Father is in me and I in the Father thirty nine Therefore they sought again to seize him and he went forth out of their hand forty And he went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was at first immersing and there he abode forty one And many came to him and said John indeed wrought no sign but all things that John spoke of this man were true forty two And many believed on him there XI NOW a certain one was sick Lazarus of Bethany from the village of Mary and Martha her sister two It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick three The sisters therefore sent to him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick four And Jesus hearing it said This sickness is not for death but for the sake of the glory of God that the Son of God may be glorified thereby five Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus six When therefore he heard that he was sick he then abode two days in the place where he was seven Then after this he says to the disciples Let us go into Judaea again eight The disciples say to him Master the Jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again nine Jesus answered Are there not twelve hours in the day If any one walk in the day he stumbles not because he sees the light of this world ten But if any one walk in the night he stumbles because the light is not in him eleven These things said he and after this he says to them Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep but I go that I may awake him out of sleep twelve Therefore his disciples said Lord if he has fallen asleep he will be restored thirteen But Jesus had spoken of his death but they thought that he said it of taking rest in sleep fourteen Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly Lazarus is dead fifteen And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there that ye may believe But let us go to him sixteen Therefore said Thomas who is called Didymus to his fellow disciples Let us also go that we may die with him seventeen Having come therefore Jesus found that he had already been four days in the tomb eighteen Now Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off nineteen And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother twenty Therefore Martha when she heard that Jesus is coming went and met him but Mary sat in the house twenty one Then said Martha to Jesus Lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died twenty two But even now I know that whatever thou shalt ask of God God will give it thee twenty three Jesus says to her Thy brother will rise again twenty four Martha says to him I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day twenty five Jesus said to her I am the resurrection and the life he that believes on me though he be dead yet shall he live twenty six and whoever lives and believes on me shall never die Believest thou this twenty seven She says to him Yea Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the Son of God who comes into the world twenty eight And having said this she went away and called Mary her sister secretly saying The Teacher is come and calls for thee twenty nine And she when she heard it rises quickly and comes to him thirty Now Jesus had not yet come into the village but was in the place where Martha met him thirty one The Jews therefore who were with her in the house and comforting her when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out followed her saying She goes to the tomb to weep there thirty two Mary therefore when she came where Jesus was seeing him fell down at his feet saying to him Lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died thirty three Jesus therefore when he saw her weeping and the Jews weeping who came with her groaned in spirit and was troubled thirty four And he said Where have ye laid him They say to him Lord come and see thirty five Jesus wept thirty six The Jews therefore said Behold how he loved him thirty seven And some of them said Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind have caused even that this man should not have died thirty eight Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the tomb It was a cave and a stone lay upon it thirty nine Jesus says Take away the stone The sister of him that was dead Martha says to him Lord by this time he is offensive for he has been dead four days forty Jesus says to her Said I not to thee that if thou believe thou shalt see the glory of God forty one So they took away the stone And Jesus raised his eyes upward and said Father I thank thee that thou didst hear me forty two And I knew that thou always hearest me but for the sake of the multitude standing around I said it that they might believe that thou didst send me forty three And having thus spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth forty four And he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin Jesus says to them Loose him and let him go forty five Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he did believed on him forty six But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus did forty seven Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said What do we seeing that this man works many signs forty eight If we let him thus alone all will believe on him and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation forty nine And a certain one of them Caiaphas being high priest that year said to them Ye know nothing fifty nor do ye consider that it is expedient for us that one man die for the people and not the whole nation perish fifty one And this he spoke not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation fifty two and not for the nation only but that also he should gather together into one the children of God that were scattered abroad fifty three Therefore from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death fifty four Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews but departed thence to the country near to the wilderness to a city called Ephraim and there continued with his disciples fifty five And the passover of the Jews was at hand and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover that they might purify themselves fifty six They sought therefore for Jesus and said among themselves as they stood in the temple What think ye that he will not come to the feast fifty seven Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment that if any one knew where he was he should make it known that they might seize him XII THEREFORE Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was who had been dead whom Jesus raised from the dead two They therefore made him a supper there and Martha served and Lazarus was one of those who reclined at table with him three Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment four Then says one of his disciples Judas Iscariot Simon s son who was about to betray him five Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denaries twelve five and given to the poor six This he said not because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bore twelve six what was put therein seven Then said Jesus Let her alone she has kept it twelve seven to the day of my preparation for burial eight For the poor ye have always with you but me ye have not always nine A great multitude of the Jews therefore knew that he was there And they came not because of Jesus only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he raised from the dead ten But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death eleven because by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus twelve On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast hearing that Jesus is coming to Jerusalem thirteen took branches of the palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried Hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord the King of Israel fourteen And Jesus having found a young ass sat thereon as it is written fifteen Fear not daughter of Zion Behold thy King comes Sitting on an ass s colt sixteen These things his disciples understood not at the first But when Jesus was glorified then they remembered that these things were written of him and that they did these things to him seventeen The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness eighteen For this the multitude also met him because they heard that he had wrought this sign nineteen The Pharisees therefore said among themselves Perceive ye that ye avail nothing Behold the world is gone after him twenty And there were certain Greeks of those who come up to worship at the feast twenty one These came therefore to Philip who was from Bethsaida of Galilee and desired him saying Sir we would see Jesus twenty two Philip comes and tells Andrew Andrew and Philip come and tell Jesus twenty three And Jesus answered them saying The hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified twenty four Verily verily I say to you except the grain of wheat fall into the ground and die it abides alone but if it die it brings forth much fruit twenty five He that loves his life shall lose it and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal twenty six If any one serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be If any one serve me him will the Father honor twenty seven Now is my soul troubled and what shall I say Father save me from this hour twelve twenty seven But for this cause came I unto this hour twenty eight Father glorify thy name Then there came a voice out of heaven I both have glorified it and will glorify it again twenty nine The multitude therefore that stood by and heard said that it thundered others said An angel has spoken to him thirty Jesus answered and said This voice came not for my sake but for your sakes thirty one Now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out thirty two And I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men to me thirty three This he said signifying by what manner of death he should die thirty four The multitude answered him We heard out of the law that the Christ abides forever and how sayest thou The Son of man must be lifted up Who is this Son of man thirty five Jesus therefore said to them Yet a little while is the light among you Walk while ye have the light that darkness may not overtake you and he that walks in the darkness knows not whither he goes thirty six While ye have the light believe on the light that ye may become sons of light These things spoke Jesus and departed and hid himself from them thirty seven But though he had wrought so many signs before them they did not believe on him thirty eight that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which he spoke Lord who believed our report And to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed thirty nine Therefore they could not believe because Isaiah said again forty He has blinded their eyes And has hardened their heart That they should not see with their eyes And understand with their heart And turn and I should heal them forty one These things said Isaiah because he saw his glory and spoke of him forty two Yet even of the rulers many believed on him but because of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge him lest they should be put out of the synagogue forty three for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God forty four And Jesus cried and said He that believes on me believes not on me but on him who sent me forty five And he that beholds me beholds him who sent me forty six I have come a light into the world that whoever believes on me may not abide in the darkness forty seven And if any one hear my words and keep them not I do not judge him for I came not to judge the world but to save the world forty eight He that rejects me and receives not my words has one that judges him The word that I spokes that shall judge him in the last day forty nine Because I spoke not from myself but the Father who sent me he has given me a commandment what I should say and what I should speak fifty And I know that his commandment is everlasting life What things I speak therefore as the Father has said to me so I speak XIII AND before the feast of the passover Jesus knowing that his hour has come that he should depart out of this world to the Father having loved his own who were in the world loved them to the end two And supper being served the Devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon s son to betray him three knowing that the Father has given all things into his hands and that he came out from God and is going to God four he rises from the supper and lays aside his garments and taking a towel he girded himself five After that he pours water into the basin and began to wash the feet of his disciples and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded six He comes therefore to Simon Peter and Peter says to him Lord dost thou wash my feet seven Jesus answered and said to him What I do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter eight Peter says to him Never shalt thou wash my feet Jesus answered him If I wash thee not thou hast no part with me nine Simon Peter says to him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head ten Jesus says to him He that has bathed has no need save to wash the feet but is wholly clean And ye are clean but not all eleven For he knew his betrayer therefore he said Ye are not all clean twelve When therefore he had washed their feet he took his garments and reclining again at table said to them Know ye what I have done to you thirteen Ye call me the Teacher and the Master and ye say well for so I am fourteen If I then the Master and the Teacher washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another s feet fifteen For I gave you an example that as I did to you ye also should do sixteen Verily verily I say to you a servant is not greater than his lord nor one that is sent thirteen sixteen greater than he who sent him seventeen If ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them eighteen I speak not of you all I know whom I chose but that the scripture might be fulfilled He that eats the loaf with me lifted up his heel against me nineteen Even now I tell you before it comes to pass that when it comes to pass ye may believe that I am he twenty Verily verily I say to you he that receives whomsoever I send receives me and he that receives me receives him who sent me twenty one Having said this Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified and said Verily verily I say to you that one of you will betray me twenty two The disciples therefore looked one on another doubting of whom he spoke twenty three And there was reclining in Jesus bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus loved twenty four To him therefore Simon Peter beckons and says to him Say who it is of whom he speaks twenty five And he leaning back on Jesus breast says to him Lord who is it twenty six Jesus answers He it is to whom I shall give the morsel when I have dipped it And having dipped the morsel he gives it to Judas Iscariot son of Simon twenty seven And after the morsel then entered Satan into him Jesus therefore says to him What thou doest do quickly twenty eight And no one at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him twenty nine For some thought because Judas had the bag that Jesus said to him Buy what we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor thirty He then having received the morsel went immediately out and it was night thirty one When therefore he was gone out Jesus says Now is the Son of man glorified and God is glorified in him thirty two If God is glorified in him God will also glorify him in himself and will straightway glorify him thirty three Children yet a little while I am with you Ye will seek me and as I said to the Jews whither I go ye can not come so now I say to you thirty four A new commandment I give to you that ye love one another as I loved you that ye also love one another thirty five By this shall all know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one toward another thirty six Simon Peter says to him Lord whither goest thou Jesus answered him Whither I go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterward thirty seven Peter says to him Lord why can not I follow thee now I will lay down my life for thee thirty eight Jesus answers Wilt thou lay down thy life for me Verily verily I say to thee a cock will not crow till thou hast denied me thrice XIV LET not your heart be troubled Believe on God and believe on me fourteen one two In my Father s house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you because I go to prepare a place for you three And if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and will receive you to myself that where I am ye may be also four And ye know the way whither I go five Thomas says to him Lord we know not whither thou goest and how do we know the way six Jesus says to him I am the way the truth and the life No one comes to the Father but by me seven If ye knew me ye would know my Father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him eight Philip says to him Lord show us the Father and it suffices us nine Jesus says to him Am I so long time with you and dost thou not know me Philip He that has seen me has seen the Father and how sayest thou Show us the Father ten Believest thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in me The words that I speak to you I speak not of myself but the Father who dwells in me he does the works eleven Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me or else believe for the very works sake twelve Verily verily I say to you he that believes on me the works that I do he shall do also and greater than these shall he do because I go to the Father thirteen And whatever ye shall ask in my name that I will do that the Father may be glorified in the Son fourteen If ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it fifteen If ye love me keep my commandments sixteen And I will ask of the Father and he will give you another Comforter that he may be with you forever seventeen the Spirit of truth whom the world can not receive because it sees him not neither knows him but ye know him because he abides with you and shall be in you eighteen I will not leave you bereaved fourteen eighteen I will come to you nineteen Yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also twenty In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father and ye in me and I in you twenty one He that has my commandments and keeps them he it is that loves me and he that loves me shall be loved by my Father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him twenty two Judas says to him not Iscariot Lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world twenty three Jesus answered and said to him If any one loves me he will keep my word and my Father will love him and we will come to him and make our abode with him twenty four He that loves me not keeps not my words and the word which ye hear is not mine but the Father s who sent me twenty five These things have I spoken to you while abiding with you twenty six But the Comforter the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all things which I said to you twenty seven Peace I leave with you my peace I give to you not as the world gives give I to you Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid twenty eight Ye heard how I said to you I go away and I come to you If ye loved me ye would have rejoiced that I go to the Father because the Father is greater than I twenty nine And now I have told you before it comes to pass that when it is come to pass ye may believe thirty I will no longer talk much with you for the prince of the world comes and in me he has nothing thirty one But that the world may know that I love the Father and as the Father gave me commandment so I do Arise let us go hence XV I AM the true vine and my Father is the husbandman two Every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes it away and every one that bears fruit he cleanses it that it may bear more fruit three Ye are already clean through the word which I have spoken to you four Abide in me and I in you As the branch can not bear fruit of itself if it abide not in the vine so neither can ye if ye abide not in me five I am the vine ye are the branches He that abides in me and I in him the same bears much fruit because without me ye can do nothing six If any one abide not in me he is cast forth as the branch and is withered and they gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned seven If ye abide in me and my words abide in you ask whatever ye will and it shall be done to you eight Herein is my Father glorified that ye bear much fruit and ye shall become my disciples nine As the Father loved me I also loved you abide in my love ten If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love as I have kept my Father s commandments and abide in his love eleven These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and your joy be made full twelve This is my commandment that ye love one another as I loved you thirteen Greater love has no one than this that one lay down his life for his friends fourteen Ye are my friends if ye do whatever I command you fifteen No longer do I call you servants because the servant knows not what his lord does But I have called you friends because all things that I heard from my Father I made known to you sixteen Ye did not choose me but I chose you and appointed you that ye may go and bear fruit and that your fruit may remain that whatever ye shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it you seventeen These things I command you that ye love one another eighteen If the world hates you ye know that it has hated me before it hated you nineteen If ye were of the world the world would love its own but because ye are not of the world but I chose you out of the world for this the world hates you twenty Remember the word that I said to you A servant is not greater than his lord If they persecuted me they will also persecute you if they kept my saying they will keep yours also twenty one But all these things they will do to you for my name s sake because they know not him who sent me twenty two If I had not come and spoken to them they would not have sin but now they have no cloak for their sin twenty three He that hates me hates my Father also twenty four If I had not done among them the works which no other one has done they would not have sin but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father twenty five But this comes to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law They hated me without a cause twenty six But when the Comforter is come whom I will send to you from the Father the Spirit of truth which proceeds from the Father he will bear witness of me twenty seven And ye also shall bear witness because ye are with me from the beginning XVI THESE things I have spoken to you that ye should not be offended two They will put you out of the synagogues yea a time is coming that every one who kills you will think he makes an offering to God three And these things they will do to you because they have not known the Father nor me four But these things I have spoken to you that when the time shall come ye may remember that I told you And these things I told you not from the beginning because I was with you five And now I go to him who sent me and none of you asks me Whither goest thou six But because I have spoken these things to you sorrow has filled your heart seven But I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I depart for if I depart not the Comforter will not come to you but if I go I will send him to you eight And when he is come he will convict the world in respect of sin and of righteousness and of judgment nine of sin in that they believe not on me ten of righteousness in that I go to my Father and ye behold me no more eleven of judgment in that the prince of this world has been judged twelve I have yet many things to say to you but ye can not bear them now thirteen But when he the Spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all the truth for he will not speak from himself but whatever he shall hear that will he speak and he will tell you the things to come fourteen He will glorify me because he will receive of mine and will tell it to you fifteen All things that the Father has are mine Therefore I said that he will receive of mine and will tell it to you sixteen A little while and ye behold me not and again a little while and ye shall see me seventeen Therefore some of his disciples said to one another What is this that he says to us A little while and ye behold me not and again a little while and ye shall see me and I go to the Father eighteen They said therefore What is this that he says A little while We know not what he says nineteen Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said to them Do ye inquire of this with one another that I said A little while and ye behold me not and again a little while and ye shall see me twenty Verily verily I say to you that ye will weep and lament but the world will rejoice and ye will be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy twenty one A woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour is come but when she has borne the child she remembers no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world twenty two And so ye now have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no one takes from you twenty three And in that day ye shall ask nothing of me Verily verily I say to you Whatever ye shall ask of the Father he will give it you in my name twenty four Hitherto ye asked nothing in my name Ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be made full twenty five These things I have spoken to you in parables A time is coming when I will no more speak to you in parables but I will tell you plainly of the Father twenty six In that day ye shall ask in my name And I say not to you that I will pray the Father for you twenty seven for the Father himself loves you because ye have loved me and have believed that I came forth from God twenty eight I came forth from the Father and have come into the world again I leave the world and go to the Father twenty nine His disciples say to him Lo now thou speakest plainly and speakest no parable thirty Now we know that thou knowest all things and needest not that any one should ask thee By this we believe that thou camest forth from God thirty one Jesus answered them Do ye now believe thirty two Behold an hour is coming and has come that ye will be scattered each one to his own and will leave me alone and I am not alone because the Father is with me thirty three These things I have spoken to you that in me ye may have peace In the world ye have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world XVII THESE words spoke Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said Father the hour has come glorify thy Son that thy Son may glorify thee two as thou gayest him authority over all flesh that as many as thou hast given to him to them he should give eternal life three And this is the eternal life that they know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou didst send four I glorified thee on the earth I finished the work which thou hast given me to do five And now O Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was six I manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world Thine they were and thou hast given them to me and they have kept thy word seven Now they know that all things whatever thou hast given me are from thee eight because the words which thou gayest me I have given to them and they received them and knew in truth that I came forth from thee and believed that thou didst send me nine I pray for them I pray not for the world but for those whom thou hast given me because they are thine ten And all things that are mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them eleven And I am no longer in the world and these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep those in thy name whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are twelve While I was with them I kept them in thy name Those whom thou hast given me I watched over and none of them perished except the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled thirteen And now I come to thee and these things I speak in the world that they may have my joy made full in them fourteen I have given them thy word and the world hated them because they are not of the world as I am not of the world fifteen I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil sixteen They are not of the world as I am not of the world seventeen Sanctify them in the truth thy word is truth eighteen As thou didst send me into the world I also sent them into the world nineteen And for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also may be sanctified in the truth twenty And I pray not for these only but also for those who believe on me through their word twenty one that all may be one as thou Father in me and I in thee that they also may be in us that the world may believe that thou didst send me twenty two And the glory which thou hast given to me I have given to them that they may be one as we are one twenty three I in them and thou in me that they may be perfected into one that the world may know that thou didst send me and lovedst them as thou lovedst me twenty four Father those whom thou hast given me I will that where I am they also be with me that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me because thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world twenty five Righteous Father And the world knew thee not But I knew thee and these knew that thou didst send me twenty six and I made known to them thy name and will make it known that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them and I in them XVIII HAVING spoken these words Jesus went out with his disciples beyond the brook Kedron where was a garden into which he entered and his disciples two And Judas also his betrayer knew the place because Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples three Judas therefore having received the band and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees comes thither with torches and lamps and weapons four Jesus therefore knowing all the things that were coming upon him went forth and said to them Whom do ye seek five They answered him Jesus the Nazarene Jesus says to them I am he And Judas also his betrayer was standing with them six When therefore he said to them I am he they went backward and fell to the ground seven Again therefore he asked them Whom do ye seek And they said Jesus the Nazarene eight Jesus answered I told you that I am he if therefore ye seek me let these go their way nine that the saying might be fulfilled which he spoke Of those whom thou hast given me I lost none ten Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it and smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear The servant s name was Malchus eleven Jesus therefore said to Peter Put up thy sword into the sheath The cup which my Father has given me shall I not drink it twelve So the band and the captain and the officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound him thirteen and led him away to Annas first for he was father in law of Caiaphas who was high priest that year fourteen And it was Caiaphas who counseled the Jews that it is expedient that one man should die for the people fifteen And Simon Peter and the other disciple followed Jesus That disciple was known to the high priest and went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest sixteen But Peter was standing at the door without Therefore the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to her that kept the door and brought in Peter seventeen Then the damsel that kept the door says to Peter Art not thou also one of this man s disciples He says I am not eighteen And the servants and the officers were standing there having made a fire of coals because it was cold and were warming themselves and Peter was standing with them and warming himself nineteen The high priest therefore asked Jesus concerning his disciples and concerning his teaching twenty Jesus answered him I have spoken openly to the world I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple where all the Jews assemble and I spoke nothing in secret twenty one Why askest thou me Ask those who have heard what I spoke to them Behold these know what things I said twenty two And when he had said this one of the officers who was standing by gave Jesus a blow on the face saying Answerest thou the high priest so twenty three Jesus answered him If I spoke evil bear witness of the evil but if well why dost thou smite me twenty four Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest twenty five And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself They said therefore to him Art thou also one of his disciples He denied and said I am not twenty six One of the servants of the high priest being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off says Did not I see thee in the garden with him twenty seven Again therefore Peter denied and immediately a cock crowed twenty eight Then they lead Jesus from Caiaphas into the Governor s palace and it was early and they themselves went not into the palace that they might not be defiled but might eat the passover twenty nine Pilate therefore went out to them and said What accusation do ye bring against this man thirty They answered and said to him If this man were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up to thee thirty one Pilate therefore said to them Do ye take him and judge him according to your law The Jews therefore said to him It is not lawful for us to put any one to death thirty two that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke signifying by what manner of death he should die thirty three Pilate therefore entered into the palace again and called Jesus and said to him Art thou the King of the Jews thirty four Jesus answered Dost thou say this of thyself or did others tell thee concerning me thirty five Pilate answered Am I a Jew Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee up to me What didst thou thirty six Jesus answered My kingdom is not of this world If my kingdom were of this world my servants would fight that I might not be delivered up to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence thirty seven Pilate therefore said to him Art thou a king then Jesus answered Thou sayest it because I am a king To this end have I been born and to this end have I come into the world that I may bear witness to the truth Every one that is of the truth hears my voice thirty eight Pilate says to him What is truth And having said this he went out again to the Jews and says to them I find no fault in him thirty nine But ye have a custom that I should release to you one at the passover Do ye desire therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews forty They all therefore cried out again saying Not this one but Barabbas Now Barabbas was a robber XIX THEN therefore Pilate took Jesus and scourged him two And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head and put on him a purple robe and they came to him three and said Hail King of the Jews And they gave him blows on the face four Pilate went forth again and says to them Behold I bring him forth to you that ye may know that I find no fault in him five Jesus therefore came forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe And he says to them Behold the man six When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out saying Crucify him crucify him Pilate says to them Do ye take him and crucify him for I find no fault in him seven The Jews answered him We have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God eight When therefore Pilate heard this saying he was the more afraid nine And he went again into the palace and says to Jesus Whence art thou But Jesus gave him no answer ten Then says Pilate to him Dost thou not speak to me Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee and have power to crucify thee eleven Jesus answered Thou wouldst have no power against me except it were given thee from above Therefore he that delivers me to thee has the greater sin twelve Thenceforth Pilate sought to release him But the Jews cried out saying If thou let this man go thou art not a friend of Caesar Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar thirteen When therefore Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus forth and sat down on the judgment seat in a place called the Pavement and in Hebrew Gabbatha fourteen And it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour And he says to the Jews Behold your king fifteen But they cried out Away with him away with him crucify him Pilate says to them Shall I crucify your king The chief priests answered We have no king but Caesar sixteen Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified And they took Jesus and led him away seventeen And bearing his cross he went forth into the place called Place of a skull which in Hebrew is called Golgotha eighteen where they crucified him and two others with him on either side one and Jesus in the midst nineteen And Pilate wrote also a title and put it on the cross And the writing was JESUS THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS twenty This title therefore many of the Jews read because the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in Hebrew and Greek and Latin twenty one Therefore said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate Write not The King of the Jews but that he said I am King of the Jews twenty two Pilate answered What I have written I have written twenty three Then the soldiers when they crucified Jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also his coat And the coat was without a seam woven from the top throughout twenty four They said therefore to one another Let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which says They parted my garments among them And for my vesture they cast lots These things the soldiers did twenty five And there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother s sister Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary the Magdalene twenty six Jesus therefore seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by says to his mother Woman behold thy son twenty seven Then he says to the disciple Behold thy mother And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home twenty eight After this Jesus knowing that all things were now finished that the scripture might be accomplished says I thirst twenty nine Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they having filled a sponge with vinegar and put it on a hyssop stalk bore it to his mouth thirty When Jesus therefore received the vinegar he said It is finished and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit thirty one The Jews therefore since it was the preparation that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the sabbath for that sabbath day was a great day besought Pilate that their legs might be broken and they be taken away thirty two The soldiers came therefore and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with him thirty three But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead they broke not his legs thirty four But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith there came out blood and water thirty five And he that has seen has borne witness and his witness is true and he knows that he says what is true that ye also might believe thirty six For these things came to pass that the scripture might be fulfilled A bone of him shall not be broken thirty seven And again another scripture says They shall look on him whom they pierced thirty eight And after this Joseph from Arimathaea being a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus and Pilate gave him leave He came therefore and took away the body of Jesus thirty nine And there came also Nicodemus who at the first came to Jesus by night bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes about a hundred pounds weight forty They took therefore the body of Jesus and wound it in linen cloths with the spices as is the custom of the Jews to prepare for burial forty one And in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein no one was yet laid forty two There they laid Jesus therefore on account of the preparation of the Jews because the sepulchre was nigh at hand XX AND on the first day of the week Mary the Magdalene comes early while it is yet dark to the sepulchre and sees the stone taken away out of the sepulchre two She runs therefore and comes to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and says to them They took away the Lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they laid him three Peter therefore went forth and the other disciple and they went to the sepulchre four And the two ran together and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the sepulchre five And stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying yet he went not in six Then comes Simon Peter following him and he went into the sepulchre and sees the linen cloths lying seven and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen cloths but wrapped together in a place by itself eight Then therefore the other disciple who came first to the sepulchre went in also and he saw and believed nine For not even yet did they know the scripture that he must rise from the dead ten The disciples therefore went away again to their own home eleven And Mary was standing by the sepulchre without weeping So as she wept she stooped clown into the sepulchre twelve and beholds two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus lay thirteen And they say to her Woman why weepest thou She says to them Because they took away my Lord and I know not where they laid him fourteen Having said this she turned back and beholds Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus fifteen Jesus says to her Woman why weepest thou Whom dost thou seek She supposing that it was the gardener says to him Sir if thou didst bear him hence tell me where thou laidest him and I will take him away sixteen Jesus says to her Mary Turning she says to him in Hebrew Rabboni which is to say Teacher seventeen Jesus says to her Touch me not for I have not yet ascended to my Father but go to my brethren and say to them I ascend to my Father and your Father and my God and your God eighteen Mary the Magdalene comes bringing word to the disciples that she has seen the Lord and that he spoke these things to her nineteen When therefore it was evening on that day the first day of the week the doors having been shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in the midst and he says to them Peace be to you twenty And having said this he showed them his hands and his side The disciples rejoiced therefore when they saw the Lord twenty one Jesus therefore said to them again Peace be to you As the Father has sent me I also send you twenty two And having said this he breathed on them and says to them Receive the Holy Spirit twenty three Whosesoever sins ye remit they are remitted to them and whosesoever ye retain they are retained twenty four But Thomas one of the twelve called Didymus was not with them when Jesus came twenty five The other disciples therefore said to him We have seen the Lord But he said to them Except I see in his hands the print of the nails and thrust my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side I will not believe twenty six And after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas with them Jesus comes the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said Peace be to you twenty seven After that he says to Thomas Reach hither thy finger and see my hands and reach thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing twenty eight Thomas answered and said to him My Lord and my God twenty nine Jesus says to him Because thou hast seen me thou hast believed Happy they who saw not and have believed thirty Many other signs also did Jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book thirty one But these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that believing ye may have life in his name XXI AFTER these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias and he manifested himself in this manner two There were together Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciples three Simon Peter says to them I go a fishing They say to him We also go with thee They went forth and entered into the ship and in that night they caught nothing four But when morning was now come Jesus stood on the beach yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus five Jesus therefore says to them Children have ye anything to eat They answered him No six And he said to them Cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find They cast it therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of the fishes seven Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved says to Peter It is the Lord Simon Peter therefore hearing that it is the Lord girded on his outer garment for he was naked and cast himself into the sea eight And the other disciples came in the boat for they were not far from land but about two hundred cubits off dragging the net with the fishes nine When therefore they went out upon the land they see a fire of coals there and a fish lying thereon and bread ten Jesus says to them Bring of the fishes which ye just now caught eleven Simon Peter went on board and drew the net to land full of great fishes a hundred and fifty and three and though there were so many the net was not broken twelve Jesus says to them Come hither and break your fast And none of the disciples durst ask him Who art thou knowing that it is the Lord thirteen Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives to them and the fish likewise fourteen This the third time already Jesus manifested himself to his disciples after he was risen from the dead fifteen When therefore they had broken their fast Jesus says to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonah lovest thou me more than these He says to him Yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee He says to him Feed my lambs sixteen He says to him again a second time Simon son of Jonah lovest thou me He says to him Yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee He says to him Tend my sheep seventeen He says to him the third time Simon son of Jonah lovest thou me Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time Lovest thou me And he said to him Lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that I love thee Jesus says to him Feed my sheep eighteen Verily verily I say to thee when thou wast young thou didst gird thyself and walk whither thou wouldst but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and lead thee whither thou wouldst not nineteen And this he spoke signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God And having spoken this he says to him Follow me twenty Peter turning about sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following who also at the supper leaned back on his breast and said Lord who is he that betrays thee twenty one Peter seeing him says to Jesus Lord and what shall this man do twenty two Jesus says to him If I will that he remain till I come what is it to thee Do thou follow me twenty three This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die And Jesus said not to him that he should not die but If I will that he tarry till I come what is it to thee twenty four This is the disciple who testifies of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true twenty five And there are also many other things which Jesus did and if they should be written every one I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES I THE former narration I made O Theophilus concerning all things that Jesus began both to do and to teach two until the day when he was taken up after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he chose three to whom also he showed himself living after he had suffered by many infallible proofs during forty days appearing to them and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God four And being assembled together with them he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem but to wait for the promise of the Father which ye heard from me five for John indeed immersed in water but ye shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit not many days hence six They therefore having come together one six asked him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel seven And he said to them It is not yours to know times or seasons which the Father appointed by his own authority one seven eight But ye shall receive power when the Holy Spirit is come upon you and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and Samaria and unto the utmost part of the earth nine And having spoken these things while they beheld he was borne up and a cloud received him out of their sight ten And while they were looking intently into heaven as he went behold two men stood by them in white apparel eleven who also said Men of Galilee why stand ye looking into heaven This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye saw him going into heaven twelve Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet which is near Jerusalem a sabbath day s journey thirteen And when they came in they went up into the upper room where were abiding both Peter and James and John and Andrew Philip and Thomas Bartholomew and Matthew James the son of Alpheus and Simon Zelotes and Judas the brother of James fourteen These all continued with one accord in prayer with women and Mary the mother of Jesus and his brothers fifteen And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren and said the number of names together was about a hundred and twenty sixteen Men brethren it was necessary that the scripture should be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas who became guide to those who took Jesus seventeen Because he was numbered with us and obtained the office of this ministry eighteen Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed out nineteen And it became known to all who dwell at Jerusalem so that that field was called in their own tongue Aceldama that is Field of blood twenty For it is written in the book of Psalms Let his habitation be made desolate And let no one dwell therein And Let another take his office one twenty twenty one Therefore of these men who accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us twenty two beginning from John s immersion unto the day when he was taken up from us must one be made a witness with us of his resurrection twenty three And they appointed two Joseph called Barsabas who was surnamed Justus and Matthias twenty four And they prayed saying Thou Lord who knowest the hearts of all show which of these two thou didst choose twenty five that he may take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell away that he might go to his own place twenty six And they gave their lots one twenty six and the lot fell upon Matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles II AND when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place two And suddenly there came a sound out of heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting three And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributed among them and it sat upon each of them four And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance five Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews devout men from every nation under heaven six And this being noised abroad two six the multitude came together and were confounded because every man heard them speak in his own language seven And all were amazed and wondered saying one to another Behold are not all these who speak Galilaeans eight And how do we hear every man in our own tongue wherein we were born nine Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those who inhabit Mesopotamia Judaea and Cappadocia Pontus and Asia ten Phrygia and Pamphylia Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene and strangers of Rome both Jews and proselytes eleven Cretes and Arabians hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God twelve And all were amazed and were in doubt saying one to another What may this mean thirteen But others mocking said They are filled with sweet wine fourteen But Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said to them Men of Judaea and all that dwell in Jerusalem be this known to you and hearken to my words fifteen For these are not drunken as ye suppose for it is the third hour of the day sixteen But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel seventeen And it shall be in the last days saith God That I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy And your young men shall see visions And your old men shall dream dreams eighteen And even on my servants and on my handmaids I will pour out of my Spirit in those days And they shall prophesy nineteen And I will show wonders in heaven above And signs in the earth beneath Blood and fire and vapor of smoke twenty The sun shall be turned into darkness And the moon into blood Before the great and notable day of the Lord shall come twenty one And it shall be that every one who shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved twenty two Men of Israel hear these words Jesus the Nazarene a man accredited to you from God by miracles and wonders and signs which God wrought by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves know twenty three this man delivered up according to the established counsel and foreknowledge of God ye slew crucifying him by the hand of lawless ones twenty four whom God raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be held by it twenty five For David says concerning him I saw the Lord always before me Because he is on my right hand that I should not be moved twenty six For this my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted Moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope twenty seven Because thou wilt not abandon my soul to the underworld Nor wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption twenty eight Thou didst make known to me the ways of life Thou wilt make me full of joy with thy presence twenty nine Men brethren I may speak freely to you of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried and his sepulchre is among us unto this day thirty Being a prophet therefore and knowing that God swore to him with an oath that of the fruit of his loins one should sit on his throne thirty one he foreseeing spoke of the resurrection of the Christ that neither was his soul abandoned to the underworld nor did his flesh see corruption thirty two This Jesus God raised up whereof we all are witnesses thirty three Being therefore exalted to the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit he poured forth this which ye now see and hear thirty four For David did not ascend into heaven but he says himself The Lord said to my Lord Sit on my right hand thirty five Until I make thy foes thy footstool thirty six Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God made him this Jesus whom ye crucified both Lord and Christ thirty seven And hearing this they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles Men brethren what shall we do thirty eight And Peter said to them Repent and be each of you immersed upon the name of Jesus Christ unto remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit thirty nine For the promise is to you and to your children and to all those afar off as many as the Lord our God shall have called forty And with many other words did he bear witness and exhort saying Save yourselves from this perverse generation forty one They therefore having received two forty one his word were immersed and on that day there were added about three thousand souls forty two And they were constantly attending on the teaching of the apostles and the distribution and the breaking of bread and prayers forty three And fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were wrought through the apostles forty four And all that believed were together and had all things common forty five and sold their possessions and goods and divided them among all as any one had need forty six And daily attending with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house they partook of food with gladness and singleness of heart forty seven praising God and having favor with all the people And the Lord added to the church daily those who are saved two forty seven III AND Peter and John were going up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour two And a certain man lame from his mother s womb was carried along whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple the one called Beautiful to ask alms of those entering into the temple three who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked alms four And Peter looking intently upon him with John said Look upon us five And he gave heed to them expecting to receive something from them six And Peter said Silver and gold have I none but what I have that I give thee In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk seven And seizing him by the right hand he raised him up And immediately his feet and ankles received strength eight and leaping forth he stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God nine And all the people saw him walking and praising God ten and they recognized him that this was he who sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him eleven And as he held fast to Peter and John all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon s greatly wondering twelve And Peter seeing it answered to the people Men of Israel why wonder ye at this Or why look ye so intently on us as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man to walk thirteen The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the God of our fathers glorified his servant Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he decided to release him fourteen But ye denied the Holy and Just and demanded that a murderer should be granted to you fifteen But the Author of life ye killed whom God raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses three fifteen sixteen And his name upon the faith in his name made this man strong whom ye see and know and the faith which is through Him gave him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all seventeen And now brethren I know that ye acted in ignorance as also your rulers eighteen But thus God fulfilled what he before announced by the mouth of all his prophets that the Christ should suffer nineteen Repent therefore and turn that your sins may be blotted out in order that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord twenty and that he may send forth Jesus Christ before appointed for you twenty one whom the heavens indeed must receive until the times of the restoration of all things which God spoke of by the mouth of all his holy prophets from the beginning twenty two Moses said A Prophet will the Lord your God raise up to you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatever he shall say to you twenty three And it shall be that every soul that will not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people twenty four And also all the prophets from Samuel both he and they who followed as many as spoke also foretold these days twenty five Ye are sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers saying to Abraham And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed twenty six Unto you first God having raised up his servant Jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from your iniquities IV AND while they were speaking to the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them two being indignant because they taught the people and announced in Jesus the resurrection from the dead three And they laid hands on them and put them in prison unto the morrow for it was now evening four But many of those who heard the word believed and the number of the men became about five thousand five And it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes six and Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together unto Jerusalem seven And having set them in the midst they asked By what power or by what name did ye do this eight Then Peter filled with the Holy Spirit said to them Rulers of the people and elders of Israel nine if we are this day examined in respect to a good deed done to an impotent man by what means this person has been made whole ten be it known to you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead by him does this man stand here before you whole eleven He is the stone that was set at naught by you the builders which is become the head of the corner twelve And there is salvation in no other for neither is there any other name under heaven that is given among men in which we must be saved thirteen And seeing the boldness of Peter and John and perceiving that they were unlearned and obscure men they wondered and they recognized them that they were with Jesus fourteen And beholding the man who had been healed standing with them they had nothing to say against it fifteen But having commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves sixteen saying What shall we do to these men For that a notorious miracle has been done by them is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem and we are not able to deny it seventeen But that it spread no further among the people let us strictly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name eighteen And having called them they commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus nineteen But Peter and John answering said to them Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken to you rather than to God judge ye twenty For we can not but speak the things which we saw and heard twenty one And they having further threatened them let them go finding no way to punish them on account of the people because all glorified God for that which was done twenty two for the man was above forty years old on whom this sign of the healing had been wrought twenty three And being dismissed they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders said to them twenty four And they hearing it lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said Lord thou art he who made heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them twenty five who by the mouth of thy servant David said Why did the heathen rage four twenty five And the peoples imagine vain things twenty six The kings of the earth stood near And the rulers assembled together Against the Lord and against his Christ twenty seven For in truth there assembled in this city against thy holy servant Jesus whom thou didst anoint both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel twenty eight to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel before determined to be done twenty nine And now Lord behold their threatenings and grant to thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word thirty by stretching forth thy hand for healing and that signs and wonders may be wrought through the name of thy holy servant Jesus thirty one And when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and they spoke the word of God with boldness thirty two And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and of one soul and not one said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common thirty three And with great power the apostles gave the testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all thirty four For there was no one among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things sold thirty five and laid them at the feet of the apostles and distribution was made to each one according as he had need thirty six And Joseph who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas which is interpreted Son of consolation a Levite born in Cyprus thirty seven having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles V BUT a certain man named Ananias with Sapphira his wife sold a possession two and kept back part of the price his wife also being aware of it and brought a certain part and laid it at the feet of the apostles three But Peter said Ananias why did Satan fill thy heart that thou shouldst lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land four While it remained was it not thine own And after it was sold was it not in thine own power Why didst thou conceive this thing in thy heart Thou didst not lie to men but to God five And Ananias hearing these words fell down and expired and great fear came on all that heard these things six And the young men arose wrapt him up and carried him out five six and buried him seven And it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in eight And Peter answered her Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much And she said Yes for so much nine And Peter said to her Why is it that ye agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord Behold the feet of those who buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out ten And immediately she fell at his feet and expired and coming in the young men found her dead and carried her forth and buried her by her husband eleven And great fear came upon all the church and upon all that heard these things twelve And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one accord in Solomon s porch thirteen But of the rest no one dared to join himself to them but the people honored them fourteen and still more were believers added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women fifteen so that along the streets they brought forth the sick and laid them on beds and pallets that as Peter was passing the shadow at least might overshadow some one of them sixteen And the multitude also of the cities around came together to Jerusalem bringing sick persons and those who were vexed by unclean spirits and they were all healed seventeen But the high priest rose up and all that were with him which is the sect of the Sadducees and were filled with indignation eighteen and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the public prison nineteen But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and having brought them forth he said twenty Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life twenty one And hearing it they went into the temple at early dawn and taught And the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the eldership of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought twenty two But the officers when they came found them not in the prison and returning they reported twenty three saying The prison indeed we found shut with all security and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we opened them we found no one within twenty four And when the priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they were at a loss concerning them to what this might grow twenty five But one came and told them saying Behold the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people twenty six Then went the captain with the officers and brought them not with violence for they feared the people that they might not be stoned twenty seven And having brought them they set them before the council And the high priest asked them twenty eight saying Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name And behold ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man s blood upon us twenty nine And Peter answering and the apostles said We ought to obey God rather than men thirty The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom ye slew hanging him on a tree thirty one Him as a prince and a Savior did God exalt to his right hand to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins thirty two And we are his witnesses of these things and the Holy Spirit also which God gave to those who obey him thirty three And they hearing it were convulsed with rage and took counsel to slay them thirty four But there stood up one in the council a Pharisee named Gamaliel a teacher of the law honored by all the people and commanded to put the men forth a little while thirty five and said to them Men of Israel take heed to yourselves what ye are about to do in respect to these men thirty six For before these days arose Theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to naught thirty seven After this man arose Judas the Galilaean in the days of the registering and drew away much people after him he also perished and all as many as obeyed him were dispersed thirty eight And now I say to you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to naught thirty nine but if it is of God ye can not overthrow them lest haply ye be found also fighting against God forty And to him they assented and having called the apostles they scourged them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus and let them go forty one They therefore went rejoicing from the presence of the council because for that name they were counted worthy to suffer shame forty two And every day in the temple and from house to house they ceased not to teach and to publish the glad tidings of Jesus the Christ VI AND in these days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration two And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them and said It is not proper that we should leave the word of God and serve tables three Therefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of good repute full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom whom we will appoint over this business four But we will give ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word five And the saying pleased the whole multitude And they chose Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch six whom they set before the apostles and having prayed they laid their hands on them seven And the word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith eight And Stephen full of grace and of power did great wonders and signs among the people nine And there arose certain ones of the synagogue so called of the Freedmen six nine and Cyrenians and Alexandrians and of those from Cilicia and Asia disputing with Stephen ten And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke eleven Then they suborned men who said We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God twelve And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and coming upon him they seized him and brought him to the council thirteen and set up false witnesses Who said This man ceases not to speak words against this holy place and the law fourteen For we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us fifteen And all that sat in the council looking intently upon him saw his face as the face of an angel VII AND the high priest said Are then these things so two And he said Brethren and fathers hearken The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in Haran three and said to him Go forth from thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which I shall show thee four Then he went forth from the land of the Chaldaeans and dwelt in Haran and from thence after his father was dead he caused him to remove into this land wherein ye now dwell five And he gave him no inheritance in it not even a foot breadth and he promised to give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when he had no child six And God spoke after this manner that his seed shall be a sojourner in a strange land and they will bring them into bondage and afflict them four hundred years seven And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage I will judge said God and after that they shall come forth and shall serve me in this place eight And he gave him the covenant of circumcision and thus he begot Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and Isaac Jacob and Jacob the twelve patriarchs nine And the patriarchs moved with envy sold Joseph into Egypt And God was with him ten and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house eleven And there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan and a great affliction and our fathers found no sustenance twelve But Jacob hearing that there was grain in Egypt first sent out our fathers thirteen And at the second time Joseph was recognized by his brothers and the race of Joseph was made known to Pharaoh fourteen Then Joseph sent and called for Jacob his father and all his kindred threescore and fifteen souls fifteen And Jacob went down into Egypt and died he and our fathers sixteen and were removed to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem seventeen But as the time of the promise drew near which God declared to Abraham the people grew and multiplied in Egypt eighteen until another king arose who knew not Joseph nineteen He dealing subtly with our race afflicted our fathers so that they should cast out their infants that they might not be preserved alive twenty In which time Moses was born and was exceeding fair seven twenty who was nourished three months in his father s house twenty one And when he was cast out Pharaoh s daughter took him up and nourished him for herself as a son twenty two And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds twenty three And when he was forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the sons of Israel twenty four And seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avenged the one oppressed by smiting the Egyptian twenty five For he supposed his brethren would understand that God by his hand would deliver them but they understood not twenty six And on the following day he showed himself to them as they were contending and urged them to peace saying Ye are brethren why wrong ye one another twenty seven But he who was wronging his neighbor thrust him away saying Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us twenty eight Wilt thou kill me as thou didst kill the Egyptian yesterday twenty nine And Moses fled at this saying and became a sojourner in the land of Midian where he begot two sons thirty And when forty years were completed there appeared to him in the wilderness of the mount Sinai an angel in a flame of fire in a bush thirty one And Moses seeing it wondered at the sight and as he drew near to behold it the voice of the Lord came to him saving thirty two I am the God of thy fathers the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob And Moses trembled and durst not behold thirty three And the Lord said to him Loose the sandals from thy feet for the place where thou standest is holy ground thirty four Truly I saw the affliction of my people in Egypt and I heard their groaning and came down to deliver them And now come I will send thee into Egypt thirty five This Moses whom they denied saying Who made thee a ruler and a judge him did God send as a ruler and a redeemer by the hand seven thirty five of the angel who appeared to him in the bush thirty six He brought them out working wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red sea and in the wilderness forty years thirty seven This is the Moses who said to the children of Israel A Prophet will God raise up to you of your brethren like unto thirty eight This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him in the mount Sinai and with our fathers who received the living oracles to give to us thirty nine to whom our fathers would not be obedient but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt forty saying to Aaron Make us gods who shall go before us for as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt we know not what is become of him forty one And they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice to the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands forty two And God turned away and gave them up to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets Did ye offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices Forty years in the wilderness O house of Israel forty three And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch And the star of the god Remphan The figures which ye made to worship them And I will carry you away beyond Babylon forty four Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness as he who spoke to Moses commanded that he should make it according to the pattern that he had seen forty five which also our fathers received and brought in with Joshua into the possession of the heathen whom God drove out before our fathers unto the days of David forty six who found favor before God and asked that he might find a habitation for the God of Jacob forty seven But Solomon built a house for him forty eight Yet the Most High dwells not in temples made with hands as says the prophet forty nine Heaven is my throne And the earth is my footstool What house will ye build for me saith the Lord Or what is my place of rest fifty Did not my hand make all these things fifty one Stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears Ye always resist the Holy Spirit as your fathers did so do ye fifty two Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute And they slew those who announced beforehand concerning the coming of the Just One of whom ye have now become the betrayers and murderers fifty three who received the law as the ordinances of angels and kept it not fifty four Hearing these things they were enraged in their hearts and gnashed their teeth against him fifty five But being full of the Holy Spirit he looked intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and said fifty six Behold I see the heavens opened and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God fifty seven And crying out with a loud voice they stopped their ears and rushed upon him with one accord fifty eight and having cast him out of the city they stoned him And the witnesses laid off their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul fifty nine and stoned Stephen calling and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit sixty And kneeling down he cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge And saying this he fell asleep VIII AND Saul was consenting to his death And on that day there arose a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem and all were scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria except the apostles two And devout men carried Stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him three But Saul laid waste the church entering house after house and dragging both men and women committed them to prison four They therefore that were scattered went abroad preaching the word five And Philip went down to the city eight five of Samaria and preached to them the Christ six And the multitudes with one accord gave heed to the things said by Philip when they heard and saw the signs which he wrought seven For out of many who had unclean spirits they went forth crying with loud voice and many that were palsied and that were lame were healed eight And there was great joy in that city nine But a certain man named Simon was in the city before using sorcery and bewitching the people of Samaria saying that he was some great one ten to whom all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying This man is the great power of God eight ten eleven And to him they gave heed because for a long time they were bewitched by his sorceries twelve But when they believed Philip publishing the good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were immersed both men and women thirteen And Simon also himself believed and having been immersed he continued with Philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were wrought fourteen And the apostles in Jerusalem hearing that Samaria has received the word of God sent to them Peter and John fifteen who having come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit sixteen for he had not yet fallen upon any of them but they had only been immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus seventeen Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit eighteen And Simon seeing that through the laying on of the apostles hands the Holy Spirit was given offered them money nineteen saying Give me also this power that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Spirit twenty But Peter said to him Thy money perish with thee because thou didst think to obtain the gift of God with money twenty one Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter eight twenty one for thy heart is not right in the sight of God twenty two Repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray the Lord if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee twenty three For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity twenty four And Simon answering said Pray ye to the Lord for me that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me twenty five They therefore having testified and spoken the word of the Lord were returning to Jerusalem and publishing the good news to many villages of the Samaritans twenty six But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying Arise and go down to the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza This is desert twenty seven And he arose and went And behold a man of Ethiopia a eunuch an officer of state of Candace queen of the Ethiopians who was over all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem to worship twenty eight was returning and sitting in his chariot and he was reading the prophet Isaiah twenty nine And the Spirit said to Philip Go near and join thyself to this chariot thirty And Philip ran thither and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet And he said Understandest thou then what thou art reading thirty one And he said How could I except some one should guide me And he entreated Philip to come up and sit with him thirty two And the contents of the Scripture which he was reading was this He was led as a sheep to the slaughter And as a lamb dumb before his shearer So he opens not his mouth thirty three In his humiliation his judgment was taken away And his generation eight thirty three who shall fully declare For his life is taken away from the earth thirty four And the eunuch answering said to Philip I pray thee of whom does the prophet speak this Of himself or of some other man thirty five And Philip opened his mouth and beginning from this Scripture made known to him the good news of Jesus thirty six And as they went along the way they came to a certain water And the eunuch said See here is water what hinders that I should be immersed thirty seven eight thirty seven And Philip said If thou believest with all thy heart thou mayest And answering he said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God thirty eight And he commanded that the chariot should stop And they went down both into the water both Philip and the eunuch and he immersed him thirty nine And when they came up out of the water the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip and the eunuch saw him no more for he went on his way rejoicing forty But Philip was found at Azotus and passing through he published the good news to all the cities till he came to Caesarea IX BUT Saul yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord went to the high priest two and asked of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound to Jerusalem three And as he journeyed he came near Damascus And suddenly there flashed around him a light from heaven four and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying to him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me five And he said Who art thou Lord And the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest six But arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do seven And the men who journeyed with him were standing speechless hearing the voice but seeing no one eight And Saul arose from the earth and his eyes being opened he saw nothing and leading him by the hand they brought him into Damascus nine And he was three days without sight and neither ate nor drank ten And there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias and to him the Lord said in a vision Ananias And he said Behold I am here Lord eleven And the Lord said to him Arise and go into the street which is called Straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus For behold he prays twelve and in a vision he saw a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive sight thirteen And Ananias answered Lord I have heard from many concerning this man how great evils he did to thy saints at Jerusalem fourteen And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name fifteen But the Lord said to him Go for he is to me a chosen vessel to bear my name before Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel sixteen for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name s sake seventeen And Ananias went and entered into the house and putting his hands on him he said Brother Saul the Lord has sent me Jesus who appeared to thee in the way thou camest that thou mayest receive sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit eighteen And immediately there fell off from his eyes as it were scales and he received sight and arose and was immersed nineteen and having taken food he was strengthened And Saul was certain days with the disciples at Damascus twenty And straightway he preached Jesus in the synagogues that he is the Son of God twenty one And all that heard him were amazed and said Is not this he who destroyed in Jerusalem those who call on this name And he came hither for this purpose that he might bring them bound to the chief priests twenty two But Saul was more strengthened and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus proving that this is the Christ twenty three And when many days were completed the Jews took counsel to kill him twenty four But their lying in wait became known to Saul And they were watching the gates day and night to kill him twenty five But the disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall lowering him in a basket twenty six And Saul having come to Jerusalem attempted to join himself to the disciples and all were afraid of him not believing that he was a disciple twenty seven But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and related fully to them how he saw the Lord in the way and that he spoke to him and how he preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus twenty eight And he was with them going in and out at Jerusalem twenty nine and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and was speaking and disputing against the Grecian Jews but they were attempting to slay him thirty And the brethren learning it brought him down to Caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus thirty one The church therefore throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace being built up and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the consolation of the Holy Spirit was multiplied thirty two And it came to pass that Peter going through them all came down also to the saints who dwelt at Lydda thirty three And there he found a certain man named Aeneas who had lain upon a pallet eight years who was palsied thirty four And Peter said to him Aeneas Jesus the Christ makes thee whole arise and make thy bed And immediately he arose thirty five And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him and they turned to the Lord thirty six And there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha which interpreted is called Dorcas This woman was full of good works and of alms which she did thirty seven And it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died And having washed her they laid her in an upper chamber thirty eight And as Lydda was near to Joppa the disciples having heard that Peter was there sent to him two men entreating that he would not delay to come to them thirty nine And Peter arose and went with them When he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and showing coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them forty But Peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and turning to the body he said Tabitha arise And she opened her eyes and seeing Peter she sat up forty one And he gave her his hand and raised her up and calling the saints and widows he presented her alive forty two And it became known throughout all Joppa and many believed on the Lord forty three And it came to pass that he remained many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner X THERE was a certain man in Caesarea named Cornelius a centurion of the band called the Italian band two devout and one that feared God with all his house giving many alms to the people and praying to God always three He saw in a vision distinctly about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him and saying to him Cornelius four And fixing his eyes on him he was afraid and said What is it Lord And he said to him Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God five And now send men to Joppa and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter six He lodges with one Simon a tanner whose house is by the seaside seven And when the angel who spoke to Cornelius was gone he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him eight and having told them all these things he sent them to Joppa nine On the morrow as they were journeying and drawing near to the city Peter went up upon the house top to pray about the sixth hour ten And he became very hungry and desired to eat While they now were making ready there fell upon him a trance eleven and he beholds heaven opened and a certain vessel descending upon him as a great sheet bound by four corners and let down upon the earth twelve wherein were all the fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the air thirteen And there came a voice to him Arise Peter slay and eat fourteen But Peter said Not so Lord for I never ate anything common or unclean fifteen And a voice came to him again the second time What God cleansed call not thou common sixteen This was done thrice and the vessel was taken up again into heaven seventeen And while Peter was doubting in himself what the vision might be which he saw behold the men who were sent from Cornelius having made inquiry for Simon s house came and stood before the gate eighteen and calling they asked whether Simon who is surnamed Peter lodges here nineteen While Peter was earnestly considering the vision the Spirit said to him Behold men are seeking thee twenty But arise and go down and go with them making no scruple because I have sent them twenty one Peter went down to the men and said Behold I am he whom ye seek What is the cause for which ye are here twenty two And they said Cornelius a centurion a just man and one that fears God and of good report among all the nation of the Jews was warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee to his house and to hear words from thee twenty three He called them in therefore and lodged them And on the morrow Peter went forth with them and certain brethren from Joppa went with him twenty four And on the morrow after they entered into Caesarea And Cornelius was expecting them having called together his kinsmen and near friends twenty five And as Peter was coming in Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and did reverence to him twenty six But Peter raised him saying Stand up I myself also am a man twenty seven And while talking with him he went in and found many that were come together twenty eight And he said to them Ye know that it is unlawful ten twenty eight for a Jew to keep company with or come to one of another nation but God showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean twenty nine Wherefore I also came without delay when sent for I ask therefore for what reason did ye send for me thirty And Cornelius said Four days ago I was fasting unto this hour and at the ninth hour was praying in my house and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing thirty one and said Cornelius thy prayer was heard and thine alms were remembered before God thirty two Send therefore to Joppa and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter he lodges in the house of Simon a tanner by the sea side who when he comes will speak to thee thirty three Immediately therefore I sent to thee and thou didst well in coming hither Now therefore we are all present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee from the Lord thirty four And Peter opened his mouth and said Of a truth I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons thirty five but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him thirty six The word which he sent to the sons of Israel publishing glad tidings of peace through Jesus Christ he is Lord of all thirty seven ye know the thing which was done throughout all Judaea beginning from Galilee after the immersion which John preached Jesus of Nazareth thirty eight how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the Devil because God was with him thirty nine And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem whom they slew hanging him on a tree forty Him God raised on the third day and showed him openly forty one not to all the people but to witnesses before appointed by God to us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead forty two And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that it is he who has been appointed by God to be Judge of the living and dead forty three To him all the prophets bear witness that through his name every one who believes on him shall receive remission of sins forty four While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word forty five And those of the circumcision who believed as many as came with Peter were astonished that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit forty six For they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God Then answered Peter forty seven Can any one forbid the water that these should not be immersed who received the Holy Spirit even as we also forty eight And he commanded that they should be immersed in the name of the Lord Then they entreated him to remain certain days XI AND the apostles and the brethren throughout Judaea heard that the Gentiles also received the word of God two And when Peter went up to Jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended with him three saying Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them four But Peter rehearsed the matter to them in order from the beginning saying five I was in the city of Joppa praying and in a trance I saw a vision a certain vessel descending as a great sheet let down out of heaven by four corners and it came even to me six On which fixing my eyes I considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the air seven And I heard a voice saying to me Arise Peter slay and eat eight But I said Not so Lord for nothing common or unclean ever entered into my mouth nine But a voice answered me a second time out of heaven What God cleansed regard not thou as common ten And this was done three times and all were drawn up again into heaven eleven And behold immediately there stood three men at the house where I was having been sent to me from Caesarea twelve And the Spirit bade me go with them making no scruple And these six brethren also went with me and we entered into the man s house thirteen And he told us how he saw the angel in his house standing and saying to him Send to Joppa and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter fourteen who will speak to thee words whereby thou shalt be saved and all thy house fifteen And as I began to speak the Holy Spirit fell on them as also on us at the beginning sixteen and I remembered the word of the Lord how he said John indeed immersed in water but ye shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit seventeen If therefore God gave the like gift to them as to us having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ who then was I that I could withstand God eighteen When they heard these things they held their peace and glorified God saying So then to the Gentiles also God gave repentance unto life nineteen Now they who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose on account of Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch speaking the word to none but Jews twenty But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene who having come to Antioch spoke to the Greeks publishing the good news of the Lord Jesus twenty one And the hand of the Lord was with them and a great number believed and turned to the Lord twenty two But the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas to go as far as Antioch twenty three Who having come and seen the grace of God rejoiced and he exhorted all that with purpose of heart they should cleave to the Lord twenty four For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith And a great multitude was added to the Lord twenty five And Barnabas departed to Tarsus to seek for Saul twenty six and having found him he brought him to Antioch And it came to pass that a whole year they came together in the church and taught a great multitude and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch twenty seven And in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch twenty eight And there stood up one of them named Agabus and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great dearth over all the world which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar twenty nine And the disciples according as any one was prospered determined each of them to send relief to the brethren dwelling in Judaea thirty which also they did sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul XII AND about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to oppress twelve one certain of the church two And he slew James the brother of John with the sword three And seeing that it pleased the Jews he proceeded further to take Peter also then were the days of unleavened bread four whom he also seized and put in prison delivering him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after the passover to bring him forth to the people five Peter therefore was kept guarded in the prison but earnest prayer was made by the church to God on his behalf six And when Herod was about to bring him forth in that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and keepers before the door were guarding the prison seven And behold an angel of the Lord stood by him and a light shined in the prison and he smote Peter on the side and raised him saying Rise up quickly And his chains fell from off his hands eight And the angel said to him Gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and he did so And he said to him Cast thy garment about thee and follow me nine And he went out and followed him and knew not that what was done by the angel was true but thought he saw a vision ten And having passed the first and the second watch they came to the iron gate that leads into the city which opened to them of its own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and immediately the angel departed from him eleven And Peter having come to himself said Now I know truly that the Lord sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews twelve And becoming fully conscious of it he went to the house of Mary the mother of John who was surnamed Mark where many were gathered together and praying thirteen And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate a maidservant came to hearken named Rhoda fourteen And recognizing Peter s voice she opened not the gate for gladness but ran in and told that Peter was standing before the gate fifteen And they said to her Thou art mad But she confidently affirmed that it was even so And they said It is his angel sixteen But Peter continued knocking and opening the door they saw him and were amazed seventeen And beckoning to them with the hand to be silent he related to them how the Lord brought him out of the prison And he said Go tell these things to James and to the brethren And he departed and went to another place eighteen And when it was day there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what was become of Peter nineteen And Herod when he had sought for him and found him not after examining the keepers commanded that they should be led away to death And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea and there abode twenty And Herod was highly displeased with the Tyrians and Sidonians But they came with one accord to him and having made Blastus the king s chamberlain their friend desired peace because their country was nourished by that of the king twenty one And on a set day Herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made a speech to them twenty two And thereupon the people shouted The voice of a god and not of a man twenty three And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him because he gave not glory to God and he was eaten by worms and expired twenty four But the word of God grew and multiplied twenty five And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem having performed the service taking with them also John who was surnamed Mark XIII AND there were at Antioch in the church that was there prophets and teachers Barnabas and Simeon who was called Niger and Lucius the Cyrenean and Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch and Saul two And while they were ministering to the Lord and fasting the Holy Spirit said Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul unto the work to which I have called them three Then having fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away four They therefore being sent forth by the Holy Spirit came down to Seleucia and from thence they sailed away to Cyprus five And having come to Salamis they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews and they had also John as an assistant six And having gone through the island to Paphos they found a certain Magian a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar jesus seven who was with the proconsul of the country Sergius Paulus an intelligent man He having called for Barnabas and Saul desired to hear the word of God eight But Elymas the Magian for so his name is interpreted withstood them seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith nine Then Saul who is also called Paul filled with the Holy Spirit fixed his eyes on him ten and said O full of all deceit and all wickedness child of the Devil enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord eleven And now behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the sun for a season And immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness and going about he sought persons to lead him by the hand twelve Then the proconsul seeing what was done believed being astonished at the teaching of the Lord thirteen And Paul and his companions having put to sea from Paphos came to Perga in Pamphylia and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem fourteen But they going on from Perga came to Antioch in Pisidia and entering into the synagogue on the sabbath day they sat down fifteen And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them saying Men brethren if ye have any word of exhortation for the people speak sixteen And Paul arose and beckoning with the hand said Men of Israel and ye that fear God hearken seventeen The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers and he exalted the people in their sojourn in the land of Egypt and with a high arm he brought them out of it eighteen And about the time of forty years he nourished them thirteen eighteen in the wilderness nineteen And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan he gave them their land as a possession twenty about four hundred and fifty years And after that he gave judges until Samuel the prophet twenty one And afterward they desired a king and God gave them Saul the Son of Kish a man of the tribe of Benjamin for forty years twenty two And having removed him he raised up for them David to be their king to whom also he gave testimony saying I found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart who will do all my will twenty three Of the seed of this man God according to promise raised up to Israel a Savior Jesus twenty four John having first preached before his entrance the immersion of repentance to all the people of Israel twenty five Now as John was finishing his course he said Whom do ye suppose me to be I am not he But behold there comes one after me the sandal of whose feet I am not worthy to loose twenty six Men brethren children of the race of Abraham and whoever among you fears God to you the word of this salvation was sent forth twenty seven For they who dwell at Jerusalem and their rulers not knowing him nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day fulfilled them in condemning him twenty eight And though they found no cause of death they demanded of Pilate that he should be slain twenty nine And when they had fulfilled all the things written of him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb thirty But God raised him from the dead thirty one And he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem who are now his witnesses unto the people thirty two And we declare to you glad tidings of the promise made to the fathers thirty three that God has fulfilled this to us their children in raising Jesus as also it is written in the second psalm thirteen thirty three Thou art my Son I this day have begotten thee thirty four And that he raised him up from the dead to return no more to corruption he has thus spoken I will give to you the holy the sure promises of David thirty five Wherefore also in another psalm he says Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption thirty six For David having served his own generation according to the purpose of God fell asleep and was added to his fathers and saw corruption thirty seven But he whom God raised saw not corruption thirty eight Be it known to you therefore men brethren that remission of sins through this man is announced to you thirty nine and by him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye were not able to be justified by the law of Moses forty Beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets forty one Behold ye despisers and wonder and perish Because I work a work in your days A work which ye will not believe Though one should fully declare it to you forty two And as they were going out they besought that these words might be spoken to them on the next sabbath forty three And when the congregation was broken up many of the Jews and of the proselyte worshipers followed Paul and Barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of God forty four And on the next sabbath day almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God forty five But the Jews seeing the multitudes were filled with indignation and spoke against the things said by Paul contradicting and blaspheming forty six Then Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly and said It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you but since ye thrust it from you and judge yourselves not worthy of the eternal life lo we turn to the Gentiles forty seven For so has the Lord commanded us I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles That thou shouldst be for salvation to the end of the earth forty eight And the Gentiles hearing it rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were appointed unto eternal life believed forty nine And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region fifty But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out from their borders fifty one And they having shaken off the dust of their feet against them came to Iconium fifty two And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit XIV AND it came to pass in Iconium that they went together into the synagogue of the Jews and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and Greeks believed two But the Jews who disbelieved stirred up and embittered the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren three They spent a long time therefore speaking boldly in the Lord who gave testimony to the word of his grace granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands four But the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the Jews and part with the apostles five And when a movement was made both of the Gentiles and Jews with their rulers to abuse and stone them six they being aware of it fled to the cities of Lycaonia Lystra and Derbe and the region around seven and there they were publishing the good news eight And there sat a certain man at Lystra impotent in his feet being lame from his mother s womb who never walked nine This man was listening to Paul as he spoke who fixing his eyes on him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed ten said with a loud voice Stand upright on thy feet And he leaped up and walked eleven And the multitudes seeing what Paul did lifted up their voices saying in the speech of Lycaonia The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men twelve And they called Barnabas Jupiter and Paul Mercury because he was the chief speaker thirteen And the priest of Jupiter that was before the city having brought oxen and garlands to the gates would have offered sacrifice with the people fourteen But the apostles Barnabas and Paul hearing of it rent their clothes and rushed forth to the multitude crying out fifteen and saying Sirs why do ye these things We also are men of like nature with you bringing you glad tidings that ye should turn from these vanities to the living God who made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are therein sixteen who in the ages past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways seventeen although he left not himself without witness in that he did good giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling your hearts with food and gladness eighteen And with these sayings they hardly restrained the people from sacrificing to them nineteen But there came thither Jews from Antioch and Iconium and having persuaded the people and stoned Paul they drew him out of the city supposing that he was dead twenty But the disciples having gathered around him he rose up and came into the city and on the morrow he departed with Barnabas to Derbe twenty one And having published the good news to that city and made many disciples they turned back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch twenty two confirming the souls of the disciples exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much affliction enter into the kingdom of God twenty three And having appointed for them elders in every church they commended them with prayer and fasting to the Lord on whom they believed twenty four And after passing through Pisidia they came to Pamphylia twenty five And having spoken the word in Perga they went down to Attalia twenty six and thence they sailed away to Antioch from whence they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they accomplished twenty seven And having come and gathered the church together they reported how great things God wrought with them and that he opened to the Gentiles a door of faith twenty eight And they spent no little time with the disciples XV AND certain men coming down from Judaea taught the brethren Except ye are circumcised after the custom of Moses ye can not be saved two Paul and Barnabas having therefore had no little dissension and discussion with them they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question three They therefore having been sent forward by the church passed through Phoenicia and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they caused great joy to all the brethren four And having come to Jerusalem they were gladly received by the church and the apostles and elders and they reported how great things God wrought with them five But there arose some of those from the sect of the Pharisees who believed saying It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses six And the apostles and the elders came together to consider this matter seven And when there had been much discussion Peter arose and said to them Men brethren ye know that a long time ago God made choice among us that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the glad tidings and believe eight And God who knows the heart bore them witness giving to them the Holy Spirit as also to us nine and made no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith ten Now therefore why do ye tempt God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear eleven But through the grace of the Lord Jesus we believe that we shall be saved in the same manner as they also twelve And all the multitude became silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul narrating how great signs and wonders God wrought among the Gentiles through them thirteen And after they were silent James answered saying Men brethren hearken to me fourteen Simeon narrated how at first God visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name fifteen And with this agree the words of the prophets as it is written sixteen After this I will return And will rebuild the tabernacle of David which is fallen down And I will rebuild the ruins thereof and will set it up again seventeen that the rest of men may seek after the Lord And all the Gentiles upon whom my name has been called Saith the Lord who does these things fifteen seventeen eighteen Known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world nineteen Wherefore my judgment is that we trouble not those who from among the Gentiles are turning to God twenty but that we write to them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood twenty one For Moses of old time has in every city those who preach him being read in the synagogues every sabbath twenty two Then the apostles and the elders with the whole church resolved having chosen men from themselves to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas leading men among the brethren twenty three And they wrote by them thus The apostles and the elders and the brethren to the brethren from the Gentiles throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia greeting twenty four Forasmuch as we heard that some who went out from us troubled you with words subverting your souls saying that ye must be circumcised and keep the law fifteen twenty four to whom we gave no commandment twenty five it seemed good to us having become of one mind to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul twenty six men who have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ twenty seven We have sent therefore Judas and Silas who will themselves also by word tell you the same things twenty eight For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no further burden except these necessary things twenty nine that ye abstain from things offered to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye will do well Farewell thirty They therefore being dismissed came to Antioch and assembling the multitude they delivered the letter thirty one And having read it they rejoiced for the consolation thirty two And Judas and Silas also themselves being prophets exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed them thirty three And having remained a while they were dismissed with peace from the brethren to the apostles thirty four But it pleased Silas to abide there still fifteen thirty four thirty five Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch teaching and publishing the glad tidings of the word of the Lord with many others also thirty six And some days after Paul said to Barnabas Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they do thirty seven And Barnabas determined to take with them John who was surnamed Mark thirty eight But Paul thought it proper not to take with them him who departed from them from Pamphylia and went not with them to the work thirty nine And there arose a sharp contention so that they parted one from the other and Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus forty And Paul having chosen Silas went forth being commended by the brethren to the grace of God forty one And he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming the churches XVI AND he came down to Derbe and Lystra And behold a certain disciple was there named Timothy the son of a believing Jewish woman but whose father was a Greek two who was well reported of by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium three Him Paul wished to go forth with him and took and circumcised him on account of the Jews who were in those places for they all knew that his father was a Greek four And as they journeyed through the cities they delivered to them the decrees to keep that were ordained by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem five The churches therefore were established in the faith and increased in number daily six And having gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia and being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia seven they came to Mysia and attempted to go into Bithynia but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them eight And passing by Mysia they came down to Troas nine And a vision appeared to Paul in the night There stood a man a Macedonian beseeching him and saying Come over into Macedonia and help us ten And when he had seen the vision immediately we sought to go into Macedonia concluding that the Lord had called us to publish the good news to them eleven Therefore setting sail from Troas we ran with a straight course to Samothrace and on the following day to Neapolis twelve and from thence to Philippi which is a chief city of that part of Macedonia a colony And we continued in that city certain days thirteen And on the sabbath we went forth out of the gate by a river side where was wont to be a place of prayer and we sat down and spoke to the women who came together fourteen And a certain woman named Lydia a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira who worshiped God was listening whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul fifteen And when she was immersed and her household she besought us saying If ye have judged me to be a believer in the Lord come into my house and abide And she constrained us sixteen And it came to pass as we were going to the place of prayer a certain bondmaid having a spirit of divination met us who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying seventeen She having followed Paul and us cried saying These men are the servants of the most high God who announce to us the way of salvation eighteen And this she did many days But Paul being indignant sixteen eighteen turned and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out from her And he came out the same hour nineteen And her masters seeing that the hope of their gain departed laid hold of Paul and Silas and drew them into the market place before the rulers twenty And having brought them to the magistrates they said These men being Jews greatly disturb our city twenty one and teach customs which it is not lawful for us to receive or to observe being Romans twenty two And the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them with rods twenty three And having laid many stripes on them they cast them into prison charging the jailer to keep them safely twenty four who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks twenty five And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises to God and the prisoners listened to them twenty six And suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and the chains of all were loosed twenty seven And the jailer awaking out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open drew his sword and was about to kill himself supposing that the prisoners had fled twenty eight But Paul cried with a loud voice saying Do thyself no harm for we are all here twenty nine And calling for lights he sprang in and trembling fell down before Paul and Silas thirty and having brought them out he said Sirs what must I do to be saved thirty one And they said Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house thirty two And they spoke to him the word of the Lord and to all that were in his house thirty three And taking them along the same hour of the night he washed their stripes and was immersed himself and all his immediately thirty four And having brought them up into his house he set food before them and rejoiced with all his house believing in God thirty five And when it was day the magistrates sent the sergeants saying Let those men go thirty six And the keeper of the prison reported these words to Paul The magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace thirty seven But Paul said to them They beat us openly uncondemned being Romans and cast us into prison and now do they send us forth secretly Nay verily but let them come themselves and bring us out thirty eight And the sergeants reported these words to the magistrates and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans thirty nine And they came and besought them and bringing them out entreated them to depart out of the city forty And they went out of the prison and entered into the house of Lydia and seeing the brethren they exhorted them and departed XVII AND passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica where was the synagogue of the Jews two And Paul as his custom was went in to them and for three sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures three opening them and setting forth that the Christ must suffer and rise again from the dead and that this is the Christ Jesus whom I preach to you four And some of them believed and joined themselves to seventeen four Paul and Silas and of the devout Greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few five But the Jews moved with envy seventeen five having taken to them of the idlers in the market place certain vicious men and having gathered a crowd set the city in an uproar and assaulting the house of Jason they sought to bring them unto the people six And not finding them they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city crying These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also seven Whom Jason has received and all these are acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar saying that there is another king Jesus eight And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things nine And having taken security of Jason and of the others they let them go ten And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Beroea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews eleven These were more noble than those in Thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness and searched the Scriptures daily whether these things were so twelve Many of them therefore believed and of honorable Grecian women and men not a few thirteen But when the Jews of Thessalonica knew that also at Beroea the word of God was preached by Paul they came stirring up the people there also fourteen And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to journey as upon the sea but Silas and Timothy abode there still fifteen And they who conducted Paul brought him to Athens and having received a command to Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible they departed sixteen Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city full of idols seventeen Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons and in the market daily with those who met with him eighteen And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics were disputing with him And some said What would this babbler say and others He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods because he made known to them the good news of Jesus and the resurrection nineteen And taking hold of him they brought him upon Mars Hill saying May we know what this new doctrine is of which thou speakest twenty For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean twenty one Now all Athenians and the strangers residing there spent their leisure for nothing else but to tell or to hear something new twenty two And Paul standing in the midst of Mars Hill said Men of Athens in all things I perceive that ye are very devout twenty three For as I passed by and observed your objects of worship I found also an altar with this inscription TO AN UNKNOWN GOD Whom therefore not knowing ye worship him I announce to you twenty four The God who made the world and all things therein he being Lord of heaven and earth dwells not in temples made with hands twenty five nor is ministered to by human hands as if needing anything more himself giving to all life and breath and all things twenty six And he made of one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth having fixed the appointed seasons and bounds of their habitation twenty seven that they should seek the Lord if haply they might feel after him and find him although he is not far from every one of us twenty eight for in him we live and move and have our being as also some of your own poets have said For his offspring also are we twenty nine Being therefore God s offspring we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold or silver or stone graven by art and man s device thirty The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked but now commands all men everywhere to repent thirty one Because he fixed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he appointed having given assurance to all by raising him from the dead thirty two And when they heard of a resurrection of the dead some mocked and others said We will hear thee again of this matter thirty three And thus Paul departed from among them thirty four But certain ones joining themselves to him believed among whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them XVIII AFTER these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth two And finding a certain Jew named Aquila a native of Pontus lately come from Italy and Priscilla his wife because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome he came to them three and because he was of the same trade he abode with them and labored for by their occupation they were tentmakers four And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded both Jews and Greeks five And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia Paul was engrossed with the word testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ six But they opposing themselves and blaspheming he shook out his garments and said to them Your blood be upon your own head I am clean from henceforth I will go to the Gentiles seven And departing thence he entered into a certain man s house named Justus one who worshiped God whose house was adjoining the synagogue eight And Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were immersed nine And the Lord said to Paul through a vision in the night Be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace ten for I am with thee and no one shall assail thee to hurt thee for I have much people in this city eleven And he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them twelve And when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia the Jews rose up with one accord against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat thirteen saying This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law fourteen And as Paul was about to open his mouth Gallio said to the Jews If it were some injustice or wicked misdeed O Jews with reason I would have borne with you fifteen But if it is a question about a word and names and your own law look to it yourselves I will not be a judge of these things sixteen And he drove them away from the judgment seat seventeen But having all seized upon Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue they beat him before the judgment seat And Gallio cared for none of these things eighteen And Paul having remained yet many days took leave of the brethren and sailed thence to Syria and with him Priscilla and Aquila having shaven his head in Cenchrea for he had a vow nineteen And they came to Ephesus and he left them there but entering himself into the synagogue he reasoned with the Jews twenty And they desiring him to remain a longer time with them he consented not twenty one but took leave of them saying eighteen twenty one I must by all means keep the coming feast at Jerusalem but I will return again to you if God will And he sailed from Ephesus twenty two And having landed at Caesarea and gone up and saluted the church he went down to Antioch twenty three And after he had spent some time there he departed going through the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order strengthening all the disciples twenty four And a certain Jew named Apollos a native of Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures came to Ephesus twenty five This man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in spirit he spoke and taught correctly the things concerning Jesus knowing only the immersion of John twenty six And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue But Aquila and Priscilla having heard him took him to them and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly twenty seven And he wishing to pass through into Achaia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come contributed much to those who had believed through grace twenty eight For he powerfully confuted the Jews in public showing by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ XIX AND it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper districts came to Ephesus And finding certain disciples two he said to them Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed And they said to him Nay we did not even hear whether there is a Holy Spirit three And he said to them Unto what then were ye immersed And they said Unto John s immersion four Then said Paul John indeed immersed with the immersion of repentance saying to the people that they should believe on him who should come after him that is on Jesus five And when they heard this they were immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus six And Paul having laid his hands upon them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied seven And all the men were about twelve eight And he went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months reasoning and persuading them of the things concerning the kingdom of God nine But when some were hardened and believed not speaking evil of the Way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus ten And this continued for two years so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord both Jews and Greeks eleven And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul twelve so that also there were carried from his body to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out from them thirteen Then some of the wandering Jewish exorcists took upon them to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches fourteen And there were seven sons of one Sceva a Jewish chief priest who did this fifteen And the evil spirit answering said Jesus I know and Paul I well know but who are ye sixteen And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against both so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded seventeen And this became known to all both Jews and Greeks who dwelt at Ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified eighteen And many of the believers came confessing and declaring their deeds nineteen Many of those also who practiced curious arts brought together the books and burned them before all and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver twenty So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed twenty one When these things were ended Paul purposed to go to Jerusalem passing through Macedonia and Achaia saying After I have been there I must also see Rome twenty two And having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him Timothy and Erastus he himself stayed in Asia for a season twenty three And about that time there arose no small tumult concerning the Way twenty four For a certain man named Demetrius a silversmith who made silver shrines of Diana brought no small gain to the craftsmen twenty five whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation and said Sirs ye well know that by this craft we have our wealth twenty six Moreover ye see and hear that this Paul has persuaded and turned aside much people not only of Ephesus but of almost all Asia saying that they are not gods which are made with hands twenty seven And there is danger to us not only that this branch of business will come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be accounted nothing and her magnificence will be destroyed whom all Asia and the world worship twenty eight And hearing it they became full of wrath and continued crying out saying Great is Diana of the Ephesians twenty nine And the whole city was filled with confusion and they rushed with one accord into the theatre having seized Gaius and Aristarchus men of Macedonia Paul s companions in travel thirty And Paul wishing to enter in unto the people the disciples suffered him not thirty one And some also of the chiefs of Asia being his friends sent to him entreating him not to adventure himself into the theatre thirty two Some therefore were crying one thing and some another for the assembly was confused and the greater part knew not wherefore they had come together thirty three And they brought forward Alexander out of the multitude the Jews thrusting him forward And Alexander beckoned with the hand desiring to make his defense to the people thirty four But when they knew that he was a Jew one voice arose from all crying about two hours Great is Diana of the Ephesians thirty five And the town clerk having quieted the people said Men of Ephesus what human being is there who knows not that the city of the Ephesians is keeper of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from Jupiter thirty six These things being therefore undeniable ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly thirty seven For ye brought hither these men who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess thirty eight If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a matter against any man the law is open nineteen thirty eight and there are proconsuls let them implead one another thirty nine But if ye make any demand concerning other matters it shall be determined in the lawful assembly forty For we are in danger of being called in question for this day s riot there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse forty one And having thus spoken he dismissed the assembly XX AND after the tumult ceased Paul called to him the disciples and having embraced them departed to go into Macedonia two And having gone through those regions and given them much exhortation he came into Greece three And after he had stayed three months a plot being laid for him by the Jews as he was about sailing to Syria it was resolved that he should return through Macedonia four And there accompanied him unto Asia Sopater son of Pyrrhus a Beroean and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy and of Asia Tychicus and Trophimus five These having gone forward were waiting for us at Troas six But we sailed forth from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came to them to Troas in five days where we abode seven days seven And on the first day of the week we having come together to break bread Paul discoursed to them being about to depart on the morrow and continued the discourse until midnight eight Now there were many lights in the upper room where we were assembled nine And there sat on the window a certain young man named Eutychus being fallen into a deep sleep and as Paul was long discoursing he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead ten And Paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said Do not lament for his life is in him eleven And having come up again and broken the bread and eaten he talked a long while even till break of day and so departed twelve And they brought the young man living and were not a little comforted thirteen And we going forward to the ship embarked for Assos intending there to take in Paul for so he had appointed intending himself to go on foot fourteen And when he met with us at Assos we took him in and came to Mitylene fifteen And sailing thence we came the following day over against Chios and the next day we arrived at Samos and having tarried at Trogyllium we came the next day to Miletus sixteen For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus that he might not spend time in Asia for he was hastening if it were possible for him to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost seventeen And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church eighteen And when they were come to him he said to them Ye know from the first day that I came into Asia after what manner I have been with you the whole time nineteen serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind and with tears and trials which befell me by the plottings of the Jews twenty how I kept back nothing that was profitable that I should not announce it to you and teach you publicly and from house to house twenty one testifying to both Jews and Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ twenty two And now behold I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there twenty three save that the Holy Spirit witnesses to me in every city saying that bonds and afflictions await me twenty four But none of these things move me neither do I count my life dear to myself so that I may finish my course with joy twenty twenty four and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus to testify the good news of the grace of God twenty five And now behold I know that all ye among whom I went about preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more twenty six Wherefore I testify to you this day that I am pure from the blood of all twenty seven for I shunned not to declare to you the whole counsel of God twenty eight Take heed therefore to yourselves and to all the flock in which the Holy Spirit made you overseers to feed the church of the Lord twenty twenty eight which he purchased with his own blood twenty nine For I know this that after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you not sparing the flock thirty And from among yourselves will men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them thirty one Therefore watch remembering that for the space of three years night and day I ceased not to warn every one with tears thirty two And now brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace who is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all the sanctified thirty three I coveted no one s silver or gold or apparel thirty four Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me thirty five In all ways I showed you that so laboring ye ought to assist the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said It is more blessed to give than to receive thirty six And having thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all thirty seven And they all wept sorely and fell on Paul s neck and kissed him thirty eight sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken that they should behold his face no more And they accompanied him to the ship XXI AND it came to pass that after we had torn ourselves from them and had put to sea we came with a straight course to Coos and the day following to Rhodes and from thence to Patara two And finding a ship crossing over to Phoenicia we went aboard and put to sea three And bringing Cyprus in sight and leaving it on the left hand we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre for there the ship was to unlade her burden four And having found out the disciples we remained there seven days who said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not go up to Jerusalem five And when we had completed the days we departed and went our way they all accompanying us with wives and children till we were out of the city and we kneeled down on the beach and prayed six And having embraced one another we went on board the ship and they returned to their homes seven And we completing the voyage came down from Tyre to Ptolemais and having embraced the brethren we remained with them one day eight And on the morrow we departed and came to Caesarea and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist being one of the Seven we abode with him nine And this man had four daughters virgins who prophesied ten And while we were remaining several days there came down from Judaea a certain prophet named Agabus eleven And coming to us he took off Paul s girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said Thus says the Holy Spirit So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose this girdle is and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles twelve And when we heard these things both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem thirteen Then answered Paul What mean ye to weep and to break my heart For I am ready not only to be bound but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus fourteen And when he would not be persuaded we ceased saying The will of the Lord be done fifteen And after those days having packed up our baggage we went up to Jerusalem sixteen There went with us also some of the disciples from Caesarea bringing us to Mnason of Cyprus an old disciple with whom we should lodge seventeen And when we were come to Jerusalem the brethren received us gladly eighteen And on the following day Paul went in with us to James and all the elders were present nineteen And having embraced them he recounted particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles through his ministry twenty And they hearing it glorified the Lord And they said to him Thou seest brother how many thousands of Jews there are who believe and they are all zealots for the law twenty one And they were informed concerning thee that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses saying that they should not circumcise their children nor walk after the customs twenty two What is it therefore A multitude must surely come together for they will hear that thou hast come twenty three Do therefore this that we say to thee We have four men who have a vow on them twenty four these take with thee and purify thyself with them and bear the charges for them that they may shave their heads and all will know that those things of which they have been informed concerning thee are nothing but that thou thyself also walkest orderly keeping the law twenty five But concerning the Gentiles who have believed we wrote to them deciding that they should observe no such thing except that they keep themselves from things offered to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication twenty six Then Paul took the men and the next day having purified himself with them entered into the temple announcing the completion of the days of the purification until the offering was brought for each one of them twenty seven And as the seven days were about to be completed the Jews from Asia having observed him in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on him twenty eight crying out Men of Israel help This is the man who teaches all everywhere against the people and the law and this place and further also he brought Greeks into the temple and has polluted this holy place twenty nine For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian whom they supposed that Paul brought into the temple thirty And all the city was moved and the people ran together and laying hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple and forthwith the doors were shut thirty one And while they were seeking to kill him a report came up to the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem was in an uproar thirty two who immediately took with him soldiers and centurions and ran down to them and they seeing the chief captain and the soldiers left off beating Paul thirty three Then the chief captain came near and took hold of him and commanded him to be bound with two chains and inquired who he was and what he had done thirty four And some cried one thing some another among the multitude and not being able to know the certainty on account of the tumult he commanded him to be led into the castle thirty five And when he came upon the stairs so it was that he was borne by the soldiers on account of the violence of the people thirty six For the multitude of the people followed after crying Away with him thirty seven And as he was about to be led into the castle Paul says to the chief captain May I speak to thee And he said Canst thou speak Greek thirty eight Art thou not then the Egyptian who before these days made an uproar and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins thirty nine And Paul said I am a Jew of Tarsus a citizen of no obscure city of Cilicia and I beseech thee suffer me to speak to the people forty And he having given him permission Paul standing on the stairs beckoned with the hand to the people And a great silence ensuing he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue saying XXII BRETHREN and fathers hear my defense which I now make to you two And hearing that he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue they kept the more silence three And he says I am a Jew born indeed in Tarsus of Cilicia but brought up in this city taught at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strictness of the law of the fathers being zealous for God as ye all are this day four And I persecuted this Way unto death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women five As also the high priest bears me witness and all the eldership from whom moreover I received letters to the brethren and was journeying to Damascus to bring also those who were there bound to Jerusalem that they might be punished six And it came to pass that as I journeyed and came near to Damascus about midday there suddenly flashed around me a great light out of heaven seven And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me Saul Saul why persecutest thou me eight And I answered Who art thou Lord And he said to me I am Jesus the Nazarene whom thou persecutest nine And they who were with me beheld indeed the light and were afraid but the voice of him who spoke to me they heard not twenty two nine ten And I said What shall I do Lord And the Lord said to me Arise and go into Damascus and there it shall be told thee concerning all things which it is appointed thee to do eleven And as I could not see for the glory of that light being led by the hand by those who were with me I came into Damascus twelve And one Ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report from all the Jews who dwelt there thirteen came to me and standing by me said to me Brother Saul receive sight And I in that very hour looked up upon him fourteen And he said The God of our fathers appointed thee to know his will and to see the Just One and to hear a voice out of his mouth fifteen For thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and didst hear sixteen And now why tarriest thou Arise be immersed and wash away thy sins calling on his name seventeen And it came to pass when I had returned to Jerusalem and as I was praying in the temple that I was in a trance eighteen and saw him saying to me Make haste and go forth quickly out of Jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me nineteen And I said Lord they well know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believe on thee twenty and when the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed then I myself was standing by and consenting and keeping the garments of those who slew him twenty one And he said to me Depart for I will send thee far hence to the Gentiles twenty two And they heard him unto this word and then lifted up their voices and said Away with such a one from the earth for it was not fit that he should live twenty three And as they were crying out and throwing up their garments and casting dust into the air twenty four the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourging that he might know for what charge they were thus crying out against him twenty five And as they stretched him forth with the thongs twenty two twenty five Paul said to the centurion who stood by Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman and uncondemned twenty six The centurion hearing it he went and told the chief captain saying What art thou about to do For this man is a Roman twenty seven And the chief captain came and said to him Tell me art thou a Roman He said Yes twenty eight And the chief captain answered For a great sum I obtained this freedom And Paul said But I was born free twenty nine Immediately therefore they departed from him who were about to examine him and the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a Roman and because he had bound him thirty On the morrow wishing to know the certainty wherefore he was accused by the Jews he released him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together and he brought Paul down and set him before them XXIII AND Paul earnestly beholding the council said Men brethren I have lived in all good conscience before God unto this day two And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to smite him on the mouth three Then Paul said to him God will smite thee thou whited wall And dost thou sit to judge me according to the law and command me to be smitten contrary to law four And they that stood by said Revilest thou God s high priest five And Paul said I knew not brethren that he is high priest for it is written Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people six And Paul knowing that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees cried out in the council Men brethren I am a Pharisee the son of a Pharisee for the hope of the resurrection of the dead I am now judged seven And when he had said this there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the multitude was divided eight For Sadducees say that there is no resurrection nor angel nor spirit but Pharisees acknowledge both nine And there arose a great clamor and the scribes of the party of the Pharisees arose and contended saying We find no evil in this man but if a spirit spoke to him or an angel ten And a great dissension arising the chief captain fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces by them commanded the soldiery to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle eleven And the night following the Lord stood by him and said Be of good courage for as thou didst fully testify the things concerning me at Jerusalem so must thou testify also at Rome twelve And when it was day the Jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul thirteen And they were more than forty who made this conspiracy fourteen And they came to the chief priests and the elders and said We bound ourselves under a great curse to taste nothing until we have slain Paul fifteen Now therefore do ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down to you as though ye would ascertain more exactly the matters concerning him and we before he comes near are ready to kill him sixteen And the son of Paul s sister hearing of their lying in wait went and entered into the castle and told Paul seventeen Then Paul called one of the centurions to him and said Bring this young man to the chief captain for he has something to tell him eighteen So he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to thee as he has something to say to thee nineteen Then the chief captain took him by the hand and went aside privately and asked What is that thou hast to tell me twenty And he said The Jews agreed to desire thee that thou wouldst bring down Paul to morrow into the council as though they would inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him twenty one But do not thou yield to them for of them more than forty men are lying in wait for him who bound themselves with an oath neither to eat nor to drink till they have killed him and now they are ready looking for the promise from thee twenty two The chief captain therefore dismissed the young man having charged him to say to no one that thou didst show these things to me twenty three And calling to him two or three of the centurions he said Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea and seventy horsemen two hundred spearmen at the third hour of the night twenty four and let them provide beasts that they may set Paul thereon and bring him safe to Felix the governor twenty five And he wrote a letter after this manner twenty six Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix sends greeting twenty seven This man was taken by the Jews and was about to be killed by them but I came upon them with the soldiery and rescued him having learned that he is a Roman twenty eight And wishing to know the crime for which they were accusing him I brought him down into their council twenty nine whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law but having nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds thirty And being informed that a plot was about to be laid against the man I sent straightway to thee having also commanded the accusers to say before thee what they had against him Farewell thirty one The soldiers therefore as was commanded them took up Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris thirty two But on the morrow leaving the horsemen to go with him they returned to the castle thirty three who when they had entered into Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor presented Paul also before him thirty four And having read it he asked of what province he was And learning that he was from Cilicia thirty five he said I will hear thee fully when thy accusers are also come And he commanded him to be kept in the praetorium of Herod XXIV AND after five days the high priest Ananias came down with the elders and a certain orator named Tertullus who informed the governor against Paul two and he having been called Tertullus began to accuse him saying Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done for this nation through thy providence in every way and everywhere three we accept it most noble Felix with all thankfulness four But not to hinder thee too long I pray thee that thou wouldst hear us of thy clemency a few words five For we have found this man to be a pest and exciting disturbance among all the Jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes six who also attempted to profane the temple whom we took twenty four six and desired to judge according to our law seven But Lysias the chief captain came and with great violence took him away out of our hands eight commanding his accusers to come before thee from whom thou canst thyself ascertain by examination concerning all these things whereof we accuse him nine And the Jews also joined in assailing him saying that these things were so ten Then Paul the governor having beckoned to him to speak answered Knowing that thou hast been for many years a judge for this nation I do the more cheerfully answer for myself eleven inasmuch as thou mayest know that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship twelve and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any one or causing a tumult of the people nor in the synagogues nor in the city thirteen nor can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me fourteen But this I acknowledge to thee that according to the way which they call a sect so I worship the God of our fathers believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets fifteen having a hope toward God which these themselves also look for that there will be a resurrection both of the just and unjust sixteen Therefore do I also myself strive to have always a conscience void of offense toward God and men seventeen And after many years I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings eighteen Amidst which they found me purified in the temple not with a crowd nor with tumult but certain Jews from Asia caused it nineteen who ought to be here before thee and make accusation if they had aught against me twenty Or let these themselves say what crime they found in me while I stood before the council twenty one except for this one voice that I cried standing among them Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am judged by you this day twenty two And Felix put them off knowing the things concerning the Way more accurately saying When Lysias the chief captain shall come down I will fully inquire into your matters twenty three And he commanded the centurion that he should be guarded and should have indulgence and to forbid none of his acquaintance to minister to him twenty four And after certain days Felix came with his wife Drusilla who was a Jewess and sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ twenty five And as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and the judgment to come Felix trembled and answered Go thy way for this time when I have a convenient season I will call for thee twenty six He hoped also that money would be given him by Paul wherefore he sent for him the oftener and conversed with him twenty seven But after two years Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus and Felix wishing to gain favor with the Jews left Paul bound XXV FESTUS therefore having come into the province after three days went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem two And the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul and besought him three asking for themselves a favor against him that he would send for him to Jerusalem preparing an ambush to slay him on the way four But Festus answered that Paul was to be kept a prisoner at Caesarea and that he himself should soon go thither five Let them therefore said he who are powerful among you go down with me and accuse this man if there is any wickedness in him six And having tarried among them not more than eight or ten days he went down to Caesarea and on the morrow sitting on the judgment seat he commanded Paul to be brought seven And when he was come the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around bringing many and grievous charges which they could not prove eight while Paul said in defense Neither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar did I commit any offense nine But Festus wishing to gain favor with the Jews answered Paul and said Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these things before me ten And Paul said I stand at Caesar s judgment seat where I ought to be judged To Jews I did no wrong as thou also very well knowest twenty five ten eleven If then I am an offender and have done anything worthy of death I refuse not to die but if there be none of the things whereof these accuse me no man can give me up to them I appeal to Caesar twelve Then Festus having conferred with the council answered Thou hast appealed to Caesar to Caesar thou shalt go thirteen And after certain days Agrippa the king and Bernice came to Caesarea to salute Festus fourteen And as they were spending some days there Festus laid the case of Paul before the king saying There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix fifteen about whom when I was at Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews made complaint asking for judgment against him sixteen To whom I answered It is not a custom for Romans to give up any man before the accused has the accusers face to face and has opportunity to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him seventeen When therefore they had come together here without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth eighteen and standing up around him the accusers brought no accusation of such things as I supposed nineteen but had certain controversies with him concerning their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who was dead whom Paul affirmed to be alive twenty And I being perplexed in regard to the dispute about these things asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning them twenty one But Paul having appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of Augustus I commanded him to be kept until I shall send him up to Caesar twenty two And Agrippa said to Festus I would also hear the man myself To morrow said he thou shalt hear him twenty three On the morrow therefore Agrippa and Bernice having come with great pomp and entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at Festus command Paul was brought forth twenty four And Festus said King Agrippa and all men who are here present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews interceded with me both at Jerusalem and here Crying out that he ought not to live any longer twenty five But having found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and he himself having appealed to Augustus I determined to send him twenty six Of whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord Wherefore I brought him forth before you and specially before thee king Agrippa in order that the examination having been made I may have something to write twenty seven For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not also signify the charges against him XXVI AND Agrippa said to Paul Thou art permitted to speak for thyself Then Paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself two I think myself happy king Agrippa because I shall answer for myself before thee this day concerning all things whereof I am accused by Jews three especially since thou art expert in all the customs and questions among Jews Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently four My manner of life therefore from my youth which was from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem all Jews know five having known me from the first if they were willing to testify that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee six And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to the fathers seven unto which our twelve tribes earnestly serving day and night hope to attain concerning which hope O king I am accused by Jews eight Why is it judged incredible with you if God raises the dead nine I therefore thought to myself that I ought to do many hostile things against the name of Jesus the Nazarene ten Which I also did in Jerusalem and many of the saints did I myself shut up in prisons having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death I gave my voice against them eleven And punishing them often throughout all the synagogues I constrained them to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them I persecuted them also unto foreign cities twelve Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests thirteen at midday O king I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining around me and those who journeyed with me fourteen And we all having fallen to the earth I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecutest thou me It is hard for thee to kick against the goads fifteen And I said Who art thou Lord And he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest sixteen But arise and stand upon thy feet for I appeared to thee for this purpose to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things which thou sawest and of the things in which I will appear to thee seventeen delivering thee from the people and the Gentiles to whom I send thee eighteen to open their eyes that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may obtain forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among the sanctified by faith in me nineteen Wherefore O king Agrippa I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision twenty but to those in Damascus first and in Jerusalem and unto all the region of Judaea and to the Gentiles I announced that they should repent and turn to God doing works worthy of repentance twenty one For these causes the Jews seizing me in the temple attempted to kill me twenty two Having therefore obtained help from God I continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying nothing except those things which the prophets and Moses said should come twenty three whether the Christ should suffer whether he the first of the resurrection from the dead shall show light to the people and to the Gentiles twenty four And as he thus spoke for himself Festus said with a loud voice Paul thou art mad much learning makes thee mad twenty five But he said I am not mad most noble Festus but utter words of truth and soberness twenty six For the king knows well concerning these things to whom also I speak boldly for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this has not been done in a corner twenty seven King Agrippa believest thou the prophets I know that thou believest twenty eight And Agrippa said to Paul With little pains twenty six twenty eighta thou persuadest twenty six twenty eightb me to become a Christian twenty nine And Paul said I could pray God that with little or much twenty six twenty nine not only thou but also all that hear me this day may become such as I am except these bonds thirty And the king rose up and the governor and Bernice and they who sat with them thirty one And having withdrawn they talked together saying This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds thirty two And Agrippa said to Festus This man could have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar XXVII AND when it was determined that we should sail to Italy they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius of the Augustan band two And entering into a ship of Adramyttium about to sail along the coasts of Asia we put to sea Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessalonica being with us three And on the second day we landed at Sidon And Julius treated Paul humanely and permitted him to go to his friends and receive their care four And thence having put to sea we sailed under Cyprus because the winds were contrary five And having sailed over the sea along Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra a city of Lycia six And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy and he put us on board of it seven And sailing slowly many days and having come with difficulty over against Cnidus the wind not suffering us to put in twenty seven seven we sailed under Crete over against Salmone eight and coasting along it with difficulty we came to a certain place called Fair Havens near to which was the city Lasa nine And much time having been spent and the voyage being now dangerous because also the fast had already passed by Paul exhorted them ten saying Sirs I perceive that the voyage will be with violence and much loss not only of the lading and the ship but also of our lives eleven But the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than the things spoken by Paul twelve And as the haven was not well situated for wintering the greater number advised to sail thence also if by any means they might reach Phoenix a haven of Crete looking toward the southwest and northwest and there winter thirteen And a south wind beginning to blow moderately supposing that they had obtained their purpose they weighed anchor and coasted along close by Crete fourteen But not long after there struck against it a tempestuous wind called Euracylon fifteen And the ship being caught and unable to face the wind we yielded to it and were driven along sixteen And running under a certain small island called Clauda we were hardly able to come by the boat seventeen which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should be cast away on the quicksand they lowered the sail and so were driven eighteen And we being violently tempest tossed the next day they lightened the ship nineteen and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship twenty And neither sun nor stars appearing for many days and no small tempest lying on us thenceforward all hope that we should be saved was utterly taken away twenty one But after much abstinence then Paul standing up in the midst of then said Sirs ye should have hearkened to me and not put to sea from Crete and so have escaped this violence and loss twenty two And now I exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of life among you but only of the ship twenty three For there stood by me this night an angel of God whose I am and whom I serve twenty four saying Fear not Paul thou must stand before Caesar and lo God has given thee all those who sail with thee twenty five Wherefore sirs be of good cheer for I believe God that it will be even so as it has been told me twenty six But we must be cast away upon a certain island twenty seven And when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven onward in the Adriatic sea about midnight the seamen suspected that they were near to some country twenty eight and sounding they found twenty fathoms and having gone a little further they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms twenty nine Then fearing lest we should fall upon rocks they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for day thirty And as the seamen were seeking to flee out of the ship and had let down the boat into the sea under color as if they were about to extend anchors out of the foreship thirty one Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers Except these abide in the ship ye can not be saved thirty two Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let it fall off thirty three And while the day was coming on Paul besought them all to take food saying This day is the fourteenth day that ye have waited and continued fasting having taken nothing thirty four Wherefore I pray you to take food for this is for your safety for there shall not a hair fall from the head of one of you thirty five And having thus spoken he took bread and gave thanks to God in presence of them all and having broken it he began to eat thirty six Then were they all of good cheer and they also took food thirty seven And we were in all in the ship two hundred and seventy six souls thirty eight And when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship casting out the grain into the sea thirty nine And when it was day they knew not the land but they perceived a certain creek having a beach on which they determined if they were able to drive the ship ashore forty And cutting the anchors entirely away they abandoned them to the sea at the same time unfastening the bands of the rudders and hoisting the foresail to the wind they made toward the beach forty one And falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground and the prow sticking fast remained immovable but the stern was broken by the violence of the waves forty two And it was the plan of the soldiers that they should kill the prisoners lest any one should swim out and escape forty three But the centurion wishing to save Paul kept them from their purpose and commanded that those who could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and get to land forty four and the rest some on boards and others on some of the pieces from the ship And so it came to pass that all escaped safe to land XXVIII AND having escaped they then learned that the island is called Melita two And the barbarians showed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received us all because of the present rain and because of the cold three And Paul having gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came out a viper from the heat and fastened on his hand four And when the barbarians saw the animal hanging from his hand they said among themselves No doubt this man is a murderer whom though escaped from the sea justice suffered not to live five He however shaking off the animal into the fire suffered no harm six But they were expecting that he would become inflamed or suddenly fall down dead but after looking a great while and seeing no harm befall him they changed their minds and said that he was a god seven In the region around that place there were lands of the chief man of the island whose name was Publius who received and entertained us kindly three days eight Now it happened that the father of Publius was lying sick with a fever and a bloody flux to whom Paul entered in and having prayed laid his hands on him and healed him nine And this having been done the others also who had diseases in the island came and were healed ten who also honored us with many honors and when we put to sea they loaded us with such things as were necessary eleven And after three months we put to sea in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island whose sign was Castor and Pollux twelve And landing at Syracuse we remained three days thirteen And from thence making a circuit twenty eight thirteen we came to Rhegium And after one day a south wind arose and we came on the second day to Puteoli fourteen where we found brethren and were entreated to remain with them seven days and so we went toward Rome fifteen And from thence the brethren having heard of us came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns whom when Paul saw he gave thanks to God and took courage sixteen And when we came to Rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the commander of the camp but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him seventeen And it came to pass that after three days Paul called together those who were the chief men of the Jews and when they were come together he said to them Men brethren though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of our fathers yet I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans eighteen who when they had examined me wished to release me because there was no cause of death in me nineteen But as the Jews spoke against it I was compelled to appeal to Caesar not that I have anything to charge against my nation twenty For this cause therefore I called for you to see and to speak with you for on account of the hope of Israel I am compassed with this chain twenty one And they said to him We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee nor did any one of the brethren that came report or speak any evil concerning thee twenty two But we desire to hear from thee what thou thinkest for concerning this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against twenty three And having appointed a day for him they came to him in greater numbers to his lodging to whom he expounded testifying fully the kingdom of God and persuading them of the things concerning Jesus both from the law of Moses and the prophets from morning till evening twenty four And some believed the things spoken and some believed not twenty five And disagreeing among themselves they departed after Paul had spoken one word Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers twenty six saying Go to this people and say With the hearing ye will hear and will not understand And seeing ye will see and will not perceive twenty seven For the heart of this people is become gross And their ears are dull of hearing And their eyes they have closed Lest haply they see with their eyes And hear with their ears And understand with their heart And turn and I shall heal them twenty eight Be it known to you therefore that to the Gentiles the salvation of God was sent they moreover will hear twenty eight twenty nine thirty And Paul remained two whole years in his own hired house and gladly received all that came in to him thirty one preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence no one hindering him THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS I PAUL a servant of Jesus Christ a called apostle set apart unto the gospel of God two which he before announced through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures three concerning his Son who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh four who was declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead Jesus Christ our Lord five through whom we received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all the nations for his name s sake six among whom are ye also called of Jesus Christ seven to all the beloved of God that are in Rome called to be saints Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ eight First I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all that your faith is spoken of in all the world nine For God is my witness whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son how without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers ten making request if haply now at length I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you eleven For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established twelve that is to be comforted together among you by each other s faith both yours and mine thirteen Now I would not have you ignorant brethren that often times I purposed to come to you but was hindered hitherto that I might have some fruit among you also as among the rest of the Gentiles fourteen I am debtor both to Greeks and Barbarians both to wise and unwise fifteen So as far as lies in me I am ready to preach the good news to you also who are at Rome sixteen For I am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes to the Jew first and also to the Greek seventeen For therein is revealed a righteousness of God from faith to faith as it is written The just shall live by faith eighteen For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness one eighteen nineteen because that which may be known of God is manifest in them for God manifested it to them twenty For from the creation of the world his invisible things are clearly seen being perceived by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are one twenty without excuse twenty one Because knowing God they glorified him not as God nor gave thanks but became vain in their reasonings and their foolish heart was darkened twenty two Professing themselves to be wise they became fools twenty three and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things twenty four Wherefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness to dishonor their bodies among themselves twenty five who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever Amen twenty six For this cause God gave them up to vile passions for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature twenty seven and in like manner the men also leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was meet twenty eight And as they did not choose to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not becoming twenty nine being filled with all unrighteousness wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder strife deceit malignity whisperers thirty slanderers haters of God overbearing proud boasters devisers of evil things disobedient to parents thirty one without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful thirty two who knowing the judgment of God that they who commit such things are worthy of death not only do them but have pleasure in those who do them II WHEREFORE thou art without excuse O man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same things two Now we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who commit such things three And reckonest thou this O man that judgest those who do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of God four Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long suffering not knowing that the goodness of God is leading thee to repentance five and after thy hardness and impenitent heart art treasuring up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God six who will render to every man according to his deeds seven to those who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality eternal life eight but to those who are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath nine tribulation and distress upon every soul of man that works evil of the Jew first and also of the Greek ten but glory and honor and peace to every man that works good to the Jew first and also to the Greek eleven For there is no respect of persons with God twelve For as many as sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as sinned with law shall be judged by law thirteen for not the hearers of law are just before God but the doers of law shall be justified fourteen for when Gentiles who have no law do by nature the things required by law these having no law are a law to themselves fifteen who show the work of law written in their hearts their conscience witnessing therewith and their thoughts alternately accusing or also excusing two fifteen sixteen in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel seventeen But if thou art called a Jew and restest upon law and makest thy boast in God eighteen and knowest his will and approvest the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law nineteen and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of those who are in darkness twenty an instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes having the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law twenty one thou then that teachest another dost thou not teach thyself Thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal twenty two Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery Thou that abhorrest idols dost thou commit sacrilege two twenty two twenty three Thou that makest thy boast in law through the transgression of the law dishonorest thou God twenty four For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you as it is written twenty five For circumcision indeed profits if thou keep the law but if thou art a transgressor of law thy circumcision has become uncircumcision twenty six If then the uncircumcision keep the requirements of the law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision twenty seven And shall not the uncircumcision that is by nature if it fulfill the law judge thee who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of law twenty eight For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly nor is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh twenty nine But he is a Jew who is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God III WHAT then is the advantage of the Jew Or what is the benefit of circumcision two Much every way first indeed that they were intrusted with the oracles of God three For what if some did not believe Shall their unbelief make void the faithfulness of God four Far be it Yea let God be true and every man a liar as it is written That thou mayest be justified in thy words And mayest overcome when thou art judged five But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God what shall we say Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance I speak as a man six Far be it For then how shall God judge the world seven For if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory why am I also still judged as a sinner eight And why not as we are slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say Let us do evil that good may come Whose judgment is just nine What then Are we better No in no wise for we before charged that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin ten As it is written There is none righteous no no one eleven there is none that understands there is none that seeks after God twelve They are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that does good there is not so much as one thirteen Their throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of asps is under their lips fourteen whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness fifteen Their feet are swift to shed blood sixteen Destruction and misery are in their ways seventeen and the way of peace they have not known eighteen There is no fear of God before their eyes nineteen Now we know that whatever the law says it says to those under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God twenty Because by works of law no flesh shall be justified in his sight for by law is the knowledge of sin twenty one But now apart from law a righteousness of God has been manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets twenty two a righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all and upon all that believe for there is no difference twenty three for all sinned and come short of the glory of God twenty four being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus twenty five whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith by his blood for the exhibition of his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins before committed in the forbearance of God twenty six for the exhibition of his righteousness in this present time that he may be just and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus twenty seven Where then is the boasting It is excluded By what kind of law Of works Nay but by the law of faith twenty eight Therefore we reckon that a man is justified by faith apart from works of law Is he the God of Jews only twenty nine Is he not also of Gentiles Yes of Gentiles also thirty seeing that God is one who will justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through the faith thirty one Do we then make void law through the faith Far be it Yea we establish law IV WHAT then shall we say that Abraham our father found as pertaining to the flesh two For if Abraham was justified by works he has ground of boasting but not before God three For what says the Scripture And Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him for righteousness four Now to him that works the reward is not reckoned as of grace but as a debt five But to him that works not but believes on him who justifies the ungodly his faith is reckoned for righteousness six As also David speaks of the happiness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works seven Happy they whose iniquities were forgiven And whose sins were covered eight Happy the man to whom the Lord will not reckon sin nine Comes this happiness then on the circumcision or also on he uncircumcision For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness ten How then was it reckoned When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision Not in circumcision but in uncircumcision eleven And he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while in uncircumcision that he might be father of all that believe while in uncircumcision that the righteousness might be reckoned to them also twelve and father of circumcision to those who are not only of the circumcision but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while in uncircumcision thirteen For not through law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world but through the righteousness of faith fourteen For if they that are of law are heirs faith is made void and the promise is made of no effect fifteen For the law works wrath for where there is no law neither is there transgression sixteen For this cause it is of faith that it may be by grace in order that the promise may be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all seventeen as it is written A father of many nations have I made thee before God whom he believed who quickens the dead and calls the things that are not as though they were eighteen who against hope believed in hope that he should become father of many nations according to that which was spoken So shall thy seed be nineteen And being not weak in faith he considered not his own body already dead being about a hundred years old and the deadness of Sarah s womb twenty And in respect to the promise of God he wavered not through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God twenty one and being fully persuaded that what he has promised he is able also to perform twenty two Wherefore also it was reckoned to him for righteousness twenty three And it was not written for his sake alone that it was reckoned to him twenty four but for ours also to whom it shall be reckoned if we believe on him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead twenty five who was delivered up for our offenses and was raised for our justification V BEING justified therefore by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ two through whom also we obtained the access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God three And not only so but we rejoice in afflictions also knowing that affliction works patience four and patience approval and approval hope five and hope makes not ashamed because the love of God has been poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which was given to us six For when we were yet without strength in due season Christ died for the ungodly seven For scarcely for a righteous man will one die though for the good man perhaps some one does even dare to die eight But God commends his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us nine Much more therefore being now justified by his blood shall we be saved from the wrath through him ten For if being enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his son much more being reconciled shall we be saved by his life eleven and not only so but also rejoicing in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received the reconciliation twelve Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all sinned thirteen for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law fourteen But yet death reigned from Adam to Moses even over those who sinned not after the likeness of Adam s transgression who is a type of him who was to come fifteen But not as the trespass so also is the free gift for if by the trespass of the one the many died much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abound to the many sixteen And not as through one that sinned is the gift for the judgment came of one unto condemnation but the free gift came of many trespasses unto justification seventeen For if by the trespass of the one death reigned through the one much more they who receive the abundance of the grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the one Jesus Christ eighteen So then as through one trespass it came upon all men unto condemnation so also through one righteous act it came upon all men unto justification of life nineteen For as through the disobedience of the one man the many were constituted sinners so also through the obedience of the one will the many be constituted righteous twenty Moreover the law came in also that the trespass might abound But where sin abounded grace did much more abound twenty one that as sin reigned in death so also might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord VI WHAT then shall we say Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound two Far be it How shall we who died to sin live any longer therein three Know ye not that all we who were immersed into Jesus Christ were immersed into his death four We were buried therefore with him by the immersion into his death that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father so we also should walk in newness of life five For if we have become united with the likeness of his death we shall be also with that of his resurrection six knowing this that our old man was crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed in order that we should no longer be in bondage to sin seven For he that died has been justified from sin eight And if we died with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him nine knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more death has dominion over him no more ten For in that he died he died to sin once but in that he lives he lives to God eleven So also reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed to sin but alive to God through Jesus Christ twelve Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey the lusts thereof thirteen nor yield your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness but yield yourselves to God as being alive from the dead and your members to God as instruments of righteousness fourteen For sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under law but under grace fifteen What then Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace Far be it sixteen Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness seventeen But thanks be to God that ye were servants of sin but obeyed from the heart that form of teaching which was delivered to you six eighteen eighteen and being made free from sin ye became servants of righteousness nineteen I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh For as ye yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto sanctification twenty For when ye were servants of sin ye were free as to righteousness twenty one What fruit therefore had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed For the end of those things is death twenty two But now being made free from sin and become servants to God ye have your fruit unto sanctification and the end everlasting life twenty three For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord VII KNOW ye not brethren for I speak to those who know the law that the law has dominion over a man for so long a time as he lives two For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives but if the husband die she is loosed from the law of the husband three So then if while the husband lives she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if the husband die she is free from the law so that she is not an adulteress though she be married to another man four Wherefore my brethren ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ in order that ye should be married to another to him who was raised from the dead that we might bring forth fruit to God five For when we were in the flesh the emotions of sins which were by the law wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death six But now we are delivered from the law having died to that wherein we were held so that we serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of the letter seven What then shall we say Is the law sin Far be it But I had not known sin except through law for I had not known coveting if the law had not said Thou shalt not covet eight But sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of coveting For without law sin is dead nine And I was alive without law once but when the commandment came sin revived and I died ten And the commandment which was for life that I found to be for death eleven For sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me twelve So that the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good thirteen Has then that which is good become death to me Far be it But sin that it might appear sin working death to me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly sinful fourteen For we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin fifteen For what I perform I know not for not what I desire that do I but what I hate that I do sixteen But if what I desire not that I do I consent to the law that it is good seventeen Now then it is no longer I that perform it but the sin that dwells in me eighteen For I know that there dwells not in me that is in my flesh any good for to desire is present with me but to perform that which is good I find not nineteen For the good that I desire I do not but the evil that I desire not that I do twenty But if what I desire not that I do it is no more I that perform it but the sin that dwells in me twenty one I find then the law that when I desire to do good evil is present with me twenty two For I delight in the law of God after the inward man twenty three But I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members twenty four Wretched man that I am Who will deliver me from the body of this death twenty five I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord So then I myself with the mind serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin VIII THERE is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus two For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus set me free from the law of sin and death three For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh four that the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit five For they that are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh but they that are according to the Spirit the things of the Spirit six For to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace seven Because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it does not submit itself to the law of God neither indeed can it eight and they that are in the flesh can not please God nine But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you And if any man has not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his ten And if Christ is in you the body indeed is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness eleven And if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised up Christ from the dead will also quicken your mortal bodies because of his Spirit that dwells in you twelve So that brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh thirteen For if ye live according to the flesh ye shall die but if by the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live fourteen For as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are sons of God fifteen For ye did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye received the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father sixteen The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God seventeen and if children also heirs heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ if indeed we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him eighteen For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are of no account in comparison with the glory which shall be revealed in us nineteen For the earnest longing of the creation is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God twenty For the creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who made it subject in hope twenty one that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God twenty two For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now twenty three And not only so but ourselves also though we have the first fruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption the redemption of our body twenty four For we were saved in hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man sees why does he also hope for twenty five But if we hope for that we see not we with patience wait for it twenty six And in like manner does the Spirit also help our weakness for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered twenty seven And he who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God twenty eight And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God to those who are called according to his purpose twenty nine Because whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son that he might be the first born among many brethren thirty And whom he predestined them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified thirty one What then shall we say to these things If God is for us who shall be against us thirty two He who spared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not also with him freely give us all things thirty three Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God s chosen God is he that justifies thirty four who is he that condemns Christ is he that died yea rather that is risen again who is also at the right hand of God who also intercedes for us thirty five Who shall separate us from the love of Christ Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword thirty six As it is written For for thy sake we are killed all the day long We were accounted as sheep for slaughter thirty seven Nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us thirty eight For I am persuaded that neither death nor life neither angels nor principalities nor powers neither things present nor things to come thirty nine neither height nor depth nor any other created thing shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord IX I SAY the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit two that I have great grief and continual anguish in my heart three For I myself could wish to be accursed from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh four who are Israelites whose is the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service and the promises five whose are the fathers and of whom as to the flesh is Christ who is over all God blessed forever Amen six Not as though the word of God has failed For not all they are Israel who are of Israel seven neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children but In Isaac shall thy seed be called eight That is not they who are the children of the flesh are children of God but the children of the promise are reckoned as seed nine For the word of promise is this At this season I will come and Sarah shall have a son ten And not only so but when Rebecca also had conceived by one our father Isaac eleven for they being not yet born nor having done anything good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him who calls twelve it was said to her The elder shall serve the younger thirteen As it is written Jacob I loved But Esau I hated fourteen What then shall we say Is there unrighteousness with God Far be it fifteen For he says to Moses I will have mercy on whomsoever I have mercy and I will have compassion on whomsoever I have compassion sixteen So then it is not of him who wills nor of him who runs but of God who shows mercy seventeen For the Scripture says to Pharaoh Even for this very purpose did I raise thee up that I might show forth my power in thee and that my name might be declared in all the earth eighteen So that on whom he will he has mercy and whom he will he hardens nineteen Thou wilt say then to me Why then does he yet find fault For who resists his will twenty Nay but O man who art thou that repliest against God Shall the thing formed say to him who formed it Why didst thou make me thus twenty one Has not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor twenty two And what if God willing to show forth his wrath and to make known his power endured with much long suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction twenty three and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy which he had before prepared for glory twenty four whom he also called even us not from among the Jews only but also from among the Gentiles twenty five As also he says in Hosea I will call them my people who were not my people And her beloved who was not beloved twenty six And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them Ye are not my people there shall they be called Sons of the living God twenty seven And Isaiah cries concerning Israel Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea The remnant shall be saved twenty eight For he will finish the work nine twenty eighta And cut it short in righteousness Because a short work nine twenty eightb will the Lord make upon the earth twenty nine And as Isaiah has said before Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed We had become as Sodom And been made like to Gomorrah thirty What then shall we say That Gentiles who were not following after righteousness obtained righteousness the righteousness which is of faith thirty one but Israel following after a law of righteousness attained not to such a law thirty two Wherefore Because they sought it not by faith but as being by works of law For they stumbled against the stone of stumbling thirty three as it is written Behold I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense and he that believes on him shall not be put to shame X BRETHREN it is my heart s desire and prayer to God on their behalf that they might be saved two For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God but not according to knowledge three For not knowing the righteousness of God and seeking to establish their own righteousness they did not submit themselves to the righteousness of God four For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes five For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law The man that has done them shall live by them ten five six But the righteousness which is of faith says thus Say not in thy heart Who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down seven or Who shall descend into the abyss that is to bring up Christ from the dead eight But what says it The word is nigh thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach nine because if thou shalt profess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved ten For with the heart man believes unto righteousness and with the mouth profession is made unto salvation eleven For the Scripture says Whoever believes on him shall not be put to shame twelve For there is no difference between Jew and Greek for the same is Lord of all rich toward all that call upon him thirteen for every one who shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved fourteen How then shall they call on him on whom they believed not And how shall they believe on him of whom they heard not And how shall they hear without a preacher fifteen And how shall they preach unless they are sent forth As it is written How beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad tidings of peace Who bring glad tidings of good things sixteen But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings For Isaiah says Lord who believed our report seventeen So then faith comes of hearing and hearing by the word of God eighteen But I say did they not hear Yes verily Their sound went forth into all the earth And their words unto the ends of the world nineteen But I say did Israel not know First Moses says I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are no people By a foolish nation I will move you to anger twenty But Isaiah is very bold and says I was found by those who sought me not I became manifest to those who asked not after me twenty one But of Israel he says All the day long I stretched forth my hands To a disobedient and gainsaying people XI I SAY then did God cast away his people Far be it For I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin two God did not cast away his people whom he foreknew Know ye not what the Scripture says in the story of Elijah how he pleads with God against Israel saying three Lord they killed thy prophets and digged down thine altars and I was left alone and they seek my life four But what says the answer of God to him I reserved to myself seven thousand men who bowed not the knee to Baal five Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace six And if by grace it is no longer of works otherwise grace becomes no longer grace eleven six But if of works it is no longer grace otherwise work is no longer work seven What then What Israel seeks after that he obtained not but the election obtained it and the rest were hardened eight According as it is written God gave them a spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day nine And David says Let their table be made a snare and a trap And a stumbling block and a recompense to them ten Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see And bow down their back alway eleven I say then did they stumble in order that they should fall Far be it But by their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles to provoke them to jealousy twelve But if their fall is the riches of the world and their diminution the riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness thirteen For I am speaking to you Gentiles inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles I magnify my office fourteen if by any means I may provoke to emulation those who are my flesh and may save some of them fifteen For if the casting away of them is the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead sixteen And if the first fruit is holy so also is the lump and if the root is holy so also are the branches seventeen And if some of the branches were broken off and thou being a wild olive tree wert grafted in among them and became a partaker with them of the root and the fatness of the olive tree eighteen boast not over the branches But if thou boast it is not thou that bearest the root but the root thee nineteen Thou wilt say then The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in twenty Well because of their want of faith they were broken off and thou standest by thy faith Be not high minded but fear twenty one for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee twenty two Behold then the goodness and severity of God toward those who fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off twenty three And they also if they continue not in their unbelief shall be grafted in for God is able again to graft them in twenty four For if thou wast cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree twenty five For I would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that hardness has come upon Israel in part until the fullness of the Gentiles come in twenty six And so all Israel shall be saved as it is written There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob twenty seven and this is the covenant from me to them when I shall take away their sins twenty eight As concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as concerning the election they are beloved for the fathers sakes twenty nine For unrepented are the gifts and the calling of God thirty For as ye in times past disobeyed God but now obtained mercy through their disobedience thirty one so also they now disobeyed through the mercy shown to you that they also might obtain mercy thirty two For God included all in disobedience eleven thirty two that he might have mercy upon all thirty three Oh the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out thirty four For Who knew the mind of the Lord Or who became his counselor thirty five Or who first gave to him and it shall be given back to him again thirty six For of him and through him and unto him are all things to him be the glory forever Amen XII I BESEECH you therefore brethren by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice holy well pleasing to God which is your rational service two And be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may discern what is the will of God the good and well pleasing and perfect three For I say through the grace given to me to every one that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God imparted to each one the measure of faith four For as we have many members in one body and all the members have not the same office five so we the many are one body in Christ and severally members one of another six And having gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith seven or ministry let us wait on the ministry or he that teaches on the teaching eight or he that exhorts on the exhortation he that gives let him do it with simplicity he that presides with diligence he that shows mercy with cheerfulness nine Let love be unfeigned Abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good In brotherly love ten be kindly affectioned one to another in honor preferring one another eleven in diligence not slothful in spirit fervent serving the Lord twelve in hope rejoicing in affliction patient in prayer persevering thirteen communicating to the necessities of the saints twelve thirteen given to hospitality fourteen Bless those who persecute you bless and curse not fifteen Rejoice with those who rejoice weep with those who weep sixteen Be of the same mind one toward another Aspire not to things that are high but condescend to the lowly Be not wise in your own conceits seventeen Recompense to no one evil for evil Provide things honorable in the sight of all men eighteen If it be possible as far as depends on you be at peace with all men nineteen Avenge not yourselves beloved but give place to the wrath of God For it is written To me belongs vengeance I will recompense saith the Lord twenty Therefore If thy enemy hungers feed him If he thirsts give him drink For in doing this Thou wilt heap coals of fire on his head twenty one Be not overcome by evil but overcome evil with good XIII LET every soul submit himself to the higher powers For there is no power but from God the powers that be have been ordained by God two So that he who resists the power resists the ordinance of God and they that resist will receive to themselves condemnation three For rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil And dost thou wish not to be afraid of the power Do that which is good and thou wilt have praise from it four for he is God s minister to thee for good But if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he bears not the sword in vain for he is God s minister an avenger for wrath to him that does evil five Wherefore it is necessary to submit yourselves not only because of the wrath but also for conscience sake six For for this cause ye pay tribute also for they are God s ministers attending continually to this very thing seven Render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honor to whom honor eight Owe no one anything but to love one another for he that loves another has fulfilled the law nine For this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not covet and if there is any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ten Love works no ill to one s neighbor therefore love is the fulfillment of the law eleven And that knowing the time that it is high time that we already were awaked out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed twelve The night is far advanced the day is at hand Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light thirteen Let us walk becomingly as in the day not in reveling and drunkenness not in lewdness and wantonness not in strife and envying fourteen but put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts XIV HIM that is weak in faith receive not for the decision of disputes two For one believes that he may eat all things but he that is weak eats herbs three Let not him that eats despise him that eats not and let not him that eats not judge him that eats for God received him four Who art thou that judgest another s servant To his own master he stands or falls But he shall be made to stand for God is able to make him stand five One man esteems one day above another another esteems every day alike Let each one be fully persuaded in his own mind six He that regards the day regards it to the Lord and he that eats eats to the Lord for he gives thanks to God and he that eats not to the Lord he eats not and gives thanks to God seven For none of us lives to himself and none dies to himself eight For if we live we live to the Lord and if we die we die to the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lord s nine For to this end Christ died and lived that he might be Lord of both the dead and living ten But why dost thou judge thy brother Or why dost thou despise thy brother For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God eleven For it is written As I live saith the Lord to me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess to God fourteen eleven twelve So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God thirteen Let us therefore no longer judge one another but judge this rather not to put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in a brother s way fourteen I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean of itself but to him that accounts anything to be unclean to him it is unclean fifteen But if because of food thy brother is grieved thou no longer walkest in accordance with love Destroy not him by thy food for whom Christ died sixteen Let not then your good be evil spoken of seventeen For the kingdom of God is not food and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit eighteen For he that in these things serves Christ is well pleasing to God and approved by men nineteen So then let us follow after the things which make for peace and things by which one may edify another twenty For the sake of food destroy not the work of God All things indeed are pure but it is evil for that man who eats with offense twenty one It is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor anything whereby thy brother stumbles or is made to offend or is weak twenty two Hast thou faith Have it to thyself before God Happy is he that judges not himself in that which he allows twenty three And he that doubts is condemned if he eat because it is not of faith and all that is not of faith is sin XV NOW we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves two Let each one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification three For also Christ pleased not himself but as it is written The reproaches of those who reproached thee fell on me four For whatever things were written afore time were for our instruction that we through patience and consolation of the Scriptures may have hope five And the God of patience and consolation grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus six that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ seven Wherefore receive ye one another as Christ also received us to the glory of God eight For I say that Jesus Christ has been made a minister of the circumcision for the sake of God s truth in order to confirm the promises made to the fathers nine and that the Gentiles should glorify God for his mercy as it is written For this cause I will give thee praise among Gentiles And to thy name will sing ten And again he says Rejoice ye Gentiles with his people eleven And again Praise the Lord all ye Gentiles And extol him all ye peoples twelve And again Isaiah says There shall be the root of Jesse And he who rises up to rule the Gentiles On him will Gentiles hope thirteen And the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit fourteen And I myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also yourselves are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another fifteen But I wrote the more boldly to you brethren in part as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me by God sixteen that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles ministering as a priest in the gospel of God that the offering up of the Gentiles may be acceptable being sanctified by the Holy Spirit seventeen I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus as to things pertaining to God eighteen For I will not dare to speak of any of the things which Christ wrought not through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed nineteen in the power of signs and wonders in the power of the Holy Spirit so that from Jerusalem and around as far as to Illyricum I have fully preached the good news of Christ twenty being emulous so to preach the good news not where Christ was named lest I should build upon another s foundation twenty one but as it is written They to whom it was not announced concerning him shall see And they that have not heard shall understand twenty two For which cause also for the most part I was hindered from coming to you twenty three But now having no longer place in these regions and having a great desire these many years to come to you twenty four whenever I go into Spain I hope to see you in my journey and to be sent forward thither by you if first I shall be satisfied in a measure with your company twenty five But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints twenty six For Macedonia and Achaia thought it good to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who were at Jerusalem twenty seven For they thought it good and their debtors are they For if the Gentiles shared in their spiritual things they ought also to minister to them in carnal things twenty eight When therefore I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit I will go by you into Spain twenty nine And I know that when I come to you I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ thirty And I beseech you brethren by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me thirty one that I may be delivered from the unbelieving in Judaea and that my service which is for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints thirty two that with joy I may come to you by the will of God and may with you be refreshed thirty three And the God of peace be with you all Amen XVI I COMMEND to you Phoebe our sister who is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchraea two that ye receive her in the Lord as becomes saints and assist her in whatever business she may have need of you for she has been a helper of many and of myself three Salute Prisca and Aquila my fellow laborers in Christ Jesus four who for my life laid down their own necks to whom not only I give thanks but also all the churches of the Gentiles five and salute the church that is in their house Salute Epenetus my beloved who is the first fruits of Asia unto Christ six Salute Mary who bestowed much labor on us sixteen six seven Salute Andronicus and Junia my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners who are of note among the apostles who also were in Christ before me eight Salute Amplias my beloved in the Lord nine Salute Urbanus our fellow laborer in Christ and Stachys my beloved ten Salute Apelles the approved in Christ Salute those of the household of Aristobulus eleven Salute Herodion my kinsman Salute those of the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord twelve Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa who labor in the Lord Salute Persis the beloved who labored much in the Lord thirteen Salute Rufus the chosen in the Lord and his mother and mine fourteen Salute Asyncritus Phlegon Hermes Patrobas Hernias and the brethren who are with them fifteen Salute Philologus and Julia Nereus and his sister and Olympas and all the saints who are with them sixteen Salute one another with a holy kiss All the churches of Christ salute you seventeen Now I beseech you brethren to mark those who cause divisions and offenses contrary to the teaching which ye learned and avoid them eighteen For they that are such serve not our Lord Christ but their own belly and by their good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple nineteen For your obedience is come abroad unto all men I rejoice therefore over you but I would have you wise as to that which is good and simple as to that which is evil twenty And the God of peace will shortly bruise Satan under your feet The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you Amen twenty one Timothy my fellow laborer salutes you and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater my kinsmen twenty two I Tertius who wrote the letter salute you in the Lord twenty three Gaius my host and of the whole church salutes you Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you and Quartus the brother twenty four The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all Amen twenty five Now to him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery kept in silence during eternal ages twenty six but now made manifest and through the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the eternal God made known to all nations for obedience to the faith twenty seven to God only wise through Jesus Christ be the glory forever Amen THE FIRST LETTER OF PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS I PAUL a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God and Sosthenes the brother two to the church of God which is at Corinth those sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord both theirs and ours three Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ four I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus five that in everything ye were made rich in him in all utterance and all knowledge six according as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you seven so that ye are behind in no gift waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ eight who will also confirm you unto the end unaccused in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ nine God is faithful by whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord ten But I beseech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment eleven For it was made known to me concerning you my brethren by those of the house of Chloe that there are contentions among you twelve And I mean this that each of you says I am of Paul and I of Apollos and I of Cephas and I of Christ thirteen Is Christ divided Was Paul crucified for you Or were ye immersed in the name of Paul fourteen I thank God that I immersed none of you but Crispus and Gaius fifteen that no one may say that I immersed in my own name sixteen And I immersed also the household of Stephanas besides I know not whether I immersed any other seventeen For Christ did not send me to immerse but to preach the glad tidings not with wisdom of speech lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect eighteen For the preaching of the cross is to those who perish foolishness but to us who are saved it is the power of God nineteen For it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise And will bring to nothing the prudence of the prudent twenty Where is the wise Where is the scribe Where is the disputer of this world Did not God make foolish the wisdom of the world twenty one For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe twenty two since Jews require signs and Greeks seek after wisdom twenty three but we preach Christ crucified to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness twenty four but to those who are the called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God twenty five Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men twenty six For see your calling brethren that not many are wise after the flesh not many mighty not many noble twenty seven but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame the wise and God chose the weak things of the world that he might put to shame the things which are strong twenty eight and the base things of the world and the things which are despised did God choose and the things which are not that he might bring to naught things that are twenty nine that no flesh should glory before God thirty But of him are ye in Christ Jesus who from God was made wisdom to us both righteousness and sanctification and redemption thirty one that according as it is written He that glories let him glory in the Lord II I ALSO when I came to you brethren came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God two For I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified three And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling four And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of man s wisdom but with demonstration of the Spirit and of power five that your faith might not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God six But we speak wisdom among those who are perfect but a wisdom not of this world nor of the rulers of this world who come to naught seven But we speak God s wisdom in a mystery the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the worlds unto our glory eight which no one of the rulers of this world has known for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory nine but as it is written things which eye saw not nor ear heard and which entered not into the heart of man which God prepared for those who love him ten but to us God revealed them by his Spirit for the Spirit searches all things even the deep things of God eleven For who among men knows the things of a man save the spirit of the man which is in him So also the things of God no one knows but the Spirit of God twelve And we received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of God that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God thirteen Which things also we speak not in words taught by man s wisdom but in those taught by the Spirit comparing spiritual things with spiritual two thirteen fourteen But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness to him and he can not know them because they are spiritually judged fifteen But he that is spiritual judges all things but he himself is judged by no one sixteen For who knew the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him But we have the mind of Christ III I ALSO brethren was not able to speak to you as spiritual but as carnal as babes in Christ two I fed you with milk and not with meat for ye were not yet able to bear it nay nor even now are ye able three For ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and do ye not walk as men four For when one says I am of Paul and another I am of Apollos are ye not carnal five Who then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers through whom ye believed even as the Lord gave to each one six I planted Apollos watered but God gave the increase seven So then neither is he that plants anything nor he that waters but God that gives the increase eight And he that plants and he that waters are one and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor nine For we are God s fellow laborers ye are God s field God s building ten According to the grace of God which was given to me as a wise master builder I laid a foundation and another builds thereon But let each one take heed how he builds thereon eleven For other foundation can no one lay than that which is laid which is Jesus Christ twelve And if any one builds on this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble thirteen the work of each one will be made manifest for the day will show it because it is revealed in fire and the fire itself will prove of what sort is each one s work fourteen If any one s work which he built thereon remains he will receive reward fifteen If any one s work shall be burned up he will suffer loss but he himself will be saved yet so as through fire sixteen Know ye not that ye are God s temple and that the Spirit of God dwells in you seventeen If any one defiles three seventeen the temple of God him will God destroy for the temple of God is holy the which are ye eighteen Let no one deceive himself If any one seems to be wise among you in this world let him become a fool that he may become wise nineteen For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God For it is written He that takes the wise in their craftiness twenty And again The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise That they are vain twenty one So then let no one glory in men For all things are yours twenty two whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours twenty three and ye are Christ s and Christ is God s IV SO let a man account us as ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God two Moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful three But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by man s day four three nay neither do I judge myself four For I am conscious to myself of nothing yet am I not hereby justified but he that judges me is the Lord five So then judge not anything before the time until the Lord come who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall each one have his praise of God six And these things brethren I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes that in us ye may learn not to go beyond that which is written that ye be not puffed up each for one against another seven For who makes thee to differ And what hast thou that thou didst not receive But if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it eight Already ye are filled full already ye became rich without us ye reigned as kings and I would ye did reign that we also might reign with you nine For I think that God set forth us the apostles last as condemned to death for we have become a spectacle to the world both to angels and to men ten We are fools for Christ s sake but ye are wise in Christ we are weak but ye are strong ye are honorable but we are despised eleven Even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place twelve and labor working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it thirteen being defamed we entreat we have become as the filth of the world the offscouring of all things unto this day fourteen I write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons I admonish you fifteen For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ yet have ye not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I begot you through the gospel sixteen I beseech you therefore be followers of me four sixteen seventeen For this cause I sent to you Timothy who is my child beloved and faithful in the Lord who will bring to your remembrance my ways in Christ as I teach everywhere in every church eighteen Now some were puffed up as though I were not coming to you nineteen But I will come to you shortly if the Lord will and will know not the word of those who are puffed up but the power twenty For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power twenty one What will ye Shall I come to you with a rod or in love and the spirit of meekness V IT is commonly reported that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles that one should have his father s wife two And ye are puffed up and did not rather mourn that he who did this deed might be taken away from among you three For I verily as absent in body but present in spirit have already judged as though I were present concerning him who has so done this four in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ye being gathered together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ five to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus six Your glorying is not good Know ye not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump seven Cleanse out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump according as ye are unleavened For our passover Christ was sacrificed for us eight therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth nine I wrote to you in my letter not to keep company with fornicators ten yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or idolaters for then ye must needs go out of the world eleven But as it is I wrote to you not to keep company if any one called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such a one not even to eat twelve For what have I to do with judging those also who are without Do not ye judge those who are within thirteen But those who are without God judges Therefore put away that wicked man from among yourselves VI DARE any one of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints two Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world And if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters three Know ye not that we shall judge angels How much more the things of this life four If then ye have judgments about things of this life set those to judge who are of no esteem in the church five I speak to your shame Is it so that there is not a wise man among you not even one that shall be able to judge between his brethren six but brother goes to law with brother and that before unbelievers seven Now therefore it is altogether a fault among you because ye go to law one with another Why do ye not rather take wrong Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded eight Nay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethren nine Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God Be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor the effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind ten nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God eleven And such were some of you but ye were washed but ye were sanctified but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God twelve All things are lawful for me but not all things are expedient all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of anything thirteen Meats for the belly and the belly for meats but God will destroy both it and them But the body is not for fornication but for the Lord and the Lord for the body fourteen And God both raised the Lord and will also raise up us by his power fifteen Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot Far be it sixteen Know ye not that he who is joined to a harlot is one body For the two says he shall be one flesh seventeen But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit eighteen Flee fornication Every sin that a man commits is without the body but he that commits fornication sins against his own body nineteen Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom ye have from God and ye are not your own twenty For ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body VII NOW concerning the things whereof ye wrote to me It is good for a man not to touch a woman two but because of fornication let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband three Let the husband render to the wife her due and in like manner the wife also to the husband four The wife has not power over her own body but the husband and in like manner the husband also has not power over his own body but the wife five Defraud not one the other except it be with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come again together that Satan may not tempt you on account of your incontinency six But this I say by way of permission not of command seven But I would that all men were as myself But each one has his own gift from God one after this manner and another after that eight And I say to the unmarried and the widows it is good for them if they remain as I also am nine But if they have not self control let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn ten And the married not I command but the Lord that the wife depart not from the husband eleven But if she have departed let her remain unmarried or let her be reconciled to her husband and let the husband not put away his wife twelve But to the rest say I not the Lord If any brother has a wife that believes not and she is pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away thirteen And a woman who has a husband that believes not and he is pleased to dwell with her let her not leave her husband fourteen For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband else your children are unclean but now they are holy fifteen But if the unbelieving departs let him depart The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases but God has called us to peace sixteen For what knowest thou O wife whether thou shalt save thy husband Or what knowest thou O man whether thou shalt save thy wife seventeen Only as the Lord apportioned to each one as God has called each one so let him walk And so I ordain in all the churches eighteen Was any one called being circumcised Let him not become uncircumcised Has any one been called in uncircumcision Let him not be circumcised nineteen Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of God twenty Let each one abide in the same calling wherein he was called twenty one Wast thou called being a servant Care not for it but if thou canst become free use it rather twenty two For he that was called in the Lord being a servant is the Lord s freedman in like manner also the freeman being called is Christ s servant twenty three Ye were bought with a price become not servants of men twenty four Brethren let every man wherein he was called therein abide with God twenty five Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord but I give my judgment as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful twenty six I consider therefore that this is good on account of the present necessity that it is good for a man so to be twenty seven Art thou bound to a wife Seek not to be loosed Art thou loosed from a wife Seek not a wife twenty eight But if also thou marry thou sinnedst not and if a virgin marry she sinned not But such shall have affliction in the flesh but I spare you seven twenty eight twenty nine But this I say brethren the time that remains is short that both they who have wives may be as though they had none thirty and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not thirty one and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world is passing away thirty two But I would have you without cares He that is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord how he shall please the Lord thirty three but he that is married cares for the things of the world how he shall please his wife thirty four There is a difference also between the wife and the virgin The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord that she may be holy both in body and spirit but she that is married cares for the things of the world how she shall please her husband thirty five And this I say for your own profit not that I may cast a snare upon you but for that which is seemly and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction thirty six But if any one thinks that he behaves himself unseemly toward his virgin if she be past the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sins not let them marry thirty seven But he that stands steadfast in his heart having no necessity but has power over his own will and has determined this in his heart that he will keep his virgin does well thirty eight So that both he that gives her in marriage does well and he that gives her not in marriage does better thirty nine A wife is bound as long as her husband lives but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the Lord forty But she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and I too think that I have the Spirit of God VIII NOW concerning the things offered to idols we know that we all have knowledge Knowledge puffs up but love edifies two If any one thinks that he knows anything he has known nothing yet as he ought to know three But if any one loves God the same is known by him four As concerning then the eating of the things offered to idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no other God but one five For though there are gods so called whether in heaven or on earth as there are gods many and lords many six yet to us there is but one God the Father of whom are all things and we unto him and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we by him seven But there is not in all men this knowledge for some with a consciousness till now of the idol eat it as a thing offered to an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled eight But food commends us not to God for neither if we eat are we the better nor if we eat not are we the worse nine But take heed lest haply this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak ten For if any one sees thee who hast knowledge reclining at table in an idol s temple will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat the things offered to idols eleven And through thy knowledge he that is weak perishes the brother for whom Christ died twelve But when ye so sin against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against Christ thirteen Wherefore if food cause my brother to offend I will eat no flesh for ever more that I may not cause my brother to offend IX AM I not an apostle Am I not free Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord Are not ye my work in the Lord two If I am not an apostle to others yet at least I am to you for the seal of my apostleship are ye in the Lord three This is my answer to those who examine me four Have we not power to eat and to drink five Have we not power to lead about a sister as a wife as well as the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas six Or have only I and Barnabas not power to forbear working seven Who ever goes to war at his own charges Who plants a vineyard and eats not of the fruit thereof Or who tends a flock and eats not of the milk of the flock eight Say I these things as a man Or does not the law also say these things nine For it is written in the law of Moses Thou shalt not muzzle an ox while treading out the grain Is it for the oxen that God cares ten Or does he say it altogether for our sakes For for our sakes it was written that he who plows ought to plow in hope and he who threshes in hope of partaking eleven If we sowed for you the things that are spiritual is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things twelve If others partake of this power over you do not we still more But we used not this power but we bear all things that we may not cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ thirteen Do ye not know that they who minister about the holy things eat of the temple and they who wait at the altar partake with the altar fourteen So also did the Lord appoint to those who preach the gospel to live by the gospel fifteen But I have used none of these things and I wrote not these things that it should be so done to me for it were better for me to die than that any one should make my glorying void sixteen For if I preach the gospel I have nothing to glory of for a necessity is laid upon me for woe is to me if I preach not the gospel seventeen For if I do this willingly I have a reward but if unwillingly I have a stewardship intrusted to me eighteen What then is my reward That in preaching the gospel I may make the gospel without charge that I use not to the full my power in the gospel nineteen For being free from all men I made myself servant to all that I might gain the more twenty And to the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain Jews to those under law as under law not being myself under law that I might gain those under law twenty one to those without law as without law not being without law to God but under law to Christ that I might gain those without law twenty two To the weak I became as weak that I might gain the weak I have become all things to all that I may by all means save some twenty three And all things I do for the gospel s sake that I may become a partaker thereof with others nine twenty three twenty four Know ye not that they who run in a race all indeed run but one receives the prize So run that ye may obtain twenty five And every one who contends for the prize is temperate in all things they indeed to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible twenty six I therefore so run as not uncertainly I so fight as not beating the air twenty seven But I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest haply having preached to others I myself should be rejected X FOR I would not have you ignorant brethren that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea two and were all immersed unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea three and all ate the same spiritual food four and all drank the same spiritual drink for they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was Christ five But in the most of them God had no pleasure for they were overthrown in the wilderness six Now these things were examples to us in order that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted seven Nor be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play eight Nor let us commit fornication as some of them did and fell in one day three and twenty thousand nine Nor let us tempt Christ as some of them tempted and perished by the serpents ten Nor murmur ye as some of them murmured and perished by the destroyer eleven Now all these things happened to them as examples and they were written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the ages are come twelve Wherefore let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall thirteen There has no temptation taken you but such as belongs to man and God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted beyond what ye are able but will with the temptation make also the way of escape that ye may be able to bear it fourteen Wherefore my beloved flee from idolatry fifteen I speak as to wise men judge ye what I say sixteen The cup of blessing which we bless is it not a partaking of the blood of Christ The loaf which we break is it not a partaking of the body of Christ seventeen Because we the many are one loaf one body for we all share in that one loaf eighteen Behold Israel according to the flesh Are not they who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar nineteen What then do I say That an idol is anything or that what is offered to idols is anything twenty Nay but that what they sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God and I would not that ye should be partakers of the demons twenty one Ye can not drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons ye can not share in the table of the Lord and the table of demons twenty two Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy Are we stronger than he twenty three All things are lawful but not all things are expedient all things are lawful but not all things edify twenty four Let no one seek his own but his neighbor s good twenty five Whatever is sold in the market eat asking no question for conscience sake twenty six for the earth is the Lord s and the fullness thereof twenty seven If any of the unbelieving bids you to a feast and ye choose to go whatever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake twenty eight But if any one say to you This is a thing sacrificed to a god eat it not for his sake that showed it and for conscience sake twenty nine Conscience I say not thine own but that of the other for why is my liberty judged by another s conscience thirty If I partake with thanks why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks thirty one Whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatever ye do do all to the glory of God thirty two Give no occasion of stumbling either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God thirty three as I also please all in all things not seeking my own profit but that of the many that they may be saved one BE ye followers of me as I also am of Christ two Now I praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and hold fast the traditions eleven two as I delivered them to you three And I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God four Every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonors his head five But every woman praying or prophesying with the head uncovered dishonors her head for it is one and the same as if she were shaven six For if a woman is not covered let her also be shorn but if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered seven For a man indeed ought not to cover his head being the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man eight For the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man nine And the man was not created for the woman but the woman for the man ten For this cause ought the woman to have the token of authority on her head because of the angels eleven Nevertheless neither is the woman without the man nor the man without the woman in the Lord twelve For as the woman is of the man so also is the man by the woman but all things of God thirteen Judge in your own selves is it seemly that a woman pray to God uncovered fourteen Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame to him fifteen But if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering sixteen But if any man seems to be contentious we have no such custom nor the churches of God seventeen And while I enjoin this I praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse eighteen For first of all when ye come together in the church I hear that there are divisions among you and I partly believe it nineteen For there must be also sects among you that they who are approved may be made manifest among you twenty When therefore ye come together into one place there is no eating of a supper of the Lord eleven twenty twenty one For in eating each takes without waiting his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken twenty two What have ye not houses to eat and to drink in Or despise ye the church of God and shame those who have not What shall I say to you Shall I praise you in this I praise you not twenty three For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took a loaf twenty four and having given thanks he broke it and said This is my body which is for you this do in remembrance of me twenty five In like manner also the cup after they had supped saying This cup is the new covenant in my blood this do as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me twenty six For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye show the Lord s death till he come twenty seven So that whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord twenty eight But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup twenty nine For he that eats and drinks eats and drinks condemnation to himself if he discern not the body thirty For this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep thirty one For if we judged ourselves we should not be judged thirty two But being judged we are chastened by the Lord that we may not be condemned with the world thirty three Wherefore my brethren when coming together to eat wait for one another thirty four If any one is hungry let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation And the rest I will set in order when I come XII NOW concerning the spiritual gifts brethren I would not have you ignorant two Ye know that ye were Gentiles carried away to the dumb idols as ye were led three Wherefore I give you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed and no one can say Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Spirit four Now there are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit five And there are diversities of ministrations and the same Lord six And there are diversities of operations but the same God who works all in all seven But to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profiting eight For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit nine to another faith by the same Spirit to another gifts of healings by the one Spirit ten to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another diversities of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues eleven But all these works the one and self same Spirit dividing to each one severally as he will twelve For as the body is one and has many members and all the members of the body being many are one body so also is Christ thirteen For by one Spirit we were all immersed into one body whether Jews or Greeks whether bond or free and were all made to drink of one Spirit fourteen For the body is not one member but many fifteen If the foot say Because I am not a hand I am not of the body it is not therefore not of the body sixteen And if the ear say Because I am not an eye I am not of the body it is not therefore not of the body seventeen If the whole body were an eye where were the hearing If the whole were hearing where were the smelling eighteen But now God set the members each one of them in the body as it pleased him nineteen And if they were all one member where were the body twenty But now there are many members but one body twenty one And the eye can not say to the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you twenty two Nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary twenty three and those which we think to be less honorable parts of the body on these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness twenty four And our comely parts have no need but God attempered the body together giving more abundant honor to that which lacked twenty five that there may be no division in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another twenty six And whether one member suffers all the members suffer with it or one member is honored all the members rejoice with it twenty seven Now ye are the body of Christ and members each one twelve twenty seven twenty eight And God set some in the church apostles first secondly prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps governings diversities of tongues twenty nine Are all apostles Are all prophets Are all teachers Are all workers of miracles thirty Have all gifts of healings Do all speak with tongues Do all interpret thirty one But desire earnestly the greater gifts and moreover I show to you a more excellent way one Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not love I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal two And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so as to remove mountains and have not love I am nothing three And though I bestow all my goods in food and though I give up my body that I may be burned and have not love it profits me nothing four Love suffers long is kind love envies not love vaunts not itself is not puffed up five does not behave itself unseemly seeks not its own is not easily provoked imputes no evil six rejoices not at unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth seven bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things eight Love never fails but whether there are prophesyings they will be done away whether tongues they will cease whether knowledge it will be done away nine For we know in part and we prophesy in part ten But when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part will be done away eleven When I was a child I spoke as a child I thought as a child I reasoned as a child but now that I am become a man I have done away the things of the child twelve For we see now in a mirror obscurely but then face to face Now I know in part but then I shall know fully even as I also am fully known thirteen And now remain faith hope love these three and the greatest of these is love one Pursue after love and desire earnestly the spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy two For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men but to God for no one understands but with the spirit he speaks mysteries three But he that prophesies to men he speaks edification and exhortation and comfort four He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself but he that prophesies edifies the church five I would that ye should all speak with tongues but rather that ye should prophesy for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edification six And now brethren if I come to you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophesying or in teaching seven And things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp yet if they give no distinction in the sounds how shall that be known which is piped or harped eight For if a trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself for battle nine So also ye if ye utter not by the tongue words easily understood how shall that be known which is spoken For ye will be speaking into the air ten So many it may be are the kinds of speaking sounds in the world and none is without significance eleven If then I know not the meaning of the sound I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian and he that speaks a barbarian to me twelve So also ye since ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that ye may abound in them to the edification of the church thirteen Wherefore let him that speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret fourteen For if I pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prays but my understanding is unfruitful fifteen What then I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also sixteen Else if thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupies the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks since he knows not what thou sayest seventeen For thou indeed givest thanks well but the other is not edified eighteen I thank God I speak with tongues more than ye all nineteen Yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding that I may also instruct others than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue twenty Brethren be not children in your understandings but in malice be as children but in your understandings be men twenty one In the law it is written For with men of other tongues and with strange lips I will speak to this people And not even so will they hearken to me saith the Lord twenty two So that the tongues are for a sign not to those who believe but to the unbelieving but prophesying is not for the unbelieving but for those who believe twenty three If therefore the whole church is come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those who are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad twenty four But if all prophesy and there come in one that is an unbeliever or unlearned he is convicted by all he is judged by all twenty five The secrets of his heart are made manifest and so falling on his face he will worship God reporting that God is in truth among you twenty six How is it then brethren When ye come together each of you has a psalm has an instruction has a tongue has a revelation has an interpretation Let all things be done to edification twenty seven If any one speaks in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most by three and in turn and let one interpret twenty eight But if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to God twenty nine And of prophets let two or three speak and the others judge thirty But if a revelation be made to another sitting by let the first be silent thirty one For ye can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all be comforted thirty two And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets thirty three For God is not a God of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints thirty four Let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted to them to speak but they are to be in subjection as the law also says thirty five And if they wish to learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church thirty six Did the word of God come forth from you Or came it unto you alone thirty seven If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the Lord s commandments thirty eight But if any one is ignorant let him be ignorant thirty nine Wherefore brethren desire earnestly the gift of prophecy and forbid not to speak with tongues forty But let all things be done decently and in order XV AND I make known to you brethren the gospel which I preached to you which also ye received in which also ye stand two through which also ye are saved if ye hold fast the word with which I preached to you unless ye believed in vain three For I delivered to you first of all what I also received that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures four and that he was buried and that he has risen on the third day according to the Scriptures five and that he appeared to Cephas then to the twelve six after that he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain until now but some are fallen asleep seven After that he appeared to James then to all the apostles eight And last of all he appeared to me also as the one born out of due time nine For I am the least of the apostles who am not worthy to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God ten But by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I labored more abundantly than they all yet not I but the grace of God which was with me eleven Therefore whether it were I or they so we preach and so ye believed twelve Now if Christ is preached that he has risen from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead thirteen But if there is no resurrection of the dead then neither has Christ risen fourteen and if Christ has not risen then is our preaching vain and vain also your faith fifteen And we are also found false witnesses of God because we testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not if it be so that the dead rise not sixteen For if the dead rise not neither has Christ risen seventeen and if Christ has not risen your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins eighteen Then also they who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished nineteen If in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable twenty But now Christ has risen from the dead the first fruits of those who sleep twenty one For since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead twenty two For as in Adam all die so also in Christ will all be made alive twenty three But each in his own order Christ the first fruits afterward they who are Christ s at his coming twenty four Then comes the end when he delivers up the kingdom to God the Father when he shall have done away all rule and all authority and power twenty five For he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet twenty six As the last enemy Death shall be done away For he subjected all things under his feet twenty seven But when he says All things are subjected it is manifest that he is excepted who subjected all things to him twenty eight And when all things shall be subjected to him then will also the Son himself be subject to him who subjected all things to him that God may be all in all twenty nine Else what shall they do who are immersed for the dead If the dead rise not at all why are they then immersed for them thirty Why also are we in peril every hour thirty one I protest by my glorying in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord I die daily thirty two If after the manner of men I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus what is the profit to me if the dead rise not Let us eat and drink For to morrow we die thirty three Be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners thirty four Awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of God I say it to your shame thirty five But some one will say How do the dead rise And with what kind of body do they come thirty six Thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die thirty seven and what thou sowest not the body that shall be sowest thou but bare grain perchance of wheat or of some other grain thirty eight But God gives it a body as it pleased him and to each of the seeds its own body thirty nine All flesh is not the same flesh but there is one flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes another of birds forty There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies but the glory of the heavenly is one and that of the earthly is another forty one There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for star differs from star in glory forty two So also is the resurrection of the dead It is sown in corruption it rises in incorruption forty three It is sown in dishonor it rises in glory It is sown in weakness it rises in power forty four It is sown a natural body it rises a spiritual body If there is a natural body there is also a spiritual forty five So also it is written The first man Adam was made a living soul the last Adam a life giving spirit forty six But the spiritual is not first but the natural and afterward the spiritual forty seven The first man was of the earth earthy the second man is from heaven forty eight As was the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly forty nine And as we bore the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly fifty And this I say brethren that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God nor does corruption inherit incorruption fifty one Behold I tell you a mystery We shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed fifty two in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed fifty three For this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality fifty four And when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then will be brought to pass the saying that is written Death is swallowed up in victory fifty five Where O death is thy sting Where O death is thy victory fifty six The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law fifty seven But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ fifty eight Therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the Lord knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord XVI NOW concerning the collection for the saints as I gave order to the churches of Galatia so also do ye two On each first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store according as he is prospered that there may be no collections when I come three And when I come whomsoever ye shall approve them I will send with letters to carry your benefaction to Jerusalem four And if it be worthy of my going also they shall go with me five And I will come to you when I shall pass through Macedonia For I pass through Macedonia six and it may be that I will remain or even pass the winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go seven For I wish not to see you now in passing for I hope to remain some time with you if the Lord permit eight But I shall remain at Ephesus until the Pentecost nine For a great and effectual door is open to me and there are many adversaries ten Now if Timothy come see that he may be with you without fear for he works the work of the Lord as I also do eleven Let no one therefore despise him but send him forward in peace that he may come to me for I look for him with the brethren twelve And concerning Apollos the brother I besought him much to come to you with the brethren and it was not at all his will to come at this time but he will come when he shall have a convenient time thirteen Watch stand fast in the faith acquit you like men be strong fourteen Let all your acts be done in love fifteen And I beseech you brethren ye know the house of Stephanas that it is the first fruits of Achaia and that they devoted themselves to the service of the saints sixteen that ye also submit yourselves to such and to every one that works with us and labors seventeen I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus for what was lacking on your part they supplied eighteen For they refreshed my spirit and yours therefore acknowledge those who are such nineteen The churches of Asia salute you Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord with the church that is in their house twenty All the brethren salute you Salute one another with a holy kiss twenty one The salutation of me Paul with my own hand twenty two If any one loves not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be accursed Maran atha sixteen twenty two twenty three The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you twenty four My love be with you all in Christ Jesus Amen THE SECOND LETTER OF PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS I PAUL an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and Timothy the brother to the church of God which is at Corinth with all the saints who are in all Achaia two Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ three Blessed be God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation four who consoles us in all our affliction that we may be able to console those who are in any affliction by the consolation wherewith we ourselves are consoled by God five Because as the sufferings of Christ abound toward us so through Christ abounds also our consolation six But whether we are afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effective in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we are consoled it is for your consolation and salvation seven And our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so are ye also of the consolation eight For we would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of our affliction which befell us in Asia that we were exceedingly oppressed above our strength so that we despaired even of life nine Yea we ourselves had in ourselves the sentence of death that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead ten who delivered us from so great a death and does deliver in whom is our hope that he will still deliver eleven ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication that for the mercy bestowed on us through many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf twelve For our glorying is this the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God did we deport ourselves in the world and more abundantly toward you thirteen For we write no other things to you than what ye read or even acknowledge and I trust ye will acknowledge even to the end fourteen as also ye did acknowledge us in part that we are your glorying even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus fifteen And in this confidence I was desirous to come to you before that ye might have a second benefit sixteen and to pass by you into Macedonia and from Macedonia to come again to you and by you to be brought on my way to Judea seventeen When therefore I purposed this did I act with levity Or the things that I purpose do I purpose according to the flesh that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay eighteen But God is faithful our word to you is not yea and nay nineteen For the Son of God Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us by me and Silvanus and Timothy was not made yea and nay but has been made yea in him twenty For however many are the promises of God in him is the yea and in him the Amen to the glory of God through us twenty one Now he who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God twenty two he who also sealed us and gave the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts twenty three But I invoke God for a witness upon my soul that to spare you I came not yet to Corinth twenty four Not that we have dominion over your faith but are helpers of your joy for in faith ye stand fast II AND I determined this with myself that I would not come again to you in sorrow two For if I make you sorry who then is he that makes me glad but the same who is made sorry by me three And I wrote this very thing to you that I might not when I came have sorrow from those of whom I ought to have joy having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all four For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears not that ye might have sorrow but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly toward you five But if any has caused sorrow he has not caused sorrow to me but in part that I be not too severe on him to you all six Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many seven So that on the contrary ye ought rather to forgive and console him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow eight Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love toward him nine For to this end also I wrote that I might know the proof of you whether ye are obedient in all things ten To whom ye forgive anything I forgive also for what I have forgiven if I have forgiven anything for your sakes I forgave it in the person of Christ eleven that no advantage might be gained over us by Satan for we are not ignorant of his devices twelve And when I came to Troas to preach the good news of Christ and a door was opened to me in the Lord thirteen I had no rest in my spirit because I found not Titus my brother but taking leave of them I went forth into Macedonia fourteen But thanks be to God who always causes us to triumph in Christ and makes manifest by us in every place the savor of the knowledge of him fifteen Because we are to God a sweet savor of Christ in those who are saved and in those who perish sixteen to the one a savor of death unto death to the other a savor of life unto life And who is sufficient for these things seventeen For we are not as the many corrupting the word of God but as of sincerity but as of God in the sight of God we speak in Christ III DO we again begin to commend ourselves Or need we as some letters of commendation to you or of commendation from you two Ye are our letter written in our hearts known and read by all men three being made manifest that ye are a letter of Christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God not in tablets of stone but in fleshly tablets of the heart four And such confidence have we through Christ toward God five Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God six who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kills but the spirit makes alive seven But if the ministration of death engraven with letters in stones was made glorious so that the sons of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away eight how shall not the ministration of the spirit be more glorious nine For if the ministration of condemnation is glory much more does the ministration of righteousness abound in glory ten For even that which was made glorious has no glory in this respect on account of the glory that excels eleven For if that which is done away was glorious much more that which abides is glorious twelve Having therefore such hope we use great plainness of speech thirteen and not as Moses put a vail over his face that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the end of that which was to be done away fourteen But their understandings were hardened for until this day the same vail on the reading of the old covenant remains not being taken away which vail is done away in Christ three fourteen fifteen But even unto this day when Moses is read a vail lies upon their heart sixteen But whenever it turns to the Lord the vail is taken away seventeen Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty eighteen But we all with unvailed face beholding in a mirror the glory of the Lord are transformed into the same image from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord IV THEREFORE having this ministry as we received mercy we faint not two But we renounced the hidden things of shame not walking in craftiness nor falsifying the word of God but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man s conscience in the sight of God three But if our gospel is vailed it is vailed in those who perish four in whom the god of this world blinded the understandings of the unbelieving that they should not discern the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is the image of God four four five For we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord and ourselves as your servants for Jesus sake six Because it is God who commands light to shine out of darkness who shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ seven But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the exceeding greatness of the power may be God s and not of us eight being pressed in every way yet not straitened perplexed yet not despairing nine persecuted yet not forsaken cast down yet not destroyed ten always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus that also the life of Jesus might be made manifest in our body eleven For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh twelve So that death works in us but life in you thirteen But having the same spirit of faith according to what is written I believed therefore did I speak we also believe therefore also speak fourteen knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus will raise up us also with Jesus and will present us with you fifteen For all things are for your sakes that the grace abounding through the greater number might make the thanksgiving more abundant to the glory of God sixteen For which cause we faint not but though our outward man perishes yet the inward man is renewed day by day seventeen For our light affliction which is but for a moment works out for us a far more exceeding an eternal weight of glory eighteen while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal V FOR we know that if our earthly house of the tabernacle five one were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens two For in this we groan longing to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven three seeing that we shall be found clothed not naked five three four For we who are in the tabernacle groan being burdened in that we do not desire to be unclothed but to be clothed upon that what is mortal might be swallowed up by life five Now he who wrought us out for this very thing is God who also gave to us the earnest of the Spirit six Being therefore always confident and knowing that while at home in the body we are absent from the Lord seven for we walk by faith not by sight eight we are confident and are well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord nine Wherefore we also strive that whether at home or absent we may be well pleasing to him ten For we must all be made manifest before the judgment seat of Christ that each one may receive the things done in the body according to the things which he did whether good or bad eleven Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord we persuade men but to God we have been made manifest and I hope that we have been made manifest also in your consciences twelve For we are not again commending ourselves to you but giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer those who glory in appearance and not in heart thirteen For whether we were beside ourselves it was for God or whether we are of sound mind it is for you fourteen For the love of Christ constrains us because we thus judged that if one died for all then they all died fifteen And he died for all that they who live should live no longer to themselves but to him who for them died and rose again sixteen So that we henceforth know no one according to the flesh and if also we have known Christ according to the flesh yet now we no longer know him seventeen So that if any one is in Christ he is a new creature the old things passed away behold all things have become new eighteen And all things are of God who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation nineteen as that God was in Christ reconciling a world to himself not reckoning to them their trespasses and having committed to us the word of reconciliation twenty We are then ambassadors on behalf of Christ five twenty as though God were beseeching by us on behalf of Christ we pray Be reconciled to God twenty one Him who knew not sin he made to be sin for us that we might become God s righteousness in him VI AND as workers together with him we also beseech you that ye receive not the grace of God in vain two for he says In an accepted time I heard thee And in the day of salvation I helped thee behold now is the well accepted time behold now is the day of salvation three giving no cause of offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed four but as God s ministers commending ourselves in everything in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses five in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labors in watchings in fastings six in pureness in knowledge in long suffering in kindness in the Holy Spirit in love unfeigned seven in the word of truth in the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left eight through glory and dishonor through evil report and good report as deceivers and true nine as unknown and well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed ten as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and possessing all things eleven O Corinthians our mouth is open to you our heart is enlarged twelve Ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own bowels thirteen Now as a recompense in the same kind I speak as to my children be ye also enlarged fourteen Be not yoked unequally with unbelievers for what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness And what communion has light with darkness fifteen And what concord has Christ with Belial Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever sixteen And what agreement has the temple of God with idols For ye are a temple of the living God as God said I will dwell in them and walk among them and I will be their God and they shall be to me a people seventeen Wherefore come out from among them and be separated saith the Lord and touch not anything unclean and I will receive you eighteen and will be to you a Father and ye shall be to me sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty VII HAVING therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of God two Receive us we wronged no one we corrupted no one we defrauded no one three I say it not for condemnation for I have before said that ye are in our hearts to die together and to live together four Great is my confidence toward you great is my glorying on account of you I am filled with the consolation I am made to abound with the joy in all our affliction five For indeed when we were come into Macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were afflicted in every way without were fightings within were fears six But God who consoles those who are cast down consoled us by the coming of Titus seven and not by his coming only but also by the consolation with which he was consoled in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your zeal for me so that I rejoiced the more eight Because though I made you sorry with the letter I do not regret it though I did regret it for I perceive that that letter made you sorry though but for a season nine Now I rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye were made sorry unto repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might in nothing receive harm from us ten For godly sorrow works repentance unto salvation not to be regretted but the sorrow of the world works out death eleven For behold this very thing that ye were made sorry after a godly manner what earnestness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what longing desire yea what zeal yea what avenging In every thing ye commended yourselves as pure in the matter twelve So then though I wrote to you it was not on account of him who did the wrong nor of him who suffered wrong but that your care for us might be made manifest to you in the sight of God thirteen For this cause we were consoled but in our consolation seven thirteen we rejoiced abundantly more at the joy of Titus because his spirit has been refreshed by you all fourteen For if in any thing I have boasted to him of you I was not made ashamed but as we spoke all things to you in truth so also our boasting before Titus was found to be truth fifteen And his tender affection is more abundantly toward you while he remembers the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him sixteen I rejoice that in every thing I have confidence in you VIII AND we made known to you brethren the grace of God which has been bestowed on the churches of Macedonia two that in much trial of affliction was the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality three For according to their power I bear witness and beyond their power they were willing of themselves four with much entreaty beseeching of us the grace and the participation in the ministering to the saints five and not as we expected but themselves they gave first to the Lord and to us by the will of God six So that we exhorted Titus that as he had before begun so he would also finish among you this grace also seven But as in everything ye abound in faith and utterance and knowledge and all diligence and your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also eight I say it not by way of command but through the forwardness of others proving also the sincerity of your love nine For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich ten And I give an opinion in this matter for this is expedient for you who began before others not only to do but also to will a year ago eleven And now perform the doing of it also that as there was the readiness to will so there may be the performance according to what ye have twelve For if there be first the willing mind it is accepted according to what a man has not according to what he has not thirteen For it is not that others may be eased and ye burdened fourteen but by the rule of equality at this present time your abundance being a supply for their want that also their abundance may be a supply for your want that there may be equality as it is written fifteen He that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little did not lack sixteen But thanks be to God who put the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus seventeen For he accepted indeed the exhortation but being very zealous he went to you of his own accord eighteen And together with him we sent the brother whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches nineteen and not that only but who was also appointed by the churches as our fellow traveler with this gift eight nineteen which is administered by us to further the glory of the Lord and our zeal twenty being careful of this that no one should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us twenty one for we provide for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men twenty two And we sent with them our brother whom we have often in many things proved to be diligent but now much more diligent through the great confidence which he has toward you twenty three As to Titus he is my partner and in regard to you a fellow laborer as to our brethren they are messengers of the churches the glory of Christ twenty four Therefore show toward them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf IX FOR concerning the ministering to the saints it is superfluous for me to write to you two For I know your readiness of mind of which I boast for you to the Macedonians that Achaia has been prepared since a year ago and your zeal stirred up the greater part of them three But I sent the brethren that our boasting of you might not be made in vain in this respect that as I said ye may be prepared four lest haply if Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be put to shame in respect to this confidence five I thought it necessary therefore to exhort the brethren that they should go before to you and make up beforehand your bounty before promised that this may be ready in manner as a bounty and not as covetousness six But as to this he that sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly and he that sows with blessings shall also reap with blessings seven but each as he purposes in his heart not grudgingly or of necessity for God loves a cheerful giver eight And God is able to make every grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in everything may abound toward every good work nine as it is written He dispersed abroad he gave to the poor His righteousness abides forever ten and he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness eleven being enriched in everything to all liberality which works through us thanksgiving to God twelve Because the ministration of this service not only supplies the wants of the saints but also abounds through many thanksgivings to God thirteen while by the proof of this ministration they glorify God for the obedience to your profession of the gospel of Christ and for the liberality of the contribution to them and to all fourteen they also with supplication for you longing after you on account of the exceeding grace of God in you fifteen Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift X NOW I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in presence indeed am lowly among you but being absent am bold toward you two but I entreat that I may not when I am present be bold with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some who think of us as walking according to the flesh three For though walking in the flesh we do not war after the flesh four for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but mighty before God to the pulling down of strongholds five casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ six and being in readiness to punish every disobedience when your obedience is made perfect seven Do ye look on things after the outward appearance If any man trusts to himself that he is Christ s let him of himself consider this again that as he is Christ s so also are we eight For even if I should boast somewhat more abundantly of our authority which the Lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction ten eight I shall not be put to shame nine that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters ten For his letters says one are weighty and strong but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible eleven Let such a one consider this that such as we are in word by letters when absent such will we be also in deed when present twelve For we venture not to reckon ourselves among or to compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves but they measuring themselves among themselves and comparing themselves with themselves are not wise thirteen But we will not boast of things without measure but according to the measure of the line which God apportioned to us a measure to reach even to you fourteen For we do not stretch ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not to you for as far as to you also did we come in the gospel of Christ fifteen not boasting of things without measure in other men s labors but having hope when your faith increases that we shall be enlarged among you according to our line abundantly sixteen to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you not to make our boast in another s line of things made ready to our hand seventeen But he that boasts let him boast in the Lord eighteen For not he that commends himself is approved but he whom the Lord commends XI WOULD that ye could bear with me in a little folly Nay ye do bear with me two For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy for I espoused you to one husband that I may present a chaste virgin to Christ three But I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve by his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from your simplicity toward Christ four For if indeed he that comes preaches another Jesus whom we preached not or if ye receive a different spirit which ye received not or a different gospel which ye accepted not ye might well bear with it five For I reckon that I am in no respect behind these overmuch apostles six And though I be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but in everything we have been made manifest among all in respect to you seven Did I commit an offense in abasing myself that ye might be exalted because I preached to you the gospel of God without charge eight I robbed other churches taking wages of them in order to do you service nine And when I was present with you and in want I was a charge to no one for what was lacking to me the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied and in every thing I kept myself from being burdensome to you and so will keep myself ten As the truth of Christ is in me this boasting shall not be shut up against me in the regions of Achaia eleven Wherefore Because I love you not God knows twelve But what I do and will do is that I may cut off the occasion of those who desire an occasion that wherein they boast they may be found even as we thirteen For such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into apostles of Christ fourteen And no wonder for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light fifteen It is no great thing then if also his ministers transform themselves as ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works sixteen I say again let no one think me foolish but if it can not be so yet receive me even if as foolish that I too may boast myself a little seventeen What I speak I speak not after the Lord but as in foolishness in this confidence of boasting eighteen Seeing that many boast after the flesh I also will boast nineteen For ye gladly bear with the foolish being yourselves wise twenty For ye bear with it if one brings you into bondage if one devours you if one takes you if one exalts himself if one smites you on the face twenty one I say it as a reproach that we were weak But in whatever any one is bold I say it in foolishness I also am bold twenty two Are they Hebrews So am I Are they Israelites So am I Are they Abraham s seed So am I twenty three Are they ministers of Christ I speak as beside myself I am more in labors more abundantly in stripes above measure in prisons more abundantly in deaths often twenty four of the Jews five times I received forty stripes save one twenty five thrice I was beaten with rods once I was stoned thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and a day I have spent in the deep twenty six by journeyings often by perils of rivers by perils of robbers by perils from my countrymen by perils from the heathen by perils in the city by perils in the wilderness by perils in the sea by perils among false brethren twenty seven by weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness twenty eight Beside those things that are without there is that which comes upon me daily the care of all the churches twenty nine Who is weak and I am not weak Who is offended and I do not burn thirty If I must needs boast I will boast of things which belong to my infirmity thirty one God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who is blessed forevermore knows that I lie not thirty two In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept guard over the city of the Damascenes wishing to apprehend me thirty three and through a window I was let down in a basket through the wall and escaped his hands XII TO boast is surely not expedient for me for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord two I know a man in Christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body I know not or whether out of the body I know not God knows such a one caught up even to the third heaven three And I know such a man whether in the body or without the body I know not God knows four that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter five Of such a one I will boast but of myself I will not boast save in my infirmities six For if I should desire to boast I shall not be foolish for I shall speak truth but I forbear lest any one should reckon of me above what he sees me to be or hears from me seven And that I might not be exalted overmuch through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh a messenger of Satan to buffet me that I might not be exalted overmuch eight Concerning this I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me nine And he said to me My grace is sufficient for thee for my power is made perfect in weakness Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my infirmities that the power of Christ may abide upon me ten Wherefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ s sake for when I am weak then I am powerful eleven I have become foolish ye compelled me For I ought to have been commended by you for in nothing was I behind these overmuch apostles though I am nothing twelve Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience by signs and wonders and miracles thirteen For what is there wherein ye were inferior to the rest of the churches except that I myself was not a charge to you Forgive me this wrong fourteen Behold I am ready to come to you the third time and I will not be a charge to you for I seek not yours but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children fifteen And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls though the more abundantly I love you the less I am loved sixteen But be it so I was not myself a charge to you twelve sixteen but yet being crafty I caught you with guile seventeen Did I make gain of you by any of those whom I have sent to you eighteen I exhorted Titus to go and sent with him the brother Did Titus make gain of you Did we not walk in the same spirit did we not in the same steps nineteen Do ye again suppose that we are excusing ourselves to you twelve nineteen Before God in Christ we speak and all beloved for your edification twenty For I fear lest haply when I come I shall find you not such as I would and I too shall be found by you such as ye would not lest there be wranglings envyings wraths rivalries backbitings whisperings swellings tumults twenty one lest when I come again my God shall humble me among you and I shall bewail many of those who have sinned before and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and wantonness which they committed XIII THIS third time I am coming to you In the mouth of two witnesses and of three shall every word be established two I have before said and now say beforehand as when present the second time so also now when absent to those who heretofore have sinned and to all the rest that if I come again I will not spare three since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me who toward you is not weak but is mighty in you four For even if he was crucified through weakness yet he lives by the power of God For we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you five Try your own selves whether ye are in the faith prove your own selves Know ye not your own selves that Jesus Christ is in you except ye are reprobate six But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobate seven Now I pray to God that ye do no evil not that we should appear approved but that ye may do what is good though we be as reprobate eight For we have no power against the truth but for the truth nine For we are glad when we are weak and ye are powerful this also we pray for even your perfection ten For this cause I write these things being absent that when present I may not use sharpness according to the power which the Lord gave me for edification and not for destruction eleven Finally brethren farewell Be perfect be of good comfort be of the same mind be at peace and the God of love and peace will be with you twelve Salute one another with a holy kiss thirteen All the saints salute you fourteen The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE GALATIANS I PAUL an apostle not from men neither through man but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead two and all the brethren who are with me to the churches of Galatia three Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ four who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us out of the present evil world according to the will of God and our Father five to whom be the glory forever and ever Amen six I marvel that ye are so soon removing from him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel seven which is not another except that there are some who trouble you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ eight But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel to you contrary to that which we preached to you let him be accursed nine As we have said before so I now say again if any one preaches a gospel to you contrary to that which ye received let him be accursed ten For do I now seek the favor of men or of God Or am I seeking to please men If I were still pleasing men I should not be Christ s servant eleven Now I make known to you brethren that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man twelve for I also did not receive it from man nor was I taught it but through the revelation of Jesus Christ thirteen For ye heard of my conduct formerly in Judaism that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and was destroying it fourteen and pressed forward in Judaism beyond many companions of the same age in my nation being more exceedingly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers fifteen But when it pleased God who set me apart from my mother s womb and called me through his grace sixteen to reveal his Son in me that I should make known the glad news of him among the Gentiles immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood seventeen neither went up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me but went away one seventeen into Arabia and returned again to Damascus eighteen Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas and remained with him fifteen days nineteen But no other of the apostles did I see save James the brother of the Lord twenty Now as to the things which I write to you behold before God I lie not twenty one Afterward I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia twenty two and was unknown by face to the churches of Juda which were in Christ twenty three but they were only hearing that he who was once our persecutor now preaches the faith which once he was destroying twenty four and they glorified God in me II THEN after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas taking also Titus with me two And I went up by revelation and communicated to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but privately to those of reputation lest by any means I should run or had run in vain three But not even Titus who was with me being a Greek was compelled to be circumcised four and that because of the false brethren stealthily brought in who crept in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage five to whom not even for an hour did we yield by the required submission that the truth of the gospel might continue with you six But from those reputed to be something whatever they were two six it matters not to me God accepts not man s person for to me those of reputation communicated nothing in addition seven But on the contrary seeing that I have been entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision as Peter was with that of the circumcision eight for he who wrought for Peter in behalf of the apostleship of the circumcision wrought also for me in behalf of the Gentiles nine and having learned the grace that was given to me James and Cephas and John who were reputed to be pillars gave to me and Barnabas right hands of fellowship that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision ten only that we should remember the poor which very thing also I was forward to do eleven But when Cephas came to Antioch I withstood him to the face because he was blamed twelve For before certain ones came from James he ate with the Gentiles but when they came he withdrew and separated himself fearing those who were of the circumcision thirteen And the other Jews also dissembled with him so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation fourteen But when I saw that they walk not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel I said to Peter in the presence of all If thou being a Jew livest after the manner of Gentiles and not that of Jews how dost thou compel the Gentiles to become as Jews fifteen We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles sixteen but knowing that a man is not justified by works of law but through faith in Jesus Christ we also believed on Christ Jesus that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of law because by works of law no flesh shall be justified seventeen But if while seeking to be justified in Christ we ourselves also were found sinners is then Christ a minister of sin Far be it eighteen For if the things which I pulled down these I build up again I make myself a transgressor nineteen For I through law died to law that I might live to God twenty I have been crucified with Christ and no longer do I live but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me twenty one I do not set aside the grace of God for if there be righteousness through law then Christ died without cause III O FOOLISH Galatians who bewitched you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was evidently set forth three one crucified among you two This only I desire to learn from you Was it from works of law that ye received the Spirit or from the hearing of faith three Are ye so foolish Having begun with the Spirit are ye now being made perfect three three with the flesh four Did ye suffer so many things in vain If indeed it be in vain five Does he therefore who supplies to you the Spirit and works miracles among you three five do it from works of law or from the hearing of faith six As Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him for righteousness seven Know then that they who are of faith these are sons of Abraham eight And the Scripture foreseeing that God justifies the Gentiles by faith announced beforehand the glad tidings to Abraham saying In thee shall all the nations be blessed nine So that they who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham ten For as many as are of works of law are under a curse for it is written Cursed is every one that continues not in all the things written in the book of the law to do them eleven And that in the law no one is justified with God is evident because the just shall live by faith twelve Now the law is not of faith but he that has done them shall live in them thirteen Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law having become a curse for us because it is written Cursed is every one that is hanged on a tree fourteen that unto the Gentiles the blessing of Abraham might come in Christ Jesus that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith fifteen Brethren I speak after the manner of men If a covenant has been confirmed though it be a man s no one sets it aside or adds thereto sixteen Now to Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed He says not and to seeds as concerning many but as concerning one and to thy seed which is Christ seventeen But this I say that a covenant before confirmed by God the law which came four hundred and thirty years after does not annul to make the promise of no effect eighteen For if the inheritance is of law it is no more of promise but God has freely given it to Abraham by promise nineteen What then is the law It was added because of the transgressions until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made having been ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator twenty Now the mediator is not of one but God is one twenty one Is then the law against the promises of God Far be it For if a law had been given which is able to make alive truly righteousness would have been of law twenty two But the Scripture shut up all under sin that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe twenty three But before faith came we were guarded under law shut up unto the faith which was to be revealed twenty four So that the law has become our schoolmaster unto Christ that we might be justified by faith twenty five But faith having come we are no longer under a schoolmaster twenty six For ye are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus twenty seven For all ye who were immersed unto Christ three twenty seven did put on Christ twenty eight There is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is no male and female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus twenty nine And if ye are Christ s then are ye Abraham s seed heirs according to the promise IV NOW I say as long as the heir is a child he differs in nothing from a servant though he is lord of all two but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father three So also we when we were children were held in bondage under the elements four three of the world four But when the fullness of the time came God sent forth his son born of a woman born under law five that he might redeem those under law that we might receive the adoption of sons six And because ye are sons God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts crying Abba Father seven So that thou art no longer a servant but a son and if a son also an heir through God eight But at that time indeed when ye knew not God ye served those which are not in their nature gods nine But now after having known God or rather having been known by God how is it that ye turn back again to the weak and poor elements four nine to which ye desire to be in bondage again anew ten Do ye carefully observe days and months and seasons and years eleven I am afraid of you lest by any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain twelve Become as I am for I also became as ye are brethren I beseech you Ye injured me in nothing thirteen Nay ye know that by reason of weakness of the flesh I preached the glad tidings to you the former time fourteen and my trial four fourteen which was in my flesh ye despised not nor spurned but received me as an angel of God as Christ Jesus fifteen Where is four fifteen then the happiness of which ye spoke For I bear you witness that if possible ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me sixteen So then have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth seventeen They zealously seek you not well but they wish to exclude you that ye may zealously seek them eighteen But it is good to be zealously sought in a good cause always and not only when I am present with you nineteen My little children of whom I travail again in birth until Christ be formed in you twenty And I could wish to be present with you now and to change my voice for I am perplexed on account of you twenty one Tell me ye who desire to be under law do ye not hear the law twenty two For it is written that Abraham had two sons one by the bondwoman and one by the freewoman twenty three But the one by the bondwoman was born after the flesh and the one by the freewoman through the promise twenty four Which things are an allegory four twenty four For these women are two covenants one from mount Sinai bearing children into bondage twenty five which is Hagar for the word Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answers to the Jerusalem that now is for she is in bondage with her children twenty six But the Jerusalem that is above is free which is the mother of us all four twenty six twenty seven For it is written Rejoice thou barren that bearest not Break forth and cry thou that travailest not Because many are the children of the desolate rather than of her who has the husband twenty eight But ye brethren after the manner of Isaac are children of promise twenty nine But as then the one born after the flesh persecuted the one born after the spirit so also is it now thirty But what says the Scripture Cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman thirty one So then brethren we are not children of a bondwoman but of the freewoman V STAND fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ made us free and be not again entangled with the yoke of bondage two Behold I Paul say to you that if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing three Now I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law four Ye are separated from Christ whoever of you are justified in the law ye are fallen away from grace five For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith six For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing nor uncircumcision but faith working by love seven Ye were running well who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth eight The persuasion is not from him who calls you nine A little leaven leavens the whole lump ten I have confidence toward you in the Lord that ye will be no otherwise minded but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment whoever he may be eleven But as for me brethren if I still preach circumcision why am I still persecuted Then has the offense of the cross ceased twelve I would that they were even cut off who unsettle you thirteen For ye were called unto liberty brethren only use not the liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another fourteen For all the law is fulfilled in one word in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself fifteen But if ye bite and devour one another beware lest ye be consumed by one another sixteen But I say walk by the Spirit and ye will not fulfill the desire of the flesh seventeen For the flesh has desires against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other that ye may not do those things that ye would eighteen But if ye are led by the Spirit ye are not under law nineteen Now the works of the flesh are manifest which are fornication uncleanness wantonness twenty idolatry sorcery hatreds strife emulation wraths contentions divisions factions twenty one envyings murders drunkenness revelings and things like these of which I tell you beforehand as I also said before that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God twenty two But the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace long suffering kindness goodness faith twenty three meekness temperance against such things there is no law twenty four And they that are Christ s crucified the flesh with its passions and desires twenty five If we live by the Spirit let us also walk by the Spirit twenty six Let us not become vainglorious provoking one another envying one another VI BRETHREN even if a man be overtaken in a fault ye who are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted two Bear one another s burdens and so fulfill six two the law of Christ three For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing he deceives himself four But let each one prove his own work and then shall he have ground of glorying in reference to himself alone and not to another five For each one shall bear his own load six But let him that is taught in the word share with him that teaches in all good things seven Be not deceived God is not mocked for whatever a man sows that shall he also reap eight Because he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting nine And let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not ten So then as we have opportunity let us do good to all especially to those who are of the household of faith eleven See with what large letters I wrote to you with my own hand twelve As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh these constrain you to be circumcised only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ thirteen For neither do they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but they desire that ye should be circumcised that they may glory in your flesh fourteen But far be it from me to glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ through whom the world is crucified to me and I to the world fifteen For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision but a new creation sixteen And as many as walk by this rule peace be on them and mercy and on the Israel of God seventeen Henceforth let no one trouble me for I bear the marks of Jesus in my body eighteen The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit brethren Amen THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS I PAUL an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the saints who are in Ephesus and believers in Christ Jesus two Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ three Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ four as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless before him in love five having predestined us unto the adoption of sons by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will six to the praise of the glory of his grace which he freely bestowed on us in the beloved seven in whom we have the redemption through his blood the remission of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace eight which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding nine making known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself ten in reference to the dispensation of the fullness of times to gather for himself into one all things in the Christ the things which are in the heavens and the things on the earth eleven in him in whom we obtained also the inheritance one eleven being predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will twelve that we should be to the praise of his glory who before have hoped in the Christ thirteen in whom ye also after having heard the word of truth the good news of your salvation in whom I say having also believed one thirteen ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise fourteen which is an earnest of our inheritance until the redemption one fourteen of the purchased possession to the praise of his glory fifteen For this cause I also having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love to all the saints sixteen cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers seventeen that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of glory would give to you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the full knowledge of him eighteen the eyes of your heart being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints nineteen and what the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the working of his mighty power twenty which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his own right hand in the heavenly places twenty one far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come twenty two and subjected all things under his feet and gave him to be head over all things to the church twenty three which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all one twenty three II YOU also being dead in trespasses and sins two in which ye once walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience three among whom we also all walked in time past in the desires of our flesh doing the will of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature children of wrath even as others four but God being rich in mercy on account of his great love wherewith he loved us made us five even when we were dead in sins alive with Christ by grace ye are saved six and raised us with him and made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus seven that he might show in the ages to come the exceeding richness of his grace in his kindness toward us in Christ Jesus eight For by grace ye are saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God nine not of works lest any one should boast ten For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God before prepared that we should walk in them eleven Wherefore remember that in time past ye the Gentiles in the flesh who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision in the flesh made by hand twelve that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of the promise having no hope and without God in the world thirteen But now in Christ Jesus ye who in time past were afar off were made near by the blood of Christ fourteen For he is our peace who made both one and broke down the middle wall of partition fifteen having abolished in his flesh the enmity the law of commandments contained in ordinances that he might make the two one new man in himself making peace sixteen and might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby seventeen And he came and brought the good news of peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near eighteen Because through him we both have the access in one Spirit to the Father nineteen So then ye are no longer strangers and sojourners but ye are fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God twenty having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone twenty one in whom all the building fitly framed together grows unto a holy temple in the Lord twenty two in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit III FOR this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles two if indeed ye heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given me toward you three that by revelation the mystery was made known to me as I wrote before in few words four whereby when ye read ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ five which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit six that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers with us of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel seven whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God which was given to me according to the working of his power eight To me who am less than the least of all the saints was this grace given to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ nine and to make all see what is the dispensation of the mystery which from ages has been hidden in God who created all things ten that now to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God eleven according to the eternal purpose which he made three eleven in Christ Jesus our Lord twelve in whom we have boldness and access three twelve with confidence through faith in him thirteen Wherefore I entreat that ye faint not at my afflictions for you which is your glory fourteen For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ three fourteen fifteen from whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named sixteen that he would grant to you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might through his Spirit as to the inner man seventeen that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith having been rooted and grounded in love eighteen that ye may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height nineteen and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that ye may be filled unto all the fullness of God twenty Now to him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that works in us twenty one to him be the glory in the church in Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without end Amen IV I THE prisoner in the Lord exhort you therefore to walk worthy of the calling with which ye were called two with all lowliness and meekness with long suffering bearing with one another in love three endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace four There is one body and one Spirit as also ye were called in one hope of your calling five one Lord one faith one immersion six one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all seven But to each one of us the grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ eight Wherefore he says When he ascended on high He led captivity captive And gave gifts to men nine Now this he ascended what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth ten The one who descended he is also the one who ascended above all the heavens that he may fill all things eleven And he gave some as apostles some as prophets some as evangelists some as pastors and teachers twelve for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the building up of the body of Christ thirteen till we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ fourteen that we may no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men by cunning craftiness after the wily manner of error fifteen but holding the truth may in love grow up into him in all things who is the head Christ sixteen from whom all the body fitly framed together and compacted by means of every joint of the supply according to the working in the measure of each single part effects the increase of the body to the upbuilding of itself in love seventeen This therefore I say and testify in the Lord that ye no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk four seventeen in the vanity of their mind eighteen having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in then because of the hardness of their heart nineteen who as being past feeling gave themselves up to wantonness to work all uncleanness in greediness four nineteen twenty But ye did not so learn Christ twenty one if indeed ye heard him and were taught in him as the truth is in Jesus twenty two that ye put off as concerns your former deportment the old man who is corrupted according to the lusts of deceit twenty three and be renewed in the spirit of your mind twenty four and put on the new man who was created after God in the righteousness and holiness of the truth twenty five Wherefore having put away falsehood speak truth each one with his neighbor because we are members one of another twenty six Be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath twenty seven neither give place to the Devil twenty eight Let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands that which is good that he may have to impart to him that has need twenty nine Let no corrupt discourse proceed out of your mouth but whatever is good for needful edification that it may impart grace to the hearers thirty And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption thirty one Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice thirty two and be kind to one another tender hearted forgiving one another as also God in Christ forgave you V BECOME therefore followers of God as beloved children two and walk in love as also Christ loved us and gave himself up for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of sweet smell three But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not even be named among you as becomes saints four and filthiness and foolish talking and jesting which are not becoming but rather giving of thanks five For this ye know being aware that no fornicator nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God six Let no one deceive you with vain words for because of these things comes the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience seven Become not therefore partakers with them eight For ye were once darkness but now light in the Lord Walk as children of light nine for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ten proving what is acceptable to the Lord eleven and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather also reprove them twelve For it is a shame even to speak of the things done by them in secret thirteen But all things when reproved are by the light made manifest for whatever makes manifest is light fourteen Wherefore he says Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ will give thee light fifteen See to it then how ye walk with exactness not as unwise but as wise sixteen redeeming the time because the days are evil seventeen Therefore be not foolish but understanding what is the will of the Lord eighteen And be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the Spirit nineteen speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord twenty giving thanks always for all things to God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ twenty one submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ twenty two wives to their own husbands as to the Lord twenty three Because a husband is the head of the wife as also Christ is the head of the church himself the Savior of the body twenty four But as the church is subjected to Christ so also are the wives to their own husbands in everything twenty five Husbands love your wives as also Christ loved the church and gave himself up for it twenty six that he might sanctify it having cleansed it by the bathing of water in the word twenty seven that he might himself present to himself the church glorious having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it may be holy and blameless twenty eight So husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies He that loves his wife loves himself twenty nine For no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it as also Christ the church thirty because we are members of his body being of his flesh and of his bones thirty one For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall be one flesh thirty two This mystery is great but I am speaking of Christ and of the church thirty three Nevertheless do ye also severally each so love his wife even as himself and let the wife see that she reverence her husband VI CHILDREN obey your parents in the Lord for this is right two Honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise three that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth four And fathers do not provoke your children to anger but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord five Servants obey your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as to Christ six not with eye service as men pleasers but as servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart seven with good will doing service as to the Lord and not to men eight knowing that whatever good thing each may have done that shall he receive from the Lord whether bond or free nine And masters do the same things to them forbearing threatening knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven and there is no respect of persons with him ten Finally be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might eleven Put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil twelve For to us the contest is not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against the spiritual powers of evil in the heavenly places six twelve thirteen Therefore take on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having fully done all to stand fourteen Stand therefore having girded your loins about with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness fifteen and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace sixteen in addition to all having taken on the shield of faith in which ye will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one seventeen And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God eighteen praying at every fitting season in the Spirit with all prayer and supplication and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints nineteen and for me that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth with boldness to make known the mystery of the gospel twenty for which I am an ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak twenty one But that ye also may know my affairs how I do Tychicus the beloved brother and a faithful minister in the Lord will make all known to you twenty two whom I sent to you for this very thing that ye might know our affairs and that he might encourage your hearts twenty three Peace be to the brethren and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ twenty four Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS I PAUL and Timothy servants of Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi with the overseers one one and deacons two Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ three I thank my God on every remembrance of you four always in every supplication of mine making the supplication for you all with joy five for your fellowship in respect to the gospel one five from the first day until now six being confident of this very thing that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ seven As it is just for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart one seven being all of you both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel partakers of the grace with me eight For God is my witness how greatly I long for you all with the tender affection of Jesus Christ nine And this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment ten in order that ye may approve the things that are most excellent one ten that ye may be pure and without offense unto the day of Christ eleven being filled with the fruit of righteousness which is by Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God twelve But I desire that ye should know brethren that the things which befell me have resulted rather in the furtherance of the gospel thirteen so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in all the Praetorium and to all the rest fourteen and that the greater part of the brethren made confident in the Lord by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear fifteen Some indeed preach Christ also from envy and strife but some also from good will sixteen the one out of love knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel seventeen the other out of contentiousness proclaim Christ not with pure intent supposing that they shall add affliction one seventeen to my bonds eighteen What then Notwithstanding in every way whether in pretense or in truth Christ is proclaimed and therein I rejoice yea and shall rejoice nineteen For I know that this will turn out for my salvation through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ twenty according to my earnest expectation and hope that I shall in nothing be put to shame but that with all boldness as always so also now Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death twenty one For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain twenty two But if it be to live in the flesh this to me is fruit of labor and which I shall choose I know not twenty three but am constrained by the two having the desire to depart and to be with Christ for it is far better twenty four but to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sakes twenty five And being persuaded of this I know that I shall remain and shall continue with you all for your furtherance and joy in the faith twenty six that your glorying may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me through my coming to you again twenty seven Only let your deportment be as becomes the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or remain absent I may hear of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel twenty eight and in nothing terrified by the adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation one twenty eight and that from God twenty nine Because to you it was granted in behalf of Christ not only to believe on him but in his behalf to suffer also thirty having the same conflict as ye saw in me and now hear of in me II IF then there is any consolation two one in Christ if any comfort from love if any communion of the Spirit if any tender affection and compassion two make my joy complete that ye be of the same mind having the same love being of one accord of the one mind three doing nothing through contentiousness or vainglory but in lowliness of mind each esteeming others better than himself four regarding not each one his own but each one also the things of others five Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus six who being in the form of God did not account it robbery to be equal with God seven but emptied himself taking the form of a servant being made in the likeness of men eight And being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself becoming obedient unto death even the death of the cross nine Wherefore also God highly exalted him and gave him a name which is above every name ten that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of beings in heaven and of beings on earth and of beings under the earth eleven and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father twelve Wherefore my beloved as ye always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling thirteen for it is God who works in you both to will and to perform of his good pleasure fourteen Do all without murmurings and disputings fifteen that ye may become blameless and simple children of God unreproachable in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom ye appear as do the heavenly lights in the world sixteen holding forth one sixteen the word of life for a ground of glorying to me at the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or labor in vain seventeen But even if I am poured out on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith I rejoice and I rejoice with you all eighteen For the same cause two eighteen do ye also rejoice and rejoice with me nineteen But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly to you that I also may be cheered when I know your state twenty For I have no one like minded who will sincerely care for your state twenty one For all seek their own not the things of Jesus Christ twenty two But ye know the proof of him that as a child with a father he served with me for the gospel twenty three Him therefore I hope to send without delay so soon as I shall see how it will go with me twenty four but I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly twenty five Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and companion in labor and fellow soldier but your messenger and minister to my wants twenty six For he was longing after you all and was much distressed because ye heard that he was sick twenty seven For indeed he was sick near to death but God had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow twenty eight I sent him therefore with the more haste that seeing him again ye might rejoice and that I may be less sorrowful twenty nine Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and hold such in honor thirty because for the work of Christ he came near to death hazarding his life that he might supply what things were lacking on your part of the ministration to me III FINALLY my brethren rejoice in the Lord To write the same things to you to me is not burdensome and for you it is safe two Beware of the dogs beware of the evil workers beware of the concision three For we are the circumcision who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh four Though I have confidence also in the flesh If any other thinks that he has confidence in the flesh I more five circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of Hebrews as to the law a Pharisee six as to zeal persecuting the church as to the righteousness which is in the law blameless seven But what things were gain to me these I have accounted loss for Christ eight Nay more and I account all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I suffered the loss of all things and account them refuse that I may gain Christ nine and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of law but that which is through faith in Christ the righteousness which is of God upon faith ten that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings three ten being conformed to his death eleven if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead twelve Not that I already obtained the prize three twelve or have already been perfected but I pursue onward if I may lay hold of that for which I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus thirteen Brethren I do not count myself to have laid hold of it but one thing I do forgetting the things behind and reaching forth to the things before fourteen I pursue on toward the mark for the prize of the heavenly calling of God in Christ Jesus fifteen Let us therefore as many as are perfect be of this mind and if in any thing ye are otherwise minded this also God will reveal to you sixteen Nevertheless whereto we have attained in the same let us walk seventeen Brethren be followers together of me and mark those who so walk as ye have us for an example eighteen For many walk of whom I told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ nineteen whose end is destruction whose God is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things twenty For our citizenship three twenty is in heaven from whence we also look for a Savior the Lord Jesus Christ twenty one who will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory according to the working with which he is able also to subject all things to himself one Therefore my brethren beloved and longed for my joy and crown so stand fast in the Lord beloved two I beseech Euodia and I beseech Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord three Yea I entreat thee also true yoke fellow help these women who labored with me in the gospel with Clement also and the rest of my fellow laborers whose names are in the book of life four Rejoice in the Lord always again I will say rejoice five Let your forbearance be known to all men The Lord is at hand six Be anxious for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God seven And the peace of God which passes all understanding will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus eight Finally brethren whatever things are true whatever things are honorable whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things nine The things also which ye learned and received and heard and saw in me these do and the God of peace will be with you ten But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length ye revived again in your care for my welfare for which ye were also careful but lacked opportunity eleven Not that I speak in respect of want for I learned in whatever state I am to be content twelve I both know how to be abased and I know how to abound in every thing and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to be in want thirteen I can do all things in him who strengthens me fourteen Notwithstanding ye did well to share with me in my affliction fifteen And ye also know Philippians that in the beginning of the gospel when I went forth from Macedonia no church communicated with me in an account of giving and receiving four fifteen but ye only sixteen that also in Thessalonica ye sent once and again to my necessity seventeen Not that I seek for the gift but I seek for the fruit that abounds to your account eighteen But I have all and abound I am full having received of Epaphroditus the things sent from you an odor of sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable well pleasing to God nineteen But my God will supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus twenty Now to God and our Father be the glory forever and ever Amen twenty one Salute every saint in Christ Jesus The brethren who are with me salute you twenty two All the saints salute you but especially they that are of Caesar s household twenty three The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS I PAUL an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God and Timothy the brother two to the saints in Colosse and faithful brethren in Christ Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ three We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ praying always for you four having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which ye have toward all the saints five because of the hope which is laid up for you in heaven of which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel six which is come to you as also in all the world and is bringing forth fruit and increasing also in you since the day ye heard it and knew the grace of God in truth seven as ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant who is for you a faithful minister of Christ eight who also made known to us your love in the Spirit nine For this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to ask that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ten that ye may walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing bringing forth fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God eleven being strengthened with all strength according to his glorious power unto all patience and long suffering with joy twelve giving thanks to the Father who made us meet for the portion of the inheritance of the saints in light thirteen who delivered us out of the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love fourteen in whom we have the redemption the remission of our sins fifteen who is the image of the invisible God the first born of every creature sixteen because in him were all things created the things in the heavens and the things on the earth the visible and the invisible whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things have been created by him and for him seventeen and he is before all things and in him all things subsist eighteen And he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that he may become in all things pre eminent nineteen For He was pleased that in him should all the fullness dwell twenty and through him to reconcile all things to himself having made peace through the blood of his cross through him whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens twenty one And you also being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in wicked works yet now has he reconciled twenty two in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and blameless and unaccused before him twenty three if indeed ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye heard which was preached in the whole creation which is under heaven of which I Paul was made a minister twenty four Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body which is the church twenty five of which I was made a minister according to the dispensation of God which was given to me for you to fulfill the word of God twenty six the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations but now has been manifested to his saints twenty seven to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory twenty eight whom we announce warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ twenty nine to which end I also labor striving according to his working which works in me with power II FOR I would have you know how great a conflict I have for you and for those in Laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh two that their hearts might be encouraged they being knit together in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of the understanding unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God even Christ three in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden four And this I say that no one may beguile you with enticing words five For though I am absent in the flesh yet in the spirit I am with you rejoicing and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith toward Christ six As therefore ye received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk in him seven having been rooted and being built up in him and being established in the faith as ye were taught abounding therein with thanksgiving eight Beware lest there shall be any one that despoils you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ nine Because in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily ten And ye are made complete in him two ten who is the head of all principality and power eleven in whom ye were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands in the putting off of the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ twelve being buried with him in the immersion wherein ye were also raised with him through faith in the working of God who raised him from the dead thirteen And you also being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh he made alive together with him graciously forgiving us all our trespasses fourteen blotting out the handwriting in ordinances that was against us which was opposed to us and he has taken it out of the way nailing it to the cross fifteen despoiling principalities and powers two fifteena he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it two fifteenb sixteen Let not any one therefore judge you in food or in drink or in respect of a feast day or of a new moon or of a sabbath seventeen which are a shadow of the things to come but the body is of Christ eighteen Let no one defraud you of the prize seeking it two eighteen in humiliation and worship of the angels intruding into things which he has not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind nineteen and not holding fast the head from whom all the body by means of the joints and bands having nourishment ministered and being knit together increases with the increase of God twenty If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances twenty one Handle not nor taste nor touch twenty two which are all to perish with the using after the commandments and teachings of men twenty three Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in self chosen worship and humiliation and neglecting of the body not in any honor for the satisfying of the flesh III IF then ye were raised together with Christ seek the things above where Christ is sitting on the right hand of God two Set your mind on the things above not on the things upon the earth three For ye died and your life is hid with Christ in God four When Christ our life shall be manifested then will ye also with him be manifested in glory five Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness passion evil desire and covetousness which is idolatry six on account of which things the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience seven in which ye also once walked when ye lived in these things eight But now do ye also put all away anger wrath malice reviling filthy communication out of your mouth nine Lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds ten and have put on the new man who is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him who created him eleven where there is no Greek and Jew circumcision and uncircumcision Barbarian Scythian bondman freeman but Christ is all and in all twelve Put on therefore as God s chosen holy and beloved bowels of compassion kindness lowliness of mind meekness long suffering thirteen forbearing one another and freely forgiving each other if any one have a complaint against any even as Christ freely forgave you so also do ye fourteen and over all these love which is the bond of perfectness fifteen And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which ye were also called in one body and be thankful sixteen Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms hymns spiritual songs in grace singing in your hearts to God seventeen And whatever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God the Father through him eighteen Wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as is fitting in the Lord nineteen Husbands love your wives and be not bitter toward them twenty Children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing in the Lord twenty one Fathers provoke not your children that they be not discouraged twenty two Servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh not with eye service as men pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing the Lord twenty three Whatever ye do do it heartily as to the Lord and not to men twenty four knowing that from the Lord ye will receive the recompense of the inheritance Serve the Lord Christ twenty five For he that does wrong will receive that which he did wrongfully and there is no respect of persons one Masters render to your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven two Persevere in prayer being watchful therein with thanksgiving three at the same time praying also for us that God would open to us a door for the word to speak the mystery of Christ for the sake of which I am also in bonds four that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak five Walk in wisdom toward those without redeeming the time six Let your speech be always with grace seasoned with salt that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man seven All my affairs will Tychicus make known to you the beloved brother and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord eight whom I sent to you for this very purpose that he may know your condition and may comfort your hearts nine together with Onesimus the faithful and beloved brother who is one of you They will make known to you all the things here ten Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you and Mark the cousin of Barnabas concerning whom ye received commands if he come to you receive him eleven and Jesus who is called Justus who are of the circumcision These only are my fellow workers for the kingdom of God who have been a comfort to me twelve Epaphras who is one of you a servant of Christ Jesus salutes you always striving for you in his prayers that ye may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God thirteen For I bear him witness that he has much concern four thirteen for you and those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis fourteen Luke the beloved physician and Demas salute you fifteen Salute the brethren in Laodicea and Nymphas and the church in his house sixteen And when the letter has been read among you cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans and that ye also read that from Laodicea seventeen And say to Archippus Take heed to the ministry which thou didst receive in the Lord that thou fulfill it eighteen The salutation by the hand of me Paul Remember my bonds Grace be with you THE FIRST LETTER OF PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS I PAUL and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ Grace to you and peace two We give thanks to God always for you all making mention of you in our prayers three remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before God and our Father four knowing brethren beloved of God your election five because our gospel came not to you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance as ye know what manner of men were we among you for your sake six And ye became followers of us and of the Lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit seven so that ye became an example to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia eight For from you has sounded forth the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth so that we have no need to speak anything nine For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entrance we had to you and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God ten and to wait for his Son from heaven whom he raised from the dead Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come II FOR yourselves brethren know our entrance to you that it has not become vain two But having before suffered and been shamefully treated as ye know at Philippi we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much conflict three For our exhortation is not of error nor of uncleanness nor in guile four but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel so we speak not as pleasing men but God who proves our hearts five For neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know nor a cloak of covetousness God is witness six nor of men sought we glory neither from you nor from others though able to use authority as Christ s apostles seven But we were gentle among you as a nurse cherishes her children eight so being affectionately desirous of you we were willing to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls because ye were dear to us nine For ye remember brethren our labor and toil night and day working in order not to burden any of you we preached to you the gospel of God ten Ye are witnesses and God how holily and justly and unblamably we behaved ourselves to you that believe eleven as ye know how we exhorted and encouraged and charged every one of you as a father his children twelve that ye should walk worthy of God who is calling you into his kingdom and glory thirteen For this cause we also thank God without ceasing that when ye received the word of God heard from us ye received not the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God which also works in you that believe fourteen For ye brethren became followers of the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen as they have of the Jews fifteen who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and drove us forth and please not God and are contrary to all men sixteen hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved to fill up their sins always and the wrath came upon them to the utmost seventeen But we brethren having been severed from you for a short time in presence not in heart endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire eighteen Wherefore we would fain have come to you even I Paul once and again and Satan hindered us nineteen For what is our hope or joy or crown of glorying Are not also ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming twenty For ye are our glory and joy III WHEREFORE when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone two and sent Timothy our brother and a fellow worker with God in the gospel of Christ to establish you and to exhort you concerning your faith three that no one should be shaken by these afflictions for yourselves know that unto this we are appointed four For even when we were with you we told you before that we are to suffer affliction as also it came to pass and ye know five For this cause when I too could no longer forbear I sent to know your faith lest by some means the tempter tempted you and our labor should be in vain six But now when Timothy came to us from you and brought us good tidings of your faith and love and that ye have good remembrance of us always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you seven for this cause we were consoled brethren over you in all our affliction and distress through your faith eight because now we live if ye stand fast in the Lord nine For what thanks can we render to God for you for all the joy wherewith we rejoice for your sakes before our God ten night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith eleven Now God and our Father himself and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you twelve And the Lord make you increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all as we also do toward you thirteen to the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God and our Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints IV FURTHERMORE then brethren we beseech you and exhort you in the Lord Jesus that as ye received from us how ye ought to walk and to please God as also ye are walking ye would abound yet more two For ye know what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus three For this is the will of God your sanctification that ye abstain from fornication four that each one of you know how to possess four four his vessel in sanctification and honor five not in lustful passion as also the Gentiles who know not God six That no one go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter four six because the Lord is the avenger for all these things as we also told you before and testified seven For God did not call us to uncleanness but in sanctification eight Therefore he that rejects rejects not man but God who also gave to you his Holy Spirit nine But concerning brotherly love ye need not that I write to you for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another ten For indeed ye do it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia But we beseech you brethren to abound yet more eleven and to study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we commanded you twelve that ye may walk becomingly toward those without and may have need of nothing thirteen But we desire that you should not be ignorant brethren concerning those who are sleeping that ye sorrow not as others who have no hope fourteen For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again so also those who fell asleep through Jesus will God bring with him fifteen For this we say to you in the word of the Lord that we the living who remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not precede those who fell asleep sixteen Because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God and the dead in Christ will first rise seventeen Then we the living who remain will be caught up together with them in clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord eighteen Wherefore encourage one another with these words V BUT of the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that I write to you two For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night three For when they shall say Peace and safety then sudden destruction comes upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape four But ye brethren are not in darkness that the day should overtake you as a thief five For all ye are sons of light and sons of day we are not of night nor of darkness six So then let us not sleep as others but let us watch and be sober seven For they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are drunken in the night eight But let us being of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation nine because God did not appoint us to wrath but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ten who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him eleven Wherefore encourage each other and edify one the other as also ye do twelve And we beseech you brethren to know those who labor among you and preside over you in the Lord and admonish you thirteen and to esteem them very highly in love for their work s sake Be at peace among yourselves fourteen Now we exhort you brethren admonish the unruly comfort the feeble minded support the weak be long suffering toward all fifteen See that none render evil for evil to any one but ever follow that which is good both toward one another and toward all sixteen Rejoice always seventeen Pray without ceasing eighteen In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you nineteen Quench not the Spirit twenty Despise not prophesyings twenty one but prove all things hold fast that which is good twenty two Abstain from every form of evil twenty three And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved whole without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ twenty four Faithful is he who calls you who also will do it twenty five Brethren pray for us twenty six Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss twenty seven I adjure you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brethren twenty eight The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you THE SECOND LETTER OF PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS I PAUL and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ two Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ three We are bound to thank God always for you brethren as it is meet because your faith grows exceedingly and the love of each one of you all toward one another abounds four so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions which ye endure five a token of the righteous judgment of God that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which ye also suffer six since it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to those who afflict you seven and to you who are afflicted rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power eight in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God and those who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ nine who shall suffer justice eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power ten when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all who believed because our testimony to you was believed in that day eleven To which end we also pray for you always that our God may count you worthy of the calling and accomplish all the good pleasure of goodness and the work of faith with power twelve that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ II NOW we beseech you brethren concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him two that ye be not hastily shaken in mind two twoa or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as through us as that the day of the Lord is at hand two twob three Let not any one deceive you in any manner because that day will not come except there come first the falling away and the man of sin be revealed the son of perdition four he that opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he sits in the temple of God showing himself that he is God five Remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these things six And now ye know what withholds in order that he may be revealed in his own time seven For the mystery of iniquity is already working only until he who now withholds shall be out of the way eight And then will the Lawless One be revealed whom the Lord Jesus will consume with the breath of his mouth and will destroy with the manifestation of his coming nine him whose coming is after the working of Satan in all power and signs and lying wonders ten and in all deceit of unrighteousness for those who perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved eleven And for this cause God sends them a working of delusion in order that they may believe the lie twelve that they may all be judged who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness thirteen But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you brethren beloved of the Lord because God from the beginning chose you to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth fourteen whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ fifteen So then brethren stand fast and hold the traditions two fifteen which ye were taught whether by word or by our letter sixteen Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God and our Father who loved us and gave us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace seventeen encourage your hearts and establish you in every good work and word III FINALLY brethren pray for us that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified as also with you two and that we may be delivered from perverse and evil men for all have not the faith three But faithful is the Lord who will establish you and guard you from evil three three four And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you that ye both do and will do the things which we command you five And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ six Now we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly and not after the tradition three six which they received from us seven For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us that we were not disorderly among you eight nor did we eat bread of any one for naught but with labor and toil working night and day that we might not be burdensome to any of you nine not because we have not power but to make ourselves an example to you that ye should follow us ten For also when we were with you this we commanded you If any will not work neither let him eat eleven For we hear of some who walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busy bodies twelve Now such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ that with quietness working they eat their own bread thirteen But ye brethren be not weary in well doing fourteen And if any one obeys not our word by this letter mark that man and keep not company with him that he may be shamed fifteen And count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother sixteen Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in every way The Lord be with you all seventeen The salutation of Paul with my own hand which is a token in every letter so I write eighteen The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all THE FIRST LETTER OF PAUL TO TIMOTHY I PAUL an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope two to Timothy a true child in the faith Grace mercy peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord three As I besought thee to remain still in Ephesus when I was going into Macedonia that thou mightest charge certain ones not to teach other doctrine four nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies which further disputes rather than God s dispensation which is in faith so do five Now the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned six from which some swerving turned aside to idle prattling seven desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm eight But we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully nine knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but for the lawless and unruly for the ungodly and sinful for the unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers one nine for man slayers ten for fornicators for those who defile themselves with mankind for enslavers of men for liars for false swearers and whatever else is contrary to the sound teachings eleven according to the glorious gospel of the blissful God with which I was entrusted twelve And I thank him who gave me strength Christ Jesus our Lord that he accounted me faithful putting me into the ministry thirteen who was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and overbearing But I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief fourteen and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus fifteen Faithful is the saying and worthy of all acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief sixteen But for this cause I obtained mercy that in me first one sixteena Christ Jesus might show forth all his long suffering one sixteenb for a pattern to those who should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting seventeen Now to the King eternal the imperishable invisible only God be honor and glory forever and ever Amen eighteen This charge I commit to thee my child Timothy according to the prophecies which went before concerning thee that thou mayest wage in them the good warfare nineteen having faith and a good conscience which some thrusting away made shipwreck concerning the faith twenty Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander whom I delivered over to Satan that they might be taught not to blaspheme II I EXHORT then first of all that supplications prayers intercessions thanksgivings be made for all men two for kings and all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and decorum three For this is good and acceptable in the sight of our Savior God four who desires that all should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth five For there is one God one mediator also between God and men the man Christ Jesus six who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time seven whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle I speak truth I lie not a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth eight I desire therefore that the men pray in every place lifting up holy hands without wrath and disputing nine in like manner also that women in becoming apparel adorn themselves with modesty and sobriety not in braided hair or gold or pearls or costly raiment ten but which becomes women professing godliness by means of good works eleven Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection twelve But I permit not the woman to teach nor to have authority over the man but to be in silence thirteen For Adam was first formed then Eve fourteen And Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived has fallen into transgression fifteen But she shall be saved through child bearing if they continue in faith and love and holiness with sobriety III FAITHFUL is the saying if any one desires the office of overseer three one he desires a good work two The overseer then must be blameless the husband of one wife sober discreet orderly hospitable apt in teaching three not given to wine not a striker but forbearing averse to strife not a lover of money four presiding well over his own house having his children in subjection with all decorum five but if one knows not how to preside over his own house how shall he take care of the church of God six not a novice three six lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the Devil seven But he must also have a good testimony from those without lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil eight Deacons in like manner must be grave not double tongued not given to much wine not greedy of gain nine holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience ten And let these also first be proved then let them serve as deacons being without reproach eleven Their wives in like manner must be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things twelve Let the deacons be husbands of one wife presiding well over their children and their own houses thirteen For they that have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a good degree three thirteen and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus fourteen These things I write to thee hoping to come to thee shortly fifteen but if I tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to conduct thyself in the house of God which is the church of the living God the pillar and ground of the truth sixteen And confessedly great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested three sixteen in the flesh was justified in the Spirit was seen by angels was preached among the Gentiles was believed on in the world was received up in glory IV NOW the Spirit says expressly that in after times some will depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons two of those who speak lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron three forbidding to marry commanding to abstain from food which God created to be received with thanksgiving for those four three who believe and know the truth four For every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving five for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer six If thou put the brethren in mind of these things thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus nurtured in the words of the faith and of the good teaching which thou hast strictly followed seven But the profane and silly fables four seven avoid and exercise thyself unto godliness eight For bodily exercise is profitable for little but godliness is profitable for all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come nine Faithful is the saying and worthy of all acceptance ten For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach because we have hoped in the living God who is the Savior of all men especially of believers eleven These things command and teach twelve Let no one despise thy youth but become an example of the believers in word in deportment in love in faith in purity thirteen Till I come give attention to reading to exhortation to teaching fourteen Neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee through prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership fifteen Meditate on these things four fifteen give thyself wholly to them that thy progress may be manifest to all sixteen Give heed to thyself and to the teaching continue in them for in doing this thou wilt save both thyself and those who hear thee V REBUKE not an elder but entreat him as a father younger men as brethren two elder women as mothers the younger as sisters with all purity three Honor as widows those who are widows indeed four But if any widow has children or grand children let these learn first to show piety to their own household and to requite their parents for this is acceptable before God five Now she that is a widow indeed and left alone has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day six But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives seven And these things command that they may be blameless eight But if any one provides not for his own and especially for those of his own house he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever nine Let not one be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old having been the wife of one husband ten well reported of for good works if she brought up children if she lodged strangers if she washed the feet of the saints if she relieved the afflicted if she diligently followed every good work eleven But younger widows refuse for when they have become wanton against Christ they desire to marry twelve having condemnation because they broke their first faith thirteen And at the same time they also learn to be idle going about from house to house and not only idle but tattlers also and busy bodies speaking things which they ought not fourteen I desire therefore that younger widows marry bear children guide the house give no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully fifteen For already some turned aside after Satan sixteen If any believing man or woman has widows let them relieve them and let not the church be burdened that it may relieve those who are widows indeed seventeen Let elders who preside well be counted worthy of double honor especially they who labor in the word and teaching eighteen For the Scripture says Thou shalt not muzzle an ox while treading out the grain and The laborer is worthy of his hire nineteen Against an elder receive not an accusation except before two or three witnesses five nineteen twenty Those who sin rebuke before all that the rest also may fear twenty one I charge thee before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels that thou observe these things without prejudging doing nothing with partiality twenty two Lay hands hastily on no one neither share in other men s sins Keep thyself pure twenty three No longer drink water only but use a little wine for thy stomach s sake and for thy frequent infirmities twenty four The sins of some men are openly manifest going before to judgment and some men they follow after twenty five In like manner also the good works are openly manifest and those that are otherwise can not be hidden VI LET as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor that the name of God and the teaching be not blasphemed two And they that have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brethren but the rather do them service because they who receive the benefit are faithful and beloved These things teach and exhort three If any one teaches otherwise and assents not to sound words the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the teaching which is according to godliness four he is puffed up with pride knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof comes envy strife railings evil surmisings five vain disputings of men corrupted in mind and robbed of the truth supposing that godliness is a means of gain six But godliness with contentment is a great means of gain seven For we brought nothing into the world it is certain we can also carry nothing out eight and having food and raiment let us be therewith content nine But they who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts which sink men into destruction and perdition ten For the love of money is a root of all evils which some coveting after wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows eleven But thou O man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness of spirit twelve Fight the good fight of the faith lay hold on the eternal life unto which thou wast called and didst make the good profession before many witnesses thirteen I charge thee in the sight of God who preserves all alive and of Jesus Christ who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good profession fourteen that thou keep the commandment without spot blameless until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ fifteen which in his own times six fifteen he will show who is the blissful and only Potentate the King of kings and Lord of lords sixteen who only has immortality dwelling in light unapproachable whom no man has seen or can see to whom be honor and power everlasting Amen seventeen Charge those who are rich in this world that they be not high minded nor place their hope on the uncertainty of riches but in God who gives us all things richly for enjoyment eighteen that they do good be rich in good works be free in imparting willing to communicate nineteen laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on the true life twenty O Timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoiding the profane babblings and oppositions of that which is falsely called knowledge twenty one which some professing erred concerning the faith Grace be with thee THE SECOND LETTER OF PAUL TO TIMOTHY I PAUL an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus two to Timothy a beloved child Grace mercy peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord three I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day four longing to see thee remembering thy tears that I may be filled with joy five calling to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded that it dwells in thee also six For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the laying on of my hands seven For God did not give us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of chastisement eight Be not then ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me his prisoner but endure hardship with me for the gospel according to the power of God nine who saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and the grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before eternal ages ten but now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who abolished death and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel eleven for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles twelve For which cause I suffer also these things But I am not ashamed for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him unto that day thirteen Hold fast the form of sound words which thou heardest from me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus fourteen The good thing committed to thee keep through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us fifteen Thou knowest this that all those in Asia turned away from me of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes sixteen The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain seventeen but when he was in Rome he sought me out very diligently and found me eighteen The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day And in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus thou knowest very well II THOU therefore my child be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus two And the things that thou heardest from me by many witnesses two two the same commit thou to faithful men who will be able to teach others also three Endure hardship with me as a good soldier of Jesus Christ four No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life that he may please him who chose him to be a soldier five And if a man also contends in the games he is not crowned unless he contends lawfully six The husbandman that labors must first partake of the fruits seven Consider what I say for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things eight Remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead of the seed of David according to my gospel nine in which I endure hardship even unto bonds as an evil doer but the word of God is not bound ten For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the chosen that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory eleven Faithful is the saying For if we died with him we shall also live with him twelve if we endure we shall also reign with him if we shall deny him he also will deny us thirteen if we are faithless he remains faithful for he can not deny himself fourteen Of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord not to strive about words to no profit to the subverting of the hearers fifteen Endeavor to present thyself approved to God a workman not made ashamed rightly dividing two fifteen the word of truth sixteen But shun the profane babblings for they will go on to more ungodliness seventeen And their word will eat as does a canker of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus eighteen who erred concerning the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place and overturn the faith of some nineteen Nevertheless God s firm foundation stands having this seal The Lord knew those who are his and Let every one that names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity twenty But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some for honor and some for dishonor twenty one If a man therefore cleanse himself from these he shall be a vessel for honor sanctified useful for the master prepared for every good work twenty two But flee youthful lusts and follow righteousness faith love peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart twenty three But the foolish and ignorant questionings avoid knowing that they beget strifes twenty four And a servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle toward all apt in teaching patient of evil twenty five in meekness admonishing those who oppose themselves if haply God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth twenty six and that they may awake to soberness out of the snare of the Devil being taken captive by him to do his will two twenty six III BUT know this that in the last days perilous times will come two For men will be lovers of themselves lovers of money boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy three without natural affection implacable false accusers incontinent fierce without love to the good four betrayers headlong puffed up lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God five having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof and from these turn away six For of these are they who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts seven ever learning and never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth eight Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses so also do these withstand the truth men corrupted in mind reprobate concerning the faith nine But they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be fully manifest to all as was also theirs ten But thou didst strictly follow my teaching manner of life purpose faith long suffering love patience eleven persecutions afflictions what things came upon me at Antioch at Iconium at Lystra what persecutions I endured and out of all the Lord delivered me twelve Yea and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution thirteen But evil men and seducers will grow worse and worse deceiving and being deceived fourteen But do thou continue in the things which thou learnedst and wast assured of knowing of whom thou didst learn fifteen and that from a child thou didst know the Holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus sixteen All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable three sixteen for teaching for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness seventeen that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works IV I CHARGE thee before God and Christ Jesus who will judge the living and the dead and by his appearing and his kingdom two preach the word apply thyself in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long suffering and teaching three For the time will come when they will not endure the sound teaching but according to their own desires will to themselves heap up teachers having itching ears four and they will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to fables five But be thou watchful in all things endure hardship do the work of an evangelist fully accomplish thy ministry six For I am now about to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand seven I have fought the good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith eight henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge will give me in that day and not to me only but also to all those who have loved his appearing nine Endeavor to come to me shortly ten For Demas forsook me having loved the present world and departed to Thessalonica Crescens to Galatia Titus to Dalmatia eleven Luke alone is with me Take Mark and bring him with thee for he is useful to me for the ministry twelve But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus thirteen The cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus when thou comest bring and the books especially the parchments fourteen Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil the Lord reward him according to his works fifteen Of whom do thou also beware for he has greatly withstood our words sixteen At my first answer no one came forward with me but all forsook me May it not be laid to their charge seventeen But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the Gentiles might hear and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion eighteen The Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will bring me safe to his heavenly kingdom to whom be the glory forever and ever Amen nineteen Salute Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus twenty Erastus remained in Corinth but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick twenty one Endeavor to come before winter Eubulus salutes thee and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren twenty two The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit Grace be with you THE LETTER OF PAUL TO TITUS I PAUL a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God s chosen and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness two upon hope of eternal life which God who can not lie promised before eternal ages three but in its own one three times manifested his word in the preaching with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of our Savior God four to Titus a true child according to the common faith Grace mercy peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior five For this cause I left thee behind in Crete that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting and appoint elders in each city as I directed thee six if any one is without reproach the husband of one wife having believing children not accused of rioting or unruly seven For the overseer one seven must be without reproach as God s steward not self willed not soon angry not given to wine not a striker not greedy of gain eight but hospitable a lover of the good discreet just holy temperate nine holding fast the faithful word according to the teaching that he may be able with the sound teaching both to exhort and to refute the gainsayers ten For there are many unruly vain talkers and deceivers chiefly they of the circumcision eleven whose mouths must be stopped who overturn whole houses teaching things which they ought not for the sake of base gain twelve One of themselves a prophet of their own said Cretans are always liars evil beasts lazy gluttons thirteen This testimony is true For which cause reprove them sharply that they may be sound in the faith fourteen not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth fifteen To the pure all things are pure but to the defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure but both their mind and conscience are defiled sixteen They profess that they know God but by their works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and for every good work reprobate II BUT do thou speak the things which become the sound teaching two that aged men be sober grave discreet sound in the faith in love in patience three that aged women likewise be in behavior as becomes holiness not false accusers not enslaved to much wine teachers of that which is good four that they may teach the young women to love their husbands to love their children five to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed six The younger men likewise exhort to be sober minded seven In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works in teaching showing uncorruptness gravity eight sound speech that can not be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be put to shame having no evil thing to say of us nine Exhort servants to submit themselves to their own masters to be well pleasing in all things not contradicting ten not purloining but showing all good faith that they may adorn the teaching of our Savior God in all things eleven For the saving grace of God appeared to all men twelve teaching us that having denied ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world thirteen looking for the blissful hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ fourteen who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and cleanse for himself a people to be his own zealous of good works fifteen These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority Let no one despise thee III PUT them in mind to submit themselves to governments to authorities to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work two to speak evil of no one to be averse to strife forbearing showing all meekness to all men three For we ourselves also were once foolish disobedient going astray serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful hating one another four But when the kindness and the love toward man of our Savior God appeared five not by works of righteousness which we did but according to his mercy he saved us through the bathing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit six which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior seven that having been justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life eight Faithful is the saying and concerning these things I will that thou affirm constantly that they who have believed God may be careful to take the lead in good works These things are good and profitable to men nine But avoid foolish questionings and genealogies and strifes and contentions about the law for they are unprofitable and vain ten A man that causes divisions after a first and second admonition avoid three ten eleven knowing that he that is such is perverted and sins being self condemned twelve When I shall send Artemas to thee or Tychicus endeavor to come to me to Nicopolis for I have determined there to winter thirteen Zenas the lawyer and Apollos send forward on their journey zealously that nothing may be wanting to them fourteen And let ours also learn to take the lead in good works for necessary wants that they may not be unfruitful fifteen All that are with me salute thee Salute those who love us in the faith Grace be with you all THE LETTER OF PAUL TO PHILEMON PAUL a prisoner of Christ Jesus and Timothy the brother to Philemon the beloved and our fellow laborer two and to Apphia the beloved one two and Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church in thy house three Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ four I thank my God always making mention of thee in my prayers five hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus and unto all the saints six that the fellowship of thy faith one six may become effectual in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us unto Christ Jesus seven For I had one seven much joy and consolation in thy love because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by thee brother eight Wherefore though having much boldness in Christ to enjoin upon thee that which is becoming nine yet for love s sake I beseech rather being such a one as Paul an old man and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ ten I beseech thee for my child whom I begot in my bonds Onesimus eleven who in time past was unprofitable to thee but is now profitable to thee and to me twelve whom I sent back to thee But do thou receive him that is my own flesh thirteen whom I would have retained with myself that in thy stead he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel fourteen But without thy consent I desired to do nothing that thy benefit may not be as it were of necessity but willingly fifteen For perhaps he departed for a season to this end that thou shouldest receive him as thine forever sixteen no longer as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved specially to me but how much more to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord seventeen If thou countest me therefore a partner receive him as myself eighteen But if he wronged thee in any thing or owes aught put that to my account nineteen I Paul wrote it with my own hand I will repay Not to say to thee that to me thou owest also thine own self besides twenty Yea brother let me have joy of thee in the Lord Refresh my heart in Christ twenty one Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote to thee knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say twenty two But at the same time be preparing for me also a lodging for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given to you twenty three There salute thee Epaphras my fellow captive in Christ Jesus twenty four Mark Aristarchus Demas Luke my fellow laborers twenty five The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit LETTER TO THE HEBREWS I GOD who in many parts and in many ways spoke of old to the fathers by the prophets two in these last days spoke to us by his Son whom he appointed heir of all things by whom he also made the worlds three who being the brightness of his glory and the impress of his substance and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself one three made a cleansing of sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high four having become so much superior to the angels as he has inherited a more excellent name than they five For to whom of the angels said he ever Thou art my Son I this day have begotten thee and again I will be to him a Father and he shall be to me a Son six But when he has again brought in one six the first begotten into the world he says And let all the angels of God worship him seven And of the angels he says Who makes his angels winds And his ministers a flame of fire eight but of the Son Thy throne O God is forever and ever A sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom nine Thou lovedst righteousness and hatedst iniquity Therefore God thy God anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows ten and Thou Lord in the beginning didst found the earth And the heavens are the works of thy hands eleven They will perish but thou remainest And they all will become old as does a garment twelve And as a vesture thou wilt fold them up and they will be changed But thou art the same And thy years will not fail thirteen But to whom of the angels has he ever said Sit on my right hand Until I make thine enemies thy footstool fourteen Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth for ministration for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation II ON this account we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things heard lest haply we should let them slip two one two For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution three how shall we escape having neglected so great a salvation which began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard four God also bearing witness with signs and wonders and divers miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his own will five For not to the angels did he put in subjection the world to come of which we are speaking six But one in a certain place testified saying What is man that thou art mindful of him Or the son of man that thou visitest him seven Thou madest him a little lower than the angels Thou crownedst him with glory and honor eight Thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet For in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him But now we do not yet see all things put under him nine But we behold him who was made a little lower than the angels Jesus on account of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor in order that he by the grace of God might taste death for every one ten For it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings eleven For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren twelve saying I will declare thy name to my brethren In the midst of the congregation I will sing praise to thee thirteen And again I will put my trust in him And again Behold I and the children whom God gave me fourteen Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself in like manner took part in the same that through death he might destroy him who had the power of death that is the Devil fifteen and might deliver those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage sixteen For surely he does not succor angels but he succors the seed of Abraham seventeen Wherefore in all things it became him to be made like to his brethren that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make propitiation for the sins of the people eighteen For in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to help those who are tempted III WHEREFORE holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession Jesus two who was faithful to him who appointed him as also was Moses in all His house three For he has been accounted worthy of more glory than Moses inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house four For every house is builded by some one but he who built all things is God five And Moses indeed was faithful in all His house as a servant as a testimony of the things which were to be afterward spoken six but Christ as son over His house whose house are we if we hold fast the boldness and the joyousness of the hope firm unto the end three six seven Wherefore as the Holy Spirit says To day if ye will hear his voice eight Harden not your hearts as in the provocation In the day of the temptation in the wilderness nine Where your fathers tempted me Proved me and saw my works forty years ten Wherefore I was offended with that generation And I said They always go astray in their heart And they knew not my ways eleven As I swore in my wrath They shall not enter into my rest twelve Take heed brethren lest there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God thirteen But exhort one another daily as long as it is called To day that no one of you may be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin fourteen For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end fifteen When it is said To day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation sixteen who then when they had heard provoked Nay was it not all who came forth out of Egypt by Moses seventeen But with whom was he offended forty years Was it not with those who sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness eighteen And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest but to those who believed not nineteen And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief IV LET us fear therefore lest a promise being still left us of entering into his rest any one of you should seem to have come short of it two For to us were the glad tidings preached as also to them but the word which they heard did not profit them not being mingled with faith in those who heard three For we who believed enter into the rest as he said As I swore in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world four For he has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day thus And God rested on the seventh day from all his works five and in this again They shall not enter into my rest six Since then it remains that some do enter into it and they to whom the glad tidings were first preached entered not in because of unbelief again seven he limits a certain day To day saying in David after so long a time as has before been said To day if ye will hear his voice Harden not your hearts eight For if Joshua had given them rest he would not after this have spoken of another day nine So then there remains a Sabbath rest to the people of God ten For he that entered into his rest himself rested from his works as God did from his own eleven Let us therefore endeavor to enter into that rest that no one may fall into the same example of unbelief twelve For the word of God is living and powerful and sharper than any two edged sword piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit of joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart thirteen And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do fourteen Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession fifteen For we have not a high priest who can not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but who has in all points been tempted in like manner without sin sixteen Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need V FOR every high priest being taken from among men is appointed for men in things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins two being able to bear with the ignorant and erring since he himself also is encompassed with infirmity three and on account of it he ought as for the people so also for himself to make offering for sins four And no one takes to himself the honor but being called by God as was also Aaron five So also Christ did not glorify himself to be made high priest but he who spoke to him Thou art my Son I this day have begotten thee six as also in another place he says Thou art a priest forever After the order of Melchizedek seven who in the days of his flesh offering up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death and being heard on account of his godly fear eight though a Son yet learned from what he suffered the required obedience nine and being perfected became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him ten called by God High Priest five ten after the order of Melchizedek eleven Of whom we have much to say and hard to be explained since ye have become dull of hearing twelve For though ye ought on account of the time to be teachers ye again have need that some one teach you the first principles of the oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of solid food thirteen For every one who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness for he is a child fourteen But solid food belongs to those who are of full age who by use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil VI WHEREFORE leaving the first principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God two of the doctrine of immersions and of the laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment three And this we will do six three if God permit four For it is impossible that they who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and been made partakers of the Holy Spirit five and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come six and have fallen away should again be renewed to repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to open shame seven For the earth which has drunk in the rain oft coming upon it and brings forth herbs fit for those for whose sake it is tilled receives blessing from God eight but if it bears thorns and briers it is rejected and is near to cursing whose end is to be burned nine But beloved we are persuaded of better things concerning you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak ten For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye showed toward his name in that ye ministered and still do minister to the saints eleven But we desire that each one of you show the same diligence for the full assurance of the hope unto the end twelve that ye may not become slothful but followers of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises thirteen For when God made the promise to Abraham because he could swear by none greater he swore by himself fourteen saying Surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee fifteen And so having patiently endured he obtained the promise sixteen For men indeed swear by the greater and the oath is to them an end of all gainsaying for a confirmation seventeen Wherein God wishing more abundantly to show to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel interposed with an oath eighteen that by two immutable things in which it is impossible that God should lie we may have strong encouragement who fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us nineteen which we have as an anchor of the soul sure and steadfast and entering within the vail twenty where as forerunner for us Jesus entered having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek VII FOR this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him two to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of all first indeed being interpreted King of righteousness and then also King of Salem which is King of peace three without father without mother without table of descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life seven three but likened to the Son of God remains a priest continually four Now consider how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch also gave a tenth of the spoils five And they indeed that are of the sons of Levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they have come out of the loins of Abraham six but he whose descent is not reckoned from them has taken tithes of Abraham and has blessed him who had the promises seven And without any contradiction the less is blessed by the better eight And here indeed men who die receive tithes but there one of whom it is testified that he lives nine And so to speak Levi also who receives tithes has paid tithes in Abraham ten for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him eleven If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood for under it the people have received the law what further need was there that a different priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek and not be called after the order of Aaron twelve For the priesthood being changed of necessity there comes also a change of law thirteen For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to a different tribe of which no one has given attendance at the altar fourteen For it is evident that our Lord has arisen out of Judah of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests fifteen And it is yet more abundantly manifest if after the similitude of Melchizedek there arises a different priest sixteen who has been made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an indissoluble life seventeen For it is testified of him Thou art a priest forever After the order of Melchizedek eighteen For on the one hand there is an annulling of the commandment that went before on account of its weakness and unprofitableness nineteen for the law perfected nothing and on the other the bringing in of a better hope by which we draw near to God twenty And inasmuch as it was not without an oath twenty one for they indeed were made priests without an oath but he with an oath by him who said to him The Lord swore and will not repent thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek seven twenty one twenty two by so much has Jesus become a surety of a better covenant twenty three And they indeed have been many priests because they were hindered by death from continuing twenty four but he because he remains forever has an unchangeable priesthood twenty five Whence also he is able to save to the utmost those who come to God through him since he ever lives to intercede for them twenty six For such a high priest became us holy harmless undefiled separated from sinners and made higher than the heavens twenty seven who has not necessity daily as the high priests to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins and then for those of the people for this he did once for all in offering up himself twenty eight For the law makes men high priests who have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law makes the Son who is perfected forever VIII NOW of the things which we are saying this is the chief We have such a high priest who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty of the heavens two a minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man three For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is necessary that this one have something which he may offer four For if he were on earth he would not be a priest since there are those who offer gifts according to the law five who minister after an outline and a shadow of the heavenly things as Moses was admonished by God when he was about to make the tabernacle for See says he that thou make all things according to the pattern which was showed thee in the mount six But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry by so much as he is also mediator of a better covenant which has been established upon better promises seven For if that first had been faultless a place would not have been sought for the second eight For finding fault with them he says eight eight Behold the days are coming saith the Lord When I will make with the house of Israel And with the house of Judah a new covenant nine Not according to the covenant that I made for their fathers In the day when I took hold of their hand To bring them out of the land of Egypt Because they continued not in my covenant And I regarded them not saith the Lord ten For this is the covenant that I will establish for the house of Israel After those days saith the Lord Putting my laws into their mind And on their hearts I will write them And I will be to them a God And they shall be to me a people eleven And they shall not teach Each one his neighbor and each one his brother Saying Know the Lord Because all shall know me from the least to the greatest twelve Because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness And their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more thirteen In that he says A new he has made the first old Now that which is grown old and worn out with age is ready to vanish away IX NOW the first had indeed also ordinances of service and the worldly sanctuary two For a tabernacle was prepared the first wherein is the lamp stand and the table and the show bread which is called holy three And after the second vail the tabernacle which is called most holy four having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on every side with gold wherein was the golden pot containing the manna and the rod of Aaron which budded and the tables of the covenant five and above it the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat of which we can not now speak particularly six Now these things being thus prepared into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times performing the services seven but into the second the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people eight the Holy Spirit signifying this that the way into the holy places has not yet been made manifest while the first tabernacle is yet standing nine which is a figure for the time present under which are offered both gifts and sacrifices unable as to the conscience to perfect the worshiper ten only with meats and drinks nine ten and divers immersions ordinances of the flesh imposed until the time of reformation eleven But Christ having come as a high priest of the good things to come through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is not of this creation twelve and not through the blood of goats and calves but through his own blood entered once for all into the holy places obtaining eternal redemption thirteen For if the blood of goats and bulls and ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctifies to the purity of the flesh fourteen how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God fifteen And for this cause he is mediator of a new covenant in order that death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant they who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance sixteen For where there is a testament nine sixteen there must also of necessity be brought in the death of the testator seventeen For a testament is of force after men are dead since it is of no strength at all while the testator lives eighteen Wherefore neither has the first been dedicated without blood nineteen For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of the calves and of the goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people saying twenty This is the blood of the covenant which God enjoined in respect to you twenty one And moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service he in like manner sprinkled with blood twenty two And nearly all things are cleansed according to the law with blood and without shedding of blood there is no remission twenty three It was therefore necessary that the outlines of things in the heavens should be cleansed with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these twenty four For Christ entered not into holy places made with hands figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us twenty five nor yet that he should many times offer himself as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with blood of others twenty six for then must he many times have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the ages he has been manifested for the putting away of sin by the sacrifice of himself nine twenty six twenty seven And inasmuch as it is appointed to men once to die but after this the judgment twenty eight so also the Christ having been once offered to bear the sins of many will to those who look for him appear a second time without sin unto salvation X FOR the law having a shadow of the good things to come not the very image of the things can never with the same sacrifices which they offer year by year continually make those who come to them ten one perfect two For then would they not have ceased to be offered because the worshipers would have had no more consciousness of sins having once been cleansed three But in them there is a remembrance of sins year by year four For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins five Wherefore when he comes into the world he says Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not But a body didst thou prepare for me six In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure seven Then said I Lo I come In the volume of the book it is written of me To do thy will O God eight Saying above Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou wouldest not nor hadst pleasure therein which are offered by the law nine then has he said Lo I come to do thy will O God He takes away the first that he may establish the second ten In which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all eleven And every priest ten eleven indeed stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins twelve but he having offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of God thirteen from henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his footstool fourteen For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified fifteen Moreover the Holy Spirit also is a witness to us for after he had said sixteen This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord putting my laws upon their hearts and on their minds I will write them he further says seventeen and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more eighteen But where there is remission of these there is no longer offering for sin nineteen Having therefore brethren boldness as to the entrance into the holy places by the blood of Jesus which entrance he instituted for us twenty a new and living way through the vail that is to say his flesh twenty one and having a great priest over the house of God twenty two Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having had our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having had our body washed with pure water twenty three let us hold fast the profession of the hope without wavering for he is faithful who promised twenty four and let us consider one another to incite to love and to good works twenty five not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as is the custom of some but exhorting and so much the more as ye see the day approaching twenty six For if we willingly sin after having received the knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins twenty seven but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and a fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries twenty eight He that despised Moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses twenty nine Of how much worse punishment suppose ye will he be thought worthy who has trodden under foot the Son of God and has accounted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and has done despite to the Spirit of grace thirty For we know him who said To me belongs vengeance I will recompense saith the Lord and again The Lord will judge his people thirty one It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God thirty two But call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were enlightened ye endured a great contest of sufferings thirty three partly whilst ye were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became partakers with those who were so used thirty four For ye sympathized with those in bonds and ye took joyfully the plundering of your goods knowing that ye have for yourselves a better and an enduring substance thirty five Cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward thirty six For ye have need of patience that having done the will of God ye may receive the promise thirty seven For yet a little while he that is to come will come and will not delay thirty eight Now the just shall live by faith but if he draw back my soul has no pleasure in him thirty nine But we are not of those who draw back unto perdition but of those who believe to the saving of the soul XI NOW faith is the assurance of things hoped for eleven one the conviction of things not seen two For in this the elders obtained a good report three Through faith we perceive that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that what is seen has not arisen eleven three out of things which appear four By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he received testimony that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and through it being dead he yet speaks five By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and he was not found because God translated him for before his translation he has had the testimony that he pleased God six But without faith it is impossible to please him for he who comes to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder to those who seek after him seven By faith Noah being warned by God concerning things not yet seen moved with fear prepared an ark for the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith eight By faith Abraham when called obeyed to go forth into a place which he should afterward receive for an inheritance and went forth not knowing whither he went nine By faith he sojourned in the land of promise as a foreign land dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob heirs with him of the same promise ten for he looked for the city which has the foundations whose builder and maker is God eleven By faith Sarah herself also received power to conceive seed even when she was past age because she accounted him faithful who had promised twelve Wherefore also there sprang from one and him become as dead even as the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable thirteen These all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them from afar and greeted them and professed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth fourteen For they that say such things declare plainly that they are seeking a country fifteen And if indeed they had in mind that from which they came out they would have had opportunity to return sixteen But now eleven sixteen they desire a better that is a heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he prepared for them a city seventeen By faith Abraham when tried has offered up Isaac and he who had accepted the promises offered up his only begotten eighteen of whom it was said In Isaac shall thy seed be called nineteen accounting that God is able even to raise from the dead whence he also received him back in a figure twenty By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come twenty one By faith Jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph and he worshiped leaning on the top of his staff twenty two By faith Joseph when dying made mention of the departure of the sons of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones twenty three By faith Moses when born was hidden three months by his parents because they saw that the child was fair and they feared not the king s commandment twenty four By faith Moses when grown up refused to be called son of a daughter of Pharaoh twenty five choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season twenty six esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he looked for the reward twenty seven By faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible twenty eight Through faith he has kept the passover and the affusion of the blood that he who destroyed the first born might not touch them twenty nine By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land which the Egyptians attempting were swallowed up thirty By faith the walls of Jericho fell after they had been encompassed during seven days thirty one By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who believed not eleven thirty one after having received the spies with peace thirty two And why say I more For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon of Barak and Samson and Jephthah of David and Samuel and the prophets thirty three who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions thirty four quenched the power of fire escaped the edge of the sword from weakness were made strong became mighty in war turned to flight the armies of the aliens thirty five Women received their dead by resurrection to life and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection thirty six And others had trial of mockings and scourgings and moreover of bonds and imprisonment thirty seven They were stoned they were sawn asunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they went about in sheep skins and goats skins being destitute afflicted tormented thirty eight of whom the world was not worthy wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and the clefts of the earth thirty nine And all these having obtained a good report through faith did not receive the promise forty God having provided something better concerning us that they should not without us be made perfect XII THEREFORE let us also having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us lay aside every weight and the easily besetting sin and with patience run the race that is set before us two looking away to the author and finisher of the faith Jesus who for the joy set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God three For consider him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against him that ye become not weary fainting in your souls four Not yet did ye resist unto blood contending against sin five and ye have forgotten the exhortation which discourses with you as with sons My son despise not the chastening of the Lord Nor faint when reproved by him six For whom the Lord loves he chastens And scourges every son whom he receives seven If ye endure chastening God deals with you as with sons for what son is there whom his father chastens not eight But if ye are without chastening of which all have been made partakers then are ye bastards and not sons nine Furthermore we had fathers of our flesh who chastened us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live ten For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed good to them but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness eleven Now all chastening for the present indeed seems not joyous but grievous but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby twelve Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees thirteen and make straight paths for your feet that the lame be not turned out of the way but rather be healed fourteen Follow peace with all and holiness without which no one shall see the Lord fifteen looking diligently lest any one come short of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and the many be thereby defiled sixteen lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one meal sold his birthright seventeen For ye know that he also afterward when he wished to inherit the blessing was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought after it with tears eighteen For ye have not come to a mount that is touched and burning with fire nor to blackness and darkness and tempest nineteen and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they who heard refused that more should be spoken to them twenty for they could not bear that which was commanded Even if a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned twenty one and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I fear and tremble twenty two But ye have come to mount Zion and to the city of the living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to myriads of angels twenty three to the general assembly and church of the first born who are enrolled in heaven and to God the Judge of all and to the spirits of just ones made perfect twenty four and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than Abel twenty five See that ye refuse not him who speaks for if they did not escape refusing him who declared the divine will on earth much more shall not we who turn away from him who speaks from heaven twenty six whose voice then shook the earth but now he has promised saying Yet once more I shake not the earth only but also heaven twenty seven And this Yet once more signifies the removing of the things shaken as of things that have been made that the things which are not shaken may remain twenty eight Wherefore receiving a kingdom which can not be shaken let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear twenty nine for our God is a consuming fire XIII LET brotherly love continue two Be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some entertained angels unawares three Remember those in bonds as bound with them those in adversity as being yourselves also in the body four Marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled thirteen four but fornicators and adulterers God will judge five Let your disposition be without covetousness and be content with what ye have for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee six So that we boldly say The Lord is my helper and I will not fear What shall man do to me seven Remember those who were your leaders who spoke to you the word of God considering the end of whose manner of life imitate their faith eight Jesus Christ is yesterday and to day the same and forever nine Be not carried away with various and strange teachings for it is good that the heart be established with grace not with meats which did not profit those who walked therein ten We have an altar whereof they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle eleven For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy places by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp twelve Wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people through his own blood suffered without the gate thirteen So then let us go forth to him without the camp bearing his reproach fourteen For here we have not an abiding city but are seeking for that which is to come fifteen Through him therefore let us offer up the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of lips giving thanks to his name sixteen But to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased seventeen Obey those who are your leaders and submit for they watch for your souls as those who shall give account that they may do this with joy and not with sighing for that is unprofitable for you eighteen Pray for us for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience in all things desiring to deport ourselves well nineteen But I the more earnestly beseech you to do this that I may the sooner be restored to you twenty Now the God of peace who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus the great Shepherd of the sheep in virtue of the blood of an eternal covenant twenty one make you perfect in every good work to do his will doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be the glory forever and ever Amen twenty two But I beseech you brethren bear with the word of exhortation for I wrote to you in few words twenty three Know that the brother Timothy has been set at liberty with whom if he come shortly I will see you twenty four Salute all that are your leaders and all the saints Those of Italy salute you twenty five Grace be with you all Amen THE GENERAL LETTER OF JAMES I JAMES a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad one one greeting two Count it all joy my brethren when ye fall into various temptations three knowing that the proving of your faith works patience four But let patience have a perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire lacking in nothing five But if any one of you is lacking in wisdom let him ask of God who gives to all liberally and upbraids not and it will be given him six But let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed seven For let not that man suppose that he shall receive anything from the Lord eight a double minded man unstable in all his ways nine Let the brother of low degree glory in that he is exalted ten but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he will pass away eleven For the sun rose with the burning heat and withered the grass and its flower fell off and the grace of its fashion perished so also will the rich man fade away in his ways twelve Happy is the man that endures temptation because when he is approved he will receive the crown of life which He promised to those who love him thirteen Let no one say when he is tempted I am tempted by God for God can not be tempted with evil and himself tempts no one fourteen But each one is tempted when by his own lust he is drawn away and enticed fifteen Then lust having conceived brings forth sin and sin when completed brings forth death sixteen Do not err my beloved brethren seventeen Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above coming down from the Father of the lights with whom there is no variableness or shadow of turning eighteen Of his own will he begot us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures nineteen So that my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath twenty for the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God twenty one Wherefore putting off all filthiness and excess of wickedness receive with meekness the implanted word which is able to save your souls twenty two But be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves twenty three For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like to a man beholding his natural face in a mirror twenty four For he beheld himself and has gone away and immediately he forgot what manner of man he was twenty five But he who looked into the perfect law the law of liberty and remained thereby being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of work this man shall be happy in his doing twenty six If any one thinks that he is religious and bridles not his tongue but deceives his own heart this man s religion is vain twenty seven Religion pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this To visit the orphans and widows in their affliction to keep himself unspotted from the world II MY brethren hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord of glory with respect of persons two For if there have come into your assembly a man with a gold ring in gay clothing and there have come in also a poor man in mean clothing three and ye have respect to him that wears the gay clothing and say Sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor man Stand thou there or Sit under my footstool four were ye not partial in yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts five Hearken my beloved brethren Did not God choose the poor as to this world two five to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to those who love him six But ye dishonored the poor man Do not the rich oppress you and do not they drag you before the judgment seats seven Do not they blaspheme the worthy name by which ye are called eight If indeed ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well nine But if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin being convicted by the law as transgressors ten For whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all eleven For he who said Do not commit adultery said also Do not kill Now if thou commit not adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a transgressor of the law twelve So speak and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty thirteen For the judgment shall be without mercy to him that showed no mercy Mercy glories over judgment fourteen What does it profit my brethren if any one say that he has faith and have not works Can the faith save him fifteen But if a brother or a sister be naked and destitute of daily food sixteen and one of you say to them Depart in peace be warmed and be filled but ye give them not the things needful for the body what does it profit seventeen So also faith if it has not works is dead in itself eighteen But some will say Thou hast faith and I have works show me thy faith without the works and I will show thee the faith by my works nineteen Thou believest that God is one Thou doest well the demons also believe and tremble twenty But wilt thou know O vain man that faith without works is dead twenty one Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son upon the altar twenty two Thou seest that faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made complete twenty three And the scripture was fulfilled which says Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him for righteousness and he was called Friend of God twenty four Ye see that by works a man is justified and not by faith only twenty five And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way twenty six For as the body without the spirit is dead so also faith without works is dead III MY brethren be not many teachers knowing that we shall receive greater condemnation two For in many things we all offend If any one offends not in word the same is a perfect man able to bridle also the whole body three Now if we put the bits into the horses mouths three three that they may obey us we turn about also their whole body four Behold also the ships though they are so great and driven by fierce winds are turned about by a very small helm whithersoever the steersman may desire five So also the tongue is a little member and boasts great things Behold how great a forest a little fire kindles six And the tongue is a fire that world of iniquity The tongue among our members is that which defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of life and is set on fire by hell seven For every nature of beasts and birds of reptiles and things in the sea is tamed and has been tamed by the nature of man eight But the tongue no man can tame a restless evil full of deadly poison nine Therewith we bless the Lord and Father and therewith we curse men who have been made after the likeness of God ten Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing My brethren these things ought not so to be eleven Does the fountain out of the same opening send forth the sweet and the bitter twelve Can a fig tree my brethren bear olives or a vine figs Neither can salt water yield fresh thirteen Who is wise and endued with knowledge among you Let him show out of his good deportment his works in meekness of wisdom fourteen But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts do not glory and lie against the truth fifteen This wisdom is not one that comes down from above but earthly sensual three sixteen devilish sixteen For where there is emulation and strife there is confusion and every evil work seventeen But the wisdom from above is first pure then peaceable forbearing easily persuaded full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy eighteen And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who work peace IV FROM whence are wars and from whence are fightings among you Are they not from hence from your lusts that war in your members two Ye desire and have not ye kill and envy and can not obtain ye fight and war Ye have not because ye ask not three ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts four Ye adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God Whoever therefore desires to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God five Do ye think that the Scripture says in vain the spirit he made to dwell in us has jealous longings six But he gives the more grace Wherefore he says God resists the proud But gives grace to the humble seven Submit yourselves therefore to God Resist the Devil and he will flee from you eight Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you Cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded nine Be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into heaviness ten Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he will exalt you eleven Do not speak against one another brethren He that speaks against his brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law But if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge twelve One is the lawgiver and judge he who is able to save and to destroy Who art thou that judgest thy neighbor thirteen Come now ye that say To day and to morrow we will go into this city and spend one year there and buy and sell and get gain fourteen whereas ye know not what belongs to the morrow for what is your life for ye are a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away fifteen instead of saying If the Lord will we shall both live and do this or that sixteen But now ye glory in your boastings All such glorying is evil seventeen Therefore to him that knows to do good and does it not to him it is sin V COME now ye rich weep wailing for your miseries that are coming upon you two Your riches are corrupted and your garments are become moth eaten three Your gold and silver is rusted and the rust of them will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh as fire Ye heaped up treasure in the last days four Behold the hire of the laborers who reaped your fields which is fraudulently kept back by you cries out and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth five four five Ye have been luxurious on the earth and lived in pleasure ye have nourished your hearts in the day of slaughter six Ye have condemned ye have killed the just he does not resist you seven Be patient therefore brethren until the coming of the Lord Behold the husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth being patient over it till it shall have received the early and latter rain eight Be ye also patient establish your hearts because the coming of the Lord draws nigh nine Murmur not against one another brethren that ye be not judged Behold the judge stands before the door ten Take my brethren the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord for an example of affliction and of patience eleven Behold we count those happy who endure Ye heard of the patience of Job and saw the end of the Lord five eleven that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy twelve But above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven nor by the earth nor by any other oath but let your yea be yea and your nay nay that ye fall not under condemnation thirteen Is any afflicted among you let him pray Is any cheerful let him sing praise fourteen Is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord fifteen And the prayer of faith will save the sick and the Lord will raise him up and even if he have committed sins it will be forgiven him sixteen Confess therefore your trespasses to one another and pray for one another that ye may be healed The earnest prayer of a righteous man avails much seventeen Elijah was a man of like nature with us and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months eighteen And again he prayed and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit nineteen Brethren if any one among you be led astray from the truth and one convert him twenty let him know that he who converts a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will hide a multitude of sins THE FIRST GENERAL LETTER OF PETER I PETER an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered one one through Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia two chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied to you three Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who according to his abundant mercy begot us again unto a living hope one three through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead four unto an inheritance imperishable and undefiled and unfading reserved in heaven for you five who by the power of God are kept through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time six Wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a little time if need be made sorrowful by manifold trials seven that the proof of your faith much more precious than gold that perishes but is proved by fire may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ eight whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory nine receiving the end of your faith the salvation of your souls ten Concerning which salvation the prophets diligently sought and searched who prophesied of the grace toward you eleven searching as to what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them signified when it testified beforehand the sufferings destined for Christ and the glories that should follow twelve to whom it was revealed that not to themselves but to you they were ministering them which now have been announced to you through those who brought you the good news by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven which things angels desire to look into thirteen Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind be sober and hope perfectly for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ fourteen as children of obedience not conforming yourselves to the former lusts in your ignorance fifteen but as he who called you is holy be ye yourselves holy in all your deportment sixteen because it is written Ye shall be holy for I am holy seventeen And if ye call him Father one seventeen who without respect of persons judges according to each one s work pass the time of your sojourning in fear eighteen knowing that not with perishable things silver and gold ye were redeemed from your vain course of life received by tradition from your fathers nineteen but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot twenty who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world but manifested in these last times for you twenty one who through him believe on God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are on God twenty two Having purified your souls in obeying the truth unto unfeigned brotherly love love one another from the heart fervently twenty three being born again not of perishable seed but of imperishable through the word of God which lives and abides forever twenty four Because All flesh is as grass And all its glory as the flower of grass The grass withered and its flower fell off twenty five But the word of the Lord abides forever And this is the word which was preached to you II LAYING aside therefore all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all backbitings two as newborn babes long for the spiritual unadulterated milk that ye thereby may grow unto salvation three if indeed ye tasted that the Lord is gracious four to whom coming a living stone disallowed indeed by men but with God chosen honored five ye yourselves also as living stones are built up two five a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ six Because it is contained in the Scripture Behold I lay in Zion a chief corner stone chosen honored and he that believes on him shall not be put to shame seven To you therefore who believe is the honor but to the disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is become the head of the corner eight and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense who stumble being disobedient to the word to which they were also appointed nine But ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for a possession that ye should show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light ten who once were not a people but are now the people of God who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy eleven Beloved I exhort you as sojourners and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul twelve having your deportment honorable among the Gentiles that wherein they speak against you as evil doers they may from your good works beholding them glorify God in the day of visitation thirteen Submit yourselves to every human institution for the Lord s sake whether to the king as pre eminent fourteen or to governors as being sent by him for the punishment of evil doers and the praise of those who do well fifteen For so is the will of God that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men sixteen as free and as not having your freedom for a vail of wickedness but as God s servants seventeen Honor all men love the brotherhood fear God honor the king eighteen ye servants being in subjection to your masters with all fear not only to the good and reasonable but also to the perverse nineteen For this is acceptable if a man for conscience toward God two nineteen endures griefs suffering wrongfully twenty For what glory is it if when ye are beaten for your faults ye shall take it patiently But if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with God twenty one For to this ye were called because Christ also suffered for you leaving you an example that ye should follow his steps twenty two who committed no sin neither was guile found in his mouth twenty three who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered threatened not but committed it to him who judges righteously twenty four who himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree that we having died to our sins should live to righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed twenty five For ye were going astray like sheep but have returned now unto the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls III IN like manner ye wives being in subjection to your own husbands that even if any obey not the word they may without the word be won by the deportment of their wives two when they behold your chaste deportment coupled with fear three Whose adorning let it not be the outward one of braiding the hair and of wearing golden ornaments or of putting on apparel four but the hidden man of the heart in that which is imperishable of the meek and quiet spirit which in the sight of God is of great price five For so in the old time the holy women also who hoped in God adorned themselves being in subjection to their own husbands six as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him lord of whom ye became children doing good and fearing no alarm seven Ye husbands in like manner dwelling with them according to knowledge giving honor to the female as the weaker vessel as also heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered eight Finally all being of one mind sympathizing loving the brethren tender hearted humble minded nine not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but on the contrary blessing because to this end ye were called that ye might inherit blessing ten For he who desires to love life and to see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking guile eleven let him turn away from evil and do good let him seek peace and pursue it twelve Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are toward their supplications but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil thirteen And who is he that shall harm you if ye are followers of that which is good fourteen But if ye even suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye but fear not with their fear nor be troubled fifteen but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts ready always to give an answer to every one that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear sixteen having a good conscience that wherein they speak against you as evil doers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good deportment in Christ seventeen For it is better if it be the will of God that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing eighteen Because Christ also suffered once for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit nineteen in which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison twenty who were disobedient in times past when the long suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was preparing wherein a few that is eight souls were saved through water twenty one which in an antitype immersion now saves us also not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the requirement of a good conscience toward God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ twenty two who is on the right hand of God having gone into heaven angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him IV CHRIST then having suffered for us in the flesh do ye also arm yourselves with the same mind because he who suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin two that ye no longer may live the remaining time in the flesh by the lusts of men but by the will of God three For the time past suffices us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles when we walked in wantonness lusts excess of wine revelings carousings and unhallowed idolatries four at which thing they are astonished as ye run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of you five who shall give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead six For to this end was the good news preached also to those who are dead that they might indeed be judged according to men in the flesh but may live according to God in the spirit seven But the end of all things is at hand Be therefore sober and watch unto prayer eight but above all things having your love toward one another fervent because love covers a multitude of sins nine hospitable to one another without grudging ten according as each received a gift ministering the same to one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God eleven if any one speaks as uttering God s oracles if any one ministers as of the ability which God bestows that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom is the glory and the dominion forever and ever Amen twelve Beloved be not astonished at the fiery test taking place among you to prove you as though a strange thing were befalling you thirteen but in so far as ye share in Christ s sufferings rejoice that also at the revelation of his glory ye may rejoice with exceeding joy fourteen If ye are reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified four fourteen fifteen For let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evil doer or as a busy body in other men s matters sixteen but if as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God in this name seventeen Because the time is come that judgment should begin from the house of God but if it begin first from us what shall be the end of those who obey not the gospel of God eighteen And if the righteous is with difficulty saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear nineteen Wherefore let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as to a faithful Creator V THE elders among you I exhort who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed two tend the flock of God which is among you overseeing it not by constraint but willingly not for base gain but with good will three neither as being lords over the heritage but being examples to the flock four And when the chief Shepherd is manifested ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory five In like manner ye younger submit yourselves to the elder Yea all of you submitting to one another gird yourselves with humility because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble six Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time seven casting all your care upon him because he cares for you eight Be sober be watchful Your adversary the Devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour nine whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same sufferings are being accomplished in your brethren that are in the world ten But the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus after ye have suffered a little while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you eleven To him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever Amen twelve By Silvanus the faithful brother as I consider I wrote to you in few words exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand thirteen The church that is in Babylon chosen with you salutes you five thirteen and Mark my son fourteen Salute one another with a kiss of love Peace to you all that are in Christ THE SECOND GENERAL LETTER OF PETER I SIMON PETER a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to those who have obtained like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ two Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord three Seeing that his divine power has given us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and might four through which he has given us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye may become partakers of the divine nature having escaped from the corruption that is in the world through lust five yea for this very reason giving all diligence add to your faith fortitude and to fortitude knowledge one five six and to knowledge self control and to self control patience and to patience godliness seven and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness love eight For if these things are in you and abound they cause that ye shall not be inactive nor unfruitful in attaining to the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ nine But he that lacks these things is blind not seeing afar off having forgotten the cleansing away of his old sins ten Wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall eleven For so shall be richly ministered to you the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ twelve Wherefore I will not neglect to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and are established in the truth that is with you thirteen But I think it right so long as I am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance fourteen knowing that I must soon put off my tabernacle one fourteen as also our Lord Jesus Christ showed me fifteen Moreover I will endeavor that at all times ye may be able after my departure to call these things to mind sixteen For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but had been eye witnesses of his majesty seventeen For he received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice was borne to him from the excellent glory This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased eighteen and this voice we heard borne from heaven being with him in the holy mount nineteen And we have more sure the prophetic word to which ye do well that ye take heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts twenty knowing this first that no prophecy of the Scripture comes of private interpretation twenty one for prophecy was never brought by the will of man but moved by the Holy Spirit men spoke from God II BUT there were false prophets also among the people as there will be false teachers among you also who stealthily will bring in destructive factions even denying as Master him who bought them bringing upon themselves swift destruction two And many will follow their dissolute ways by reason of whom the way of truth will be evil spoken of three And in covetousness will they with feigned words make merchandise of you for whom the judgment from of old lingers not and their destruction slumbers not four For if God spared not angels having sinned but casting them down to hell delivered them over to chains of darkness two four reserved unto judgment five and spared not the old world but kept Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing the flood on the world of ungodly men six and turning to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah condemned them to overthrow having made them an example of those who should afterward live ungodly seven and delivered righteous Lot wearied out with the lewd conduct of the lawless eight for that righteous man dwelling among them with seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds nine the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to reserve the unjust under punishment to the day of judgment ten but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise dominion Presumptuous self willed they are not afraid to rail at dignities eleven whereas angels being greater in strength and power bring not a railing judgment against them before the Lord twelve But these as natural brute beasts born to be taken two twelve and destroyed railing at things that they understand not shall utterly perish in their own corruption thirteen receiving the wages of unrighteousness as they who account reveling for a day pleasure spots and blemishes reveling in their own deceits while feasting with you fourteen having eyes full of the adulteress and that cease not from sin alluring unstable souls having a heart exercised in covetousness children of a curse fifteen forsaking the right way they went astray following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness sixteen but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with man s voice forbade the madness of the prophet seventeen These are wells without water mists driven by a tempest to whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever eighteen For speaking swelling words of vanity in lusts of the flesh they allure by wanton ways such as partly escape those who live in error nineteen promising them liberty while they themselves are servants of corruption for by what a man is overcome by the same he is also brought into bondage twenty For if having escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christy but having again become entangled therein they are overcome the last state is become worse with them than the first twenty one For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them twenty two But it has happened to them according to the true proverb A dog returned to his own vomit and A sow that was washed to the wallowing in the mire III THIS second letter beloved I now write to you in both which I stir up your pure mind by putting you in remembrance two that ye may be mindful of the words spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of the Lord and Savior by your apostles three knowing this first that there shall come in the last of the days scoffers in their scoffings walking after their own lusts four and saying Where is the promise of his coming for from the day the fathers fell asleep all things so continue from the beginning of the creation five For of this they willingly are ignorant that by the word of God there were heavens of old and earth framed out of water and by means of water six whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished seven but the heavens that now are and the earth by his word are kept in store being reserved for fire unto the day of judgment and of perdition of ungodly men eight But beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day nine The Lord is not tardy in respect to the promise as some account tardiness but is long suffering toward us three nine not wishing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance ten But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in which the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise and the elements will be dissolved with burning heat and the earth and the works therein will be burned up eleven Seeing then that all these things are dissolving what manner of men ought ye to be in all holy deportment and godliness twelve looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God because of which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved and the elements will melt with burning heat thirteen But according to his promise we look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness fourteen Wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for these things be diligent that ye may be found without spot and blameless in his sight in peace fifteen And the long suffering of our Lord account salvation as also our beloved brother Paul according to the wisdom given him wrote to you sixteen as also in all his letters speaking in them of these things in which things are some that are hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as also the other Scriptures unto their own destruction seventeen Ye therefore beloved seeing ye know beforehand beware lest being carried away with the error of the lawless ye fall from your own steadfastness eighteen But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ To him be the glory both now and forever Amen THE FIRST GENERAL LETTER OF JOHN I THAT which was from the beginning that which we have heard that which we have seen with our eyes that which we looked upon and our hands handled concerning the Word of life two and the life was manifested and we have seen and bear witness and report to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us three that which we have seen and have heard we report to you also that ye also may have fellowship with us and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ four And these things we write to you that your joy may be full five And this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you That God is light and in him there is no darkness six If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness we lie and do not the truth seven but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ one seven his Son cleanses us from all sin eight If we say that we have not sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us nine If we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous that he may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness ten If we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us II MY little children these things I write to you that ye may not sin And if any one have sinned we have an advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righteous two And he is a propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the whole world three And in this we know that we know him if we keep his commandments four He that says I know him and keeps not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him five But whoever keeps his word of a truth in him the love of God is perfected In this we know that we are in him six He that says he abides in him ought as he walked himself also so to walk seven Beloved I write not to you a new commandment but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning The old commandment is the word which ye heard from the beginning two seven eight Again a new commandment I write to you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is passing away and the true light now shines nine He that says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness until now ten He that loves his brother abides in the light and there is no occasion of stumbling in him eleven But he that hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and knows not where he goes because the darkness blinded his eyes twelve I write to you little children because your sins have been forgiven you for his name s sake thirteen I write to you fathers because ye know him that was from the beginning I write to you young men because ye have overcome the evil one I wrote to you little children because ye know the Father fourteen I wrote to you fathers because ye know him that was from the beginning I wrote to you young men because ye are strong and the word of God abides in you and ye have overcome the evil one fifteen Love not the world neither the things in the world If any one loves the world the love of the Father is not in him sixteen Because all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the empty pomp of life is not of the Father but is of the world seventeen And the world is passing away and the lust thereof but he that does the will of God abides forever eighteen Little children it is the last time and as ye heard that antichrist should come even now many antichrists have arisen from whence we know that it is the last time nineteen They went out from among us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would have remained with us but it was in order that they might be made manifest that all are not of us twenty And ye have an anointing from the Holy One and know all things twenty one I wrote not to you because ye do not know the truth but because ye know it and because no lie is of the truth twenty two Who is the liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ This is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son twenty three Every one that denies the Son the same has not the Father he that acknowledges the Son has also the Father twenty four What ye heard from the beginning let it abide in you If what ye heard from the beginning shall abide in you ye also will abide in the Son and in the Father twenty five And this is the promise which he himself promised to us the life eternal twenty six These things I wrote to you concerning those who seduce you twenty seven And the anointing which ye received from him abides in you and ye have no need that any one teach you but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things and is truth and is not a lie and even as it taught you abide in him twenty eight And now little children abide in him that if he should be manifested we may have confidence and not turn away from him with shame at his coming twenty nine If ye know that he is righteous ye know that every one that does righteousness has been begotten of him III BEHOLD what manner of love the Father has given to us that we should be called children of God For this cause the world knows not us because it knew not him two Beloved now are we the children of God and it was never yet manifested what we shall be We know that if it shall be manifested we shall be like him because we shall see him as he is three And every one that has this hope on him purifies himself even as he is pure four Every one that commits sin also commits transgression of law and sin is transgression of law five And ye know that he was manifested that he might take away our three five sins and in him is no sin six Every one that abides in him sins not whoever sins has not seen him neither has known him seven Little children let no one deceive you He that does righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous eight He that commits sin is of the Devil because the Devil sins from the beginning To this end the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the Devil nine Whoever has been begotten of God does not commit sin because his seed abides in him and he can not sin because he has been begotten of God ten In this are manifest the children of God and the children of the Devil Every one that does not righteousness is not of God neither he that loves not his brother eleven because this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another twelve Not as Cain was of the evil one and slew his brother And wherefore did he slay him Because his own works were evil and his brother s righteous thirteen Wonder not brethren if the world hates you fourteen We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brethren He that loves not his brother three fourteen abides in death fifteen Every one that hates his brother is a murderer three fifteen and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him sixteen In this we know love that he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren seventeen But whoever has the world s sustenance and sees his brother having need and shuts up his pity from him how abides the love of God in him eighteen Little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth nineteen And in this we shall know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him twenty Because if our heart accuse us God is greater than our heart and knows all things three twenty twenty one Beloved if our heart accuse us not we have confidence toward God twenty two And whatever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight twenty three And this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ and should love one another as he gave us commandment twenty four And he that keeps his commandments abides in him and he in him And in this we know that he abides in us from the Spirit which he gave us IV BELOVED believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets have gone forth into the world two In this ye know the Spirit of God three Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not of God and this is that of the antichrist of which ye have heard that it should come and now it is already in the world four Ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world five They are of the world for this cause they speak of the world and the world hears them six We are of God he that knows God hears us he that is not of God hears us not From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error seven Beloved let us love one another because love is of God and every one that loves has been begotten of God and knows God eight He that loves not knew not God because God is love nine In this was manifested the love of God in respect to us that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him ten Herein is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins eleven Beloved if God so loved us we also ought to love one another twelve No man has ever seen God If we love one another God abides in us and the love of him is perfected in us thirteen In this we know that we abide in him and he in us because he has given us of his Spirit fourteen And we have seen and bear witness that the Father has sent forth the Son a Savior of the world fifteen Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God God abides in him and he in God sixteen And we have known and have believed the love that God has in respect to us God is love and he that abides in love abides in God and God in him seventeen In this has love been perfected with us four seventeen that we have confidence in the day of judgment because as he is we also are in this world eighteen There is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear has torment four eighteen and he that fears is not made perfect in love nineteen We love because he first loved us twenty If any one say I love God and hates his brother he is a liar for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he has not seen twenty one And this commandment we have from him that he who loves God love also his brother V EVERY one who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God and every one that loves him who begot loves also him that has been begotten of him two In this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and do his commandments three For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments And his commandments are not burdensome four because all that is begotten of God overcomes the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world our faith five Who is he that overcomes the world but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God six This is he who came by water and blood Jesus the Christ not in the water only but in the water and in the blood And the Spirit is that which bears witness because the Spirit is the truth seven For there are three who bear witness the Spirit and the water and the blood eight and the three agree in the one five eight nine If we receive the witness of men the witness of God is greater for this is the witness of God that he has borne witness concerning his Son ten He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself he that believes not God has made him a liar because he has not believed in the witness which God has borne concerning his Son eleven And this is the witness that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in his Son twelve He that has the Son has the life he that has not the Son of God has not the life thirteen These things I wrote to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life who believe on the name of the Son of God fourteen And this is the confidence that we have toward him that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us fifteen And if we know that he hears us whatever we ask we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him sixteen If any one see his brother sin a sin not unto death he shall ask and he will give him life to those who sin not unto death There is a sin unto death for that I do not say that he shall pray seventeen All unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death eighteen We know that every one who has been begotten of God sins not but he that was begotten of God keeps himself and the evil one touches him not nineteen We know that we are of God and the whole world is lying in the evil one twenty And we know that the Son of God is come and has given us understanding that we may know the True one and we are in the True One in his Son Jesus Christ This is the true God and eternal life twenty one Little children keep yourselves from the idols THE SECOND LETTER OF JOHN THE elder to the elect lady and to her children whom I love in truth and not I alone but also all that know the truth two for the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever three Grace mercy peace shall be with you from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father in truth and love four I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking in truth as we received commandment from the Father five And now I beseech thee lady not as writing to thee a new commandment but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another six And this is love that we walk according to his commandment and this is the commandment as ye heard from the beginning that ye should walk in it seven Because many deceivers went out into the world who acknowledge not that Jesus Christ comes in the flesh This is the deceiver and the antichrist eight Look to yourselves that ye lose not the things which we wrought but receive a full reward nine Every one who transgresses and abides not one eight in the teaching of Christ has not God He that abides in the teaching he has both the Father and the Son ten If any one comes to you and brings not this teaching receive him not into your house and do not bid him good speed eleven for he that bids him good speed shares in his evil deeds twelve Having many things to write to you I would not write with paper and ink but I hope to come to you and to speak face to face that our joy may be full thirteen The children of thy elect sister salute thee THE THIRD LETTER OF JOHN THE elder to Gaius the beloved whom I love in truth two Beloved concerning all things I pray that thou mayest prosper and be in health as thy soul prospers three For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and bore witness to thy truth as thou walkest in the truth four I have no greater joy than this to hear of my children walking in the truth five Beloved thou doest a faithful thing in whatever thou doest to the brethren and that to strangers six who bore witness to thy love before the church whom if thou send forward on their journey worthily of God thou wilt do well seven for on behalf of the NAME they went forth taking nothing of the Gentiles eight We therefore ought to sustain such persons that we may become fellow workers for the truth nine I wrote somewhat to the church but Diotrephes who loves to have the pre eminence among them receives us not ten Therefore if I come I will bring to remembrance his deeds which he does prating against us with evil words And not content therewith neither does he himself receive the brethren and those who are willing he forbids and casts them out of the church eleven Beloved do not imitate what is evil but what is good He that does good is of God he that does evil has not seen God twelve To Demetrius testimony has been borne by all and by the truth itself yea we also bear witness and thou knowest that our witness is true thirteen I had many things to write to thee but I wish not to write to thee with ink and pen fourteen but I hope immediately to see thee and we shall speak face to face Peace be to thee The friends salute thee Salute the friends by name THE GENERAL LETTER OF JUDE JUDE a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James to the called beloved in God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ one one two Mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you three Beloved while giving all diligence to write to you concerning the common salvation I found it needful for me to write to you exhorting to contend earnestly for the faith delivered once for all to the saints four For there crept in stealthily certain men who of old were appointed beforehand to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into wantonness and denying the only Master and our Lord Jesus Christ five But I wish to remind you as once knowing all that Jesus having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed those who believed not six And angels who kept not their principality but left their own habitation he has kept in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day seven As Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner with them giving themselves over to fornication and going away after other flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire eight Yet in like manner these also in their dreamings defile the flesh despise dominion and rail at dignities nine But Michael the archangel when contending with the Devil he disputed concerning the body of Moses dared not bring against him a railing judgment but said The Lord rebuke thee ten But these rail at the things which they know not but what things naturally as the brute beasts they understand in these they corrupt themselves eleven Woe to them For they went in the way of Cain and rushed on in the error of Balaam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of Korah twelve These are rocks in your feasts of love feasting with you fearlessly feeding their own selves clouds without water carried away by winds autumnal trees without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots thirteen raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever fourteen Yea and of these Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied saying Behold the Lord came with his holy myriads fifteen to execute judgment upon all and to convict all the ungodly among them of all their acts of ungodliness which they committed and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners spoke against him sixteen These are murmurers complaining of their lot walking according to their lusts and their mouth speaks swelling words having respect to persons for the sake of profit seventeen But ye beloved remember the words which were before spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ eighteen that they told you that at the last of the time there will be scoffers walking after their own lusts of ungodliness nineteen These are they who separate sensual having not the Spirit twenty But ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the Holy Spirit twenty one keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life twenty two And some refute when they are contending but others save snatching them out of the fire twenty three and others compassionate with fear hating even the garment spotted by the flesh twenty four Now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy twenty five to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord be glory majesty dominion and power before all time and now and forever Amen THE REVELATION I THE Revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him to show to his servants what things must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John two who testified of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ of whatever things he saw three Happy he that reads and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep the things written therein for the time is at hand four John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come and from the seven spirits that are before his throne five and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness the first born of the dead and the Ruler of the kings of the earth To him who loves us and washed us from our sins in his own blood six and made us a kingdom priests to God and his Father to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever Amen seven Behold he comes amidst the clouds and every eye shall see him and they who pierced him and all the tribes of the earth shall wail because of him Even so Amen eight I am the Alpha and the Omega saith the Lord God he who is and who was and who is to come the Almighty nine I John your brother and partner with you in the affliction and kingdom and patient endurance in Jesus was in the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus ten I was in the Spirit on the Lord s day and I heard behind me a loud voice as of a trumpet eleven saying What thou seest write in a book and send to the seven churches to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamus and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea twelve And I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me And having turned I saw seven golden lamp stands thirteen and in the midst of the lamp stands one like to the Son of Man clothed with a garment falling down to the feet and girded round at the breasts with a golden girdle fourteen But his head and his hairs were white as white wool as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire fifteen and his feet were like to burnished brass as if burning in a furnace one fifteen and his voice was as the sound of many waters sixteen And he had in his hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shining in his strength seventeen And when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead And he laid his right hand on me saying Fear not I am the first and the last eighteen and the living one and I became dead and behold I am alive forevermore and I have the keys of death and of the underworld nineteen Write therefore the things which thou sawest and the things which are and the things which shall be after these twenty the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest on my right hand and the seven golden lamp stands The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lamp stands are the seven churches II TO the angel of the church in Ephesus write These things says he who holds the seven stars in his right hand who walks in the midst of the seven golden lamp stands two I know thy works and thy labor and patience and how thou canst not bear evil men and thou didst try those who say they are apostles and are not and didst find them liars three and thou hast patience and didst bear for my name s sake and hast not been weary four But I have this against thee that thou hast left thy first love five Remember therefore from whence thou hast fallen and repent and do the first works but if not I am coming to thee and will remove thy lamp stand out of its place if thou repent not six But this thou hast that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans which I also hate seven He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches To him that overcomes to him I will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God eight And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write These things says the first and the last who became dead and lived again nine I know thy affliction and poverty but thou art rich and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan ten Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer Behold the Devil is about to cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye will have affliction ten days Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee the crown of life eleven He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches He that overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death twelve And to the angel of the church in Pergamus write These things says he who has the sharp two edged sword thirteen I know where thou dwellest where the throne of Satan is and thou holdest fast my name and didst not deny the faith in me even in the days in which Antipas was my faithful witness who was slain among you where Satan dwells fourteen But I have a few things against thee Thou hast there men holding the teaching of Balaam who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the sons of Israel to eat things offered to idols and to commit fornication fifteen Thus thou also hast men holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner sixteen Repent therefore but if not I come to thee quickly and will make war with them with the sword of my mouth seventeen He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches To him that overcomes to him I will give of the hidden manna and I will give to him a white stone and on the stone a new name written which no one knows but he that receives it eighteen And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write These things says the Son of God who has his eyes as a flame of fire and his feet are like to burnished brass nineteen I know thy works and thy love and faith and service and patience and thy last works are more than the first twenty But I have against thee that thou sufferest the woman Jezebel two twenty who calls herself a prophetess and she teaches and seduces my servants to commit fornication and to eat things offered to idols twenty one And I gave her time that she might repent and she will not repent of her fornication twenty two Behold I cast her into a bed and those who together with her commit adultery into great affliction if they repent not of their works two twenty two twenty three And her children I will slay with death and all the churches shall know that I am he who searches the reins and hearts and I will give to you every one according to your works twenty four But to you I say the rest who are in Thyatira as many as have not this teaching who knew not the depths of Satan as they speak I put upon you no other burden twenty five but that which ye have hold fast till I come twenty six And he that overcomes and he that keeps my works until the end to him I will give authority over the nations twenty seven and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter are they dashed in pieces as I also have received from my Father twenty eight and I will give him the morning star twenty nine He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches III AND to the angel of the church in Sardis write These things says he who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars I know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead two Be watchful and strengthen the remaining things that were ready to die for I have not found thy works complete before my God three Remember therefore how thou hast received and didst hear and keep and repent If therefore thou shalt not watch I will come as a thief and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee four But thou hast a few names in Sardis which did not defile their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy five He that overcomes the same shall be clothed three five in white garments and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life and I will acknowledge his name before my Father and before his angels six He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches seven And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write These things says the Holy the True he who has the key of David he who opens and no one shall shut and shuts and no one opens eight I know thy works Behold I have set before thee a door opened which no one can shut because thou hast little power and didst keep my word and didst not deny my name nine Behold I make those of the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews and they are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and bow down before thy feet and to know that I loved thee ten Because thou didst keep my word of patient endurance I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which is about to come upon the whole world to try those who dwell upon the earth eleven I come quickly hold fast that which thou hast that no one may take thy crown twelve He that overcomes I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go out no more and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God the new Jerusalem which comes down out of heaven from my God and my new name thirteen He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches fourteen And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write These things says the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God fifteen I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot sixteen So because thou art lukewarm and neither hot nor cold I am about to vomit thee out of my mouth seventeen Because thou sayest I am rich and have gotten wealth and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art the wretched and the pitiable one and poor and blind and naked eighteen I counsel thee to buy of me gold refined by fire that thou mayest be rich and white garments that thou mayest be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness not be made manifest and to anoint thine eyes with eye salve that thou mayest see nineteen As many as I love I rebuke and chasten Be zealous therefore and repent twenty Behold I stand at the door and knock if any one hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and I will sup with him and he with me twenty one He that overcomes I will give to him to sit with me in my throne as I also overcame and sat down with my Father in his throne twenty two He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches IV AFTER these things I saw and behold a door set open in heaven and that first voice which I heard as of a trumpet speaking with me saying Come up hither and I will show thee what things must take place after these two Immediately I was in the Spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne three And he who sat was like in appearance to a jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow round the throne like in appearance to an emerald four and around the throne were twenty four thrones and upon the thrones twenty four elders sitting clothed in white garments and on their heads crowns of gold five And out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God six and before the throne as it were a sea of glass like to crystal and in the midst of the throne and around the throne four animals full of eyes before and behind seven And the first animal was like to a lion and the second animal like to a calf and the third animal having its face as of a man and the fourth animal like to an eagle flying eight And the four animals had each of them six wings apiece around and within they are full of eyes and they have no rest by day and by night saying Holy holy holy Lord God the Almighty who was and who is and who is to come nine And when the animals shall give glory and honor and thanksgiving to him who sits upon the throne to him who lives forever and ever ten the twenty four elders will fall down before him who sits upon the throne and will worship him who lives forever and ever and will cast their crowns before the throne saying eleven Worthy art thou our Lord and our God to receive the glory and the honor and the power because thou didst create all things and because of thy will they were and were created V AND I saw on the right hand of him who sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed up with seven seals two And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice Who is worthy to open the book and to loose its seals three And no one was able in heaven nor on the earth nor under the earth to open the book nor to look thereon four And I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the book nor to look thereon five And one of the elders says to me Weep not behold the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah the Root of David prevailed to open the book and its seven seals six And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four animals and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as if having been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth seven And he came and has taken the book out of the right hand of him who sits upon the throne eight And when he took the book the four animals and the twenty four elders fell down before the Lamb having each one a harp and golden cups full of odors which are the prayers of saints nine And they sing a new song saying Thou art worthy to take the book and to open its seals because thou wast slain and didst redeem to God by thy blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation ten and didst make them unto our God five ten a kingdom and priests and they will reign on the earth eleven And I saw and I heard a voice of many angels around the throne and the animals and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands twelve saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that has been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing thirteen And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all that are in them I heard saying To him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the dominion forever and ever fourteen And the four animals said Amen And the elders fell down and worshiped VI AND I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals and I heard one of the four animals saying as a voice of thunder Come two And I saw and behold a white horse and he who sat on him having a bow and a crown was given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer three And when he opened the second seal I heard the second animal saying Come four And there went forth another horse that was red And to him who sat thereon it was given to take away peace from the earth and that they should slay one another and there was given to him a great sword five And when he opened the third seal I heard the third animal saying Come And I saw and behold a black horse and he who sat on him having a balance in his hand six And I heard a voice in the midst of the four animals saying A quart of wheat six six for a denary and three quarts of barley for a denary and Hurt not the oil and the wine seven And when he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth animal saying Come eight And I saw and behold a pale horse and he who sat on him his name was Death and the underworld followed with him And authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with famine and with death and by the beasts of the earth nine And when he opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of those slain on account of the word of God and on account of the testimony which they had ten And they cried with a loud voice saying How long O Master the holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell upon the earth eleven And a white robe was given to each one of them and it was said to them that they should rest yet a little time until also their fellow servants and their brethren who are about to be killed as they were should be fully numbered twelve And I saw when he opened the sixth seal and there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became all as blood thirteen and the stars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree casts its untimely figs when shaken by a great wind fourteen and the heaven parted asunder as a scroll rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places fifteen And the kings of the earth and the great men and the chief captains and the rich men and the strong men and every bondman and freeman hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains sixteen and they say to the mountains and to the rocks Fall upon us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb seventeen because the great day of his wrath is come and who is able to stand VII AND after this I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that no wind should blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree two And I saw another angel coming up from the rising of the sun having the seal of the living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea three saying Hurt not the earth nor the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God upon their foreheads four And I heard the number of the sealed A hundred and forty four thousand were sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel five out of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand out of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand out of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand six out of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand out of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand out of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand seven out of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand out of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand out of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand eight out of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand out of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand out of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed nine After these things I saw and behold a great multitude which no one could number out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues standing before the throne and before the Lamb clothed in white robes and palms in their hands ten And they cry with a loud voice saying Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb eleven And all the angels were standing round the throne and the elders and the four animals and fell before the throne on their faces and worshiped God twelve saying Amen the blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the might be to our God forever and ever Amen thirteen And one of the elders answered saying to me These who are clothed in the white robes who are they and whence came they fourteen And I said to him Sir thou knowest And he said to me These are they who come out of the great affliction and they washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb fifteen Therefore are they before the throne of God and they serve him day and night in his temple and he who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle over them seven fifteen sixteen They shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun fall upon them nor any heat seventeen because the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd and will lead them to the fountains of the waters of life and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes VIII AND when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about half an hour two And I saw the seven angels who stand before God and there were given to them seven trumpets three And another angel came and stood over the altar having a golden censer and there was given to him much incense that he should give it to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne four And there went up the smoke of the incense to the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the angel before God five And the angel has taken the censer and he filled it out of the fire of the altar and cast it into the earth And there followed thunders and lightnings and voices and an earthquake six And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they might sound seven The first sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast into the earth and the third part of the earth was burnt up and the third part of the trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up eight And the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood nine and the third part of the creatures that are in the sea that have life died and the third part of the ships were destroyed ten And the third angel sounded and there fell out of heaven a great star burning as a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of the waters eleven And the name of the star is called Wormwood And the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter twelve And the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars that the third part of them might be darkened and the day not shine for a third part of it and the night in like manner thirteen And I saw and heard an eagle flying in mid heaven saying with a loud voice Woe woe woe to those who dwell upon the earth by reason of the remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound IX AND the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fallen out of heaven to the earth and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss two And he opened the pit of the abyss and there went up a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit three And out of the smoke went forth locusts into the earth and there was given to them power as the scorpions of the earth have power four And it was said to them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree but only the men who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads five And it was given to them that they should not kill them but that they shall be tormented five months And their torment is as the torment of a scorpion when it has smitten a man six And in those days men will seek death and shall not find it and they will desire to die and death flees from them seven And the shapes of the locusts were like to horses prepared for battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men eight And they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions nine And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle ten And they have tails like to scorpions and stings and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months eleven They have over them a king the angel of the abyss His name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon but in the Greek tongue he has for a name Apollyon twelve The first woe is past behold there come yet two woes after these things thirteen And the sixth angel sounded and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is before God fourteen saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet Loose the four angels who are bound by the great river Euphrates fifteen And the four angels were loosed who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year that they may slay the third part of men sixteen And the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred thousand thousand I heard the number of them seventeen And thus I saw the horses in the vision and those who sat on them having breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and like brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issue fire and smoke and brimstone eighteen By these three plagues was the third part of men killed by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which issued out of their mouths nineteen For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails are like to serpents having heads and with them they do hurt twenty And the rest of men who were not killed in these plagues repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship demons and idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood which can neither see nor hear nor walk twenty one and they repented not of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts X AND I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as the sun and his feet as pillars of fire two And he had in his hand a little book opened And he set his right foot upon the sea and the left upon the land three and he cried with a loud voice as a lion roars and when he cried the seven thunders uttered their voices four And when the seven thunders spoke I was about to write and I heard a voice out of heaven saying to me Seal up the things which the seven thunders spoke and write them not five And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land lifted up his right hand to heaven six and swore by him who lives forever and ever who created heaven and the things therein and the earth and the things therein and the sea and the things therein that there shall be time ten six no longer seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to sound then is the mystery of God finished as he gave the joyful message to his servants the prophets eight And the voice which I heard out of heaven I heard again speaking to me and saying Go take the little book which lies opened in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the land nine And I went to the angel telling him to give me the little book And he said to me Take and eat it up and it will make thy belly bitter but in thy mouth it will be sweet as honey ten And I took the little book out of the hand of the angel and ate it up and it was in my mouth as honey sweet and when I had eaten it my belly became bitter eleven And they say to me Thou must again prophesy of many peoples and nations and tongues and kings XI AND there was given me a reed like to a staff saying Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship therein two And the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not because it was given to the Gentiles and they will tread down the holy city forty two months three And I will give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth four These are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands which stand before the Lord of the earth five And if any one desires to hurt them fire goes forth out of their mouth and devours their enemies and if any one desires to hurt them he must in this manner be killed six These have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over the waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they will seven And when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them and will overcome them and will kill them eight And their remains are on the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where their Lord also was crucified nine And some out of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations look on their remains three days and a half and suffer not their dead bodies to be put into a tomb ten And they who dwell on the earth rejoice ever them and are glad and they will send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth eleven And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon those who beheld them twelve And they heard a loud voice out of heaven saying to them Come up hither And they went up into heaven in the cloud and their enemies beheld them thirteen And in that hour there was a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand names and the rest became afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven fourteen The second woe is past behold the third woe comes quickly fifteen And the seventh angel sounded and there followed loud voices in heaven saying The kingdom of the world is become our Lord s and his Christ s and he will reign forever and ever sixteen And the twenty four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell upon their faces and worshiped God seventeen saying We give thanks to thee O Lord God the Almighty who art and who wast because thou hast taken thy great power and didst reign eighteen And the nations were enraged and thy wrath came and the time of the dead to be judged and to give the reward to thy servants the prophets and to the saints and to those who fear thy name the small and the great and to destroy those who destroy the earth nineteen And the temple of God was opened in heaven and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple and there were lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hail XII AND a great sign was seen in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars two And being with child she cries out travailing in birth and pained to be delivered three And another sign was seen in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven crowns four And his tail drags the third part of the stars of heaven and it cast them to the earth And the dragon stands before the woman who was about to bring forth that when she has brought forth he may devour her child five And she brought forth a man child who will rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up to God and to his throne six And the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared by God that they may nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days seven And there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fighting with the dragon And the dragon fought and his angels eight and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven nine And the great dragon was cast down the old serpent called the Devil and Satan who leads astray the whole world he was cast down to the earth and his angels were cast down with him ten And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying Now is come the salvation and the strength and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ because the accuser of our brethren is cast down who accused them before our God day and night eleven And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony and they loved not their life unto the death twelve For this cause rejoice ye heavens and they who dwell in them Woe to the earth and the sea For the Devil is come down to you having great wrath knowing that he has little time thirteen And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man child fourteen And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent fifteen And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood sixteen And the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth seventeen And the dragon was enraged at the woman and he departed to make war with the rest of her seed who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus XIII AND I stood thirteen onea upon the sand of the sea And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea having ten horns and seven heads and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads names of blasphemy one sixteenb two and the beast which I saw was like to a leopard and his feet as of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave to him his power and his throne and great authority three and one of his heads as it were wounded unto death And his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast four And they worshiped the dragon because he gave the authority to the beast and they worshiped the beast saying Who is like to the beast and who is able to make war with him five And there was given to him a mouth speaking great and blasphemous things and power was given him to work forty two months six And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle those who tabernacle in heaven seven And it was given him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over every tribe and tongue and nation eight And all who dwell upon the earth will worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb which is slain from the foundation of the world nine If any one has an ear let him hear ten If any one is for captivity he goes into captivity if any to be killed with the sword he must be killed with the sword Here is the patience and the faith of the saints eleven And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon twelve And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence and causes the earth and those who dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed thirteen And he does great signs so that also he causes fire to come down out of heaven on the earth in the sight of men fourteen and he leads astray those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to do in the presence of the beast saying to those who dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which has the wound of the sword and lived fifteen And it was given him to give breath thirteen fifteen to the image of the beast that the image of the beast should also speak and should cause that as many as worship not the image of the beast should be killed sixteen And he causes all the small and the great and the rich and the poor and the free and the bond to receive a mark thirteen sixteen on their right hand or on their forehead seventeen and that no one should be able to buy or sell save he that has the mark the name of the beast or the number of his name eighteen Here is wisdom Let him that has understanding count up the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is Six hundred and sixty six XIV AND I saw and behold the Lamb stood on the mount Zion and with him a hundred and forty four thousand having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads two And I heard a voice out of heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of loud thunder the voice which I heard was as that of harpers harping with their harps three And they sing as it were a new song before the throne and before the four animals and the elders and no one was able to learn the song except the hundred and forty four thousand who are redeemed from the earth four These are they who were not defiled with women for they are virgins These are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes These were redeemed from men a first fruits to God and to the Lamb five And in their mouth was found no falsehood for they are blameless six And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven having the everlasting gospel fourteen six to preach to those who dwell on the earth and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people seven saying with a loud voice Fear God and give glory to him because the hour of his judgment is come and worship him who made heaven and earth and sea and fountains of waters eight And another a second angel followed saying Babylon the great is fallen is fallen because she has made all the nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication nine And another a third angel followed them saying with a loud voice If any one worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand ten he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his wrath and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb eleven And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever and they have no rest day and night who worship the beast and his image and whoever receives the mark of his name twelve Here is the patience of the saints who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus thirteen And I heard a voice out of heaven saying Write Happy are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth yea says the Spirit that they shall rest from their labors for their works follow with them fourteen And I saw and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sitting like to the Son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle fifteen And another angel came forth out of the temple crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud Put forth thy sickle and reap because the time to reap is come because the harvest of the earth is ripe sixteen And he who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle upon the earth and the earth was reaped seventeen And another angel came forth out of the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickle eighteen And another angel came out from the altar who had power over fire and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle saying Put forth thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe nineteen And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great wine press of the wrath of God twenty And the wine press was trodden without the city and blood came forth out of the wine press even to the bits of the horses as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs XV AND I saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having seven plagues which are the last because in them is completed the wrath of God two And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and those who had gained the victory over the beast and over his image and over the number of his name standing by the sea of glass having harps of God three And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb saying Great and marvelous are thy works Lord God the Almighty just and true are thy ways thou King of the nations four Who shall not fear O Lord and glorify thy name Because thou alone art holy because all the nations shall come and worship before thee because thy judgments are made manifest five And after these things I saw and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened six and there came forth the seven angels having the seven plagues clothed in pure shining linen and girded about the breasts with golden girdles seven And one of the four animals gave to the seven angels seven golden cups full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever eight And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power and no one was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be completed XVI AND I heard a loud voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels Go and pour out the seven cups of the wrath of God into the earth two And the first departed and poured out his cup into the earth sixteen two and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men who have the mark of the beast and who worship his image three And the second poured out his cup into the sea and it became blood as of a dead man and every living thing died that was in the sea four And the third poured out his cup into the rivers and the fountains of water and they became blood five And I heard the angel of the waters saying Righteous art thou who art and who wast holy because thou didst thus judge six because they shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink They are worthy seven And I heard out of the altar one saying sixteen seven Even so Lord God the Almighty true and righteous are thy judgments eight And the fourth poured out his cup upon the sun and it was given to it to scorch men with fire nine And men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues and repented not to give him glory ten And the fifth poured out his cup upon the throne of the beast and his kingdom became darkened and they gnawed their tongues for pain eleven and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores and repented not of their works twelve And the sixth poured out his cup upon the great river the Euphrates and its water was dried up that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun might be prepared thirteen And I saw come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits as frogs fourteen for they are spirits of demons working signs which go forth over the kings of the whole habitable world to gather them to the battle of that great day of God the Almighty fifteen Behold I come as a thief Happy is he that watches and keeps his garments that he may not walk naked and they see his shame sixteen And they gathered them into the place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon seventeen And the seventh poured out his cup upon the air and there came forth a loud voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying It is done eighteen And there were lightnings and voices and thunders and there was a great earthquake such as was not since there was a man upon the earth so mighty an earthquake so great nineteen And the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and Babylon the great was remembered before God to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath twenty And every island fled away and mountains were not found twenty one And great hail as of a talent s weight comes down out of heaven upon men and men blasphemed God on account of the plague of the hail because the plague thereof was exceeding great XVII AND there came one of the seven angels who have the seven cups and talked with me saying Come hither I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sits upon many waters two with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication three And he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast full of the names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns four And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the impurities of her fornication five And upon her forehead was a name written MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH six And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus and I wondered when I saw her with great wonder seven And the angel said to me Wherefore didst thou wonder I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her which has the seven heads and the ten horns eight The beast that thou sawest was and is not and is to come up out of the abyss and to go into perdition and they will wonder who dwell on the earth whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world seeing the beast that he was and is not and shall come nine Here is the mind that has wisdom The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits ten And they are seven kings the five are fallen and the one is the other is not yet come and when he comes he must remain a little time eleven And the beast that was and is not he also is an eighth and is of the seven and goes into perdition twelve And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings who received no kingdom as yet but receive authority as kings one hour along with the beast thirteen These have one mind and give their power and authority to the beast fourteen These will make war with the Lamb and the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings and they who are with him are called and chosen and faithful fifteen And he says to me The waters which thou sawest where the harlot sits are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues sixteen And the ten horns and the beast these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire seventeen For God put it into their hearts to do his will and to form one purpose and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God shall be fulfilled eighteen And the woman which thou sawest is the great city which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth XVIII AFTER these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven having great authority and the earth was lightened with his glory two And he cried with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is fallen is fallen and is become a habitation of demons and a hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird three Because all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth became rich out of the abundance of her luxury four And I heard another voice out of heaven saying Come out of her my people that ye partake not in her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues five For her sins reached unto heaven and God remembered her iniquities six Reward her as she also rewarded and render twofold according to her works in the cup which she mixed mix for her twofold seven By as much as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously so much torment and mourning give her because in her heart she says I sit a queen and not a widow and shall not see mourning eight Therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be burned up with fire because strong is the Lord God who judged her nine And the kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her shall weep and shall lament for her when they see the smoke of her burning ten standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying Alas alas the great city Babylon the mighty city Because in one hour thy judgment is come eleven And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her because no one buys their lading any more twelve the lading of gold and of silver and of precious stones and of pearls and of fine linen and of purple and of silk and of scarlet and all citron wood and every vessel of ivory and every vessel of most precious wood and of brass and of iron and of marble thirteen and cinnamon and amomum and odors and ointment and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep and lading of horses and of chariots and of slaves and souls of men fourteen And the fruit that thy soul desired departed from thee and all the dainty and goodly things perished from thee and thou shalt no more find them fifteen The merchants of these things who became rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and mourning sixteen saying Alas alas the great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls seventeen because in one hour so great riches are made desolate And every pilot and every one that sails to any place and seamen and as many as do business at sea stood afar off eighteen and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning saying Who is like to the great city nineteen And they cast dust upon their heads and cried out weeping and mourning saying Alas alas the great city whereby all that have the ships in the sea became rich by reason of her costliness because in one hour she is made desolate twenty Rejoice over her thou heaven and ye saints ye apostles and ye prophets because God judged your cause upon her twenty one And a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea saying Thus with violence shall Babylon the great city be cast down and shall be found no more twenty two And the voice of harpers and of musicians and of pipers and of trumpeters shall be heard in thee no more and no craftsman of whatever craft shall be found any more in thee and the sound of a millstone shall be heard in thee no more twenty three and the light of a lamp shall shine in thee no more and the voice of bridegroom and of bride shall be heard in thee no more because thy merchants were the great men of the earth because by thy sorcery all the nations were led astray twenty four And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that have been slain upon the earth XIX AFTER these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven of those saying Alleluia the salvation and the glory and the power are our God s two because true and righteous are his judgments because he judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication and avenged the blood of his servants at her hand three And a second time they said Alleluia And her smoke goes up forever and ever four And the twenty four elders and the four animals fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne saying Amen Alleluia five And a voice came out from the throne saying Praise our God all ye his servants and ye who fear him the small and the great six And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunders saying Alleluia because the Lord God the Almighty reigns seven Let us rejoice and exult and we will give to him the glory because the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife made herself ready eight And it was given her that she should be clothed in fine linen pure and shining for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints nine And he says to me Write Happy are they who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb And he says to me These are the true sayings of God ten And I fell before his feet to worship him And he said to me See thou do it not I am a fellow servant of thee and of thy brethren who have the testimony of Jesus worship God For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy eleven And I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he who sat upon him called Faithful and True and in righteousness he judges and makes war twelve His eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written which no one knows but he himself thirteen And he was clothed with a garment dipped in blood and his name is called The Word of God fourteen And the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white pure fifteen And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he may smite the nations and he will rule them with a rod of iron and he treads the wine press of the fierceness of the wrath of God the Almighty sixteen And he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS seventeen And I saw an angel standing in the sun And he cried with a loud voice saying to all the birds that fly in mid heaven Come and gather yourselves together to the great supper of God eighteen that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains of thousands and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all both free and bond both small and great nineteen And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with him who sat on the horse and with his army twenty And the beast was seized and with him the false prophet that wrought the signs in his presence with which he led astray those who received the mark of the beast and who warship his image The two were cast alive into the lake of fire that burns with brimstone twenty one And the rest were slain with the sword of him who sat upon the horse which went forth out of his mouth and all the birds were filled with their flesh XX AND I saw an angel coming down out of heaven having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand two And he laid hold of the dragon the old serpent which is the Devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years three and cast him into the abyss and shut it and set a seal over him that he mislead the nations no more until the thousand years are finished after these he must be loosed a little time four And I saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given to them and the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus and on account of the word of God and whoever did not worship the beast neither his image and did not receive the mark upon the forehead or upon their hand and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years five The rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years were finished This is the first resurrection six Happy and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection on these the second death has no power but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years seven And when the thousand years are finished Satan will be loosed out of his prison eight and will go out to mislead the nations that are in the four corners of the earth Gog and Magog to gather them together to the war the number of whom is as the sand of the sea nine And they went up upon the breadth of the earth and encompassed the camp of the saints and the beloved city and fire came down from God twenty nine out of heaven and devoured them ten And the Devil who misleads them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where are also the beast and the false prophet and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever eleven And I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and no place was found for them twelve And I saw the dead the great and the small standing before the throne And books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of the things written in the books according to their works thirteen And the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and the underworld gave up the dead which were in them and they were judged each one according to their works fourteen And death and the underworld were cast into the lake of fire This is the second death the lake of fire fifteen And if any one was not found written in the book of life he was cast into the lake of fire XXI AND I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth passed away and the sea is no more two And I saw the holy city new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God prepared as a bride adorned for her husband three And I heard a loud voice out of the throne saying Behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and GOD WITH THEM twenty one three himself will be their God four And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more nor shall mourning nor crying nor pain be any more because the former things are passed away five And he who sat upon the throne said Behold I make all

fountain of the water of life freely seven He that overcomes shall inherit these things and I will be to him a God and he shall be to me a son eight But the fearful and unbelieving and defiled with abominations and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all the liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death nine And there came one from among the seven angels who have the seven cups full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying Come hither I will show thee the bride the wife of the Lamb ten And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God eleven having the glory of God her luminary like to a most precious stone as it

sons of Israel thirteen on the east three gates and on the north three gates and on the south three gates and on the west three gates fourteen And the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb fifteen And he who talked with me had a golden reed for a measure that he might measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof sixteen And the city lies foursquare and its length is as great as the breadth And he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal seventeen And he measured the wall thereof a hundred and forty four cubits the measure of a man which is that of an angel eighteen And the structure of its wall was jasper and the city was pure gold

nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it twenty five And its gates will not be shut by day for there will be no night there twenty six and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it twenty seven And there shall not enter into it any thing unclean or that works abomination or falsehood but they who are written in the Lamb s book of life XXII AND he showed me a river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb two In the midst of its street and on either side of the river was a tree of life bearing twelve fruits yielding its fruit every month and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations three And there will be no more curse And the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it and his servants will serve him four and will see his face and his name will be upon their foreheads five And there will be no night there and they will have no need of a lamp nor of the
