Newcomb Gauss Printers eighteen ninety eight Salem Mass September nineteen eighteen ninety eight mister Stroyer s account of his experience in slavery and during the war is of great interest and value as a trustworthy description of the condition and life of slaves by one of themselves His memory is remarkably keen and his narrative vivid and at times both touching and thrilling The book is a great credit to its author and deserves a generous reception and a wide circulation John Wright Buckham August thirteen eighteen seventy nine In this book mister Stroyer has given us with a most simple and effective realism the inside view of the institution of slavery It is worth reading to know how men intelligent enough to report their experience felt under the yoke The time has come when American slavery can be studied historically without passion save such as mixes itself with the wonder that so great an evil could exist so long as a social form or a political idol The time has not come when such study is unnecessary for to deal justly by white or black in the United States their previous relations must be understood and nothing which casts light on the most universal and practical of those relations is without value today I take pleasure therefore in saying that I consider mister Stroyer a competent and trustworthy witness to these details of plantation life E C Bolles City of Salem Mayor s Office Nov five eighteen eighty four This is to certify that since the year eighteen seventy six I have known reverend Jacob Stroyer as a preacher and minister to the colored people of this city He is earnest devoted and faithful He is endeavoring by the sale of this book to realize the means to enable him by a course of study to better fit himself as a minister to preach in the South I most cheerfully commend him in his praiseworthy efforts Wm M Hill Mayor mister Stroyer s book is a setting forth in a fresh and unique manner of the old and bitter wrongs of American slavery It is an inside view of a phase of our national life which has happily passed away forever Although it concerns itself largely with incidents and details it is not without the historical value which attaches to reliable personal reminiscences The author has made commendable progress in intellectual culture and is worthy of generous assistance in his effort to fit himself still more perfectly for labor among his needy brethren in the South E S Atwood PREFACE Fourth Edition When the author first presented his book to the public he did not anticipate the very great favor with which it would be received The first edition was soon disposed of a second and a third were called for and those were as generously received as had been their predecessors The present edition the fourth besides all that was in those former publications contains some new material relating to the author s personal experiences in the Civil War Thanking the people for the support given and hoping that this latest effort will meet approval the author presents the story of himself and his once oppressed brethren CHAPTER I My father was born in Sierra Leone Africa Of his parents and his brothers and sisters I know nothing I only remember that it was said that his father s name was Moncoso and his mother s Mongomo which names are known only among the native Africans He was brought from Africa when but a boy and sold to old Colonel Dick Singleton who owned a great many plantations in South Carolina and when the old colonel divided his property among his children father fell to the second son colonel M R Singleton Mother never was sold but her parents were they were owned by one mister Crough who sold them and the rest of the slaves with the plantation to colonel Dick Singleton upon whose place mother was born I was born on this extensive plantation twenty eight miles southeast of Columbia South Carolina in the year eighteen forty nine I belonged to colonel M R Singleton and was held in slavery up to the time of the emancipation proclamation issued by President Lincoln THE CHILDREN My father had fifteen children four boys and three girls by his first wife and eight by his second Their names were as follows of the boys Toney Aszerine Duke and Dezine of the girls Violet Priscilla and Lydia Those of his second wife were as follows Footy Embrus Caleb Mitchell Cuffey and Jacob and of the girls Catherine and Retta SAND HILL DAYS colonel M R Singleton was like many other rich slave owners in the South who had summer seats four six or eight miles from the plantation where they carried the little negro boys and girls too small to work Our summer seat or the sand hill as the slaves used to call it was four miles from the plantation Among the four hundred and sixty five slaves owned by the colonel there were a great many children If my readers had visited colonel Singleton s plantation the last of May or the first of June in the days of slavery they would have seen three or four large plantation wagons loaded with little negroes of both sexes of various complexions and conditions who were being carried to this summer residence and among them they would have found the author of this little work in his sand hill days My readers would naturally ask how many seasons these children were taken to the summer seats I answer until in the judgment of the overseer they were large enough to work then they were kept at the plantation How were they fed There were three or four women who were too old to work on the plantation who were sent as nurses to the summer seats with the children they did the cooking The way in which these old women cooked for eighty and sometimes one hundred fifty children in my sand hill days was this they had two or three large pots which held about a bushel each in which they used to cook corn flour stirred with large wooden paddles The food was dealt out with the paddles into each child s little wooden tray or tin pail which was furnished by the parents according to their ability With this corn flour which the slaves called mush each child used to get a gill of sour milk brought daily from the plantation in a large wooden pail on the head of a boy or man We children used to like the sour milk or hard clabber as it was called by the slaves but that seldom changed diet namely the mush was hated worse than medicine Our hatred was increased against the mush from the fact that they used to give us molasses to eat with it instead of clabber The hateful mixture made us anxious for Sundays to come when our mothers fathers sisters and brothers would bring something from the plantation which however poor we considered very nice compared with what we had during the week days Among the many desirable things our parents brought us the most delightful was cow pease rice and a piece of bacon cooked together the mixture was called by the slaves hopping John THE STORY OF GILBERT A few large boys were sent yearly to the sand hill among the smaller ones as guides At the time to which I am referring there was one by the name of Gilbert who used to go around with the smaller boys in the woods to gather bushes and sticks for the old women to cook our food with Gilbert was a cruel boy He used to strip his little fellow negroes while in the woods and whip them two or three times a week so that their backs were all scarred and threatened them with severer punishment if they told this state of things had been going on for quite a while As I was a favorite with Gilbert I always had managed to escape a whipping with the promise of keeping the secret of the punishment of the rest which I did not so much that I was afraid of Gilbert as because I always was inclined to mind my own business But finally one day Gilbert said to me Jake as he used to call me you am a good boy but I m gwine to wip you some to day as I wip dem toder boys Of course I was required to strip off my only garment which was an Osnaburg linen shirt worn by both sexes of the negro children in the summer As I stood trembling before my merciless superior who had a switch in his hand thousands of thoughts went through my little mind as to how to get rid of the whipping I finally fell upon a plan which I hoped would save me from a punishment that was near at hand There were some carpenters in the woods some distance from us hewing timber they were far away but it was a clear morning so we could hear their voices and the sound of the axes Having resolved in my mind what I would do I commenced reluctantly to take off my shirt at the same time pleading with Gilbert who paid no attention to my prayer but said Jake I is gwine to wip you to day as I did dem toder boys Having satisfied myself that no mercy was to be found with Gilbert I drew my shirt off and threw it over his head and bounded forward on a run in the direction of the sound of the carpenters By the time he got from the entanglement of my garment I had quite a little start of him Between my starting point and the place where the carpenters were at work I jumped over some bushes five or six feet high Gilbert soon gained upon me and sometimes touched me with his hands but as I had on nothing for him to hold to he could not take hold of me As I began to come in sight of the carpenters Gilbert begged me not to go to them for he knew that it would be bad for him but as that was not a time for me to listen to his entreaties I moved on faster As I got near to the carpenters one of them ran and met me into whose arms I jumped The man into whose arms I ran was Uncle Benjamin my mother s uncle As he clasped me in his arms he said Bres de Lo my son wat is de matter But I was so exhausted that it was quite a while before I could tell him my trouble when recovered from my breathless condition I told him that Gilbert had been in the habit of stripping the boys and whipping them two or three times a week when we went into the woods and threatened them with greater punishment if they told I said he had never whipped me before but I was cautioned to keep the secret which I had done up to this time but he said he was going to whip me this morning so I threw my shirt over his head and ran here for protection Gilbert did not follow me after I got in sight of the carpenters but sneaked away Of course my body was all bruised and scratched by the bushes Acting as a guide for Uncle Benjamin I took him to where I had left my garment At this time the children were scattered around in the woods waiting for what the trouble would bring They all were gathered up and taken to the sand hill house examined and it was found as I have stated that their backs were all scarred Gilbert was brought to trial severely whipped and they made him beg all the children to pardon him for his treatment to them But he never was allowed to go into the woods with the rest of the children during that season My sand hill associates always thanked me for the course I took which saved them and myself from further punishment by him MASTER AND MISTRESS VISITING When master and mistress were to visit their little negroes at the sand hill the news was either brought by the overseer who resided at the above named place and went back and forth to the plantation or by one of master s house servants a day ahead The preparation required to receive our white guests was that each little negro was to be washed and clad in the best dress he or she had But before this was done the unsuccessful attempt was made to straighten out our unruly wools with some small cards or Jim Crows as we called them On one occasion an old lady by the name of Janney Cuteron attempted to straighten out my wool with one of those Jim crows as she hitched the teeth of the instrument in my unyielding wool with her great masculine hand of course I was jerked flat on my back This was the common fate of most of my associates whose wools were of the same nature but with a little water and the strong application of the Jim crow the old lady soon combed out my wool into some sort of shape As our preparations were generally completed three quarters of an hour before our guests came we were placed in line the boys together and the girls by themselves We were then drilled in the art of addressing our expected visitors The boys were required to bend the body forward with head down and rest the body on the left foot and scrape the right foot backward on the ground while uttering the words how dy Massie and Missie The girls were required to use the same words accompanied with a courtesy But when Master and Mistress had left the little African wools were neglected until the news of their next visit Our sand hill days were very pleasant outside of the seldom changed diet namely the mush which we had sometimes to eat with molasses the treatment of Gilbert and the attempt to straighten out our unruly wools I said that my father was brought from Africa when but a boy and was sold to old colonel Dick Singleton and when the children were of age the Colonel divided his plantations among them and father fell to colonel M K Singleton who was the second son On this large plantation there were four hundred sixty five slaves there were not so many when it was given to colonel M R but increased to the above stated number up to the time of emancipation My father was not a field hand my first recollection of him was that he used to take care of hogs and cows in the swamp and when too old for that work he was sent to the plantation to take care of horses and mules as master had a great many for the use of his farm I have stated that father said that his father s name in Africa was Moncoso and his mother s Mongomo but I never learned what name he went by before he was brought to this country I only know that he stated that colonel Dick Singleton gave him the name of William by which he was known up to the day of his death Father had a surname Stroyer which he could not use in public as the surname Stroyer would be against the law he was known only by the name of William Singleton because that was his master s name So the title Stroyer was forbidden him and could be used only by his children after the emancipation of the slaves There were two reasons given by the slave holders why they did not allow a slave to use his own name but rather that of the master The first was that if he ran away he would not be so easily detected by using his own name as by that of his master The second was that to allow him to use his own name would be sharing an honor which was due only to his master and that would be too much for a negro said they who was nothing more than a servant So it was held as a crime for a slave to be caught using his own name a crime which would expose him to severe punishment But thanks be to God that those days have passed and we now live under the sun of liberty MOTHER Mother s name was Chloe She belonged to colonel M R Singleton too she was a field hand and never was sold but her parents were once mister Crough who as I have said had owned this plantation on which mother lived had sold the plantation to colonel Dick Singleton with mother s parents on it before she was born Most of the family from which mother came had trades of some kind some were carpenters some were blacksmiths some house servants and others were made drivers over the other negroes Of course the negro drivers would be under a white man who was called the overseer Sometimes the negro drivers were a great deal worse to their fellow negroes than were the white men Mother had an uncle by the name of Esau whom master thought more of than he did of the overseer Uncle Esau was more cruel than was any white man master ever had on his plantation Many of the slaves used to run away from him into the woods I have known some of the negroes to run away from the cruel treatment of Uncle Esau and to stay off eight or ten months They were so afraid of him that they used to say that they would rather see the devil than to see him they were glad when he died But while so much was said of Uncle Esau which was also true of many other negro drivers the overseers themselves were not guiltless of cruelty to the defenceless slaves I have said that most of the family from which mother came had trades of some kind but she had to take her chance in the field with those who had to weather the storm But my readers are not to think that those whom I have spoken of as having trades were free from punishment for they were not some of them had more trouble than had the field hands At times the overseer who was a white man would go to the shop of the blacksmith or carpenter and would pick a quarrel with him so as to get an opportunity to punish him He would say to the negro Oh ye think yourself as good as ye master ye Of course he knew what the overseer was after so he was afraid to speak the overseer hearing no answer would turn to him and cry out ye so big ye can t speak to me ye and then the conflict would begin and he would give that man such a punishment as would disable him for two or three months The merciless overseer would say to him Ye think because ye have a trade ye are as good as ye master ye but I will show ye that ye are nothing but a nigger I said that my father had two wives and fifteen children four boys and three girls by the first and six boys and two girls by the second wife Of course he did not marry his wives as they do now as it was not allowed among the slaves but he took them as his wives by mutual agreement He had my mother after the death of his first wife I am the third son of his second wife My readers would very naturally like to know whether some of the slaves did not have more than one woman I answer they had for as they had no law to bind them to one woman they could have as many as they pleased by mutual agreement But notwithstanding they had a sense of the moral law for many of them felt that it was right to have but one woman they had different opinions about plurality of wives as have the most educated and refined among the whites I met one of my fellow negroes one day who lived next neighbor to us and I said to him Well Uncle William how are you to day His answer was Thank God my son I have two wives now and must try and make out with them until I get some more But while you will find many like him others would rebuke the idea of having more than one wife But thanks be to God the day has come when no one need to plead ignorance for master and servant are both bound by the same law I did not go to the sand hill or summer seat my alloted time but stopped on the plantation with father as I said that he used to take care of horses and mules I was around with him in the barn yard when but a very small boy of course that gave me an early relish for the occupation of hostler and I soon made known my preference to colonel Singleton who was a sportsman and an owner of fine horses And although I was too small to work the Colonel granted my request hence I was allowed to be numbered among those who took care of the fine horses and learned to ride But I soon found that my new occupation demanded a little more than I cared for It was not long after I had entered my new work before they put me upon the back of a horse which threw me to the ground almost as soon as I had reached his back It hurt me a little but that was not the worst of it for when I got up there was a man standing near with a switch in hand and he immediately began to beat me Although I was a very bad boy this was the first time I had been whipped by any one except father and mother so I cried out in a tone of voice as if I would say this is the first and last whipping you will give me when father gets hold of you When I had got away from him I ran to father with all my might but soon found my expectation blasted as father very coolly said to me Go back to your work and be a good boy for I cannot do anything for you But that did not satisfy me so on I went to mother with my complaint and she came out to the man who had whipped me he was a groom a white man master had hired to train the horses Mother and he began to talk then he took a whip and started for her and she ran from him talking all the time I ran back and forth between mother and him until he stopped beating her After the fight between the groom and mother he took me back to the stable yard and gave me a severe flogging And although mother failed to help me at first still I had faith that when he had taken me back to the stable yard and commenced whipping me she would come and stop him but I looked in vain for she did not come Then the idea first came to me that I with my dear father and mother and the rest of my fellow negroes was doomed to cruel treatment through life and was defenceless But when I found that father and mother could not save me from punishment as they themselves had to submit to the same treatment I concluded to appeal to the sympathy of the groom who seemed to have full control over me but my pitiful cries never touched his sympathy for things seemed to grow worse rather than better so I made up my mind to stem the storm the best I could I have said that colonel Singleton had fine horses which he kept for racing and he owned two very noted ones named captain Miner and Inspector Perhaps some of my readers have already heard of captain Miner for he was widely known having won many races in Charlestown and Columbia S C also in Augusta Ga and New York He was a dark bay with short tail Inspector was a chestnut sorrel and had the reputation of being a very great horse These two horses have won many thousand dollars for the the colonel I rode these two horses a great many times in their practice gallops but never had the opportunity to ride them in a race before colonel Singleton died for he did not live long after I had learned so that I could ride for money The custom was that when a boy had learned the trade of a rider he would have to ride what was known as a trial in the presence of a judge who would approve or disapprove his qualifications to be admitted as a race rider according to the jockey laws of South Carolina at that time I have said that I loved the business and acquired the skill very early and this enabled me to pass my examination creditably and to be accepted as a capable rider but I passed through some very severe treatment before reaching that point This white man who trained horses for colonel Singleton was named Boney Young he had a brother named Charles who trained for the colonel s brother John Singleton Charles was a good man but Boney our trainer was as mean as Charles was good he could smile in the face of one who was suffering the most painful death at his hands One day about two weeks after Boney Young and mother had the conflict he called me to him as though he were in the pleasantest mood he was singing I ran to him as if to say by action I will do anything you bid me willingly When I got to him he said Go and bring me a switch sir I answered yes sir and off I went and brought him one then he said come in here sir I answered yes sir and I went into a horse s stall but while I was going in a thousand thoughts passed through my mind as to what he wanted me to go into the stall for but when I had got in I soon learned for he gave me a first class flogging A day or to after that he called me in the same way and I went again and he sent me for a switch I brought him a short stubble that was worn out which he took and beat me on the head with Then he said to me Go and bring me a switch sir I answered Yes sir and off I went the second time and brought him one very little better than the first he broke that over my head also saying Go and bring me a switch sir I answered Yes sir and off I went the third time and brought one which I supposed would suit him Then he said to me Come in here sir I answered Yes sir When I went into the stall he told me to lie down and I stooped down he kicked me around for a while then making me lie on my face he whipped me to his satisfaction That evening when I went home to father and mother I said to them mister Young is whipping me too much now I shall not stand it I shall fight him Father said to me You must not do that because if you do he will say that your mother and I advised you to do it and it will make it hard for your mother and me as well as for yourself You must do as I told you my son do your work the best you can and do not say anything I said to father But I don t know what I have done that he should whip me he does not tell me what wrong I have done he simply calls me to him and whips me when he gets ready Father said I can do nothing more than to pray to the Lord to hasten the time when these things shall be done away that is all I can do When mother had stripped me and looked at the wounds that were upon me she burst into tears and said If he were not so small I would not mind it so much this will break his constitution I am going to master about it because I know he will not allow mister Young to treat this child so And I thought to myself that had mother gone to master about it it would have helped me some for he and she had grown up together and he thought a great deal of her But father said to mother You better not go to master for while he might stop the child from being treated badly mister Young may revenge himself through the overseer for you know that they are very friendly to each other So said father to mother You would gain nothing in the end the best thing for us to do is to pray much over it for I believe that the time will come when this boy with the rest of the children will be free though we may not live to see it When father spoke of liberty his words were of great comfort to me and my heart swelled with the hope of a future which made every moment seem an hour to me Father had a rule which was strictly carried out as far as possible under the slave law which was to put his children to bed early but that night the whole family sat up late while father and mother talked over the matter It was a custom among the slaves not to allow their children under certain ages to enter into conversation with them hence we could take no part with father and mother As I was the object of their sympathy I was allowed the privilege of answering the questions about the whipping the groom gave me When the time came for us to go to bed we all knelt down in family prayer as was our custom father s prayer seemed more real to me that night than ever before especially in the words Lord hasten the time when these children shall be their own free men and women My faith in father s prayer made me think that the Lord would answer him at the farthest in two or three weeks but it was fully six years before it came and father had been dead two years before the war After prayer we all went to bed next morning father went to his work in the barn yard mother to hers in the field and I to mine among the horses before I started however father charged me carefully to keep his advice as he said that would be the easiest way for me to get along But in spite of father s advice I had made up my mind not to submit to the treatment of mister Young as before seeing that it did not help me any Things went smoothly for a while until he called me to him and ordered me to bring him a switch I told him that I would bring him no more switches for him to whip me with but that he must get them himself After repeating the command very impatiently and I refusing he called to another boy named Hardy who brought the switch and then taking me into the stall he whipped me unmercifully After that he made me run back and forth every morning from a half to three quarters of an hour about two hundred and fifty yards and every now and then he would run after me and whip me to make me run faster Besides that when I was put upon a horse if it threw me he would whip me if it were five times a day So I did not gain anything by refusing to bring switches for him to whip me with One very cold morning in the month of March I came from home without washing my face and mister Young made two of the slave boys take me down to a pond where the horses and mules used to drink they threw me into the water and rubbed my face with sand until it bled then I was made to run all the way to the stable which was about a quarter of a mile This cruel treatment soon hardened me so that I did not care for him at all A short time afterwards I was sent with the other boys about four or five miles from home up the public road to practice the horse and they gave me a very wild animal to ride which threw me very often mister Young did not go with us but sent a colored groom every morning who was very faithful to every task alloted him he was instructed to whip me every time the horse threw me while away from home I got many little floggings by the colored groom as the horse threw me a great many times but the floggings I got from him were very feeble compared with those of the white man hence I was better content to go away with the colored groom than to be at home where I should have worse punishment But the time was coming when they ceased to whip me for being thrown by horses One day as I was riding along the road the horse that I was upon darted at the sight of a bird which flew across the way throwing me upon a pile of brush The horse stepped on my cheek and the head of a nail in his shoe went through my left cheek and broke a tooth but it was done so quickly that I hardly felt it It happened that he did not step on me with his whole weight if he had my jaw would have been broken When I got up the colored groom was standing by me but he could not whip me when he saw the blood flowing from my mouth so he took me down to the creek which was but a short distance from the place and washed me and then taking me home sent for a doctor who dressed the wound When mister Young saw my condition he asked how it was done and upon being told he said it ought to have killed me After the doctor had dressed my face of course I went home thinking they would allow me to stay until I got well but I had no sooner arrived than the groom sent for me I did not answer as my jaw pained me very much When he found that I did not come he came after me himself and said if I did not come to the stable right away he would whip me so I went with him He did not whip me while I was in that condition but he would not let me lie down so I suffered very much from exposure When mother came that night from the farm and saw my condition she was overcome with grief she said to father this wound is enough to kill the child and that merciless man will not let him lie down until he gets well this is too hard Father said to her I know it is very hard but what can we do for if we try to keep this boy in the house it will cause us trouble Mother said I wish they would take him out of the world then he would be out of pain and we should not have to fret about him for he would be in heaven Then she took hold of me and said Does it hurt you son meaning my face and I said Yes mamma and she shed tears but she had no little toys to give me to comfort me she could only promise me such as she had which were eggs and chickens Father did not show his grief for me as mother did but he tried to comfort mother all he could and at times would say to me Never mind my son you will be a man bye and bye but he did not know what was passing through my mind at that time Though I was very small I thought that if while a boy my treatment was so severe it would be much worse when I became a man and having had a chance to see how men were being punished it was a very poor consolation to me Finally the time came for us to go to bed and we all knelt in family prayer Father thanked God for having saved me from a worse injury and then he prayed for mother s comfort and also for the time which he predicted would come that is the time of freedom when I and the rest of the children would be our own masters and mistresses then he commended us to God and we all went to bed The next morning I went to my work with a great deal of pain They did not send me up the road with the horses in that condition but I had to ride the old horses to water and work around the stable until I was well enough to go with the other boys But I am happy to say that from the time I got hurt by that horse I was never thrown except through carelessness neither was I afraid of a horse after that Notwithstanding father and mother fretted very much about me they were proud of my success as a rider but my hardships did not end here A short time after I was taken to Columbia and Charleston S C where they used to have the races That year colonel Singleton won a large sum of money by the well known horse captain Miner and that was the same season that I rode my trial race The next year before the time of racing colonel Singleton died at his summer seat After master s death mistress sold all the race horses and that put an end to sporting horses in that family I said that Boney Young colonel Singleton s groom had a brother by the name of Charles who trained horses for the colonel s brother John Singleton Boney was a better trainer but Charles was a better man to the negroes It was against the law for a slave to buy spirituous liquors without a ticket but Charles used to give the boys tickets to buy rum and whiskey with He also allowed them to steal the neighbor s cows and hogs I remember that on one occasion his boys killed a cow belonging to a man by the name of Le Brun soon after the meat was brought to the stable Le Brun rode up on horseback with a loaded shot gun and threatened to shoot the party with whom the beef was found Of course the negroes apartments were searched but as that had been anticipated mister Young had made them put the meat in his apartment and as it was against the law of South Carolina for a white man to search another s house or any apartment without very strong evidence the meat was not found Before searching among the negroes mister Young said to Le Brun You may search but you won t find your beef here for my boys don t steal Le Brun answered mister Young your word might be true sir but I would trust a nigger with money a great deal sooner than I would with cows and hogs mister Young answered That might be true but you won t find your beef here After their rooms and clothes had been searched blood was found under some of their finger nails which increased Le Brun s suspicion that they were of the party who stole his cow but mister Young answered that blood is from rabbits my boys caught today mister Le Brun tried to scare one of the boys to make him say it was the blood of his cow mister Young said mister Le Brun you have searched and did not find your beef as I told you that you would not also I told you that the blood under their finger nails is from rabbits caught today You will have to take my word sir without going to further trouble furthermore these boys belong to mister Singleton and if you want to take further steps you will have to see him Finding that he was not allowed to do as he wanted to mister Le Brun made great oaths and threats as he mounted his horse to leave that he would shoot the very first one of those boys he should catch near his cattle He and mister Young never did agree after that But poor mister Young as good as he was to the negroes was an enemy to himself for he was a very hard drinker People who knew him before I did said they never had seen him drink tea coffee or water but rather rum and whiskey he drank so hard that he used to go into a crazy fit he finally put an end to his life by cutting his throat with a razor at a place called O Handly s race course about three miles from Columbia S C This was done just a few days before one of the great races Boney Young drank too but not so hard as Charles He lived until just after the late war and while walking one day through one of the streets of the above named city dropped dead with what was supposed to have been heart disease Boney had a mulatto woman named Moriah who had been originally brought from Virginia by negro traders but had been sold to several different masters later The trouble was that she was very beautiful and wherever she was sold her mistresses became jealous of her so that she changed owners very often She was finally sold to Boney Young who had no wife and she lived with him until freed by the emancipation proclamation She had two daughters the elder s name was Annie but we used to call her sissie the younger s name was Josephine Annie looked just like her father Boney Young while Josephine looked enough like Charles to have been his daughter It was easy enough to tell that the mother had sprung from the negro race but the girls could pass for white Their mother Moriah died in Columbia some time after the war Annie went off and was married to a white man but I don t know what became of Josephine A short time before master s death he stood security for a northern man who was cashier of one of the largest banks in the city of Charleston This man ran away with a large sum of money leaving the colonel embarassed which fact made him very fretful and peevish He had been none too good before to his slaves and that made him worse as you knew that the slave holders would revenge themselves on the slaves whenever they became angry I had seen master whip his slaves a great many times but never so severely as he did that spring before he died One day before he went to his summer seat he called a man to him stripped and whipped him so that the blood ran from his body like water thrown upon him in cupfuls and when the man stepped from the place where he had been tied the blood ran out of his shoes He said to the man You will remember me now sir as long as you live The man answered Yes master I will Master went away that spring for the last time he never returned alive he died at his summer seat When they brought his remains home all of the slaves were allowed to stop at home that day to see the last of him and to lament with mistress After all the slaves who cared to do so had seen his face they gathered in groups around mistress to comfort her they shed false tears saying Never mind missis massa gone home to heaven While some were saying this others said Thank God massa gone home to hell Of course the most of them were glad that he was dead but they were gathered there for the express purpose of comforting mistress But after master s death mistress was a great deal worse than he had been When the master died there was a great change of things on the plantation the creditors came in for settlement so all of the fine horses and some others such as carriage horses and a few mules also were sold The slaves whom master had bought himself had to be sold but those who had been born on the plantation given to him by his father old colonel Dick Singleton could not be sold until the grandchildren were of age As I have stated my hardships and trials did not end with the race horses you will now see them in another form After all the fine horses had been sold mistress ordered the men and boys who were taking care of the horses to be put into the field and I was among them though small but I had become so attached to the horses that they could get no work out of me so they began to whip me but every time they whipped me I would leave the field and run home to the barn yard Finally mistress engaged a very bad man as overseer in place of old Ben Usome whose name was William Turner Two or three days after his arrival he took me into the field and whipped me until I was sick so I went home I went to mistress and told her that the overseer had whipped me she asked if I had done the work that he had given me I told her that master had promised me that when I got too heavy to ride race horses he would send me to learn the carpenter s trade she asked me if in case she put me to a trade I would work and I told her I would So she consented But the overseer did not like the idea of having me work at the trade which was my choice He said to mistress That is the worst thing you can do madam to allow a negro to have his choice about what he shall do I have had some experience as an overseer for many years and I think I am able to give a correct statement about the nature of negroes in general I know a gentleman who allowed his negroes to have their own way about things on his plantation and the result was that they got as high as their master Besides that madam their influence rapidly spreads among the neighbors and if such should be allowed South Carolina would have all masters and mistresses and no servants and as I have said I know somewhat about the nature of negroes I notice madam that this boy will put you to a great deal of trouble unless you begin to subdue him now while he is young A very few years delay will enable him to have a great influence among his fellow negroes for that boy can read very well now and you know madam it is against the law for a negro to get an education and if you allow him to work at the carpenter s trade it will thus afford him the opportunity of acquiring a better education because he will not be directly under the eye of one who will see that he makes no further advancement Then mistress asked me Can you read Jacob I did not want her to know that I had taken notice of what they were saying so I answered I don t know ma am The overseer said He does not know what is meant madam but I can make him understand me Then he took a newspaper from his pocket and said to me Can you say these words I took the paper and began to read then he took it from me Mistress asked when I had learned to read and who had taught me The overseer did not know but said he would find out from me Turning to me he took the paper from his pocket again and said Jacob who told you to say words in the book I answered Nobody sir I said them myself He repeated the question three or four times and I gave the same answer every time Then mistress said I think it would be better to put him to trade than to have him in the field because he will be away from his fellow negroes and will be less liable to influence them if we can manage to keep him away The overseer said That might be true madam but if we can manage to keep him from gaining any more education he will eventually lose what little he has and now madam if you will allow me to take him in hand I will bring him out all right without injuring him Just at this juncture a carriage drove up to the gate and I ran as usual to open it the overseer went about his business and mistress went to speak to the persons in the carriage I never had a chance to hear their conclusion A few days after the conversation between the overseer and mistress I was informed by one of the slaves who was a carpenter that she had ordered that I should go to work at the trade with him This gave me great joy as I was very anxious to know what they had decided to do with me I went to my new trade with great delight and soon began to imagine what a famous carpenter I should make and what I should say and do when I had learned the trade Everything seemed to run smoothly with me for about two months when suddenly I was told one morning that I must go into the field to drop cotton seed but I did not heed the call as mistress was not at home and I knew she had just put me to the trade also that the overseer was trying to get mistress consent to have me work out in the field The next morning the overseer came into the carpenter s shop and said Did I not order ye into the field sir I answered Yes sir Well why did ye not go I answered Mistress has put me here to learn the trade He said I will give ye trade So he stripped me and gave me a severe whipping and told me that that was the kind of trade I needed and said he would give me many of them The next day I went into the field and he put me to drop cotton seed as I was too small to do anything else I would have made further resistance but mistress was very far away from home and I had already learned the lesson that father and mother could render me no help so I thought submission to him the easiest for me When I had got through with the cotton seed in about three weeks I went back to the carpenter s shop to work so he came there and gave me another severe whipping and said to me Ye want to learn the carpenter s trade but I will have ye to the trade of the field But that was the last whipping he gave me and the last of his whip A few days after my last whipping the slaves were ordered down into the swamp across the river to clear up new grounds while the already cleared lands were too wet from rain that had fallen that night Of course I was among them to do my part that is while the men quartered up dry trees which had been already felled in the winter and rolled the logs together the women boys and girls piled the brushes on the logs and burned them We had to cross the river in a flat boat which was too small to carry over all the slaves at once so they had to make several trips mister Turner the overseer went across in the first flat he did not ride down to the work place but went on foot while his horse which was trained to stand alone without being hitched was left at the landing place My cousin and I crossed in the last boat When we had got across we lingered behind the crowd at the landing when they all were gone we went near the horse and saw the whip with which I was whipped a few days before fastened to the saddle I said to him Here is the whip old Turner whipped me with the other day He said It ought to be put where he will never get it to whip anybody with again I answered my cousin If you will keep the secret I will put it where old Bill as we used to call mister Turner will never use it any more He agreed to keep the secret and then asked me how I would put the whip away I told him if he would find me a string and a piece of iron I would show him how He ran down to the swamp barn which was a short distance from the margin of the river and soon returned with the string and iron exactly suited for the work I tied the iron to the whip went into the flat boat and threw it as far as I could into the river My cousin and I watched it until it went out of sight under water then as guilty boys generally do after mischievous deeds we dashed off in a run hard as we could among the other negroes and acted as harmless as possible mister Turner made several inquiries but never learned what had become of his whip A short time after this in the time of the war in the year eighteen sixty three when a man was going round to the different plantations gathering slaves from their masters to carry off to work on fortifications and to wait on officers there were ten slaves sent from missus Singleton s plantation and I was among them They carried us to Sullivan s Island at Charleston S C and I was there all of that year I thanked God that it afforded me a better chance for an education than I had had at home and so I was glad to be on the island Though I had no one to teach me as I was thrown among those of my fellow negroes who were fully as lame as I was in letters yet I felt greatly relieved from being under the eye of the overseer whose intention was to keep me from further advancement The year after I had gone home I was sent back to Fort Sumpter in the year eighteen sixty four I carried my spelling book with me and although the northerners were firing upon us I tried to keep up my study In July of the same year I was wounded by the Union soldiers on a Wednesday evening I was taken to the city of Charleston to doctor Regg s hospital and there I stayed until I got well enough to travel when I was sent to Columbia where I was when the hour of liberty was proclaimed to me in eighteen sixty five This was the year of jubilee the year which my father had spoken of in the dark days of slavery when he and mother sat up late talking of it He said to mother The time will come when this boy and the rest of the children will be their own masters and mistresses He died six years before that day came but mother is still enjoying liberty with her children And no doubt my readers would like to know how I was wounded in the war We were obliged to do our work in the night as they were firing on us in the day and on a Wednesday night just as we went out we heard the cry of the watchman Look out There was a little lime house near the southwest corner of the fort and some twelve or thirteen of us ran into it and all were killed but two a shell came down on the lime house and burst and a piece cut my face open But as it was not my time to die I lived to enjoy freedom I said that when I got so I could travel I was sent from doctor Ragg s hospital in Charleston to colonel Singleton s plantation near Columbia in the last part of the year eighteen sixty four I did not do any work during the remainder of that year because I was unwell from my wound received in the fort About that time general Sherman came through Georgia with his hundred thousand men and camped at Columbia S C The slave holders were very uneasy as to how they should save other valuables as they saw that slavery was a hopeless case Mistress had some of her horses mules cows and hogs carried down into the swamp while the others which were left on the plantation were divided out to the negroes for safe keeping as she had heard that the Yankees would not take anything belonging to the slaves A little pig of about fifty or sixty pounds was given to me for safe keeping A few of the old horses and mules were taken from the plantation by the Union soldiers but they did not trouble anything else After Columbia had been burned and things had somewhat quieted along in the year eighteen sixty five the negroes were asked to give up the cows and hogs given them for safe keeping all the rest gave up theirs but mine was not found No doubt but my readers want to know what had become of it Well I will tell you You all know that Christmas was a great day with both masters and slaves in the South but the Christmas of eighteen sixty four was the greatest which had ever come to the slaves for although the proclamation did not reach us until eighteen sixty five we felt that the chains which had bound us so long were well nigh broken So I killed the pig that Christmas gathered all of my associates and had a great feast after which we danced the whole week Mother would not let me have my feast in her cabin because she was afraid that the white people would charge her with advising me to kill the pig so I had it in one of the other slave s cabins When the overseer asked me for the pig given me I told him that I killed it for my Christmas feast Mistress said to me Jacob why did you not ask me for the pig if you wanted it rather than take it without permission I answered I would have asked but thought as I had it in hand it wasn t any use asking for it The overseer wanted to whip me for it but as Uncle Sam had already broken the right arm of slavery through the voice of the proclamation of eighteen sixty three he was powerless When the yoke had been taken from my neck I went to school in Columbia S C awhile then to Charleston Afterward I came to Worcester Mass in February eighteen sixty nine I studied quite a while in the evening schools at Worcester and also a while in the academy of the same place During that time I was licensed a local preacher of the African Methodist Episcopal church and sometime later was ordained deacon at Newport R I A short time after my ordination I was sent to Salem Mass where I have remained carrying on religious work among my people trying in my feeble way to preach that gospel which our blessed Saviour intended for the redemption of all mankind when he proclaimed Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel In the meantime I have been striking steady blows for the improvement of my education in preparing myself for a field of work among my more unfortunate brethren in the South I must say that I have been surrounded by many good friends including the clergy since I have been in Salem whose aid has enabled me to serve a short term in the Wesleyan school at Wilbraham Mass also to begin a course of theological studies at Talladega college in Alabama which I am endeavoring to complete by the sale of this publication CHAPTER II SKETCHES THE SALE OF MY TWO SISTERS I have stated that my father had fifteen children four boys and three girls by his first wife and six boys and two girls by his second Their names are as follows Toney Azerine Duke and Dezine 
5781-52134-0000	train-other-500	of the girls Violet Priscilla and Lydia those of the second wife as follows Footy Embrus Caleb Mitchell Cuffee and Jacob who is the author and the girls
5781-52134-0001	train-other-500	Catherine and Retta As I have said old colonel Dick Singleton had two sons and two daughters and each had a plantation Their names were John Matt Marianna and Angelico They were very agreeable together
none	none	 so that if one wanted negro help from another s plantation he or she could have it especially in cotton picking time John Singleton had a place about twenty miles from master s and master used to send him slaves to pick cotton At one time my master 
5781-52134-0002	train-other-500	colonel M R Singleton sent my two sisters Violet and Priscilla to his brother John and while they were there they married two of the men on his place By mutual consent master allowed them to remain on his brother s place But some time after this
5781-52134-0003	train-other-500	John Singleton had some of his property destroyed by water
none	none	 as is often the case in the South at the time of May freshets 
5781-52134-0004	train-other-500	what is known in the North as high tides One of these freshets swept away John Singleton s slave houses his barns with horses mules and cows These caused his death by a broken heart
5781-52134-0005	train-other-500	and since he owed a great deal of money his slaves had to be sold A mister Manning bought a portion of them and Charles Login the rest These two men were known as the greatest slave traders in the South My sisters were among the number that mister Manning bought
5781-52134-0006	train-other-500	He was to take them into the state of Louisiana for sale but some of the men did not want to go with him and he put those in prison until he was ready to start My sisters husbands were among the prisoners in the Sumterville jail
none	none	 which was about twenty five or thirty miles across the river from master s place Those who did not show any unwillingness to go were allowed to visit their relatives and friends for the last time So my sisters with the rest of their unfortunate companions 
5781-52134-0007	train-other-500	came to master s place to visit us When the day came for them to leave some who seemed to have been willing to go at first refused and were handcuffed together and guarded on their way to the cars by white men
5781-52134-0008	train-other-500	The women and children were driven to the depot in crowds like so many cattle and the sight of them caused great excitement among master s negroes Imagine a mass of uneducated people shedding tears and yelling at the top of their voices in anguish
none	none	 The victims were to take the cars at a station called Clarkson turnout 
5781-52134-0009	train-other-500	which was about four miles from master s place The excitement was so great that the overseer and driver could not control the relatives and friends of those that were going away as a large crowd of both old and young went down to the depot to see them off
5781-52134-0010	train-other-500	Louisiana was considered by the slaves a place of slaughter
none	none	 so those who were going did not expect to see their friends again 
5781-52134-0011	train-other-500	While passing along many of the negroes left their masters fields and joined us as we marched to the cars some were yelling and wringing their hands while others were singing little hymns that they had been accustomed to for the consolation of those that were going away
5781-52134-0012	train-other-500	such as When we all meet in heaven There is no parting there When we all meet in heaven There is parting no more We arrived at the depot and had to wait for the cars to bring the others from the Sumterville jail
5781-52134-0013	train-other-500	but they soon came in sight and when the noise of the cars had died away we heard wailing and shrieks from those in the cars While some were weeping others were fiddling picking banjo and dancing as they used to do in their cabins on the plantations
5781-52134-0014	train-other-500	Those who were so merry had very bad masters and even though they stood a chance of being sold to one as bad or even worse yet they were glad to be rid of the one they knew While the cars were at the depot a large crowd of white people gathered
5781-52134-0015	train-other-500	laughing and talking about the prospect of negro traffic but when the cars began to start and the conductor cried out All who are going on this train must get on board without delay
none	none	 the colored people cried out with one voice as though the heavens and earth were coming together and it was so pitiful that those hard hearted white men who had been accustomed to driving slaves all their lives shed tears like children As the cars moved away 
5781-52134-0016	train-other-500	we heard the weeping and wailing from the slaves as far as human voice could be heard and from that time to the present I have neither seen nor heard from my two sisters nor any of those who left Clarkson depot on that memorable day
none	none	 THE WAY THE SLAVES LIVED Most of the cabins in the time of slavery were built so as to contain two families some had partitions while others had none When there were no partitions each family would fit up its own part as it could 
5781-52134-0017	train-other-500	sometimes they got old boards and nailed them up stuffing the cracks with rags when they could not get boards they hung up old clothes When the family increased the children all slept together both boys and girls until one got married
5781-52134-0018	train-other-500	then a part of another cabin was assigned to that one but the rest would have to remain with their mother and father as in childhood unless they could get with some of their relatives or friends who had small families or unless they were sold
5781-52134-0019	train-other-500	but of course the rules of modesty were held in some degrees by the slaves while it could not be expected that they could entertain the highest degree of it on account of their condition A portion of the time the young men slept in the apartment known as the kitchen
5781-52134-0020	train-other-500	and the young women slept in the room with their mother and father The two families had to use one fireplace One who was accustomed to the way in which the slaves lived in their cabins could tell as soon as they entered whether they were friendly or not for when they did not agree
5781-52134-0021	train-other-500	the fires of the two families did not meet on the hearth but there was a vacancy between them that was a sign of disagreement In a case of this kind when either of the families stole a hog cow or sheep from the master
none	none	 he had to carry it to some of his friends for fear of being betrayed by the other family On one occasion a man who lived with one unfriendly stole a hog killed it and carried some of the meat home He was seen by some one of the other family who reported him to the overseer and he gave the man a severe whipping 
5781-52134-0022	train-other-500	Sometime afterward this man who had been betrayed thought he would get even with his enemy so about two months later he killed another hog and after eating a part of it stole into the apartment of the other family
5781-52134-0023	train-other-500	and hid a portion of the meat among the old clothes Then he told the overseer that he had seen the man go out late that night and that he had not come home until the next morning
none	none	 when he did come 
5781-52134-0024	train-other-500	he had called his wife to the window and she had taken something in He did not know what it was but if the overseer would go there right away he would find it The overseer went and searched and found the meat so the man was whipped
none	none	 He told the overseer that the other man put it in his apartment while the family were away but the overseer told him that every man must be responsible for his own apartment No doubt you would like to know how the slaves could sleep in their cabins in summer when it was so very warm 
5781-52134-0025	train-other-500	When it was too warm for them to sleep comfortably they all slept under trees until it grew too cool that is along in the month of October Then they took up their beds and walked JOE AND THE TURKEY
5781-52134-0026	train-other-500	Joe was a boy who was waiter to his master one mister King and he and his wife were very fond of company missus King always had chickens and turkey for dinner but at one time the company was so large that they did not leave anything for the servants
none	none	 so that day finding that all had been eaten while mistress and master were busy with the company Joe killed a turkey dressed it and put it into the pot but as he did not cut it up the turkey s knees stuck out of the pot and as he could not cover them up 
5781-52134-0027	train-other-500	he put one of his shirts over them When missus King called Joe he answered but did not go right away as he generally did and when he did go his mistress said Joe what was the matter with you he answered Noffing missis
5781-52134-0028	train-other-500	Then he went and opened the gate for the company Soon after Joe was back in the kitchen again and missus King went down to see what he was doing seeing the pot on she said Joe what is in that pot he said noffing missis but my shirt
5781-52134-0029	train-other-500	am gwine to wash it She did not believe him so she took a fork and stuck it in the pot taking out the shirt and she found the turkey She asked him how the turkey had got into the pot he said he did not know but reckoned the turkey got in himself
none	none	 as the fowls were very fond of going into the kitchen So Joe was whipped because he allowed the turkey to get into the pot THE CUSTOM OF CHRISTMAS Both masters and slaves regarded Christmas as a great day 
5781-52134-0030	train-other-500	When the slaveholders had made a large crop they were pleased and gave the slaves from five to six days which were much enjoyed by the negroes especially by those who could dance Christmas morning was held sacred both by master and slaves but in the afternoon
5781-52134-0031	train-other-500	or in a part of the next day the slaves were required to devote themselves to the pleasure of their masters Some of the masters would buy presents for the slaves such as hats and tobacco for the men handkerchiefs and little things for the women
5781-52134-0032	train-other-500	these things were given after they had been pleased with them after either dancing or something for their amusement When the slaves came up to their masters and mistresses the latter would welcome them the men would take off their hats and bow and the women would make a low courtesy
none	none	 There would be two or three large pails filled with sweetened water with a gallon or two of whiskey in each this was dealt out to them until they were partly drunk while this was going on those who could talk very well would give tokens of well wishing to their master and mistress 
5781-52134-0033	train-other-500	and some who were born in Africa would sing some of their songs or tell different stories of the customs in Africa After this they would spend half a day in dancing in some large cotton house or on a scaffold the master providing fiddlers who came from other plantations
none	none	 if there were none on the place and who received from fifteen to twenty dollars on these occasions A great many of the strict members of the church who did not dance would be forced to do it to please their masters the favorite tunes were The Fisher s Hornpipe 
5781-52134-0034	train-other-500	The Devil s Dream and Black eyed Susan No one can describe the intense emotion in the negro s soul on those occasions when they were trying to please their masters and mistresses After the dancing was over we had our presents master giving to the men
5781-52134-0035	train-other-500	and mistress to the women then the slaves would go to their quarters and continue to dance the rest of the five or six days and would sometimes dance until eight o clock Sunday morning The cabins were mostly made of logs and there were large cracks in them
none	none	 so that a person could see the light in them for miles in the night and of course the sun s rays would shine through them in the daytime so on Sunday morning when they were dancing and did not want to stop 
5781-52134-0036	train-other-500	you would see them filling up the cracks with old rags The idea was that it would not be Sunday inside if they kept the sun out and thus they would not desecrate the Sabbath and these things continued until the freedom of the slaves
5781-52134-0037	train-other-500	Perhaps my readers would like to know if most of the negroes were inclined to violate the Sabbath They were as the masters would make them do unnecessary work they got into the habit of disregarding the day as one for rest
none	none	 and did many things Sunday that would not be allowed in the North At that time if you should go through the South on those large cotton and rice plantations while you would find some dancing on Sunday others would be in the woods and fields hunting rabbits and other game and some would be killing pigs belonging to their masters or neighbors 
5781-52134-0038	train-other-500	I remember when a small boy I went into the woods one Sunday morning with one of my fellow negroes whose name was Munson
none	none	 but we called him Pash and we killed one of master s pigs 
5781-52134-0039	train-other-500	hid it under the leaves until night then took it home and dressed it That was the only time I killed a pig but I knew of thousands of cases like this in the time of slavery
none	none	 But thank God the year of Jubilee has come and the negroes can return from dancing from hunting and from the master s pig pens on Sundays and become observers of the Sabbath of good moral habits and men of equal rights before the law PUNISHMENTS INFLICTED ON DIFFERENT ONES One of my fellow negroes who belonged to colonel M R Singleton visited the plantation of the colonel s sister the overseer of that plantation had forbidden strangers to go there 
5781-52135-0001	train-other-500	but this man whose name was Harry would go The overseer heard of him but could not catch him but the overseer of master s place sent him to mister Jackson the overseer of master s sister s place
5781-52135-0002	train-other-500	mister Jackson tied him and hit him three hundred lashes and then said to him Harry if you were not such a good nigger
none	none	 I should have given you a first class whipping 
5781-52135-0003	train-other-500	but as you are a good fellow and I like you so well I thought I would give you a light flogging now you must be a good nigger and behave yourself for if I ever have to take hold of you again I shall give you a good whipping
5781-52135-0004	train-other-500	When mister Jackson had loosed him from where he had tied him Harry was so exhausted that he fell down so mister Jackson sent him home in a cart
none	none	 and he had to stay at home from work a month or two and was never the same man again 
5781-52135-0005	train-other-500	THE PUNISHMENT AND SALE OF MONDAY There was a man who belonged to master by the name of Monday who was a good field hand in summer the tasks generally performed by the slaves were more than they could do
5781-52135-0006	train-other-500	and in consequence they were severely whipped but Monday would not wait to be whipped but would run away before the overseer or driver could get to him Sometimes master would hire a white man who did nothing else but hunt runaway slaves for a living
none	none	 this man would take from fifteen to twenty hounds with him to hunt Monday but often he would be out three or four months when he was caught and brought home he was put in prison and was whipped every day for a week or two 
5781-52135-0007	train-other-500	but just as soon as he could he would run away again At one time when he had been brought home one of his arms was tied and he was put in care of a keeper who made him work with the other slaves days and put him in confinement nights
5781-52135-0008	train-other-500	but for all this he got away from his keeper and went into the woods again The last time he ran away two white men were hired to hunt him they had about twenty five blood hounds but this time Monday fell in with another slave who had ran away from his master
5781-52135-0009	train-other-500	and had been in the woods seven years and they together were able to kill a greater portion of the hounds Finally the white men caught his companion but did not catch Monday though they chased him two or three days longer but he came home himself
5781-52135-0010	train-other-500	they did not whip him and he went to work in the field Things went on very nicely with him for two or three weeks until one day a white man was seen riding through the fields with the overseer of course the slaves did not mistrust his object as white men often visited master s plantation
none	none	 but that night when all the slaves were sleeping the man that was seen in the daytime went to the door of Monday s cabin and called him out of his bed and when he had come to his door the stranger whom he had never seen before that day 
5781-52135-0011	train-other-500	handcuffed him and said You now belong to me Most of the slaves found it out as Monday was put in a cart and carried through the streets of the negro quarters and there was quite an excitement but Monday was never heard from again
none	none	 THE STORY OF JAMES HAY 
5781-52135-0012	train-other-500	There was a slave named James Hay who belonged to a neighbor of master s he was punished a great many times because he could not get his task done The other slaves pitied him because he seemed unable to perform his task
none	none	 One evening he got a severe whipping the next morning as the slaves were having their tasks assigned them an old lady by the name of Aunt Patience went by and said Never mind Jim my son the Lord will help you with your task today 
5781-52135-0013	train-other-500	he answered Yes ma am He began his work very faithfully and continued until it was half done then he lay down under a tree the others not understanding his motive thought he was tired and was taking a rest
5781-52135-0014	train-other-500	but he did not return to his task until the overseer called him and asked him why he did not have his work nearer done He said Aunt Patience told me dis morning that the Lord would help me today
none	none	 and I thought as I did half of the task the Lord might have finished the other half if he intended to help me at all 
5781-52135-0015	train-other-500	The overseer said You see that the Lord did not come to help you and we shall not wait for him but we will help you so Jim got a severe punishment Sometime after this Jim Hay was called upon by some professors of religion
none	none	 they asked him if he was not tired of serving the devil and told him that the Lord was good and had helped many of his people and would help all who asked him and then take them home to heaven Jim said that if the Lord would not do half an acre of his task for him when he depended on him he did not think he could trust him and Jim never became a Christian to my knowledge THE STORY OF mister USOM AND JACK 
5781-52135-0016	train-other-500	One Sunday when the boys were at the overseer s mister Usom s house as we generally were he said to one Jack don t you think that hell is a very hot place if it is as they describe it Jack said Yes massa
none	none	 mister Usom said Well how do you think it will be with poor fellows that have to go there 
5781-52135-0017	train-other-500	Well Massa Bob I will tell you what I tinks about it I tinks us niggers need not trouble usselves about hell as the white folks How is that Jack Jack answered
none	none	 Because us niggers have to work out in the hot sun 
5781-52135-0018	train-other-500	and if we go to hell it would not be so bad for us because us used to heat but it will be bad for white folks because they is not used to hot weather
none	none	 THE STORY OF JAMES SWINE AND HIS DEATH There was a negro who belonged to one mister Clarkson 
5781-52135-0019	train-other-500	he was called Jim Swine his right name was James but he was called Jim Swine because he loved hog meat and would often steal hogs from his master or from the neighbors he was a very able bodied man weighing about two hundred and twenty five pounds
5781-52135-0020	train-other-500	and a very good field hand Of course it is generally known that a great many of the slaves were poorly fed
none	none	 so it was natural that they should take anything they could to sustain life As his master had only a few hogs 
5781-52135-0021	train-other-500	he stole many from the neighbors and was punished a great many times for it Sometimes he was punished when a hog was missing even though they did not find the meat with him Jim was not in the habit of running away much
none	none	 but if they whipped him when he had not stolen the hog they accused him of taking he would go away into the woods and stay until he got ready to come home He was so strong that they were afraid of him three or four men would not attack him when in the woods 
5781-52135-0022	train-other-500	The last time Jim stole hogs he was caught in the act of taking one from my master colonel Singleton They tied him and mister Clarkson s overseer was sent for who was his own son Thomas Clarkson Jim was taken home whipped
5781-52135-0023	train-other-500	and a cured middling of a hog was tied around his neck he was then made to work along with the other slaves in the day and was put in prison in the night for two weeks One morning when the overseer went to his place of confinement to take him into the field he found him dead
5781-52135-0024	train-other-500	with a large piece of meat hanging to his neck The news of his death soon went abroad also the cause of it and when old mister Clarkson found it out he was very angry at his son Thomas and his punishment was
5781-52135-0025	train-other-500	that he was driven from his plantation with orders never to return and that he should not have any of his property This seemed to grieve Thomas very much and he made several attempts to regain his father s affections but failed Finally one night
none	none	 Thomas made an outcry that he had found a pearl of great price that the Lord had pardoned his sins and that he was at peace with all mankind When his father heard of this he sent for him to come home and he gave him quite a sum of money 
5781-52135-0026	train-other-500	and willed him the portion of property that he had said he should keep from him But poor Jim was not there to forgive him A MAN MISTAKEN FOR A HOG Two negroes went to steal hogs from their masters
none	none	 The swine were under a barn as in the South barns were made high enough for hogs to stand under The man who went under the barn said to the other you must strike the hog that goes the slowest then he went under the barn on his knees to drive them out while the other stood with his club ready to strike 
5781-52135-0027	train-other-500	but they ran out so fast he could not hit them except the last as he thought which came just slow enough and he struck
none	none	 While the supposed hog was kicking he jumped upon it to stab it with his knife but found it was his companion 
5781-52135-0028	train-other-500	CUSTOM OF WITCHES AMONG SLAVES The witches among slaves were supposed to have been persons who worked with them every day
none	none	 and were called old hags or jack lanterns 
5781-52135-0029	train-other-500	Those both men and women who when they had grown old
none	none	 looked old 
5781-52135-0030	train-other-500	were supposed to be witches Sometimes after eating supper
none	none	 the negroes would gather in each other s cabins which looked over the large openings on the plantation and when they would see a light at a great distance and see it open and shut they would say there is an old hag and if it came from a direction in which those lived whom they called witches one would say Dat looks like old Aunt Susan another would say No dat look like man hag still another I tink dat look like ole Uncle Renty When the light had disappeared they said that the witch had got into the plantation and changed itself into a person and had gone about on the place talking with the people like others until those whom it wanted to bewitch went to bed then it would change itself to a witch again They claimed that the witches rode human beings like horses and that the spittle that ran on the side of the cheek when one slept was the bridle that the witch rode with Sometimes a baby would be smothered by its mother and they would charge it to a witch If they went out hunting at night and were lost it was believed that a witch had led them off especially if they fell into a pond or creek I was very much troubled with witches when a little boy and am now sometimes but it is only when I eat a hearty supper and immediately go to bed It was said by some of the slaves that the witches would sometimes go into the rooms of the cabins and hide themselves until the family went to bed and therefore when any one claimed that he had gone into the apartment before bed time and thought he had seen a witch if he had an old Bible in the cabin that would be taken into the room and the person who carried the Bible would say as he went in In de name of de Fader and of de Son and de Holy Gos wat you want Then the Bible would be put in the corner where the person thought he had seen the witch as it was generally believed that if this were done the witch could not stay When they could not get the Bible they used red pepper and salt pounded together and scattered in the room but in this case they generally felt the effects of it more than the witch for when they went to bed it made them cough all night When I was a little boy my mother sent me into the cabin room for something and as I got in I saw something black and white but did not stop to see what it was and running out said there was a witch in the room But father having been born in Africa did not believe in such things so he called me a fool and whipped me and the witch got scared and ran out the door It turned out to be our own black and white cat that we children played with every day Although it proved to be the cat and father did not believe in witches still I held the idea that there were such things for I thought the majority of the people believed it and that they ought to know more than could one man Sometime after I was free in travelling from Columbia to Camden a distance of about thirty two miles night overtook me when about half way there it was very dark and rainy and as I approached a creek I saw a great number of lights of those witches opening and shutting I did not know what to do and thought of turning back but when I looked behind I saw some witches in the distance so I said If I turn back those will meet me and I shall be in as much danger as if I go on and I thought of what some of my fellow negroes had said about their leading men into ponds and creeks There was a creek just ahead so I concluded that I should be drowned that night however I went on as I saw no chance of turning back When I came near the creek one of the witches flew into my face I jumped back and grasped it but it proved to be one of those lightning bugs and I thought that if all the witches were like that one I should not be in any great danger from them THE DEATH OF CYRUS AND STEPNEY Old colonel Dick Singleton had several state places as I have mentioned In the South the rich men who had a great deal of money bought all the plantations they could get and obtained them very cheap The Colonel had some ten or twenty places and had slaves settled on each of them He had four children and after each had received a plantation the rest were called state places and these could not be sold until all the grandchildren should become of age after they all had received places the rest could be sold One of the places was called Biglake The slaves on these places were treated more cruelly than on those where the owner lived for the overseers had full sway One day the overseer at Biglake punished the slaves so that some of them fell exhausted When he came to the two men Cyrus and Stepney they resisted but were taken by force and severely punished A few days afterwards the overseer died and those two men were taken up and hanged on the plantation without judge or jury After that another overseer was hired with orders to arm himself and every slave who did not submit to his punishment was to be shot immediately At times when the overseer was angry with a man he would strike him on the head with a club and kill him instantly and they would bury him in the field Some would run away and come to M R Singleton my master but he would only tell them to go home and behave Then they were handcuffed or chained and carried back to Biglake and when we would hear from them again the greater part would have been murdered When they were taken from master s place they would bid us good bye and say they knew they should be killed when they got home Oh who can paint the sad feeling in our minds when we saw these our own race chained and carried home to drink the bitter cup of death from their merciless oppressors with no one near to say Spare him God made him or to say Have mercy on him for Jesus died for him His companions dared not groan above a whisper for fear of sharing the same fate but thanks that the voice of the Lord was heard in the North which said Go quickly to the South and let my prison bound people go free for I have heard their cries from cotton corn and rice plantations saying how long before thou wilt come to deliver us from this chain and the Lord said to them Wait I will send you John Brown who shall be the key to the door of your liberty and I will harden the heart of Jefferson Davis your devil that I may show him and his followers my power then shall I send you Abraham Lincoln mine angel who shall lead you from the land of bondage to the land of liberty Our fathers all died in the wilderness but thank God the children reached the promised land THE WAY THE SLAVES DETECTED THIEVES AMONG THEMSELVES The slaves had three ways of detecting thieves one with a Bible one with a sieve and another with graveyard dust The first way was this four men were selected one of whom had a Bible with a string attached and each man had his own part to perform Of course this was done in the night as it was the only time they could attend to such matters as concerned themselves These four would commence at the first cabin with every man of the family and one who held the string attached to the Bible would say John or Tom whatever the person s name was you are accused of stealing a chicken or a dress from Sam at such a time then one of the other two would say John stole the chicken and another would say John did not steal the chicken They would continue their assertions for at least five minutes then the man would put a stick in the loop of the string that was attached to the Bible and holding it as still as he could one would say Bible in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost if John stole that chicken turn that is if the man had stolen what he was accused of the Bible was to turn around on the string and that would be a proof that he did steal it This was repeated three times before they left that cabin and it would take those men a month sometimes when the plantation was very large that is if they did not find the right person before they got through the whole place The second way they had of detecting thieves was very much like the first only they used a sieve instead of a Bible they stuck a pair of scissors in the sieve with a string hitched to it and a stick put through the loop of the string and the same words were used as for the Bible Sometimes the Bible and the sieve would turn upon the names of persons whose characters were beyond suspicion When this was the case they would either charge the mistake to the men who fixed the Bible and the sieve or else the man who was accused by the turning of the Bible and the sieve would say that he passed near the coop from which the fowl was stolen then they would say Bro John we see dis how dat ting work you pass by de chicken coop de same night de hen went away But when the Bible or the sieve turned on the name of one whom they knew often stole and he did not acknowledge that he had stolen the chicken of which he was accused he would have to acknowledge his previously stolen goods or that he had thought of stealing at the time when the chicken or the dress was stolen Then this examining committee would justify the turning of the Bible or sieve on the above statement of the accused person The third way of detecting thieves was taught by the fathers and mothers of the slaves They said no matter how untrue a man might have been during his life when he came to die he had to tell the truth and had to own everything he had ever done and whatever dealing those alive had with anything pertaining to the dead must be true or they would immediately die and go to hell to burn in fire and brimstone So in consequence of this the graveyard dust was the truest of the three ways in detecting thieves The dust would be taken from the grave of a person who had died last and put into a bottle with water Then two of the men of the examining committee would use the same words as in the case of the Bible and the sieve John stole that chicken John did not steal that chicken and after this had gone on for about five minutes then one of the other two who attended to the Bible and the sieve would say John you are accused of stealing that chicken that was taken from Sam s chicken coop at such a time In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost if you have taken Sam s chicken don t drink this water for if you do you will die and go to hell and be burned in fire and brimstone but if you have not you may take it and it will not hurt you So if John had taken the chicken he would own it rather than take the water Sometimes those whose characters were beyond suspicion would be proven thieves when they tried the graveyard dust and water When the right person was detected if he had any chickens he had to give four for one and if he had none he made it good by promising that he would do so no more If all the men on the plantation passed through the examination and no one was found guilty the stolen goods would be charged to strangers Of course these customs were among the negroes for their own benefit for they did not consider it stealing when they took anything from their master JOSH AND THE CORN A man engaged in stripping fodder put some green ears of corn in the fire to roast as the slaves generally do in fodder stripping time although they were whipped when caught Before the ears were roasted enough the overseer approached and Josh took the ears out with some live coals stuck to them and put them in his shirt bosom In running away his clothes took fire and Josh jumped into a creek to put it out The overseer said to him Josh what are you doing there He answered It is so warm today I taught I would go in de creek to git cool off sir Well have you got cooled off Josh Oh yes sir very much cooler sir Josh was a very hearty eater so that the peck of corn flour allowed the slaves for a week s ration lasted him only a half He used to lug large sticks of wood on his shoulders from the woods which was from a mile to a mile and a half away to first one and then another of his fellow negroes who gave him something to eat and in that way he made out his week s rations His habit was to bring the wood at night throw it down at the cabin door and as he walked in some one of the family would say Well Josh you fetched us a piece of wood He would burst into one of his jolly laughs and answer Yes Soon after they had given him something to eat Josh would bid them good night but when he went the wood disappeared too He would throw it down at another cabin door as before go in and get something to eat but every time when he went away the wood would be missing until he had found enough to eat when he would leave it at the last cabin Those to whom Josh carried the wood accused others of stealing it and when they asked him about it he only laughed and said that the wood was at the door when he came out Josh continued the trick for quite a while Finally one night he brought a stick of wood and threw it down at a cabin door walked in and got something to eat as usual But as he came in the man of the family to whom he carried the wood bade him good night and said that he had business out which would keep him so late that Josh would be gone before he got back While Josh was busy laughing and talking with the rest of the family the man went out and secreted himself in the chimney corner of another cabin and it was not long after he took his stand before Josh bade the family good night came out whistling and shouldered the wood but as he started off the watchman cried out Is that you Josh Josh threw the wood down and answered O no tisn t me Of course Josh was so funny one couldn t get angry with him if he wanted to but the rest of the slaves found out after that how the wood Josh brought them was missing But poor Josh died at last away from home he was sent with some of the other negroes from missus M R Singleton s plantation at Columbia in the year eighteen sixty four to build fortifications as a defence under general Wade Hampton against general Sherman and while there he was taken sick and died under the yoke of slavery having heard of freedom but not living to enjoy it RUNAWAY SLAVES My readers have no doubt already heard that there were men in the South who made it their business in the days of slavery to raise and train hounds especially to hunt slaves with Most of the owners hired such men on condition that they were to capture and return their runaway slaves without being bruised and torn by the dogs The average sums paid hunters were ten fifteen and twenty five dollars for capturing a slave very many times these sums were taken from the overseer s salary as they were more or less the cause of slaves running away My readers want to know whether the runaway slaves ever returned to the overseers and their masters without being caught by the hunters Sometimes they did and sometimes they never returned Some stayed their lifetime others who would have returned fell sick and died in the woods My readers ask how did the slaves at home know when their fellow negroes the runaways sickened or died in the woods In general some one on the plantation from which they ran away or confidential friends on some other plantation had communication with them so that if anything happened to them the slaves at home would find out through such parties And sometimes the masters and overseers would find out about their death but indirectly however because if it was known that any one on the plantation had dealings with the runaway he would be punished even though the information should be gladly received by the master and overseer Sometimes groups of runaway slaves of eight ten and even twenty belonging to different owners got together in the woods which made it very difficult and dangerous for slave hunters to capture those whom they were hired to hunt In such cases sometimes these runaways killed both hunters and dogs The thick forests in which they lived could not be searched on horseback neither could man or dog run in them The only chances the hunters had of catching runaway slaves were either to rout them from those thick forests or attack them when they came out in the opening to seek food Of course the runaways were mostly armed and when attacked in the forests they would fight My readers ask how had they obtained arms and what were those arms since slaves were not allowed to have deadly weapons Some had large knives made by their fellow negroes who were blacksmiths others stole guns from white men who were accustomed to lay them carelessly around when they were out hunting game The runaways who stole the guns were kept in powder and shot by some of the other slaves at home who bought such from poor white men who kept little country stores in the different parts of the South The runaway slaves generally had fathers brothers cousins or confidential friends who met them at certain appointed places and brought them such things as were needed The most they wanted from their fellow negroes at home was salt and a little corn flour for they lived principally on beef and swine meat taken either from their own masters or some other s stock My readers ask did not some of the slaves at home betray their fellow negroes the runaways to the white man I answer they did but often such were well spotted and if the runaway slaves got a chance at them while in the woods would mob or kill them On the other hand when they met those whom they could trust instead of injuring them they exchanged beef and swine meat with them for bread corn flour and salt such as they needed in the woods THE RUNAWAY SLAVES IN THE HOUSE Instead of going into the woods sometimes runaway slaves lived right around the overseer s and master s houses for months A slave named Isom ran away from Thomas Clarkson his master s son who was the overseer mister Clarkson was satisfied as he said that the unaccustomed runaway whom he thought was in the woods could not stay from home long but finding that he stayed longer than expected mister Clarkson hired a slave hunter with his dogs to hunt him The hunter came early to the plantation and took breakfast with mister Clarkson on the day they began to hunt for the runaway slave While sitting at breakfast mister Clarkson said to the hunter My father brought up that boy as a house servant and petted him so that it takes all the salt in the country to cure him Father had too much religion to keep his negroes straight but I don t believe in that I think a negro ought to be overhauled every little while to keep him in his place and that is just the reason why I took the overseership on this plantation The Hunter Well what caused your boy to run away mister Clarkson mister Clarkson Well he ran away because I gave him an overhauling to keep him in the place of a negro mister Clarkson s wife Well Thomas I told you the other day before you did it that I didn t see any need of your whipping Isom because I thought he was a good boy mister Clarkson Yes my dear if South Carolina had many more such Presbyterians as you and Father Boston he meant old mister Clarkson in a short time there would be no slaves in the state then who would you have to work for you I wish to state a fact to my readers While there were exceptions as a general thing the Presbyterians made better masters than did any other denomination among the slave holders in the South missus Clarkson Yes Thomas if you were such a Presbyterian as you charged Father Boston and me with being you could have saved yourself the trouble and money which it will cost to hunt him mister Clarkson Well we will not discuss the matter of religion any further To the hunter That boy has been away now for several days since I whipped him I thought that he would have returned home long before this time as this is the first time he has ever run away but I rather conclude that he got with some experienced runaways Now do you think that you can capture him without his being hurt or torn by your dogs missus Clarkson That is just what I am afraid will be done to that boy The Hunter O no fear of that madam I shall use care in hunting him I have but one dog which is dangerous for tearing runaway negroes I will chain him here until I capture your boy The hunter blew his horn which gathered his dogs chained the one he spoke of then he and mister Clarkson started on a chase for the runaway slave who secreted in the house had heard every word they had said about him After the hunter and mister Clarkson had gone missus Clarkson went to her room as a general thing the southern mistresses hardly ever knew what went on in their dining rooms and kitchens after meal hours and Isom the runaway slave sat at the same table and ate his breakfast After two or three days of vain search in the woods for the runaway slave mister Clarkson asked some of the other negroes on the plantation if they saw him to tell him if he came home he would not whip him Of course as a general thing when they stayed in the woods until they were captured they were whipped but they were not when they came home themselves One morning after several days of fruitless search in the woods for the runaway slave by the overseer and the hunter while at breakfast Isom came up to the door As soon as mister Clarkson learned that the runaway slave was at the door he got up from his breakfast and went out Well Isom said mister Clarkson Well Massa Thomas said Isom Where have you been said mister Clarkson I been in the woods sir answered Isom Of course it would not have been well for him to tell mister Clarkson that he was hidden and fed right in the house for it would have made it bad for the other negroes who were house servants among whom he had a brother and sister mister Clarkson Isom did you get with some other runaways Yes sir said Isom Of course Isom s answer was in keeping with the belief of mister Clarkson that he had got in with some experienced runaway in the woods How many were with you asked mister Clarkson Two answered Isom What are their names and to whom do they belong asked mister Clarkson I don t know sir said Isom Didn t you ask their names said mister Clarkson No sir said Isom Can you describe them asked mister Clarkson One is big like you and the other was little like the man who was hunting me said Isom Where did you see the hunter asked mister Clarkson In the woods sir said Isom Isom do you want something to eat asked mister Clarkson Yes sir said Isom He sent him around to the kitchen and told the cook to give him something to eat missus Clarkson thought a great deal of Isom so while he was in the kitchen eating she went in and had a long talk with him about how he got along since he had been away as they supposed As I have said in general when runaway slaves came home themselves they were not whipped but were either handcuffed or put in stocks and locked up for two or three days While Isom was eating and talking with missus Clarkson mister Clarkson appeared at the kitchen door with a pistol in one hand and handcuffs in the other missus Clarkson said What are you going to do Thomas I want Isom as soon as he is through eating said mister Clarkson You are not going to lock him up are you Thomas said missus Clarkson missus Clarkson s name was Henrietta but her pet name was Henie mister Clarkson said Henie I shan t hurt Isom Isom who had a smooth black round face full eyes white teeth was a very beautiful negro When he saw the pistol and handcuffs in mister Clarkson s hands those large eyes of his were stretched so wide one could see the white like great sheets in them missus Clarkson said Thomas please don t lock up Isom he won t run away again You won t will you Isom No mamma massie Henie I won t said Isom Yes Henie said mister Clarkson he says so but will he not Thomas said missus Clarkson I will take the responsibility if you do as I ask you to I will keep Isom around the house and will assure you that he will not run away mister Clarkson wanted to lock Isom up very much but he knew what a strong will his wife had and how hard it would be to get her right when she had got wrong hence he complied with her request So Isom worked around the house for a long time The hunter was to rest a few days and then resume his work but mister Clarkson wrote to him that his services would be no longer needed as the runaway slave whom he was employed to hunt had returned himself I never learned whether the hunter got paid for what he had done mister BLACK THE SLAVE HUNTER 
5781-52137-0000	train-other-500	There was a white man in Richland County South Carolina named mister Black who made his living by hunting runaway slaves
none	none	 I knew him as well as I did one of my fellow negroes on colonel Singleton s plantation He was of dark complexion short stature spare built with long jet black coarse hair He bore the description of what some would call a good man but he was quite the reverse he was one of the most heartless men I have ever seen mister Black was a very successful hunter although sometimes all of his bloodhounds were killed by runaway slaves and he barely escaped with his life He used to ride a small bay mare in hunting 
5781-52137-0001	train-other-500	which was the only horse he owned She was a thin raw boned creature and looked as though she could hardly walk but knew the business about as well as her master and in such troubles as above stated she used to carry him pretty fast out of danger
5781-52137-0002	train-other-500	mister Black caught several runaway slaves belonging to colonel Singleton I have known him to chase runaway slaves out of the forest right through the colonel s plantation through a crowd of other negroes and his dogs would never mistake any among the crowd
5781-52137-0003	train-other-500	for the ones they were after When these hound dogs chased the runaways through farms in that way many of them were killed and buried in the cotton or corn field by some among the crowd of negroes through which they passed
5781-52137-0004	train-other-500	In general the slaves hated bloodhounds and would kill them any time they got a chance but especially on such occasions as above stated to keep them from capturing runaways Once eight slaves ran away from colonel Singleton s plantation
5781-52137-0005	train-other-500	and mister Black with twenty five hound dogs was hired to hunt them up The dogs struck trail of the runaways late one afternoon and chased them all that night during which time they got scattered Next morning
none	none	 three of the runaways were chased through a crowd of their fellow negroes who were working in the cotton field 
5781-52137-0006	train-other-500	While chasing the runaways some among the crowd killed six of the dogs including the two leading ones
none	none	 and buried them in the cotton beds or rows as we used to call them mister Black the hunter 
5781-52137-0007	train-other-500	though a mile or more off knew that something had happened from the irregular barking of the other dogs and also because he did not hear the yelling of the two leading dogs So he blew his horn called the rest of his dogs and gave up the chase until he had replaced his leading dogs by others
5781-52137-0008	train-other-500	which he always had on hand at home Slave hunters generally had one or two among the pack of hound dogs called trailers or leaders which the others fifty or more were trained to follow So if anything happened to the leaders while on chase
5781-52137-0009	train-other-500	the rest would become confused and could not follow the runaway But if the leaders were hurt or killed after the runaways were captured the rest would surround and guard them until the hunter reached them as he was always a mile or more behind
none	none	 After the leading dogs had been replaced 
5781-52137-0010	train-other-500	mister Black resumed the chase and caught some of the runaways but the rest came home themselves The last runaway slave mister Black was hired to hunt belonged to colonel M R Singleton and was named Dick
5781-52137-0011	train-other-500	but instead of Dick he caught a slave belonging to a man in Sumterville county who had been in the woods seven years This runaway slave had another name at home but while in the woods had assumed the name of Champion
5781-52137-0012	train-other-500	for his success in keeping slave hunters from capturing him up to that time mister Black the hunter chased Dick and Champion two days and nights on the morning before the capture of the latter they swam across the Water ree river
5781-52137-0013	train-other-500	After they got across they were separated the dogs followed Champion and ran him down that morning about eleven o clock Champion had a gun and pistol as the first dog ran up and opened his mouth to take hold of him
5781-52137-0014	train-other-500	he discharged the contents of the pistol in his mouth and killed him instantly The rest of the dogs did not take hold of him but surrounded him and held him at bay until the hunter reached the spot When mister Black rode up within gunshot Champion aimed at him
5781-52137-0015	train-other-500	with a loaded double barrel gun but the caps of both barrels snapped from being wet by running through the bushes mister Black had a gun and pistol too he attempted to shoot the negro but William Turner colonel Singleton s overseer
none	none	 who hired mister Black to hunt Dick the runaway from the colonel s plantation would not let him do it mister Black then attempted to strike Champion with the breech of his gun but Champion kicked him down and as he drew his knife to stab mister Black 
5781-52137-0016	train-other-500	mister Turner the overseer struck him on the back of his head with the butt of a loaded whip This stunned him for a few moments and by the time he had regained his senses they had handcuffed him After the negro had been handcuffed
5781-52137-0017	train-other-500	mister Black wanted to abuse him because he had killed the dog and attempted to shoot him but mister Turner the overseer would not let him Champion was taken to colonel Singleton s plantation locked up in the dungeon under the overseer s house
5781-52137-0018	train-other-500	and his master was notified of his capture he was a mulatto negro and his master who was his father sent for him at colonel Singleton s plantation but I never learned whether mister Black the hunter was ever paid for capturing him
none	none	 Dick the runaway negro from colonel Singleton s place came home himself sometime after Champion his companion had been captured mister Black the slave hunter was very poor and had a large family he had a wife 
5781-52137-0019	train-other-500	with eight or ten helpless children whom I knew as well as I did my fellow negroes on the colonel s plantation But as cruel as mister Black was to runaway slaves his family was almost wholly supported by negroes I have known in some cases
5781-52137-0020	train-other-500	that they stole from their masters to help this family The negroes were so kind to mister Black s family that his wife turned against him for his cruelty to runaway slaves
none	none	 I have stated that some of the masters and overseers hired the hunters on condition that they would capture and return the runaway slaves unbruised and untorn by their dogs 
5781-52137-0021	train-other-500	while others in a mad fit of passion would say to them I want you to bring my runaway nigger home dead or alive All of the slave hunters used to practice cruelty upon the runaway slaves
5781-52137-0022	train-other-500	more especially upon those whose masters would say to hunters bring them dead or alive
none	none	 But among all the slave hunters in the part of South Carolina where the author of this work lived mister Black was the most cruel It was rumored that many of the runaway slaves that were never heard of afterward were captured and killed in the woods by mister Black but no special clue to this could be found Finally mister Black was hired to capture a runaway slave in Barnwell County S C 
5781-52137-0024	train-other-500	This slave was with another who was thought well of by his master but hated by the overseer
none	none	 In the chase the two runaways separated and the dogs followed the second instead of the one whom mister Black had been hired to hunt mister Black had another hunter with him by the name of Motley The negro killed several of the dogs 
5781-52137-0025	train-other-500	and gave Messrs Black and Motley a hard fight After the negro had been captured they killed him cut him up and gave his remains to the living dogs The companion of the murdered slave was not caught A few days after the chase
5781-52137-0026	train-other-500	while wandering around in the wood in a somewhat excited state he came to a spot where the bushes and leaves seemed to have been in a stirred up condition as though there had been tussling by two parties On looking around in this disordered spot
none	none	 he found pieces of clothing here and there in rags looking just like the suit worn by his companion who was then a victim of a most cruel death from the hands of the hunters On closer examination he saw spots of blood here and there upon the leaves which awakened his suspicion on looking a little way from this spot he saw some leaves which looked as though they had been moved by hands and put there and on removing the leaves he found that the earth had been freshly dug and filled in again 
5781-52137-0027	train-other-500	Digging down in the spot he soon discovered pieces of the person of a dead man whom he could not identify but was satisfied that it was the remains of his companion from whom he had been compelled to separate a few days before
5781-52137-0028	train-other-500	This sight frightened the runaway negro so that he left the woods went home to his master and told the story
none	none	 but as a negro s word was not to be taken against a white man s in the days of slavery no special notice was taken of what he had said Still some of the white people were secretly watching mister Black the slave hunter as he had been before suspected of killing runaway slaves in the woods 
5781-52137-0029	train-other-500	The master of the murdered negro was still ignorant of his death he was in hopes that his slave would return But finding that his slave did not return as expected the master became uneasy and offered a reward to any one
none	none	 who could give a clue of his negro 
5781-52137-0030	train-other-500	In the meantime he discharged the overseer who had been the cause of his slave running away and he also kept the overseer s salary of four hundred dollars which was the annual pay for overseering his plantation
5781-52137-0031	train-other-500	mister Black s house was in Richland county and as he was the last who had hunted runaway slaves in Barnwell county before the murder suspicion rested on him Still no one said anything to him
5781-52137-0032	train-other-500	but he was very closely watched by men of his own county whose interest was not in the hatefulness of the crime committed but rather in the reward offered by the master
none	none	 to any who could give information 
5781-52137-0033	train-other-500	of his runaway slave Sometime after the case had occurred another white man of Richland county became quite a friend to mister Black the slave hunter this apparent friendship soon led mister Black to tell the secret
5781-52137-0034	train-other-500	which speedily brought him to trial While he and his pretended friend were on a drinking spree in the midst of the merriment of course the conversation was how to control negroes as that was the principal topic of the poor white men South in the days of slavery
5781-52137-0035	train-other-500	In the conversation this friend spoke of several plans which he said if properly carried out
none	none	 would keep a nigger in his place 
5781-52137-0036	train-other-500	After the friend had said so much to mister Black the slave hunter
none	none	 the latter felt that he could tell his secret without endangering himself so he answered 
5781-52137-0037	train-other-500	The way to show a nigger that would resist a white man his place is to put him among the missing Not long since I went to Barnwell county to hunt a runaway nigger and my dogs struck trail of another instead of the one I wanted to capture
none	none	 After quite a long chase my dogs ran him down and before I reached him he killed several of them and gave me a hard fight when I got to him Motley and I were together I shot him down 
5781-52137-0038	train-other-500	and Motley and I cut him up and gave the pieces to the remainder of my dogs that is the way I put a nigger in his place After the secret had been revealed mister Black s friend excused himself
5781-52137-0039	train-other-500	and the former saw him no more until he appeared as a witness against him The companion of the murdered negro was summoned to carry the investigating party including the murderer to the spot where his companion had been buried
none	none	 mister Black was tried and found to be guilty After sentence had been passed he confessed the commission of that crime and also told that he had killed several runaway negroes previously in his own county So mister Black and Motley his companion were both hanged in Barnwell county S C 
5781-52137-0041	train-other-500	The system of slavery outlived mister Black the slave hunter just six years MANNING BROWN AND AUNT BETTY A man by the name of Manning Brown was nursed by an old colored woman he called mamma Betty
5781-52137-0042	train-other-500	She was naturally good natured and a devout Christian and mister Brown gained many of her good qualities when he was under her entire control at which time he was said to be a boy of very fine sense of feeling and quite promising But when approaching manhood
5781-52137-0043	train-other-500	mister Brown fell among a class of other white men who in the days of slavery were unbridled in their habits With this class of men he began to drink and step by step in this rapid stride he soon became a confirmed drunkard
none	none	 This habit so over coated the good influence he had gained from the colored woman that it rendered him dangerous not only to his enemies but also to his friends Manning Brown was feared by most of the other white men in Richland county S C 
5781-52137-0045	train-other-500	and strange to say although he was dangerous to white men yet he never lost the respect he had for colored people in his boyhood days He ate drank and slept among colored people after he was a grown man
5781-52137-0046	train-other-500	and in many cases when other white men who were called patrols caught colored people away from home without tickets and were about to whip them mister Brown would ride up and say The first man who raises a whip at one of those negroes I will blow his brains out
none	none	 Knowing that he would shoot a man as quick as he would a bird even if ten patrols were together when mister Brown made such threats they never would attempt to whip the negroes mister Brown owned a plantation with forty slaves on it his good treatment of them enabled him to get more work out of them than most owners got out of their slaves His slaves thought so much of their Massa Manning as they used to call him that they did everything in their power to please him But while he was so good to colored people 
5781-52137-0047	train-other-500	he was dangerous to many of the white people and feared by them A man by the name of Peter Gafney fought a duel with his brother in law
none	none	 whose name was doctor Kay the former who was quite a marksman was killed by the latter who was considered a very poor one This led many who were in favor of mister Gafney to feel that there had been foul play by doctor Ray the contestant 
5781-52137-0048	train-other-500	mister Brown who acted as a second for mister Gafney in the fight felt the loss of his old friend very deeply A short time after this he sent a challenge to doctor Ray stating
none	none	 You may either meet me at a certain time 
5781-52137-0049	train-other-500	on the spot where you killed P T Gafney for a duel or I will shoot you on first sight wherever I meet you Yours M Brown
5781-52137-0050	train-other-500	But doctor Ray refused in the face of the threat to accept the challenge Knowing the disposition of mister Brown the people in that county were inflamed with excitement because the doctor was liable at any moment while riding in the road to be killed
none	none	 In fear of meeting mister Brown 
5781-52137-0051	train-other-500	the doctor gave up visiting the most of his sick patients and almost wholly confined himself to his large plantation At the same time mister Brown was closely watched by his friends to keep him from waylaying the doctor
5781-52137-0052	train-other-500	A short time after this threat mister Brown commenced to drink harder than ever so that at times he did not know his own family But the providence of God was slowly leading mister Brown through the unknown paths to a sudden change of life
5781-52137-0053	train-other-500	as we shall soon see mister Brown s family consisted of a wife one child and Aunt Betty the old colored woman who had brought him up She was the only mother he knew for his own mother had died when he was an infant
5781-52137-0054	train-other-500	and her dying request had been that mamma Betty the old woman should bring up this boy who was an only child
none	none	 and when mister Brown got married he took Aunt Betty into his family and told her she need not do any work 
5781-52137-0055	train-other-500	only what she chose to do and that he would take care of her the balance of her days And missus Brown regarded Aunt Betty more as a mother in law than as a negress servant Sometimes when mister Brown would not listen to his wife he would to his mamma Betty
none	none	 when he was sober enough to know her One afternoon while mister Brown was in one of those drunken fits 
5781-52137-0056	train-other-500	he went into his bedroom and lay down across the bed talking to himself His wife went in to speak to him but as she entered he jumped up and got his loaded double barrelled gun and threatened to shoot her Frightened at this she ran out of the room and screamed saying
none	none	 Oh my God mamma Betty please go in and speak to your Massa Manning 
5781-52137-0057	train-other-500	for he threatened to shoot me With that old familiar confidence in one who had often listened to her advice Aunt Betty went into the house and to the room where she found mister Brown lying across the bed with the gun by his side On entering the room
none	none	 as she was advancing toward the bed she said Massa Manning what is the matter with you You naughty boy what is the matter On saying these words before she had reached the bed mister Brown rose with the gun in hand and discharged the contents of both barrels at the old woman 
5781-52137-0058	train-other-500	she dropped instantly to the floor mister Brown lay across the bed as before with the gun by his side talking to himself and soon dropped to sleep missus Brown fainted away several times under the excitement Aunt Betty lived about an hour
none	none	 Soon after she had been shot she wanted to see mister Brown but when told that she could not she said 
5781-52137-0059	train-other-500	O my Lord I wanted to see my child before I die and I know that he would want to see his mamma Betty too before she leaves him
5781-52137-0060	train-other-500	During the time she lived she prayed for mister Brown and requested that he would change his course of life become a Christian and meet her in heaven After singing one of her familiar hymns Aunt Betty said to some one who stood by her bedside
none	none	 I want you to tell Massa Manning that he must not feel bad for what he did to me because I know that if he was in his right mind he would not hurt me any more than he would himself Tell him that I have prayed to the Lord for him that he may be a good boy and I want him to promise that he will be a Christian and meet me in heaven With these words Aunt Betty became speechless dying a few moments afterwards The doctor was sent for but had to come from such a distance 
5781-52137-0061	train-other-500	that she died before he reached there When mister Brown awoke from his drunken state in the night and learned the sad news of Aunt Betty s death of which he had been the cause he clasped his hands and cried out What is it possible that my mamma Betty
none	none	 the only mother I ever knew was killed by my hands He ran into the room where the corpse was and clasped the remains of the old negress in his arms and cried Mamma Betty mamma Betty please speak to me as you used to 
5781-52137-0062	train-other-500	But that voice was hushed in death
none	none	 The doctor overseer and others tried to quiet him but they could not 
5781-52137-0063	train-other-500	That night mister Brown took the train to Columbia the capital of South Carolina and gave himself up to the law next day He was told that it was all right that the old negress was his slave But mister Brown was dissatisfied
5781-52137-0064	train-other-500	he came back home and invited all the white neighbors and slaves to Aunt Betty s funeral in which he and his family took part After the excitement was over the message of Aunt Betty was delivered to mister Brown
5781-52137-0065	train-other-500	he was told that her last request had been that he would meet her in heaven He answered I will mister Brown then and there took an oath that he would drink no more strong drinks He then disposed of his slaves
none	none	 but how I did not learn Soon after this he was converted and became one of the ablest preachers in Richland county S C mister Brown s conversion freed doctor Ray from his threat The doctor was so glad of this that he paid quite a large sum towards mister Brown s salary for preaching CHAPTER III MY EXPERIENCE IN THE CIVIL WAR My knowledge of the Civil War extends from the time when the first gun was fired on Fort Sumter in April eighteen sixty one to the close of the War While the slaves were not pressed into the Confederate service as soldiers yet they were used in all the slave holding states at war points not only to build fortifications but also to work on vessels used in the war The slaves were gathered in each state anywhere from six thousand to eight thousand or more from different plantations carried to some centre and sent to various war points in the state It would be impossible to describe the intense excitement which prevailed among the Confederates in their united efforts to raise troops to meet the Union forces They were loud in their expressions of the certainty of victory Many of the poor white men were encouraged by the promise of from three to five negroes to each man who would serve in the Confederate service when the Confederate government should have gained the victory On the other hand the negroes were threatened with an increase of the galling yoke of slavery These threats were made with significant expressions and the strongest assumption that the negro was the direct cause of the war HOW SLAVES WERE GATHERED AND CARRIED TO WAR POINTS No sooner had the war commenced in the spring of eighteen sixty one than the slaves were gathered from the various plantations and shipped by freight cars or boats to some centre and apportioned out and sent to work at different war points I do not know just how many slaves the Confederate Government required each master to furnish for its service but I know that fifteen of the four hundred sixty five slaves on my master s colonel M E Singleton s plantation were sent to work on fortifications each year during the war The war had been going on two years before my turn came In the summer of eighteen sixty three with thousands of other negroes gathered from the various parts of the state I was freighted to the city of Charleston South Carolina and the group in which my lot fell was sent to Sullivan s Island We were taken on a boat from the city of Charleston and landed in a little village situated nearly opposite Fort Sumter on this island Leaving behind us Fort Moultrie Fort Beauregard and several small batteries we marched down the white sandy beach of the island below Fort Marshall to the very extreme point where a little inlet of water divides Sullivan s from Long Island and here we were quartered under captain Charles Haskell From this point on the island turning our faces northward with Morris Island northwest of us and looking directly north out into the channel we saw a number of Union gun boats like a flock of black sheep feeding on a plain of grass while the men pacing their decks looked like faithful shepherds watching the flock While we negroes remained upon Sullivan s Island we watched every movement of the Union fleet with hearts of joy to think that they were a part of the means by which the liberty of four and one half millions of slaves was to be effected in accordance with the emancipation proclamation made the January preceding We kept such close watch upon them that some one among us whether it was night or day would be sure to see the discharge of a shot from the gun boat before the sound of the report was heard During that summer there was no engagement between the Union fleet and the Confederates at that point in South Carolina The Union gun boats however fired occasional shots over us six miles into the city of Charleston They also fired a few shells into a marsh between Sullivan s Island and Mount Pleasant but with no damage to us WHAT WORK THE NEGROES DID ON THE ISLAND After we had reached the island our company was divided One part was quartered at one end of the Island around Fort Moultrie and we were quartered at the other end at Fort Marshall Our work was to repair forts build batteries mount guns and arrange them While the men were engaged at such work the boys of my age namely thirteen and some older waited on officers and carried water for the men at work and in general acted as messengers between different points on the island ENGAGEMENT ON LONG ISLAND Though there was no fighting on Sullivan s Island during my stay there Confederate soldiers at times crossed the inlet from Sullivan s to Long Island in the night and engaged in skirmishes with Union soldiers who had entered the upper end of that island and camped there Whether these Confederate scouts were ever successful in routing the Union forces on the island or not I have never learned but I know that they were several times repulsed with considerable loss NEGROES ESCAPE The way the Confederates came to the knowledge that Union soldiers were on Long Island was that the group of negroes who preceded us on Sullivan s Island had found out that Union soldiers were camping on the upper end of Long Island So one night quite a number of them escaped by swimming across the inlet that divides Sullivan s Island and Long Island and succeeded in reaching the Union line The next day it was discovered that they had swam across the inlet and the following night they were pursued by a number of Confederate scouts who crossed in a flat boat Instead of the capture of the negroes who would have been victims of the most cruel death the Confederate scouts were met by soldiers from the Union line and after a hot engagement they were repulsed as they usually were BUILDING A BATTERY ON LONG ISLAND Finally the Confederates took a large number of the group of which I was a member from Sullivan s to the south shore of Long Island and there built a battery and mounted several small field guns upon it As they were afraid of being discovered in the daytime we were obliged to work on the battery nights and were taken back to Sullivan s in the morning until the work was completed We were guarded by Confederate soldiers while building the battery as without a guard it would have been easy for any of us to have reached the Union line on the north end of Long Island Sullivan s Island was about five miles long A NEGRO SERVANT MURDERED One of the most heartless deeds committed while I was on Sullivan s Island was that of the murder of a negro boy by his master a Confederate officer to whom the boy had been a body servant What the rank of this officer was I am not sure but I think he was a Major and that he was from the state of Georgia It was a common thing for southern men to carry dirks especially during the war This officer had one and for something the boy displeased him in he drew the knife and made a fatal stab between the boy s collar bone and left shoulder As the victim fell at the brutal master s feet we negroes who had witnessed the fiendish and cowardly act upon a helpless member of our race expected an immediate interference from the hand of justice in some form or other But we looked and waited in vain for the horrible deed did not seem to have changed the manner of those in authority in the least but they rather treated it as coolly as though nothing had happened Finding that the Confederates failed to lay the hand of justice upon the officer we with our vague ideas of moral justice and with our extreme confidence that God would somehow do more for the oppressed negroes than he would ordinarily for any other people anxiously waited a short time for some token of Divine vengeance but as we found that no such token as we desired in the heat of our passion came we finally concluded to wait God s way and time as to how and when this as every other wrong act should be visited with his unfailing justice But aside from this case we fared better on these fortifications than we had at home on the plantations This was the case at least with those of us who were on Sullivan s Island Our work in general on the fortifications was not hard we had a great deal of spare time and although we knew that our work in the Confederate service was against our liberty yet we were delighted to be in military service We felt an exalted pride that having spent a little time at these war points we had gained some knowledge which would put us beyond our fellow negroes at home on the plantations while they would increase our pride by crediting us with far more knowledge than it was possible for us to have gained Our daily rations from the Commissary was a quart of rice or hard tack and a half pound of salt pork or corn beef The change from the cabins and from the labor on the old plantations so filled our cup of joy that we were sorry when the two months of our stay on the island was ended At the end of about two months I with the rest of my fellow negroes of that group was sent back to the plantation again while others took our places MY EXPERIENCE IN FORT SUMTER In the summer of eighteen sixty four when I was in my fourteenth year another call was made for negro laborers for the Confederate government and fifteen from our plantation including myself with thousands from other plantations were sent down to Charleston again There the negroes were apportioned in groups to be sent to the different fortifications My lot fell among the group of three hundred and sixty who were assigned to Fort Sumter I shall never forget with what care they had to move in carrying us in a steamer from the government wharf in Charleston to John s island wharf on account of the network of torpedo mines in Charleston Harbor From John s island wharf they carried us in rowboats to Fort Sumter and as those boats could not carry many it took all night to convey us with other freightage to Fort Sumter The steamer which carried us from Charleston to John s island wharf had to run at night Indeed every move the Confederates made about there near the close of the war had to be made at night because the Yankees on gunboats outside the channel and those on Morris island kept so close a watch it was very dangerous to convey us from John s island wharf to Fort Sumter because the oars dipping into the salt water at night made sparks like fire and thus the Yankees on Morris island were able to see us Indeed their shots oftentimes took effect Many of the negroes were killed Of the fifteen from our plantation one boy of about my age was struck by a parrot shell while climbing from the boat into the fort We were told of the perils we were to meet both before and after we reached our destination For one of the most disheartening things was the sad report of the survivors of those whose places we were to fill As the rowboats left them on John s island wharf and as we were about to embark they told us of the great danger to which we would be exposed of the liability of some of us being killed before we reached the fort which proved true and of how fast their comrades were killed in Fort Sumter A number it was said died from fright before reaching Sumter THE OFFICERS AND QUARTERS The officers who were then in command of the fort were captain J C Mitchell and Major John Johnson The name of the overseer in charge of the negroes in the fort was Deburgh whether that was his right name I can not say Deburgh was a foreigner by birth He was one of the most cruel men I ever knew As he and his atrocious deeds will come up later in this history I will say no more of him here CONDITION OF THE FORT Fort Sumter which previous to this had not only been silenced by the Union forces but also partly demolished had but one gun mounted on it on the west side That cannon we used to call the Sundown Gun because it was fired every evening as the sun went down as well as at sunrise On this west side the Confederate officers and soldiers were sheltered in the bomb proof safe during bombardment On the east side of the fort facing Morris island opposite Fort Wagner there was another apartment called the Rat hole in which we negroes were quartered WHAT THE NEGROES DID IN FORT SUMTER Fort Sumter had been so badly damaged by the Union forces in eighteen sixty three that unless something had been done upon the top the continued bombardment which it suffered up to the close of the war would have rendered it uninhabitable The fort was being fired upon every five minutes with mortar and parrot shells by the Yankees from Morris Island The principal work of the negroes was to secure the top and other parts against the damage from the Union guns Large timbers were put on the rampart of the fort and boards laid on them then baskets without bottoms about two feet wide and four feet high were put close together on the rampart and filled with sand by the negroes The work could only be done at night because besides the bombardment from Fort Wagner which was about a mile or little less from us there were also sharp shooters there who picked men off whenever they showed their heads on the rampart The mortar and parrot shells rained alternately upon Fort Sumter every five minutes day and night but the sharp shooters could only fire by day light The negroes were principally exposed to the bombardment The only time the few Confederate soldiers were exposed to danger was while they were putting the Chevaldefrise on the parapet at night The Chevaldefrise is a piece of timber with wooden spikes pointed with iron and used for defence on fortifications In the late war between the Spaniards and the Americans the former used barbed wire for the same purpose If my readers could have been in Fort Sumter in the summer of eighteen sixty four they would have heard the sentinel cry every five minutes Look out Mortar Then they would have seen the negroes running about in the fort yard in a confused state seeking places of safety from the missile sure to bring death to one or more of them Another five minutes and again the cry of the sentinel Look out means a parrot shell which is far more deadly than is the mortar because it comes so quickly that one has no chance to seek a place of safety The next moment the survivors of us expecting that it would be our turn next would be picking up here and there parts of the severed bodies of our fellow negroes many of those bodies so mutilated as not to be recognizable DEBURGH THE OVERSEER Deburgh the overseer of whom I have spoken was a small man of light complexion and very light hair If my readers could have been in Fort Sumter in July eighteen sixty four they would have seen Deburgh with a small bar of iron or a piece of shell in his hand forcing the surviving portion of the negroes back into line and adding to these other negroes kept in the Rat hole as reserves to fill the places of those who were killed and wounded They would also have heard him swearing at the top of his voice while forcing the negroes to rearrange themselves in line from the base of the fort to the top This arrangement of the negroes enabled them to sling to each other the bags of sand which was put in the baskets on the top of the fort My readers ask what was the sand put on the fort for It was to smother the fuses of such shells as reached the ramparts before bursting After the bombardment of Port Sumter in eighteen sixty three by the Union forces its top of fourteen or sixteen feet in thickness built of New Hampshire granite was left bare From that time all through eighteen sixty four the shells were so aimed as to burst right over the fort and it was pieces of these shells which flew in every direction that were so destructive The fuses of many of these shells fired on Port Sumter did not burn in time to cause the shells to burst before falling Now as the shells fell on the rampart of the fort instead of falling and bursting on the stone they buried themselves harmlessly in the sand which put out the fuse and also kept them from bursting But while the destruction of life was lessened by the sand it was fully made up by the hand of that brute the overseer God only knows how many negroes he killed in Port Sumter under the shadow of night Every one he reached while forcing the slaves back into working position after they had been scattered by the shells he would strike on the head with the piece of iron he carried in his hand and as his victim fell would cry out to some other negro Put that fellow in his box meaning his coffin Whether the superior officers in Fort Sumter knew that Deburgh was killing the negroes off almost as fast as the shells from Fort Wagner or whether they did not know and did not care I never have learned But I have every reason to believe that one of them at least namely Major John Johnson would not have allowed such a wholesale slaughter had he known On the other hand I believe that captain J C Mitchell was not only mean enough to have allowed it but that he was fully as heartless himself Whatever became of Deburgh whether he was killed in Fort Sumter or not I never knew OUR SUPERIOR OFFICERS The two officers in command of Fort Sumter in July of eighteen sixty four were captain J C Mitchell and Major John Johnson Major Johnson was as kind gentle and humane to the negroes as could have been expected On the other hand the actions of captain Mitchell were harsh and very cruel He had a bitter hatred toward the Yankees and during the rain of shells on Fort Sumter he sought every opportunity to expose the negroes to as much danger as he dared I remember that one night captain Mitchell ordered us outside of Fort Sumter to a projection of the stone bed upon which the Fort was built right in front of Fort Wagner At that place we were in far greater danger from the deadly missiles of the Union forces than we were exposed to on the inside of Sumter and I could see no other reasons for his ordering us outside of the fort that night than that we might be killed off faster It seems that during the incessant firing on Fort Sumter the officers held a consultation as to whether it was not best to evacuate the fort It was at this time that it was rumored a rumor that we had every reason to believe that captain Mitchell plotted to lock us negroes up in our quarters in Sumter known as the Rat hole and put powder to it and arrange it so that both the negroes and the Yankees should be blown up when the latter should have taken possession after the evacuation of the fort by the Confederates But we learned that Major John Johnson who has since become an Episcopal minister in Charleston S C wholly refused to agree with captain Mitchell in such a barbarous and cowardly act and as though Providence were watching over the innocent and oppressed negroes and over the Yankees as well because they were fighting in a righteous cause captain Mitchell s career and further chances of carrying out his cruel intentions were cut short He was mortally wounded by the sharp shooters of Fort Wagner on the fourteenth of July eighteen sixty four and died four hours afterwards OUR RATIONS IN SUMTER The working forces of negroes in Sumter with the exception of the boys who carried messages to the different parts of the fort day and night were locked up days and turned out nights to work We drew our rations of hard tack and salt pork twice a day mornings when we ceased work and turned in for the day and again between three and four o clock in the afternoon so as to have supper eaten in time to go to work at dark We often ate our salt pork raw with the hard tack as there were no special means of cooking in the negroes apartment We were not only in danger while at work from the continued rain of shells but oftentimes when we were put in line to draw our rations some of us were killed or wounded I cannot say how they got fresh water in Fort Sumter as I do not remember seeing any brought there in boats neither did I notice any conveniences there for the catching of rain water The water we negroes used was kept in large hogsheads with coal tar in them I do not know what the tar was put in the water for unless it was for our health The rat hole into which we were locked was like a sweat box it was so hot and close that although we were exposed to death by shells when we were turned out to work we were glad to get into the fresh air We had little cups in which they used to give us whiskey mornings when we went in and again when we were going out to work at night I don t know how many of the forty survivors of the three hundred and sixty of us who were carried into the Fort in the summer of eighteen sixty four besides myself are still alive But if there are any with the keen tenderness of a negro they cannot help joining me in an undying sense of gratitude to Major John Johnson not only for his kind and gentle dealings with us which meant so much to a negro in the days of slavery but also for his humane protection which saved us from some of the danger from shells to which we were exposed in Sumter A short time after captain J C Mitchell had been killed Major Johnson was dangerously wounded in the head by a piece of shell MY LAST NIGHT IN FORT SUMTER AND THE GLORIOUS END OF THE WAR During the time we spent in Fort Sumter we had not seen a clear day or night In harmony with the continual danger by which we were surrounded the very atmosphere wore the pall of death for it was always rainy and cloudy The mutilated bodies of the negroes mingled with the black mud and water in the fort yard added to the awfulness of the scene Pieces of bombshells and other pieces of iron and also large southern pine timbers were scattered all over the yard of the fort There was also a little lime house in the middle of the yard into which we were warned not to go when seeking places of safety from the deadly missiles at the cry of the sentinel The orders were that we should get as near the centre of the fort yard as possible and lie down The reason for this was that the shells which were fired upon Sumter were so measured that they would burst in the air and the pieces would generally fly toward the sides of the fort But the orders were not strictly carried out because at the warning cries of the sentinel we became confused That night at the cry of the sentinel I ran and lay down on one of the large southern pine timbers and several of my fellow negroes followed and piled in upon me Their weight was so heavy that I cried out as for life The sense of that crush I feel at certain times even now At the next report of a shell I ran toward the lime house but some one tripped me up and by the time I had got to my feet again twelve or thirteen others were crowded into it Another negro and I reached the doorway but we were not more than there before a mortar shell came crushing down upon the little lime house and all within were so mangled that their bodies were not recognizable Only we two were saved My companion had one of his legs broken and a piece of shell had wounded me over my right eye and cut open my under lip At the moment I was wounded I was not unconscious but I did not know what had hurt me I became almost blind from the effect of my wounds but not directly after I was wounded and I felt no pain for a day or so With other wounded I was taken to the bombproof in the fort I shall never forget this first and last visit to the hospital department To witness the rough handling of the wounded patients to see them thrown on a table as one would a piece of beef and to see the doctor use his knife and saw cutting off a leg or arm and sometimes both with as much indifference as if he were simply cutting up beef and to hear the doctor say of almost every other one of these victims after a leg or an arm was amputated Put that fellow in his box meaning his coffin was an awful experience After the surgeon had asked to whom I belonged he dressed my wounds My readers will remember that I stated that no big boat could run to Fort Sumter at that time on account of the bombardment We had to be conveyed back to John s Island wharf in rowboats which was the nearest distance a steamer could go to Fort Sumter As one of those rowboats was pushed out to take the dead and wounded from the fort and as the for men were put into the boat which was generally done before they put in the latter fortunately just before the wounded were put in a Parrott shell was fired into it from Fort Wagner by the Union forces which sunk both the boat and the coffins with their remains My readers would ask how the Confederates disposed of the negroes who were killed in Fort Sumter Those who were not too badly mutilated were sent over to the city of Charleston and were buried in a place which was set apart to bury the negroes But others who were so badly cut up by shells were put into boxes with pieces of iron in them and carried out a little away from Sumter and thrown overboard I was then taken to John s Island wharf and from there to the city of Charleston in a steamer and carried to Doctor Rag s hospital where I stopped until September Then I was sent back home to my master s plantation Quoting the exact words of Major John Johnson a Confederate officer under whom I was a part of the time at the above named place I would say July seventh Fort Sumter s third great bombardment lasting sixty days and nights with a total of fourteen thousand six hundred sixty six rounds fired at the fort with eighty one casualties WHAT TOOK PLACE AFTER I said that after I got well enough to travel I was sent back home to my master s plantation about a hundred miles from the city of Charleston in central South Carolina This was in September of eighteen sixty four and I with the rest of my fellow negroes on this extensive plantation and with other slaves all over the South were held in suspense waiting the final outcome of the emancipation proclamation issued January eighteen sixty three but as the war continued it had not taken effect until the spring of eighteen sixty five Here I had less work than before the war for the nearer the war approached its close the less the slaves had to do as the masters were at the end of their wits what to do In the latter part of eighteen sixty four general Sherman with his army of a hundred thousand men and almost as many stragglers covered the space of about sixty miles in width while marching from Georgia through South Carolina The army camped around Columbia the capital of South Carolina for a short time Early in the spring of eighteen sixty five the commissary building first took fire which soon spread to such extent that the whole city of Columbia was consumed just a few houses on the suburbs were left The commissary building was set on fire by one of the two parties but it was never fully settled whether it was done by general Sherman s men or by the Confederates who might have as surmised by some as they had to evacuate the city set it on fire to keep general Sherman s men from getting the food After this Columbia was occupied by a portion of Sherman s men while the others marched on toward North Carolina THE GLORIOUS END In closing this brief sketch of my experiences in the war I would ask my readers to go back of the war a little with me I want to show them a few of the dark pictures of the slave system Hark I hear the clanking of the ploughman s chains in the fields I hear the tramping of the feet of the hoe hands I hear the coarse and harsh voice of the negro driver and the shrill voice of the white overseer swearing at the slaves I hear the swash of the lash upon the backs of the unfortunates I hear them crying for mercy from the merciless Amidst these cruelties I hear the fathers and mothers pour out their souls in prayer O Lord how long and their cries not only awaken the sympathy of their white brothers and sisters of the North but also mightily trouble the slave masters of the South The firing on Fort Sumter in April of eighteen sixty one brought hope to the slaves that the long looked for year of jubilee was near at hand And though the South won victory after victory and the Union reeled to and fro like a drunken man the negroes never lost hope but faithfully supported the Union cause with their prayers Thank God where Christianity exists slavery cannot exist At last came freedom And what joy it brought I am now standing in imagination on a high place just outside the city of Columbia in the spring of eighteen sixty five The stars and stripes float in the air The sun is just making its appearance from behind the hills and throwing its beautiful light upon green bush and tree The mocking birds and jay birds sing this morning more sweetly than ever before Beneath the flag of liberty there is congregated a perfect network of the emancipated slaves from the different plantations their swarthy faces from a distance looking like the smooth water of a black sea Their voices like distant thunder rend the air Old master gone away and the darkies all at home There must be now the kingdom come and the year of jubilee The old men and women bent over by reason of age and servitude
