none	none	What you just read in that magazine which seems to cause you so much excitement Well it may be a joke and yet the professor seems very much in earnest about it replied Tom It certainly is one wonderful story So you said before Come on the fillium is busted Splice it or else put in a new reel and on with the show I d like to know what s doing What professor are you talking of Professor Swyington Bumper Swyington Bumper and Ned s voice showed that his memory was a bit hazy Yes You ought to remember him He was on the steamer when I went down to Peru to help the Titus Brothers dig the big tunnel That plotter Waddington or some of his tools dropped a bomb where it might have done us some injury but Professor Bumper who was a fellow passenger on his way to South America to look for the lost city of Pelone calmly picked up the bomb plucked out the fuse and saved us from bad injuries if not death And he was as cool about it as an ice cream cone Surely you remember Swyington Bumper Oh yes now I remember him said Ned Newton But what has he got to do with a wonderful story Has he written more about the lost city of Pelone If he has I don t see anything so very wonderful in that There isn t agreed Tom But this isn t that and Tom picked up the magazine and leafed it to find the article he had been reading Let s have a look at it suggested Ned You act as though you might be vitally interested in it Maybe you re thinking of joining forces with the professor again as you did when you dug the big tunnel Oh no I haven t any such idea Tom said I ve got enough work laid out now to keep me in Shopton for the next year I have no notion of going anywhere with Professor Bumper Yet I can t help being impressed by this and having found the article in the magazine to which he referred he handed it to his chum Why it s by Bumper himself exclaimed Ned Yes Though there s nothing remarkable in that seeing that he is constantly contributing articles to various publications or writing books It s the story itself that s so wonderful To save you the trouble of wading through a lot of scientific detail which I know you don t care about I ll tell you that the story is about a queer idol of solid gold weighing many pounds and in consequence of great value Of solid gold you say asked Ned eagerly That s it Got on your banking air already Tom laughed To sum it up for you notice I use the word sum which is very appropriate for a bank the professor has got on the track of another lost or hidden city This one the name of which doesn t appear is in the Copan valley of Honduras and Copan interrupted Ned It sounds like the name of some new floor varnish Well it isn t though it might be laughed Tom Copan is a city in the Department of Copan near the boundary between Honduras and Guatemala A fact I learned from the article and not because I remembered my geography I was going to say remarked Ned with a smile that you were coming it rather strong on the school book stuff Oh it s all plainly written down there and Tom waved toward the magazine at which Ned was looking As you ll see if you take the trouble to go through it as I did Copan is or maybe was for all I know one of the most important centers of the Mayan civilization What s Mayan asked Ned You see I m going to imbibe my information by the deductive rather than the excavative process he added with a laugh I see laughed Tom Well Mayan refers to the Mayas an aboriginal people of Yucatan The Mayas had a peculiar civilization of their own thousands of years ago and their calendar system was so involved Never mind about dates again interrupted Ned Get down to brass tacks I m willing to take your word for it that there s a Copan valley in Honduras But what has your friend Professor Bumper to do with it This He has come across some old manuscripts or ancient document records referring to this valley and they state according to this article he has written for the magazine that somewhere in the valley is a wonderful city traces of which have been found twenty to forty feet below the surface on which great trees are growing showing that the city was covered hundreds if not thousands of years ago But where does the idol of gold come in I m coming to that said Tom Though if Professor Bumper has his way the idol will be coming out instead of coming in You mean he wants to get it and take it away from the Copan valley Tom That s it Ned It has great value not only from the amount of pure gold that is in it but as an antique I fancy the professor is more interested in that aspect of it But he s written a wonderful story telling how he happened to come across the ancient manuscripts in the tomb of some old Indian whose mummy he unearthed on a trip to Central America Then he tells of the trouble he had in discovering how to solve the key to the translation code but when he did he found a great story unfolded to him This story has to do with the hidden city and tells of the ancient civilization of those who lived in the Copan valley thousands of years ago The people held this idol of gold to be their greatest treasure and they put to death many of other tribes who sought to steal it Whew whistled Ned That IS some yarn But what is Professor Bumper going to do about it I don t know The article seems to be written with an idea of interesting scientists and research societies so that they will raise money to conduct a searching expedition Perhaps by this time the party may be organized this magazine is several months old I have been so busy on my stabilizer patent that I haven t kept up with current literature Take it home and read it Ned That is if you re through telling me about my affairs for Ned who had formerly worked in the Shopton bank had recently been made general financial manager of the interests of Tom and his father The two were inventors and proverbially poor business men though they had amassed a fortune Your financial affairs are all right Tom said Ned I have just been going over the books and I ll submit a detailed report later The telephone bell rang and Tom picked up the instrument from the desk As he answered in the usual way and then listened a moment a strange look came over his face Well this certainly is wonderful he exclaimed in much the same manner as when he had finished reading the article about the idol It certainly is a strange coincidence he added speaking in an aside to Ned while he himself still listened to what was being told to him over the telephone wire CHAPTER II PROFESSOR BUMPER ARRIVES What s the matter Tom
207_143321_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 What is it 
none	none	asked Ned Newton attracted by the strange manner of his chum at the telephone Has anything happened But the young inventor was too busy listening to the unseen speaker to answer his chum even if he heard what Ned remarked which is doubtful Well I might as well wait until he is through mused Ned as he started to leave the room Then as Tom motioned to him to remain he murmured He may have something to say to me later But I wonder who is talking to him There was no way of finding out however until Tom had a chance to talk to Ned and at present the young scientist was eagerly listening to what came over the wire Occasionally Ned could hear him say You don t tell me That is surprising Yes yes Of course if it s true it means a big thing I can understand that What s that No I couldn t make a promise like that I m sorry but Then the person at the other end of the wire must have plunged into something very interesting and absorbing for Tom did not again interrupt by interjected remarks Tom Swift as has been said was an inventor as was his father mister Swift was now rather old and feeble taking only a nominal part in the activities of the firm made up of himself and his son But his inventions were still used many of them being vital to the business and trade of this country Tom and his father lived in the village of Shopton New York and their factories covered many acres of ground Those who wish to read of the earliest activities of Tom in the inventive line are referred to the initial volume Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle From then on he and his father had many and exciting adventures In a motor boat an airship and a submarine respectively the young inventor had gone through many perils On some of the trips his chum Ned Newton accompanied him and very often in the party was a mister Wakefield Damon who had a curious habit of blessing everything that happened to strike his fancy Besides Tom and his father the Swift household was made up of Eradicate Sampson a colored man of all work who with his mule Boomerang did what he could to keep the grounds around the house in order There was also missus Baggert the housekeeper Tom s mother being dead mister Damon living in a neighboring town was a frequent visitor in the Swift home Mary Nestor a girl of Shopton might also be mentioned She and Tom were more than just good friends Tom had an idea that some day But there I promised not to tell that part at least until the young people themselves were ready to have a certain fact announced From one activity to another had Tom Swift gone now constructing some important invention for himself as among others when he made the photo telephone or developed a great searchlight which he presented to the Government for use in detecting smugglers on the border The book immediately preceding this is called Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel and deals with the efforts of the young inventor to help a firm of contractors penetrate a mountain in Peru How this was done and how incidentally the lost city of Pelone was discovered bringing joy to the heart of Professor Swyington Bumper will be found fully set forth in the book Tom had been back from the Peru trip for some months when we again find him interested in some of the work of Professor Bumper as set forth in the magazine mentioned Well he certainly is having some conversation reflected Ned as after more than five minutes Tom s ear was still at the receiver of the instrument into the transmitter of which he had said only a few words All right Tom finally answered as he hung the receiver up I ll be here and then he turned to Ned whose curiosity had been growing with the telephone talk and remarked That certainly was wonderful What was asked Ned Do you think I m a mind reader to be able to guess No indeed I beg your pardon I ll tell you at once But I couldn t break away It was too important To whom do you think I was talking just then I can imagine almost any one seeing I know something of what you have done It might be almost anybody from some person you met up in the caves of ice to a red pygmy from the wilds of Africa I m afraid neither of them would be quite up to telephone talk yet laughed Tom No this was the gentleman who wrote that interesting article about the idol of gold and he motioned to the magazine Ned held in his hand You don t mean Professor Bumper That s just whom I do mean What did he want Where did he call from He wants me to help organize an expedition to go to Central America to the Copan valley to be exact to look for this somewhat mythical idol of gold Incidentally the professor will gather in any other antiques of more or less value if he can find any and he hopes even if he doesn t find the idol to get enough historical material for half a dozen books to say nothing of magazine articles Where did he call from did you say I didn t say But it was a long distance call from New York The Professor stopped off there on his way from Boston where he has been lecturing before some society And now he s coming here to see me finished Tom What Is he going to lecture here cried Ned If he is and spouts a whole lot of that bone dry stuff about the ancient Mayan civilization and their antiquities with side lights on how the old time Indians used to scalp their enemies I m going to the moving pictures I m willing to be your financial manager Tom Swift but please don t ask me to be a high brow I wasn t built for that Nor I Ned The professor isn t going to lecture He s only going to talk he says What about He s going to try to induce me to join his expedition to the Copan valley Do you feel inclined to go No Ned I do not I ve got too many other irons in the fire I shall have to give the professor a polite but firm refusal Well maybe you re right Tom and yet that idol of gold GOLD weighing how many pounds did you say Oh you re thinking of its money value Ned old man Yes I d like to see what a big chunk of gold like that would bring It must be quite a nugget But I m not likely to get a glimpse of it if you don t go with the professor I don t see how I can go Ned But come over and meet the delightful gentleman when he arrives I expect him day after to morrow I ll be here promised Ned and then he went downtown to attend to some matters connected with his new duties which were much less irksome than those he had had when he had been in the bank Well Tom have you heard any more about your friend asked Ned two days later as he came to the Swift home with some papers needing the signature of the young inventor and his father You mean Professor Bumper No I haven t heard from him since he telephoned But I guess he ll be here all right He s very punctual Did you see anything of my giant Koku as you came in Yes he and Eradicate were having an argument about who should move a heavy casting from one of the shops Rad wanted to do it all alone but Koku said he was like a baby now Poor Rad is getting old said Tom with a sigh But he has been very faithful He and Koku never seem to get along well together Koku was an immense man a veritable giant one of two whom Tom had brought back with him after an exciting trip to a strange land The giant s strength was very useful to the young inventor Now Tom about this business of leasing to the English Government the right to manufacture that new explosive of yours began Ned plunging into the business at hand I think if you stick out a little you can get a better royalty price But I don t want to gouge em Ned I m satisfied with a fair profit The trouble with you is you think too much of money Now At that moment a voice was heard in the hall of the house saying Now my dear lady don t trouble yourself I can find my way in to Tom Swift perfectly well by myself and while I appreciate your courtesy I do not want to trouble you No don t come missus Baggert added another voice Bless my hat band I think I know my way about the house by this time mister Damon ejaculated Ned And Professor Bumper is with him added Tom Come in he cried opening the hall door to confront a bald headed man who stood peering at our hero with bright snapping eyes like those of some big bird spying out the land from afar Come in Professor Bumper and you too mister Damon CHAPTER III BLESSINGS AND ENTHUSIASM Greetings and inquiries as to health having been passed not without numerous blessings on the part of mister Damon the little party gathered in the library of the home of Tom Swift sat down and looked at one another On Professor Bumper s face there was plainly to be seen a look of expectation and it seemed to be shared by mister Damon who seemed eager to burst into enthusiastic talk On the other hand Tom Swift appeared a bit indifferent Ned himself admitted that he was frankly curious The story of the big idol of gold had occupied his thoughts for many hours Well I m glad to see you both said Tom again You got here all right I see Professor Bumper But I didn t expect you to meet and bring mister Damon with you I met him on the train explained the author of the book on the lost city of Pelone as well as books on other antiquities I had no expectation of seeing him and we were both surprised when we met on the express It stopped at Waterfield Tom explained mister Damon which it doesn t usually do being an aristocratic sort of train not given even to hesitating at our humble little town There were some passengers to get off which caused the flier to stop I suppose And as I wanted to come over to see you I got aboard Glad you did voiced Tom Then I happened to see Professor Bumper a few seats ahead of me went on mister Damon and bless my scarfpin he was coming to see you also Well I m doubly glad answered Tom So here we are went on mister Damon and you ve simply got to come Tom Swift You must go with us and mister Damon in his enthusiasm banged his fist down on the table with such force that he knocked some books to the floor Koku the giant who was in the hall opened the door and in his imperfect English asked Master Tom knock for him bigs man No answered Tom with a smile I didn t knock or call you Koku Some books fell that is all Massa Tom done called fo me dat s what he done broke in the petulant voice of Eradicate No Rad I don t need anything Tom said Though you might make a pitcher of lemonade It s rather warm Right away Massa Tom Right away cried the old colored man eager to be of service Me help too rumbled Koku in his deep voice Me punch de lemons and away he hurried after Eradicate fearful lest the old servant do all the honors Same old Rad and Koku observed mister Damon with a smile But now Tom while they re making the lemonade let s get down to business You re going with us of course Where asked Tom more from habit than because he did not know Where Why to Honduras of course After the idol of gold Why bless my fountain pen it s the most wonderful story I ever heard of You ve read Professor Bumper s article of course He told me you had I read it on the train coming over He also told me about it and Well I m going with him Tom Swift And think of all the adventures that may befall us We ll get lost in buried cities ride down raging torrents on a raft fall over a cliff maybe and be rescued Why it makes me feel quite young again and mister Damon arose to pace excitedly up and down the room Up to this time Professor Bumper had said very little He had sat still in his chair listening to mister Damon But now that the latter had ceased at least for a time Tom and Ned looked toward the scientist I understand Tom he said that you read my article in the magazine about the possibility of locating some of the lost and buried cities of Honduras Yes Ned and I each read it It was quite wonderful And yet there are more wonders to tell went on the professor I did not give all the details in that article I will tell you some of them I have brought copies of the documents with me and he opened a small valise and took out several bundles tied with pink tape As mister Damon said he went on while arranging his papers he met me on the train and he was so taken by the story of the idol of gold that he agreed to accompany me to Central America On one condition put in the eccentric man What s that You didn t make any conditions while we were talking said the scientist Yes I said I d go if Tom Swift did Oh yes You did say that But I don t call that a condition for of course Tom Swift will go Now let me tell you something more than I could impart over the telephone Soon after I called you up Tom and it was quite a coincidence that it should have been at a time when you had just finished my magazine article Soon after that as I was saying I arranged to come on to Shopton And now I m glad we re all here together But how comes it Ned Newton that you are not in the bank I ve left there explained Ned He s now general financial man for the Swift Company Tom explained My father and I found that we could not look after the inventing and experimental end and money matters too and as Ned had had considerable experience this way we made him take over those worries and Tom laughed genially No worries at all as far as the Swift Company is concerned returned Ned Well I guess you earn your salary laughed Tom But now Professor Bumper let s hear from you Is there anything more about this idol of gold that you can tell us Plenty Tom plenty I could talk all day and not get to the end of the story But a lot of it would be scientific detail that might be too dry for you in spite of this excellent lemonade Between them Koku and Eradicate had managed to make a pitcher of the beverage though missus Baggert the housekeeper told Tom afterward that the two had a quarrel in the kitchen as to who should squeeze the lemons the giant insisting that he had the better right to punch them So not to go into too many details went on the professor I ll just give you a brief outline of this story of the idol of gold Honduras as you of course know is a republic of Central America and it gets its name from something that happened on the fourth voyage of Columbus He and his men had had days of weary sailing and had sought in vain for shallow water in which they might come to an anchorage Finally they reached the point now known as Cape Gracias a Dios and when they let the anchor go and found that in a short time it came to rest on the floor of the ocean some one of the sailors perhaps Columbus himself is said to have remarked Thank the Lord we have left the deep waters honduras that being the Spanish word for unfathomable depths So Honduras it was called and has been to this day It is a queer land with many traces of an ancient civilization a civilization which I believe dates back farther than some in the far East On the sculptured stones in the Copan valley there are characters which seem to resemble very ancient writing but this pictographic writing is largely untranslatable Honduras I might add is about the size of our state of Ohio It is rather an elevated tableland though there are stretches of tropical forest but it is not so tropical a country as many suppose it to be There is much gold scattered throughout Honduras though of late it has not been found in large quantities In the old days however before the Spaniards came it was plentiful so much so that the natives made idols of it And it is one of the largest of these idols by name Quitzel that I am going to seek Do you know where it is asked Ned Well it isn t locked up in a safe deposit box of that I m sure laughed the professor No I don t know exactly where it is except that it is somewhere in an ancient and buried city known as Kurzon If I knew exactly where it was there wouldn t be much fun in going after it And if it was known to others it would have been taken away long ago No we ve got to hunt for the idol of gold in this land of wonders where I hope soon to be Later on I ll show you the documents that put me on the track of this idol Enough now to show you an old map I found or rather a copy of it and some of the papers that tell of the idol and he spread out his packet of papers on the table in front of him his eyes shining with excitement and pleasure mister Damon too leaned eagerly forward So Tom Swift went on the professor I come to you for help in this matter I want you to aid me in organizing an expedition to go to Honduras after the idol of gold Will you I ll help you of course said Tom You may use any of my inventions you choose my airships my motor boats and submarines even my giant cannon if you think you can take it with you And as for the money part Ned will arrange that for you But as for going with you myself it is out of the question I can t No Honduras for me CHAPTER IV FENIMORE BEECHER Had Tom Swift s giant cannon been discharged somewhere in the vicinity of his home it could have caused but little more astonishment to mister Damon and Professor Bumper than did the simple announcement of the young inventor The professor seemed to shrink back in his chair collapsing like an automobile tire when the air is let out As for mister Damon he jumped up and cried Bless my But that is as far as he got at least just then He did not seem to know what to bless but he looked as though he would have liked to include most of the universe Surely you don t mean it Tom Swift gasped Professor Bumper at length Won t you come with us No said Tom slowly Really I can t go I m working on an invention of a new aeroplane stabilizer and if I go now it will be just at a time when I am within striking distance of success And the stabilizer is very much needed If it s a question of making a profit on it Tom began mister Damon I can let you have some money until Oh no It isn t the money cried Tom Don t think that for a moment You see the European war has called for the use of a large number of aeroplanes and as the pilots of them frequently have to fight and so can not give their whole attention to the machines some form of automatic stabilizer is needed to prevent them turning turtle or going off at a wrong tangent So I have been working out a sort of modified gyroscope and it seems to answer the purpose I have already received advance orders for a number of my devices from abroad and as they are destined to save lives I feel that I ought to keep on with my work I d like to go don t misunderstand me but I can t go at this time It is out of the question If you wait a year or maybe six months No it is impossible to wait Tom declared Professor Bumper Is it so important then to hurry asked mister Damon You did not mention that to me Professor Bumper No I did not have time There are so many ends to my concerns But Tom Swift you simply must go I can t my dear professor much as I should like to But Tom think of it cried mister Damon who was as much excited as was the little bald headed scientist You never saw such an idol of gold as this What s its name and he looked questioningly at the professor Quitzel the idol is called supplied Professor Bumper And it is supposed to be in a buried city named Kurzon somewhere in the Sierra de Merendon range of mountains in the vicinity of the Copan valley Copan is a city or maybe we ll find it only a town when we get there and it is not far from the borders of Guatemala Tom if I could show you the translations I have made of the ancient documents referring to this idol and the wonderful city over which it kept guard I m sure you d come with us Please don t tempt me Tom said with a laugh I m only too anxious to go and if it wasn t for the stabilizer I d be with you in a minute But Well you ll have to get along without me Maybe I can join you later What s this about the idol keeping guard over the ancient city asked Ned for he was interested in strange stories It seems explained the professor that in the early days there was a strange race of people inhabiting Central America with a somewhat high civilization only traces of which remained when the Spaniards came But these traces and such hieroglyphics or to be more exact pictographs as I have been able to decipher from the old documents tell of one country or perhaps it was only a city over which this great golden idol of Quitzel presided There is in some of these papers a description of the idol which is not exactly a beauty judged from modern standards But the main fact is that it is made of solid gold and may weigh anywhere from one to two tons Two tons of gold cried New Newton Why if that s the case it would be worth and he fell to doing a sum in mental arithmetic I am not so concerned about the monetary value of the statue as I am about its antiquity went on Professor Bumper There are other statues in this buried city of Kurzon and though they may not be so valuable they will give me a wealth of material for my research work How do you know there are other statues asked mister Damon Because my documents tell me so It was because the people made other idols in opposition as it were to Quitzel that their city or country was destroyed At least that is the legend Quitzel so the story goes wanted to be the chief god and when the image of a rival was set up in the temple near him he toppled over in anger and part of the temple went with him the whole place being buried in ruins All the inhabitants were killed and trace of the ancient city was lost forever No 
207_143321_000037_000002	train-clean-360	I hope not 
none	none	forever for I expect to find it If all the people were killed and the city buried how did the story of Quitzel become known asked mister Damon One only of the priests in the temple of Quitzel escaped and set down part of the tale said the professor It is his narrative or one based on it that I have given you And now what I want to do is to go and make a search for this buried city I have fairly good directions as to how it may be reached We will have little difficulty in getting to Honduras as there are fruit steamers frequently sailing Of course going into the interior to the Copan valley is going to be harder But an expedition from a large college was recently there and succeeded after much labor in excavating part of a buried city Whether or not it was Kurzon I am unable to say But if there was one ancient city there must be more So I want to make an attempt And I counted on you Tom You have had considerable experience in strange quarters of the earth and you re just the one to help me I don t need money for I have interested a certain millionaire and my own college will put up part of the funds Oh it isn t a question of money said Tom It s time That s just what it is with me exclaimed Professor Bumper I haven t any time to lose My rivals may even now be on their way to Honduras Your rivals cried Tom You didn t say anything about them No I believe I didn t There were so many other things to talk about But there is a rival archaeologist who would ask nothing better than to get ahead of me in this matter He is younger than I am and youth is a big asset nowadays Pooh You re not old cried mister Damon You re no older than I am and I m still young I m a lot younger than some of these boys who are afraid to tackle a trip through a tropical wilderness and he playfully nudged Tom in the ribs I m not a bit afraid retorted the young inventor No I know you re not laughed mister Damon But I ve got to say something Tom to stir you up Ned how about you Would you go I can t unless Tom does You see I m his financial man now There you are Tom Swift cried mister Damon You see you are holding back a number of persons just because you don t want to go I certainly wouldn t like to go without Tom said the professor slowly I really need his help You know Tom we would never have found the city of Pelone if it had not been for you and your marvelous powder The conditions in the Copan valley are likely to be still more difficult to overcome and I feel that I risk failure without your young energy and your inventive mind to aid in the work and to suggest possible means of attaining our object Come Tom reconsider and decide to make the trip And my promise to go was dependent on Tom s agreement to accompany us said mister Damon Come on urged the professor much as one boy might urge another to take part in a ball game Don t let my rival get ahead of me I wouldn t like to see that Tom said slowly Who is he any one I know I don t believe so Tom He s connected with a large new college that has plenty of money to spend on explorations and research work Beecher is his name Fenimore Beecher Beecher exclaimed Tom and there was such a change in his manner that his friends could not help noticing it He jumped to his feet his eyes snapping and he looked eagerly and anxiously at Professor Bumper Did you say his name was Fenimore Beecher Tom asked in a tense voice That s what it is Professor Fenimore Beecher He is really a learned young man and thoroughly in earnest though I do not like his manner But he is trying to get ahead of me which may account for my feeling Tom Swift did not answer Instead he hurried from the room with a murmured apology I ll be back in about five minutes he said as he went out Well what s up now asked mister Damon of Ned as the young inventor departed What set him off that way The mention of Beecher s name evidently Though I never heard him mention such a person before Nor did I ever hear Professor Beecher speak of Tom said the bald headed scientist Well we ll just have to wait until At that moment Tom came back into the room Gentlemen he said I have reconsidered my refusal to go to the Copan valley after the idol of gold I m going with you Good cried Professor Bumper Fine ejaculated mister Damon Bless my time table I thought you d come around Tom Swift But what about your stabilizer asked Ned I was just talking to my father about it the young inventor replied He will be able to put the finishing touches on it So I ll leave it with him As soon as I can get ready I ll go since you say haste is necessary Professor Bumper It is if we are to get ahead of Beecher Then we ll get ahead of him cried Tom I m with you now from the start to the finish I ll show him what I can do he added while Ned and the others wondered at the sudden change in their friend s manner CHAPTER V THE LITTLE GREEN GOD Tom how soon can we go asked Professor Bumper as he began arranging his papers maps and documents ready to place them back in the valise Within a week if you want to start that soon The sooner the better A week will suit me I don t know just what Beecher s plans are but he may try to get on the ground first Though without boasting I may say that he has not had as much experience as I have had thanks to you Tom when you helped me find the lost city of Pelone Well I hope we ll be as successful this time murmured Tom I don t want to see Beecher beat you I didn t know you knew him Tom said the professor Oh yes I have met him once and there was something in Tom s manner though he tried to speak indifferently that made Ned believe there was more behind his chum s sudden change of determination than had yet appeared He never mentioned you went on Professor Bumper yet the last time I saw him I said I was coming to see you though I did not tell him why No he wouldn t be likely to speak of me said Tom significantly Well if that s all settled I guess I ll go back home and pack up said mister Damon making a move to depart There s no special rush Tom said We won t leave for a week I can t get ready in much less time than that Bless my socks I know that ejaculated mister Damon But if I get my things packed I can go to a hotel to stay while my wife is away She might take a notion to come home unexpectedly and though she is a dear good soul she doesn t altogether approve of my going off on these wild trips with you Tom Swift But if I get all packed and clear out she can t find me and she can t hold me back She is visiting her mother now I can send her a wire from Kurzon after I get there I don t believe the telegraph there is working laughed Professor Bumper But suit yourself I must go back to New York to arrange for the goods we ll have to take with us In a week Tom we ll start You must stay to dinner Tom said You can t get a train now anyhow and father wants to meet you again He s pretty well considering his age And he s much better I verily believe since I said I d turn over to him the task of finishing the stabilizer He likes to work We ll stay and take the night train back agreed mister Damon It will be like old times Tom he went on traveling off together into the wilds Central America is pretty wild isn t it he asked as if in fear of being disappointed on that score Oh it s wild enough to suit any one answered Professor Bumper Well now to settle a few details observed Tom Ned what is the situation as regards the financial affairs of my father and myself Nothing will come to grief if we go away will there I guess not Tom But are you going to take your father with you No of course not But you spoke of we I meant you and I are going Me Tom Sure you I wouldn t think of leaving you behind You want Ned along don t you Professor Of course It will be an ideal party we four We ll have to take natives when we get to Honduras and make up a mule pack train for the interior I had some thoughts of asking you to take an airship along but it might frighten the Indians and I shall have to depend on them for guides as well as for porters So it will be an old fashioned expedition in a way mister Swift came in at this point to meet his old friends The boy needs a little excitement he said He s been puttering over that stabilizer invention too long I can finish the model for him in a very short time Professor Bumper told mister Swift something about the proposed trip while mister Damon went out with Tom and Ned to one of the shops to look at a new model aeroplane the young inventor had designed There was a merry party around the table at dinner though now and then Ned noticed that Tom had an abstracted and preoccupied air Thinking about the idol of gold asked Ned in a whisper to his chum when they were about to leave the table The idol of gold Oh yes Of course It will be great if we can bring that back with us But the manner in which he said this made Ned feel sure that Tom had had other thoughts and that he had used a little subterfuge in his answer Ned was right as he proved for himself a little later when mister Damon and the professor having gone home the young financial secretary took his friend to a quiet corner and asked What s the matter Tom Matter What do you mean I mean what made you make up your mind so quickly to go on this expedition when you heard Beecher was going Oh er well you wouldn t want to see our old friend Professor Bumper left would you after he had worked out the secret of the idol of gold You wouldn t want some young whipper snapper to beat him in the race would you Ned No of course not Neither would I That s why I changed my mind This Beecher isn t going to get that idol if I can stop him You seem rather bitter against him Bitter Oh not at all I simply don t want to see my friends disappointed Then Beecher isn t a friend of yours Oh I ve met him that is all and Tom tried to speak indifferently Humph mused Ned there s more here than I dreamed of I m going to get at the bottom of it But though Ned tried to pump Tom he was not successful The young inventor admitted knowing the youthful scientist but that was all Tom reiterating his determination not to let Professor Bumper be beaten in the race for the idol of gold Let me see mused Ned as he went home that evening Tom did not change his mind until he heard Beecher s name mentioned Now this shows that Beecher had something to do with it The only reason Tom doesn t want Beecher to get this idol or find the buried city is because Professor Bumper is after it And yet the professor is not an old or close friend of Tom s They met only when Tom went to dig his big tunnel There must be some other reason Ned did some more thinking Then he clapped his hands together and a smile spread over his face I believe I have it he cried The little green god as compared to the idol of gold That s it I m going to make a call on my way home This he did stopping at the home of Mary Nestor a pretty girl who rumor had it was tacitly engaged to Tom Mary was not at home but mister Nestor was and for Ned s purpose this answered Well well glad to see you exclaimed Mary s father Isn t Tom with you he asked a moment later seeing that Ned was alone No Tom isn t with me this evening Ned answered The fact is he s getting ready to go off on another expedition and I m going with him You young men are always going somewhere remarked missus Nestor Where is it to this time Some place in Central America Ned answered not wishing to be too particular He was wondering how he could find out what he wanted to know when Mary s mother unexpectedly gave him just the information he was after Central America she exclaimed Why Father and she looked at her husband that s where Professor Beecher is going isn t it Yes I believe he did mention something about that Professor Beecher the man who is an authority on Aztec ruins asked Ned taking a shot in the dark Yes said mister Nestor And a mighty fine young man he is too I knew his father well He was here on a visit not long ago young Beecher was and he talked most entertainingly about his discoveries You remember how interested Mary was Mother Yes she seemed to be said missus Nestor Tom Swift dropped in during the course of the evening she added to Ned and Mary introduced him to Professor Beecher But I can t say that Tom was much interested in the professor s talk No questioned Ned No not at all But Tom did not stay long He left just as Mary and the professor were drawing a map so the professor could indicate where he had once made a big discovery I see murmured Ned Well I suppose Tom must have been thinking of something else at the time Very likely agreed mister Nestor But Tom missed a very profitable talk I was very much interested myself in what the professor told us and so was Mary She invited mister Beecher to come again He takes after his father in being very thorough in what he does Sometimes I think went on mister Nestor that Tom isn t quite steady enough He s thinking of so many things perhaps that he can t get his mind down to the commonplace I remember he once sent something here in a box labeled dynamite Though there was no explosive in it it gave us a great fright But Tom is a boy in spite of his years Professor Beecher seems much older We all like him very much That s nice said Ned as he took his departure He had found out what he had come to learn I knew it Ned exclaimed as he walked home I knew something was in the wind The little green god of jealousy has Tom in his clutches That s why my inventive friend was so anxious to go on this expedition when he learned Beecher was to go He wants to beat him I guess the professor has plainly shown that he wouldn t like anything better than to cut Tom out with Mary Whew that s something to think about CHAPTER VI UNPLEASANT NEWS Ned Newton decided to keep to himself what he had heard at the Nestor home Not for the world would he let Tom Swift know of the situation That is I won t let him know that I know said Ned to himself though he is probably as well aware of the situation as I am But it sure is queer that this Professor Beecher should have taken such a fancy to Mary and that her father should regard him so well That is natural I suppose But I wonder how Mary herself feels about it That is the part Tom would be most interested in No wonder Tom wants to get ahead of this young college chap who probably thinks he s the whole show If he can find the buried city and get the idol of gold it would be a big feather in his cap He d have no end of honors heaped on him and I suppose his hat wouldn t come within three sizes of fitting him Then he d stand in better than ever with mister Nestor And maybe with Mary too though I think she is loyal to Tom But one never can tell However I m glad I know about it I ll do all I can to help Tom without letting him know that I know And if I can do anything to help in finding that idol of gold for Professor Bumper and incidentally Tom I ll do it and he spoke aloud in his enthusiasm Ned who was walking along in the darkness clapped his open hand down on Tom s magazine he was carrying home to read again and the resultant noise was a sharp crack As it sounded a figure jumped from behind a tree and called tensely Hold on there Ned stopped short thinking he was to be the victim of a holdup but his fears were allayed when he beheld one of the police force of Shopton confronting him I heard what you said about gettin the gold went on the officer I was walkin along and I heard you talkin Where s your pal I haven t any mister Newbold answered Ned with a laugh as he recognized the man Oh pshaw It s Ned Newton exclaimed the disappointed officer I thought you was talkin to a confederate about gold and figured maybe you was goin to rob the bank No nothing like that answered Ned still much amused I was talking to myself about a trip Tom Swift and I are going to take and Oh that s all right responded the policeman I can understand it if it had anything to do with Tom He s a great boy Indeed he is agreed Ned making a mental resolve not to be so public with his thoughts in the future He chatted for a moment with the officer and then bidding him good night walked on to his home his mind in a whirl with conglomerate visions of buried cities great grinning idols of gold and rival professors seeking to be first at the goal The next few days were busy ones for Tom Ned and in fact the whole Swift household Tom and his father had several consultations and conducted several experiments in regard to the new stabilizer the completion of which was so earnestly desired mister Swift was sure he could carry the invention to a successful conclusion Ned was engaged in putting the financial affairs of the Swift Company in shape so they would practically run themselves during his absence Then too there was the packing of their baggage which must be seen to Of course the main details of the trip were left to Professor Bumper who knew just what to do He had told Tom and Ned that all they and mister Damon would have to do would be to meet him at the pier in New York where they would find all arrangements made One day near the end of the week the beginning of the next being set for the start Eradicate came shuffling into the room where Tom was sorting out the possessions he desired to take with him Ned assisting him in the task Well Rad what is it asked Tom with businesslike energy I done heah Massa Tom dat yo all s gwine off on a long trip once mo Am dat so Yes that s so Rad Well den I se come to ast yo whut I d bettah take wif me Shall I took warm clothes or cool clothes Well if you were going Rad answered Tom with a smile you d need cool clothes for we re going to a sort of jungle land But I m sorry to say you re not going this trip I I ain t gwine Does yo mean dat yo all ain t gwine to take me Massa Tom That s it Rad It isn t any trip for you Is certain not broke in the voice of Koku the giant who entered with a big trunk Tom had sent him for Master want strong man like a bull He take Koku Look heah spluttered Eradicate and his eyes flashed Yo yo giant yo yo may be strong laik a bull but ya ain t got as much sense as mah mule Boomerang Massa Tom don t want no sich pusson wif him He s gwine to take me He take me cried Koku and his voice was a roar while he beat on his mighty chest with his huge fists Tom seeing that the dispute was likely to be bothersome winked at Ned and began to speak I don t believe you d like it there Rad not where we re going It s a bad country Why the mosquitoes there bite holes in you raise bumps on you as big as eggs Oh good land ejaculated the old colored man Am dat so Massa Tom It sure is Then there s another kind of bug that burrows under your fingernails and if you don t get em out your fingers drop off Oh good land Massa Tom Am dat a fact It sure is I don t want to see those things happen to you Rad Slowly the old colored man shook his head I don t mahse f he said I I guess I won t go Eradicate did not stop to ask how Tom and Ned proposed to combat these two species of insects But there remained Koku to dispose of and he stood smiling broadly as Eradicate shuffled of Me no fraid bugs said the giant No said Tom with a look at Ned for he did not want to take the big man on the trip for various reasons No maybe not Koku Your skin is pretty tough But I understand there are deep pools of water in the land where we are going and in them lives a fish that has a hide like an alligator and a jaw like a shark If you fall in it s all up with you Dat true Master Tom and Koku s voice trembled Well I ve never seen such a fish I m sure but the natives tell about it Koku seemed to be considering the matter Strange as it may seem the giant though afraid of nothing human and brave when it came to a hand to claw argument with a wild animal had a very great fear of the water and the unseen life within it Even a little fresh water crab in a brook was enough to send him shrieking to shore So when Tom told of this curious fish which many natives of Central America firmly believe in the giant took thought with himself Finally he gave a sigh and said Me stay home and keep bad mans out of master s shop Yes I guess that s the best thing for you assented Tom with an air of relief He and Ned had talked the matter over and they had agreed that the presence of such a big man as Koku in an expedition going on a more or less secret mission would attract too much attention Well I guess that clears matters up said Tom as he looked over a collection of rifles and small arms to decide which to take We won t have them to worry about No only Professor Beecher remarked Ned with a sharp look at his chum Oh we ll dispose of him all right asserted Tom boldly He hasn t had any experience in business of this sort and with what you and Professor Bumper and mister Damon know we ought to have little trouble in getting ahead of the young man Not to speak of your own aid added Ned Oh I ll do what I can of course said Tom with an air of indifference But Ned knew his chum would work ceaselessly to help get the idol of gold Tom gave no sign that there was any complication in his affair with Mary Nestor and of course Ned did not tell anything of what he knew about it That night saw the preparations of Ned and Tom about completed There were one or two matters yet to finish on Tom s part in relation to his business but these offered no difficulties The two chums were in the Swift home talking over the prospective trip when missus Baggert answering a ring at the front door announced that mister Damon was outside Tell him to come in ordered Tom Bless my baggage check exclaimed the excitable man as he shook hands with Tom and Ned and noted the packing evidences all about You re ready to go to the land of wonders The land of wonders repeated Ned Yes that s what Professor Bumper calls the part of Honduras we re going to And it must be wonderful Tom Think of whole cities some of them containing idols and temples of gold buried thirty and forty feet under the surface Wonderful is hardly the name for it It ll be great cried Ned I suppose you re ready mister Damon you and the professor Yes But Tom I have a bit of unpleasant news for you Unpleasant news Yes You know Professor Bumper spoke of a rival a man named Beecher who is a member of the faculty of a new and wealthy college I heard him speak of him yes and the way Tom said it no one would have suspected that he had any personal interest in the matter He isn t going to give his secret away thought Ned Well this Professor Beecher you know went on mister Damon also knows about the idol of gold and is trying to get ahead of Professor Bumper in the search He did say something of it but nothing was certain remarked Tom But it is certain exclaimed mister Damon Bless my toothpick it s altogether too certain How is that asked Tom Is Beecher certainly going to Honduras Yes of course But what is worse he and his party will leave New York on the same steamer with us CHAPTER VII TOM HEARS SOMETHING On hearing mister Damon s rather startling announcement Tom and Ned looked at one another There seemed to be something back of the simple statement an ominous and portending something On the same steamer with us is he mused Tom How did you learn this asked Ned Just got a wire from Professor Bumper telling me He asked me to telephone to you about it as he was too busy to call up on the long distance from New York But instead of phoning I decided to come over myself Glad you did said Tom heartily Did Professor Bumper want us to do anything special now that it is certain his rival will be so close on his trail Yes he asked me to warn you to be careful what you did and said in reference to the expedition Then does he fear something asked Ned Yes in a way I think he is very much afraid this young Beecher will not only be first on the site of the underground city but that he may be the first to discover the idol of gold It would be a great thing for a young archaeologist like Beecher to accomplish a mission of this sort and beat Professor Bumper in the race Do you think that s why Beecher decided to go on the same steamer we are to take asked Ned Yes I do said mister Damon Though from what Professor Bumper said I know he regards Professor Beecher as a perfectly honorable man as well as a brilliant student I do not believe Beecher or his party would stoop to anything dishonorable or underhand though they would not hesitate nor would we to take advantage of every fair chance to win in the race No I suppose that s right observed Tom but there was a queer gleam in his eye and his chum wondered if Tom did not have in mind the prospective race between himself and Fenimore Beecher for the regard of Mary Nestor We ll do our best to win and any one is at liberty to travel on the same steamer we are to take added the young inventor and his tone became more incisive It will be all the livelier with two expeditions after the same golden idol remarked Ned Yes I think we re in for some excitement observed Tom grimly But even he did not realize all that lay before them ere they would reach Kurzon mister Damon having delivered his message and remarking that his preparations for leaving were nearly completed went back to Waterfield from there to proceed to New York in a few days with Tom and Ned to meet Professor Bumper Well I guess we have everything in pretty good shape remarked Tom to his chum a day or so after the visit of mister Damon Everything is packed and as I have a few personal matters to attend to I think I ll take the afternoon off Go to it laughed Ned guessing a thing of two I ve got a raft of stuff myself to look after but don t let that keep you If there is anything I can do began Tom don t hesitate to
207_143321_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Nonsense 
none	none	exclaimed Ned I can do it all alone It s some of the company s business anyhow and I m paid for looking after that All right then I ll cut along Tom said and he wore a relieved air He s going to see Mary observed Ned with a grin as he observed Tom hop into his trim little roadster which under his orders Koku had polished and cleaned until it looked as though it had just come from the factory A little later the trim and speedy car drew up in front of the Nestor home and Tom bounded up on the front porch his heart not altogether as light as his feet No I m sorry but Mary isn t in said missus Nestor answering his inquiry after greeting him Not at home No she went on a little visit to her cousin s at Fayetteville She said something about letting you know she was going She did drop me a card answered Tom and somehow he did not feel at all cheerful But I thought it wasn t until next week she was going That was her plan Tom But she changed it Her cousin wired asking her to advance the date and this Mary did There was something about a former school chum who was also to be at Myra s house Myra is Mary s cousin you know Yes I know assented the young inventor And so Mary is gone How long is she going to stay Oh about two weeks She wasn t quite certain It depends on the kind of a time she has I suppose Yes I suppose so agreed Tom Well if you write before I do you might say I called missus Nestor I will Tom And I know Mary will be sorry she wasn t here to take a ride with you it s such a nice day and the lady smiled as she looked at the speedy roadster Maybe maybe you d like to come for a spin asked Tom half desperately No thank you I m too old to be jounced around in one of those small cars Nonsense She rides as easily as a Pullman sleeper Well I have to go to a Red Cross meeting anyhow so I can t come Tom Thank you just the same Tom did not drive back immediately to his home He wanted to do a bit of thinking and he believed he could do it best by himself So it was late afternoon when he again greeted Ned who meanwhile had been kept very busy Well called Tom s chum Um was the only answer and Tom called Koku to put the car away in the garage Something wrong mused Ned The next three days were crowded with events and with work mister Damon came over frequently to consult with Tom and Ned and finally the last of their baggage had been packed certain of Tom s inventions and implements sent on by express to New York to be taken to Honduras and then our friends themselves followed to the metropolis Good bye Tom said his father Good bye and good luck If you don t get the idol of gold I m sure you ll have experiences that will be valuable to you We re going to get the idol of gold said Tom determinedly Look out for the bad bugs suggested Eradicate We will promised Ned Tom s last act was to send a message to Mary Nestor and then he with Ned and mister Damon who blessed everything in sight from the gasoline in the automobile to the blue sky overhead started for the station New York was reached without incident The trio put up at the hotel where Professor Bumper was to meet them He hasn t arrived yet said Tom after glancing over the names on the hotel register and not seeing Professor Bumper s among them Oh he ll be here all right asserted mister Damon Bless my galvanic battery he sent me a telegram at one o clock this morning saying he d be sure to meet us in New York No fear of him not starting for the land of wonders There are some other professors registered though observed Ned as he glanced at the book noting the names of several scientists of whom he and Tom had read Yes I wonder what they re doing in New York replied Tom They are from New England Maybe there s a convention going on Well we ll have to wait that s all until Professor Bumper comes And during that wait Tom heard something that surprised him and caused him no little worry It was when Ned came back to his room which adjoined Tom s that the young treasurer gave his chum the news I say Tom Ned exclaimed Who do you think those professors are whose names we saw on the register I haven t the least idea Why they re of Beecher s party You don t mean it I surely do How do you know I happened to overhear two of them talking down in the lobby a while ago They didn t make any secret of it They spoke freely of going with Beecher to some ancient city in Honduras to look for an idol of gold They did But where is Beecher He hasn t joined them yet Their plans have been changed Instead of leaving on the same steamer we are to take in the morning they are to come on a later one The professors here are waiting for Beecher to come Why isn t he here now Well I heard one of the other scientists say that he had gone to a place called Fayetteville and will come on from there Fayetteville ejaculated Tom Yes That isn t far from Shopton I know assented Tom I wonder I wonder why he is going there I can tell you that too You can You re a regular detective No I just happened to overhear it Beecher is going to call on Mary Nestor in Fayetteville so his friends here said he told them and his call has to do with an important matter to him and Ned gazed curiously at his chum CHAPTER VIII OFF FOR HONDURAS Just what Tom s thoughts were Ned of course could not guess But by the flush that showed under the tan of his chum s cheeks the young financial secretary felt pretty certain that Tom was a bit apprehensive of the outcome of Professor Beecher s call on Mary Nestor So he is going to see her about something important Ned That s what some members of his party called it And they re waiting here for him to join them Yes And it means waiting a week for another steamer It must be something pretty important don t you think to cause Beecher to risk that delay in starting after the idol of gold Important Yes I suppose so assented Tom And yet even if he waits for the next steamer he will get to Honduras nearly as soon as we do How is that The next boat is a faster one Then why don t we take that I hate dawdling along on a slow freighter Well for one thing it would hardly do to change now when all our goods are on board And besides the captain of the Relstab on which we are going to sail is a friend of Professor Bumper s Well I m just as glad Beecher and his party aren t going with us resumed Ned after a pause It might make trouble Oh I m ready for any trouble HE might make quickly exclaimed Tom He meant trouble that might be developed in going to Honduras and starting the search for the lost city and the idol of gold This kind of trouble Tom and his friends had experienced before on other trips where rivals had sought to frustrate their ends But in his heart though he said nothing to Ned about it Tom was worried Much as he disliked to admit it to himself he feared the visit of Professor Beecher to Mary Nestor in Fayetteville had but one meaning I wonder if he s going to propose to her thought Tom He has the field all to himself now and her father likes him That s in his favor I guess mister Nestor has never quite forgiven me for that mistake about the dynamite box and that wasn t my fault Then too the Beecher and Nestor families have been friends for years Yes he surely has the inside edge on me and if he gets her to throw me over Well I won t give up without a fight and Tom mentally girded himself for a battle of wits He s relying on the prestige he ll get out of this idol of gold if his party finds it thought on the young inventor But I ll help find it first I m glad to have a little start of him anyhow even if it isn t more than two days Though if our vessel is held back much by storms he may get on the ground first However that can t be helped I ll do the best I can These thoughts shot through Tom s mind even as Ned was asking his questions and making comments Then the young inventor shaking his shoulders as though to rid them of some weight remarked Well come on out and see the sights It will be long before we look on Broadway again When the chums returned from their sightseeing excursion they found that Professor Bumper had arrived Where s Professor Bumper asked Ned the next day In his room going over books papers and maps to make sure he has everything And mister Damon Tom did not have to answer that last question Into the apartment came bursting the excited individual himself Bless my overshoes he cried I ve been looking everywhere for you Come on there s no time to lose What s the matter now asked Ned Is the hotel on fire Has anything happened to Professor Bumper Tom demanded a wild idea forming in his head that perhaps some one of the Beecher party had tried to kidnap the discoverer of the lost city of Pelone Oh everything is all right answered mister Damon But it s nearly time for the show to start and we don t want to be late I have tickets For what asked Tom and Ned together The movies was the laughing reply Bless my loose ribs but I wouldn t miss him for anything He s in a new play called Up in a Balloon Boys It s great and mister Damon named a certain comic moving picture star in whose horse play mister Damon took a curious interest Tom and Ned were glad enough to go Tom that he might have a chance to do a certain amount of thinking and Ned because he was still boy enough to like moving pictures I wonder Tom said mister Damon as they came out of the theater two hours later all three chuckling at the remembrance of what they had seen I wonder you never turned your inventive mind to the movies Maybe I will some day said Tom He spoke rather uncertainly The truth of the matter was that he was still thinking deeply of the visit of Professor Beecher to Mary Nestor and wondering what it portended But if Tom s sleep was troubled that night he said nothing of it to his friends He was up early the next morning for they were to leave that day and there was still considerable to be done in seeing that their baggage and supplies were safely loaded and in attending to the last details of some business matters While at the hotel they had several glimpses of the members of the Beecher party who were awaiting the arrival of the young professor who was to lead them into the wilds of Honduras But our friends did not seek the acquaintance of their rivals The latter likewise remained by themselves though they knew doubtless that there was likely to be a strenuous race for the possession of the idol of gold then it was presumed buried deep in some forest covered city Professor Bumper had made his arrangements carefully As he explained to his friends they would take the steamer from New York to Puerto Cortes one of the principal seaports of Honduras This is a town of about three thousand inhabitants with an excellent harbor and a big pier along which vessels can tie up and discharge their cargoes directly into waiting cars The preparations were finally completed The party went aboard the steamer which was a large freight vessel carrying a limited number of passengers and late one afternoon swung down New York Bay Off for Honduras cried Ned gaily as they passed the Statue of Liberty I wonder what will happen before we see that little lady again Who knows asked Tom shrugging his shoulders Spanish fashion And there came before him the vision of a certain little lady about whom he had been thinking deeply of late CHAPTER IX VAL JACINTO Rather tame isn t it Tom Well Ned it isn t exactly like going up in an airship and Tom Swift who was gazing over the rail down into the deep blue water of the Caribbean Sea over which their vessel was then steaming looked at his chum beside him No and your submarine voyage had it all over this one for excitement went on Ned When I think of that Bless my sea legs interrupted mister Damon overhearing the conversation Don t speak of THAT trip My wife never forgave me for going on it But I had a fine time he added with a twinkle of his eyes Yes that was quite a trip observed Tom as his mind went back to it But this one isn t over yet remember And I shouldn t be surprised if we had a little excitement very soon What do you mean asked Ned Up to this time the voyage from New York down into the tropical seas had been anything but exciting There were not many passengers besides themselves and the weather had been fine At first used as they were to the actions of unscrupulous rivals in trying to thwart their efforts Tom and Ned had been on the alert for any signs of hidden enemies on board the steamer But aside from a little curiosity when it became known that they were going to explore little known portions of Honduras the other passengers took hardly any interest in our travelers It was thought best to keep secret the fact that they were going to search for a wonderful idol of gold Not even the mule and ox cart drivers whom they would hire to take them into the wilds of the interior would be told of the real object of the search It would be given out that they were looking for interesting ruins of ancient cities with a view to getting such antiquities as might be there What do you mean asked Ned again when Tom did not answer him immediately What s the excitement I think we re in for a storm was the reply The barometer is falling and I see the crew going about making everything snug So we may have a little trouble toward this end of our trip Let it come exclaimed mister Damon We re not afraid of trouble Tom Swift are we No to be sure we re not And yet it looks as though the storm would be a bad one Then I am going to see if my books and papers are ready so I can get them together in a hurry in case we have to take to the life boats said Professor Bumper coming on deck at that moment It won t do to lose them If we didn t have the map we might not be able to find Ahem exclaimed Tom with unnecessary emphasis it seemed I ll help you go over your papers Professor he added and with a wink and a motion of his hand he enjoined silence on his friend Ned looked around for a reason for this and observed a man evidently of Spanish extraction passing them as he paced up and down the deck What s the matter asked the scientist in a whisper as the man went on Do you know him Is he a I don t know anything about him said Tom but it is best not to speak of our trip before strangers You are right Tom said Professor Bumper I ll be more careful A storm was brewing that was certain A dull sickly yellow began to obscure the sky and the water from a beautiful blue turned a slate color and ran along the sides of the vessel with a hissing sound as though the sullen waves would ask nothing better than to suck the craft down into their depths The wind which had been freshening now sang in louder tones as it hummed through the rigging and the funnel stays and bowled over the receiving conductors of the wireless Sharp commands from the ship s officers hastened the work of the crew in making things snug and life lines were strung along deck for the safety of such of the passengers as might venture up when the blow began The storm was not long in coming The howling of the wind grew louder flecks of foam began to separate themselves from the crests of the waves and the vessel pitched rolled and tossed more violently At first Tom and his friends thought they were in for no more than an ordinary blow but as the storm progressed and the passengers became aware of the anxiety on the part of the officers and crew the alarm spread among them It really was a violent storm approaching a hurricane in force and at one time it seemed as though the craft having been heeled far over under a staggering wave that swept her decks would not come back to an even keel There was a panic among some of the passengers and a few excited men behaved in a way that caused prompt action on the part of the first officer who drove them back to the main cabin under threat of a revolver For the men were determined to get to the lifeboats and a small craft would not have had a minute to live in such seas as were running But the vessel proved herself sturdier than the timid ones had dared to hope and she was soon running before the blast going out of her course it is true but avoiding the danger among the many cays or small islands that dot the Caribbean Sea There was nothing to do but to let the storm blow itself out which it did in two days Then came a period of delightful weather The cargo had shifted somewhat which gave the steamer a rather undignified list This as well as the loss of a deckhand overboard was the effect of the hurricane and though the end of the trip came amid sunshine and sweet scented tropical breezes many could not forget the dangers through which they had passed In due time Tom and his party found themselves safely housed in the small hotel at Puerto Cortes their belongings stored in a convenient warehouse and themselves rather weary by reason of the stress of weather ready for the start into the interior wilds of Honduras How are we going to make the trip asked Ned as they sat at supper the first night after their arrival eating of several dishes the red pepper condiments of which caused frequent trips to the water pitcher We can go in two ways and perhaps we shall find it to our advantage to use both means said Professor Bumper To get to this city of Kurzon he proceeded in a low voice so that none of the others in the dining room would hear them we will have to go either by mule back or boat to a point near Copan As near as I can tell by the ancient maps Kurzon is in the Copan valley Now the Chamelecon river seems to run to within a short distance of there but there is no telling how far up it may be navigable If we can go by boat it will be much more comfortable Travel by mules and ox carts is slow and sure but the roads are very bad as I have heard from friends who have made explorations in Honduras And as I said we may have to use both land and water travel to get us where we want to go We can proceed as far as possible up the river and then take to the mules What about arranging for boats and animals asked Tom I should think He suddenly ceased talking and reached for the water taking several large swallows Whew he exclaimed when he could catch his breath That was a hot one What did you do asked Ned Bit into a nest of red pepper Guess I ll have to tell that cook to scatter his hits He s bunching em too much in my direction and Tom wiped the tears from his eyes To answer your question said Professor Bumper I will say that I have made partial arrangements for men and animals and boats if it is found feasible to use them I ve been in correspondence with one of the merchants here and he promised to make arrangements for us When do we leave asked mister Damon As soon as possible I am not going to risk anything by delay and it was evident the professor referred to his young rival whose arrival might be expected almost any time As the party was about to leave the table they were approached by a tall dignified Spaniard who bowed low rather exaggeratedly low Ned thought and addressed them in fairly good English Your pardons Senors he began but if it will please you to avail yourself of the humble services of myself I shall have great pleasure in guiding you into the interior I have at my command both mules and boats How do you know we are going into the interior asked Tom a bit sharply for he did not like the assurance of the man Pardon Senor I saw that you are from the States And those from the States do not come to Honduras except for two reasons To travel and make explorations or to start trade and professors do not usually engage in trade and he bowed to Professor Bumper I saw your name on the register he proceeded and it was not difficult to guess your mission and he flashed a smile on the party his white teeth showing brilliantly beneath his small black moustache I make it my business to outfit traveling parties either for business pleasure or scientific matters I am at your service Val Jacinto and he introduced himself with another low bow For a moment Tom and his friends hardly knew how to accept this offer It might be as the man had said that he was a professional tour conductor like those who have charge of Egyptian donkey boys and guides Or might he not be a spy This occurred to Tom no less than to Professor Bumper They looked at one another while Val Jacinto bowed again and murmured At your service Can you provide means for taking us to the Copan valley asked the professor You are right in one respect I am a scientist and I purpose doing some exploring near Copan Can you get us there Most expensively I mean most expeditionlessly said Val Jacinto eagerly Pardon my unhappy English I forget at times The charges will be most moderate I can send you by boat as far as the river travel is good and then have mules and ox carts in waiting How far is it asked Tom A hundred miles as the vulture flies Senor but much farther by river and road We shall be a week going A hundred miles in a week groaned Ned Say Tom if you had your aeroplane we d be there in an hour Yes but we haven t it However we re in no great rush But we must not lose time said Professor Bumper I shall consider your offer he added to Val Jacinto Very good Senor I am sure you will be pleased with the humble service I may offer you and my charges will be small Adios and he bowed himself away What do you think of him asked Ned as they went up to their rooms in the hotel or rather one large room containing several beds He s a pretty slick article said mister Damon Bless my check book but he spotted us at once in spite of our secrecy I guess these guide purveyors are trained for that sort of thing observed the scientist I know my friends have often spoken of having had the same experience However I shall ask my friend who is in business here about this Val Jacinto and if I find him all right we may engage him Inquiries next morning brought the information from the head of a rubber exporting firm with whom the professor was acquainted that the Spaniard was regularly engaged in transporting parties into the interior and was considered efficient careful and as honest as possible considering the men he engaged as workers So we have decided to engage you Professor Bumper informed Val Jacinto the afternoon following the meeting I am more than pleased Senor I shall take you into the wilds of Honduras At your service and he bowed low Humph I don t just like the way our friend Val says that observed Tom to Ned a little later I d have been better pleased if he had said he d guide us into the wilds and out again If Tom could have seen the crafty smile on the face of the Spaniard as the man left the hotel the young inventor might have felt even less confidence in the guide CHAPTER X IN THE WILDS All aboard Step lively now This boat makes no stops this side of Boston cried Ned Newton gaily as he got into one of the several tree canoes provided for the transportation of the party up the Chamelecon river for the first stage of their journey into the wilds of Honduras All aboard This reminds me of my old camping days Tom It brought those days back in a measure to Tom also For there were a number of canoes filled with the goods of the party while the members themselves occupied a larger one with their personal baggage Strong half naked Indian paddlers were in charge of the canoes which were of sturdy construction and light draft since the river like most tropical streams was of uncertain depths choked here and there with sand bars or tropical growths Finding that Val Jacinto was regularly engaged in the business of taking explorers and mine prospectors into the interior Professor Bumper had engaged the man He seemed to be efficient At the promised time he had the canoes and paddlers on hand and the goods safely stowed away while one big craft was fitted up as comfortably as possible for the men of the party As Ned remarked it did look like a camping party for in the canoes were tents cooking utensils and most important mosquito canopies of heavy netting The insect pests of Honduras as in all tropical countries are annoying and dangerous Therefore it was imperative to sleep under mosquito netting On the advice of Val Jacinto who was to accompany them the travelers were to go up the river about fifty miles This was as far as it would be convenient to use the canoes the guide told Tom and his friends and from there on the trip to the Copan valley would be made on the backs of mules which would carry most of the baggage and equipment The heavier portions would be transported in ox carts As Professor Bumper expected to do considerable excavating in order to locate the buried city or cities as the case might be he had to contract for a number of Indian diggers and laborers These could be hired in Copan it was said The plan therefore was to travel by canoes during the less heated parts of the day and tie up at night making camp on shore in the net protected tents As for the Indians they did not seem to mind the bites of the insects They sometimes made a smudge fire Val Jacinto had said but that was all Well we haven t seen anything of Beecher and his friends remarked the young inventor as they were about to start No he doesn t seem to have arrived agreed Professor Bumper We ll get ahead of him and so much the better Well are we all ready to start he continued as he looked over the little flotilla which carried his party and his goods The sooner the better cried Tom and Ned fancied his chum was unusually eager I guess he wants to make good before Beecher gets the chance to show Mary Nestor what he can do thought Ned Tom sure is after that idol of gold You may start Senor Jacinto said the professor and the guide called something in Indian dialect to the rowers Lines were cast off and the boats moved out into the stream under the influence of the sturdy paddlers Well this isn t so bad observed Ned as he made himself comfortable in his canoe How about it Tom Oh no But this is only the beginning A canopy had been arranged over their boat to keep off the scorching rays of the sun The boat containing the exploring party and Val Jacinto took the lead the baggage craft following At the place where it flowed into the bay on which Puerto Cortes was built the stream was wide and deep The guide called something to the Indians who increased their stroke I tell them to pull hard and that at the end of the day s journey they will have much rest and refreshment he translated to Professor Bumper and the others Bless my ham sandwich but they ll need plenty of some sort of refreshment said mister Damon with a sigh I never knew it to be so hot Don t complain yet advised Tom with a laugh The worst is yet to come It really was not unpleasant traveling aside from the heat And they had expected that coming as they had to a tropical land But as Tom said what lay before them might be worse In a little while they had left behind them all signs of civilization The river narrowed and flowed sluggishly between the banks which were luxuriant with tropical growth Now and then some lonely Indian hut could be seen and occasionally a craft propelled by a man who was trying to gain a meager living from the rubber forest which hemmed in the stream on either side As the canoe containing the men was paddled along there floated down beside it what seemed to be a big rough log I wonder if that is mahogany remarked mister Damon reaching over to touch it Mahogany is one of the most valuable woods of Honduras and if this is a log of that nature Bless my watch chain he suddenly cried It s alive And the log was indeed so for there was a sudden flash of white teeth a long red opening showed and then came a click as an immense alligator having opened and closed his mouth sank out of sight in a swirl of water mister Damon drew back so suddenly that he tilted the canoe and the black paddlers looked around wonderingly Alligator explained Jacinto succinctly in their tongue Ugh they grunted Bless my bless my hesitated mister Damon and for one of the very few times in his life his language failed him Are there many of them hereabouts asked Ned looking back at the swirl left by the saurian Plenty said the guide with a shrug of his shoulders He seemed to do as much talking that way and with his hands as he did in speech The river is full of them Dangerous queried Tom Don t go in swimming was the significant advice Wait I ll show you and he called up the canoe just behind In this canoe was a quantity of provisions There was a chunk of meat among other things a gristly piece seeing which mister Damon had objected to its being brought along but the guide had said it would do for fish bait With a quick motion of his hand as he sat in the awning covered stern with Tom Ned and the others Jacinto sent the chunk of meat out into the muddy stream Hardly a second later there was a rushing in the water as though a submarine were about to come up An ugly snout was raised two rows of keen teeth snapped shut as a scissors like jaw opened and the meat was gone See was the guide s remark and something like a cold shiver of fear passed over the white members of the party This water is not made in which to swim Be careful We certainly shall agreed Tom They re fierce And always hungry observed Jacinto grimly And to think that I that I nearly had my hand on it murmured mister Damon Ugh Bless my eyeglasses The alligator nearly had your hand said the guide They can turn in the water like a flash wherefore it is not wise to pat one on the tail lest it present its mouth instead They paddled on up the river the dusky Indians now and then breaking out into a chant that seemed to give their muscles new energy The song if song it was passed from one boat to the other and as the chant boomed forth the craft shot ahead more swiftly They made a landing about noon and lunch was served Tom and his friends were hungry in spite of the heat Moreover they were experienced travelers and had learned not to fret over inconveniences and discomforts The Indians ate by themselves two acting as servants to Jacinto and the professor s party As is usual in traveling in the tropics a halt was made during the heated middle of the day Then as the afternoon shadows were waning the party again took to the canoes and paddled on up the river Do you know of a good place to stop during the night asked Professor Bumper of Jacinto Oh yes a most excellent place It is where I always bring scientific parties I am guiding You may rely on me It was within an hour of dusk none too much time to allow in which to pitch camp in the tropics where night follows day suddenly when a halt was called as a turn of the river showed a little clearing on the edge of the forest bound river We stay here for the night said Jacinto It is a good place It looks picturesque enough observed mister Damon But it is rather wild We are a good distance from a settlement agreed the guide But one can not explore and find treasure in cities and he shrugged his shoulders again Find treasure What do you mean asked Tom quickly Do you think that we Pardon Senor replied Jacinto softly I meant no offense I think that all you scientific parties will take treasure if you can find it We are looking for traces of the old Honduras civilization put in Professor Bumper And doubtless you will find it was the somewhat too courteous answer of the guide Make camp quickly he called to the Indians in their tongue You must soon get under the nets or you will be eaten alive he told Tom There are many mosquitoes here The tents were set up smudge fires built and supper quickly prepared Dusk fell rapidly and as Tom and Ned walked a little way down toward the river before turning in under the mosquito canopies the young financial man said Sort of lonesome and gloomy isn t it Tom Yes But you didn t expect to find a moving picture show in the wilds of Honduras did you No and yet Look out What s that suddenly cried Ned as a great soft black shadow seemed to sweep out of a clump of trees toward him Involuntarily he clutched Tom s arm and pointed his face showing fear in the fast gathering darkness CHAPTER XI THE VAMPIRES Tom Swift looked deliberately around It was characteristic of him that though by nature he was prompt in action he never acted so hurriedly as to obscure his judgment So though now Ned showed a trace of strange excitement Tom was cool What is it asked the young inventor What s the matter What did you think you saw Ned another alligator Alligator Nonsense Up on shore I saw a black shadow and I didn t THINK I saw it either I really did Tom laughed quietly A shadow he exclaimed Since when were you afraid of shadows Ned I m not afraid of ordinary shadows answered Ned and in his voice there was an uncertain tone I m not afraid of my shadow or yours Tom or anybody s that I can see But this wasn t any human shadow It was as if a great big blob of wet darkness had been waved over your head That s a queer explanation Tom said in a low voice A great big blob of wet darkness But that just describes it went on Ned looking up and around It was just as if you were in some dark room and some one waved a wet velvet cloak over your head spooky like It didn t make a sound but there was a smell as if a den of some wild beast was near here I remember that odor from the time we went hunting with your electric rifle in the jungle and got near the den in the rocks where the tigers lived Well there is a wild beast smell all around here admitted Tom sniffing the air It s the alligators in the river I guess You know they have an odor of musk Do you mean to say you didn t feel that shadow flying over us just now asked Ned Well I felt something sail through the air but I took it to be a big bird I didn t pay much attention To tell you the truth I was thinking about Beecher wondering when he would get here added Tom quickly as if to forestall any question as to whether or not his thoughts had to do with Beecher in connection with Tom s affair of the heart Well it wasn t a bird at least not a regular bird said Ned in a low voice as once more he looked at the dark and gloomy jungle that stretched back from the river and behind the little clearing where the camp had been made Come on cried Tom in what he tried to make a cheerful voice This is getting on your nerves Ned and I didn t know you had any Let s go back and turn in I m dog tired and the mosquitoes are beginning to find that we re here Let s get under the nets Then the black shadows won t get you Not at all unwilling to leave so gloomy a scene Ned after a brief glance up and down the dark river followed his chum They found Professor Bumper and mister Damon in their tent a separate one having been set up for the two men adjoining that of the youths Bless my fountain pen exclaimed mister Damon as he caught sight of Tom and Ned in the flickering light of the smudge fire between the two canvas shelters We were just wondering what had become of you We were chasing shadows laughed Tom At least Ned was But you look cozy enough in there It did indeed look cheerful in contrast to the damp and dark jungle all about Professor Bumper being an experienced traveler knew how to provide for such comforts as were possible Folding cots had been opened for himself mister Damon and the guide to sleep on others similar being set up in the tent where Tom and Ned were to sleep In the middle of the tent the professor had made a table of his own and mister Damon s suit cases and on this placed a small dry battery electric light He was making some notes doubtless for a future book Jacinto was going about the camp seeing that the Indians were at their duties though most of them had gone directly to sleep after supper Better get inside and under the nets advised Professor Bumper to Tom and Ned The mosquitoes here are the worst I ever saw We re beginning to believe that returned Ned who was unusually quiet Come on Tom I can t stand it any longer I m itching in a dozen places now from their bites As Tom and Ned had no wish for a light which would be sure to attract insects they entered their tent in the dark and were soon stretched out in comparative comfort Tom was just on the edge of a deep sleep when he heard Ned murmur I can t understand it What s that asked the young inventor I say I can t understand it Understand what That shadow It was real and yet Oh go to sleep advised Tom and turning over he was soon breathing heavily and regularly indicating that he at least had taken his own advice Ned too finally succumbed to the overpowering weariness of the first day of travel and he too slept though it was an uneasy slumber disturbed by a feeling as though some one were holding a heavy black quilt over his head preventing him from breathing The feeling sensation or dream whatever it was perhaps a nightmare became at last so real to Ned that he struggled himself into wakefulness With an effort he sat up uttering an inarticulate cry To his surprise he was answered Some one asked What is the matter Who who are you asked Ned quickly trying to peer through the darkness This is Jacinto your guide was the soft answer I was walking about camp and hearing you murmuring I came to your tent Is anything wrong For a moment Ned did not answer He listened and could tell by the continued heavy and regular breathing of his chum that Tom was still asleep Are you in our tent asked Ned at length Yes answered Jacinto I came in to see what was the matter with you Are you ill No of course not said Ned a bit shortly I I had a bad dream that was all All right now For that I am glad Try to get all the sleep you can for we must start early to avoid the heat of the day and there was the sound of the guide leaving and arranging the folds of the mosquito net behind him to keep out the night flying insects Once more Ned composed himself to sleep and this time successfully for he did not have any more unpleasant dreams The quiet of the jungle settled down over the camp at least the comparative quiet of the jungle for there were always noises of some sort going on from the fall of some rotten tree limb to the scream or growl of a wild beast while now and again from the river came the pig like grunts of the alligators It was about two o clock in the morning as they ascertained later when the whole camp white travelers and all was suddenly awakened by a wild scream It seemed to come from one of the natives who called out a certain word ever and over again To Tom and Ned it sounded like
207_143321_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Oshtoo 
207_143321_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Oshtoo 
none	none	Oshtoo Oshtoo What s the matter cried Professor Bumper The vampires came the answering voice of Jacinto One of the Indians has been attacked by a big vampire bat Look out every one It may be a raid by the dangerous creatures Be careful Notwithstanding this warning Ned stuck his head out of the tent The same instant he was aware of a dark enfolding shadow passing over him and with a shudder of fear he jumped back 
207_143321_000004_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XII
none	none	 A FALSE FRIEND What is it What s the matter cried Tom springing from his cot and hastening to the side of his chum in the tent
207_143321_000006_000002	train-clean-360	 What has happened Ned 
207_143321_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know but Jacinto is yelling something about vampires 
none	none	Vampires Yes 
207_143321_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Big bats 
207_143321_000009_000002	train-clean-360	And he s warning us to be careful 
207_143321_000009_000003	train-clean-360	I stuck my head out just now and I felt that same sort of shadow I felt this evening when we were down near the river 
none	none	Nonsense I tell you I did 
207_143321_000012_000000	train-clean-360	At that instant Tom flashed a pocket electric lamp he had taken from beneath his pillow and in the gleam of it he and Ned saw fluttering about the tent some dark shadow like form at the sight of which Tom s chum cried 
none	none	There it is 
207_143321_000013_000001	train-clean-360	That s the shadow 
207_143321_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Look out and he held up his hands instinctively to shield his face 
207_143321_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Shadow yelled Tom unconsciously adding to the din that seemed to pervade every part of the camp 
207_143321_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 That isn t a shadow 
207_143321_000014_000002	train-clean-360	It s substance It s a monster bat and here goes for a strike at it 
none	none	He caught up his camera tripod which was near his cot and made a swing with it at the creature that had flown into the tent through an opening it had made for itself
207_143321_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Look out yelled Ned 
207_143321_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 If it s a vampire it ll 
207_143321_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 It won t do anything to me shouted Tom as he struck the creature knocking it into the corner of the tent with a thud that told it must be completely stunned if not killed 
none	none	But what s it all about anyhow Tom asked
207_143321_000017_000002	train-clean-360	 What s the row 
none	none	From without the tent came the Indian cries of Oshtoo Oshtoo 
207_143321_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Mingled with them were calls of Jacinto partly in Spanish partly in the Indian tongue and partly in English 
207_143321_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 It is a raid by vampire bats was all Tom and Ned could distinguish We shall have to light fires to keep them away if we can succeed Every one grab up a club and strike hard 
none	none	Come on cried Tom getting on some clothes by the light of his gleaming electric light which he had set on his cot
207_143321_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 You re not going out there are you asked Ned 
none	none	I certainly am 
207_143321_000024_000001	train-clean-360	If there s a fight I want to be in it bats or anything else 
207_143321_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Here you have a light like mine 
none	none	Flash it on and hang it somewhere on yourself 
207_143321_000024_000004	train-clean-360	Then get a club and come on 
none	none	The lights will blind the bats and we can see to hit em 
207_143321_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Tom s plan seemed to be a good one 
207_143321_000025_000001	train-clean-360	His lamp and Ned s had small hooks on them so they could be carried in the upper coat pocket showing a gleam of light and leaving the hands free for use 
207_143321_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Out of the tents rushed the young men to find Professor Bumper and mister Damon before them 
207_143321_000026_000001	train-clean-360	The two men had clubs and were striking about in the half darkness for now the Indians had set several fires aglow And in the gleams constantly growing brighter as more fuel was piled on the young inventor and his chum saw a weird sight 
none	none	Circling and wheeling about in the camp clearing were many of the black shadowy forms that had caused Ned such alarm 
207_143321_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Great bats they were and a dangerous species if Jacinto was to be believed 
none	none	The uncanny creatures flew in and out among the trees and tents now swooping low near the Indians or the travelers At such times clubs would be used often with the effect of killing or stunning the flying pests For a time it seemed as if the bats would fairly overwhelm the camp so many of them were there 
207_143321_000028_000003	train-clean-360	But the increasing lights and the attacks made by the Indians and the white travelers turned the tide of battle and with silent flappings of their soft velvety wings the bats flew back to the jungle whence they had emerged 
207_143321_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 We are safe for the present exclaimed Jacinto with a sigh of relief 
207_143321_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you think they will come back asked Tom 
207_143321_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 They may there is no telling 
207_143321_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Bless my speedometer cried mister Damon If those beasts or birds whatever they are come back I ll go and hide in the river and take my chances with the alligators 
207_143321_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 The alligators aren t much worse asserted Jacinto with a visible shiver 
207_143321_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 These vampire bats sometimes depopulate a whole village 
none	none	Bless my shoe laces cried mister Damon You don t mean to say that the creatures can eat up a whole village
207_143321_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Not quite 
207_143321_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Though they might if they got the chance was the answer of the Spanish guide 
none	none	These vampire bats fly from place to place in great swarms and they are so large and blood thirsty that a few of them can kill a horse or an ox in a short time by sucking its blood So when the villagers find they are visited by a colony of these vampires they get out taking their live stock with them and stay in caves or in densely wooded places until the bats fly on 
207_143321_000035_000003	train-clean-360	Then the villagers come back 
none	none	It was only a small colony that visited us tonight or we would have had more trouble 
207_143321_000036_000001	train-clean-360	I do not think this lot will come back 
207_143321_000036_000002	train-clean-360	We have killed too many of them and he looked about on the ground where many of the uncanny creatures were still twitching in the death struggle 
none	none	Come back again cried mister Damon
207_143321_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 Bless my skin 
none	none	I hope not 
207_143321_000037_000003	train-clean-360	I ve had enough of bats and mosquitoes he added as he slapped at his face and neck 
none	none	Indeed the party of whites were set upon by the night insects to such an extent that it was necessary to hurry back to the protection of the nets 
207_143321_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Tom and Ned kicked outside the bat the former had killed in their tent and then both went back to their cots 
none	none	But it was some little time before they fell asleep And they did not have much time to rest for an early start must be made to avoid the terrible heat of the middle of the day Whew whistled Ned as he and Tom arose in the gray dawn of the morning when Jacinto announced the breakfast which the Indian cook had prepared
207_143321_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 That was some night 
207_143321_000040_000002	train-clean-360	If this is a sample of the wilds of Honduras give me the tameness of Shopton 
none	none	Oh we ve gone through with worse than this laughed Tom
207_143321_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 It s all in the day s work 
207_143321_000041_000002	train-clean-360	We ve only got started 
207_143321_000041_000003	train-clean-360	I guess we re a bit soft Ned though we had hard enough work in that tunnel digging 
207_143321_000042_000000	train-clean-360	After breakfast while the Indians were making ready the canoes Professor Bumper who in a previous visit to Central America had become interested in the subject made a brief examination of some of the dead bats 
none	none	They were exceptionally large some almost as big as hawks and were of the sub family Desmodidae the scientist said
207_143321_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 This is a true blood sucking bat went on the professor 
207_143321_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 This and he pointed to the nose leaves is the sucking apparatus 
207_143321_000043_000002	train-clean-360	The bat makes an opening in the skin with its sharp teeth and proceeds to extract the blood 
none	none	I can well believe two or three of them attacking a steer or mule at once could soon weaken it so the animal would die
207_143321_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 And a man too asked Ned 
207_143321_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Well a man has hands with which to use weapons but a helpless quadruped has not 
207_143321_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Though if a sufficient number of these bats attacked a man at the same time he would have small chance to escape alive 
207_143321_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Their bites too may be poisonous for all I know 
207_143321_000046_000000	train-clean-360	The Indians seemed glad to leave the place of the bats as they called the camp site 
none	none	Jacinto explained that the Indians believed a vampire could kill them while they slept and they were very much afraid of the blood sucking bats There were many other species in the tropics Professor Bumper explained most of which lived on fruit or on insects they caught 
207_143321_000046_000003	train-clean-360	The blood sucking bats were comparatively few and the migratory sort fewer still 
207_143321_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Well we re on our way once more remarked Tom as again they were in the canoes being paddled up the river 
207_143321_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 How much longer does your water trip take Professor 
207_143321_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I hardly know and Professor Bumper looked to Jacinto to answer 
207_143321_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 We go two more days in the canoes the guide answered and then we shall find the mules waiting for us at a place called Hidjio 
207_143321_000049_000001	train-clean-360	From then on we travel by land until well until you get to the place where you are going 
none	none	I suppose you know where it is he added nodding toward the professor
207_143321_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 I am leaving that part to you 
207_143321_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I have a map showing where I want to begin some excavations was the answer 
none	none	We must first go to Copan and see what arrangements we can make for laborers 
207_143321_000051_000002	train-clean-360	After that well we shall trust to luck for what we shall find 
none	none	There are said to be many curious things went on Jacinto speaking as though he had no interest
207_143321_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 You have mentioned buried cities 
207_143321_000052_000002	train-clean-360	Have you thought what may be in them great heathen temples idols perhaps 
207_143321_000053_000000	train-clean-360	For a moment none of the professor s companions spoke 
none	none	It was as though Jacinto had tried to get some information 
207_143321_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Finally the scientist said 
none	none	Oh yes we may find an idol I understand the ancient people who were here long before the Spaniards came worshiped idols 
207_143321_000054_000002	train-clean-360	But we shall take whatever antiquities we find 
207_143321_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Huh grunted Jacinto and then he called to the paddlers to increase their strokes 
207_143321_000056_000000	train-clean-360	The journey up the river was not very eventful 
none	none	Many alligators were seen and Tom and Ned shot several with the electric rifle 
207_143321_000056_000002	train-clean-360	Toward the close of the third day s travel there was a cry from one of the rear boats and an alarm of a man having fallen overboard was given 
207_143321_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Tom turned in time to see the poor fellow s struggles and at the same time there was a swirl in the water and a black object shot forward 
207_143321_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 An alligator is after him yelled Ned 
none	none	I see observed Tom calmly Hand me the rifle Ned 
207_143321_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Tom took quick aim and pulled the trigger 
207_143321_000060_000001	train-clean-360	The explosive electric bullet went true to its mark and the great animal turned over in a death struggle 
none	none	But the river was filled with them and no sooner had the one nearest the unfortunate Indian been disposed of than another made a dash for the man 
207_143321_000061_000000	train-clean-360	There was a wild scream of agony and then a dark arm shot up above the red foam 
none	none	The waters seethed and bubbled as the alligators fought under it for possession of the paddler 
207_143321_000061_000002	train-clean-360	Tom fired bullet after bullet from his wonderful rifle into the spot but though he killed some of the alligators this did not save the man s life 
207_143321_000061_000003	train-clean-360	His body was not seen again though search was made for it 
207_143321_000062_000000	train-clean-360	The accident cast a little damper over the party and there was a feeling of gloom among the Indians 
207_143321_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Professor Bumper announced that he would see to it that the man s family did not want and this seemed to give general satisfaction especially to a brother who was with the party 
207_143321_000063_000000	train-clean-360	Aside from being caught in a drenching storm and one or two minor accidents nothing else of moment marked the remainder of the river journey and at the end of the third day the canoes pulled to shore and a night camp was made 
207_143321_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 But where are the mules we are to use in traveling to morrow asked the professor of Jacinto 
207_143321_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 In the next village 
207_143321_000065_000001	train-clean-360	We shall march there in the morning 
207_143321_000065_000002	train-clean-360	No use to go there at night when all is dark 
207_143321_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose that is so 
207_143321_000067_000000	train-clean-360	The Indians made camp as usual the goods being brought from the canoes and piled up near the tents 
207_143321_000067_000001	train-clean-360	Then night settled down 
207_143321_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Hello cried Tom awakening the next morning to find the sun streaming into his tent 
207_143321_000068_000001	train-clean-360	 We must have overslept Ned 
none	none	We were to start before old Sol got in his heavy work but we haven t had breakfast yet
207_143321_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 I didn t hear any one call us remarked Ned 
207_143321_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Nor I Wonder if we re the only lazy birds He looked from the tent in time to see mister Damon and the professor emerging 
207_143321_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Then Tom noticed something queer 
207_143321_000070_000002	train-clean-360	The canoes were not on the river bank 
207_143321_000070_000003	train-clean-360	There was not an Indian in sight and no evidence of Jacinto 
none	none	What s the matter asked the young inventor Have the others gone on ahead
207_143321_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 I rather think they ve gone back was the professor s dry comment 
207_143321_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 gone back 
none	none	was the professor s dry comment Gone back Yes The Indians seem to have deserted us at the ending of this stage of our journey
207_143321_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Bless my time table cried mister Damon 
207_143321_000075_000001	train-clean-360	 You don t say so 
207_143321_000075_000002	train-clean-360	What does it mean 
207_143321_000075_000003	train-clean-360	What has becomes of our friend Jacinto 
none	none	I m afraid he was rather a false friend was the professor s answer This is the note he left He has gone and taken the canoes and all the Indians with him and he held out a paper on which was some scribbled writing CHAPTER XIII FORWARD AGAIN What does it all mean asked Tom seeing that the note was written in Spanish a tongue which he could speak slightly but read indifferently This is some of Beecher s work was Professor Bumper s grim comment It seems that Jacinto was in his pay In his pay cried mister Damon Do you mean that Beecher deliberately hired Jacinto to betray us Well no Not that exactly Here I ll translate this note for you and the professor proceeded to read Senors I greatly regret the step I have to take but I am a gentleman and having given my word I must keep it No harm shall come to you I swear it on my honor Queer idea of honor he has commented Tom grimly Professor Bumper read on Know then that before I engaged myself to you I had been engaged by Professor Beecher through a friend to guide him into the Copan valley where he wants to make some explorations for what I know not save maybe that it is for gold I agreed in case any rival expeditions came to lead them astray if I could So knowing from what you said that you were going to this place I engaged myself to you planning to do what I have done I greatly regret it as I have come to like you but I had given my promise to Professor Beecher s friend that I would first lead him to the Copan valley and would keep others away until he had had a chance to do his exploration So I have led you to this wilderness It is far from the Copan but you are near an Indian village and you will be able to get help in a week or so In the meanwhile you will not starve as you have plenty of supplies If you will travel northeast you will come again to Puerto Cortes in due season As for the money I had from you I deposit it to your credit Professor Beecher having made me an allowance for steering rival parties on the wrong trail So I lose nothing and I save my honor I write this note as I am leaving in the night with the Indians I put some harmless sedative in your tea that you might sleep soundly and not awaken until we were well on our way Do not try to follow us as the river will carry us swiftly away And let me add there is no personal animosity on the part of Professor Beecher against you I should have done to any rival expedition the same as I have done with you JACINTO For a moment there was silence and then Tom Swift burst out with Well of all the mean contemptible tricks of a human skunk this is the limit Bless my hairbrush but he is a scoundrel ejaculated mister Damon with great warmth I d like to start after him the biggest alligator in the river was Ned s comment Professor Bumper said nothing for several seconds There was a strange look on his face and then he laughed shortly as though the humor of the situation appealed to him Professor Beecher has more gumption than I gave him credit for he said It was a clever trick Trick cried Tom Yes I can t exactly agree that it was the right thing to do but he or some friend acting for him seems to have taken precautions that we are not to suffer or lose money Beecher goes on the theory that all is fair in love and war I suppose and he may call this a sort of scientific war Ned wondered as he looked at his chum how much love there was in it Clearly Beecher was determined to get that idol of gold Well it can t be helped and we must make the best of it said Tom after a pause True But now boys let s have breakfast and then we ll make what goods we can t take with us as snug as possible until we can send the mule drivers after them went on Professor Bumper Send the mule drivers after them questioned Ned What do you mean to do Do Why keep on of course You don t suppose I m going to let a little thing like this stand between me and the discovery of Kurzon and the idol of gold do you But began mister Damon I don t see how Oh we ll find a way interrupted Tom It isn t the first time I ve been pretty well stranded on an expedition of this kind and sometimes from the same cause the actions of a rival Now we ll turn the tables on the other fellows and see how they like it The professor s right let s have breakfast Jacinto seems to have told the truth Nothing of ours is missing Tom and Ned got the meal and then a consultation was held as to what was best to be done We can t go on any further by water that s sure said Tom In the first place the river is too shallow and secondly we have no canoes So the only thing is to go on foot through the jungle But how can we and carry all this stuff asked Ned We needn t carry it cried Professor Bumper We ll leave it here where it will be safe enough and tramp on to the nearest Indian village There we ll hire bearers to take our stuff on until we can get mules I m not going to turn back Good cried mister Damon Bless my rubber boots but that s what I say keep on Oh no we ll never turn back agreed Tom But how can we manage it asked Ned We ve just got to And when you have to do a thing it s a whole lot easier to do than if you just feel as though you ought to So lively is the word cried Tom in answer We ll pack up what we can carry and leave the rest added the scientist Being an experienced traveler Professor Bumper had arranged his baggage so that it could be carried by porters if necessary Everything could be put into small packages including the tents and food supply There are four of us remarked Tom and if we can not pack enough along with us to enable us to get to the nearest village we had better go back to civilization I m not afraid to try Nor I cried mister Damon The baggage stores and supplies that were to be left behind were made as snug as possible and so piled up that wild beasts could do the least harm Then a pack was made up for each one to carry They would take weapons of course Tom Swift s electric rifle being the one he choose for himself They expected to be able to shoot game on their way and this would provide them food in addition to the concentrated supply they carried Small tents in sections were carried there being two one for Tom and Ned and one for mister Damon and the professor As far as could be learned from a casual inspection Jacinto and his deserting Indians had taken back with them only a small quantity of food They were traveling light and down stream and could reach the town much more quickly than they had come away from it That Beecher certainly was slick commented Professor Bumper when they were ready to start He must have known about what time I would arrive and he had Jacinto waiting for us I thought it was too good to be true to get an experienced guide like him so easily But it was all planned and I was so engrossed in thinking of the ancient treasures I hope to find that I never thought of a possible trick Well let s start and he led the way into the jungle carrying his heavy pack as lightly as did Tom Professor Bumper had a general idea in which direction lay a number of native villages and it was determined to head for them blazing a path through the wilderness so that the Indians could follow it back to the goods left behind It was with rather heavy hearts that the party set off but Tom s spirits could not long stay clouded and the scientist was so good natured about the affair and seemed so eager to do the utmost to render Beecher s trick void that the others fell into a lighter mood and went on more cheerfully though the way was rough and the packs heavy They stopped at noon under a bower they made of palms and spreading the nets over them got a little rest after a lunch Then when the sun was less hot they started off again Forward is the word cried Ned cheerfully Forward They had not gone more than an hour on the second stage of their tramp when Tom who was in the lead following the direction laid out by the compass suddenly stopped and reached around for his electric rifle which he was carrying at his back What is it asked Ned in a whisper I don t know but it s some big animal there in the bushes was Tom s low voiced answer I m ready for it The rustling increased and a form could be seen indistinctly Tom aimed the deadly gun and stood ready to pull the trigger Ned who had a side view into the underbrush gave a sudden cry Don t shoot Tom he yelled It s a man CHAPTER XIV A NEW GUIDE In spite of Ned Newton s cry Tom s finger pressed the switch trigger of the electric rifle for previous experience had taught him that it was sometimes the best thing to awe the natives in out of the way corners of the earth But the young inventor quickly elevated the muzzle and the deadly missile went hissing through the air over the head of a native Indian who at that moment stepped from the bush The man startled and alarmed shrank back and was about to run into the jungle whence he had emerged Small wonder if he had considering the reception he so unwittingly met with But Tom aware of the necessity for making inquiries of one who knew that part of the jungle quickly called to him Hold on he shouted Wait a minute I didn t mean that I thought at first you were a tapir or a tiger No harm intended I say Professor Tom called back to the savant you d better speak to him in his lingo I can t manage it He may be useful in guiding us to that Indian village Jacinto told us of This Professor Bumper did being able to make himself understood in the queer part Spanish dialect used by the native Hondurians though he could not of course speak it as fluently as had Jacinto Professor Bumper had made only a few remarks to the man who had so unexpectedly appeared out of the jungle when the scientist gave an exclamation of surprise at some of the answers made Bless my moving picture cried mister Damon What s the matter now Is anything wrong Does he refuse to help us No it isn t that was the answer In fact he came here to help us Tom this is the brother of the Indian who fell overboard and who was eaten by the alligators He says you were very kind to try to save his brother with your rifle and for that reason he has come back to help us Come back queried Tom Yes he went off with the rest of the Indians when Jacinto deserted us but he could not stand being a traitor after you had tried to save his brother s life These Indians are queer people They don t show much emotion but they have deep feelings This one says he will devote himself to your service from now on I believe we can count on him He is deeply grateful to you Tom I m glad of that for all our sakes But what does he say about Jacinto The professor asked some more questions receiving answers and then translated them This Indian whose name is Tolpec says Jacinto is a fraud exclaimed Professor Bumper He made all the Indians leave us in the night though many of them were willing to stay and fill the contract they had made But Jacinto would not let them making them desert Tolpec went away with the others but because of what Tom had done he planned to come back at the first chance and be our guide Accordingly he jumped ashore from one of the canoes and made his way to our camp He got there found it deserted and followed us coming up just now Well I m glad I didn t frighten him off with my gun remarked Tom grimly So he agrees with us that Jacinto is a scoundrel does he I guess he might as well classify Professor Beecher in the same way I am not quite so sure of that said Professor Bumper slowly I can not believe Beecher would play such a trick as this though some over zealous friend of his might Oh of course Beecher did it cried Tom He heard we were coming here figured out that we d start ahead of him and he wanted to side track us Well he did it all right and Tom s voice was bitter He has only side tracked us for a while announced Professor Bumper in cheerful tones What do you mean asked mister Damon I mean that this Indian comes just in the nick of time He is well acquainted with this part of the jungle having lived here all his life and he offers to guide us to a place where we can get mules to transport ourselves and our baggage to Copan Fine cried Ned When can we start Once more the professor and the native conversed in the strange tongue and then Professor Bumper announced He says it will be better for us to go back where we left our things and camp there He will stay with us to night and in the morning go on to the nearest Indian town and come back with porters and helpers I think that is good advice to follow put in Tom for we do need our goods and if we reached the settlement ourselves we would have to send back for our things with the uncertainty of getting them all So it was agreed that they would make a forced march back through the jungle to where they had been deserted by Jacinto There they would make camp for the night and until such time as Tolpec could return with a force of porters It was not easy that backward tramp through the jungle especially as night had fallen But the new Indian guide could see like a cat and led the party along paths they never could have found by themselves The use of their pocket electric lights was a great help and possibly served to ward off the attacks of jungle beasts for as they tramped along they could hear stealthy sounds in the underbush on either side of the path as though tigers were stalking them For there was in the woods an animal of the leopard family called tiger or tigre by the natives that was exceedingly fierce and dangerous But watchfulness prevented any accident and eventually the party reached the place where they had left their goods Nothing had been disturbed and finally a fire was made the tents set up and a light meal with hot tea served We ll get ahead of Beecher yet said Tom You seem as anxious as Professor Bumper observed mister Damon I guess I am admitted Tom I want to see that idol of gold in the possession of our party The night passed without incident and then telling his new friends that he would return as soon as possible with help Tolpec taking a small supply of food with him set out through the jungle again As the green vines and creepers closed after him and the explorers were left alone with their possessions piled around them Ned remarked After all I wonder if it was wise to let him go Why not asked Tom Well maybe he only wanted to get us back here and then he ll desert too Maybe that s what he s done now making us lose two or three days by inducing us to return waiting for what will never happen his return with other natives A silence followed Ned s intimation CHAPTER XV IN THE COILS Ned do you really think Tolpec is going to desert us asked Tom Well I don t know was the slowly given reply It s a possibility isn t it Yes it is broke in Professor Bumper But what if it is We might as well trust him and if he proves true as I believe he will we ll be so much better off If he proves a traitor we ll only have lost a few days for if he doesn t come back we can go on again in the way we started But that s just it complained Tom We don t want to lose any time with that Beecher chap on our trail I am not so very much concerned about him remarked Professor Bumper dryly Why not snapped out mister Damon Well because I think he ll have just about as hard work locating the hidden city and finding the idol of gold as we ll have In other words it will be an even thing unless he gets too far ahead of us or keeps us back and I don t believe he can do that now So I thought it best to take a chance with this Indian He would hardly have taken the trouble to come all the way back and run the risks he did just to delay us a few days However we ll soon know Meanwhile we ll take it easy and wait for the return of Tolpec and his friends Though none of them liked to admit it Ned s words had caused his three friends some anxiety and though they busied themselves about the camp there was an air of waiting impatiently for something to occur And waiting is about the hardest work there is But there was nothing for it but to wait and it might be at least a week Professor Bumper said before the Indian could return with a party of porters and mules to move their baggage Yes Tolpec has not only to locate the settlement Tom admitted but he must persuade the natives to come back with him He may have trouble in that especially if it is known that he has left Jacinto who I imagine is a power among the tribes here But there were only two things left to do wait and hope The travelers did both Four days passed and there was no sign of Tolpec Eagerly and not a little anxiously they watched the jungle path along which he had disappeared Oh come on exclaimed Tom one morning when the day seemed a bit cooler than its predecessor Let s go for a hunt or something I m tired of sitting around camp Bless my watch hands So am I cried mister Damon Let s all go for a trip It will do us good And perhaps I can get some specimens of interest added Professor Bumper who in addition to being an archaeologist was something of a naturalist Accordingly having made everything snug in camp the party Tom and Ned equipped with electric rifles and the professor with a butterfly net and specimen boxes set forth mister Damon said he would carry a stout club as his weapon The jungle as usual was teeming with life but as Ned and Tom did not wish to kill wantonly they refrained from shooting until later in the day For once it was dead game did not keep well in that hot climate and needed to be cooked almost immediately We ll try some shots on our back trip said the young inventor Professor Bumper found plenty of his own particular kind of game which he caught in the net transferring the specimens to the boxes he carried There were beautiful butterflies moths and strange bugs in the securing of which the scientist evinced great delight though when one beetle nipped him firmly and painfully on his thumb his involuntary cry of pain was as real as that of any other person But I didn t let him get away he said in triumph when he had dropped the clawing insect into the cyanide bottle where death came painlessly It is well worth a sore thumb They wandered on through the jungle taking care not to get too far from their camp for they did not want to lose their way nor did they want to be absent too long in case Tolpec and his native friends should return Well it s about time we shot something I think remarked Ned when they had been out about two hours Let s try for some of these wild turkeys They ought to go well roasted even if it isn t Thanksgiving I m with you agreed Tom Let s see who has the best luck But tone down the charge in your rifle and use a smaller projectile or you ll have nothing but a bunch of feathers to show for your shot The guns are loaded for deer The change was made and once more the two young men started off a little ahead of Professor Bumper and mister Damon Tom and Ned had not gone far however before they heard a strange cry from mister Damon Tom Ned shouted the eccentric man Here s a monster after me Come quick A tiger ejaculated Tom as he began once more to change the charge in his rifle to a larger one running back meanwhile in the direction of the sound of the voice There were really no tigers in Honduras the jaguar being called a tiger by the natives while the cougar is called a lion The presence of these animals often dangerous to man had been indicated around camp and it was possible that one had been bold enough to attack mister Damon not through hunger but because of being cornered Come on Ned cried Tom He s in some sort of trouble But when a moment later the young inventor burst through a fringe of bushes and saw mister Damon standing in a little clearing with upraised club Tom could not repress a laugh Kill it Tom Kill it begged the eccentric man Bless my insurance policy but it s a terrible beast And so it was at first glance For it was a giant iguana one of the most repulsive looking of the lizards Not unlike an alligator in shape with spikes on its head and tail with a warty squatty ridge encrusted body a big pouch beneath its chin and long toed claws it was enough to strike terror into the heart of almost any one Even the smaller ones look dangerous and this one which was about five feet long looked capable of attacking a man and injuring him As a matter of fact the iguanas are harmless their shape and coloring being designed to protect them Don t be afraid mister Damon called Tom still laughing It won t hurt you I m not so positive of that It won t let me pass Just take your club and poke it out of the way the young inventor advised It s only waiting to be shoved Then you do it Tom Bless my looking glass but I don t want to go near it If my wife could see me now she d say it served me just right mister Damon was not a coward but the giant iguana was not pleasant to look at Tom with the butt of his rifle gave it a gentle shove whereupon the creature scurried off through the brush as though glad to make its escape unscathed I thought it was a new kind of alligator said mister Damon with a sigh of relief Where is it asked Professor Bumper coming up at this juncture A new species of alligator Let me see it It s too horrible said mister Damon I never want to see one again It was worse than a vampire bat Notwithstanding this when he heard that it was one of the largest sized iguanas ever seen the professor started through the jungle after it We can t take it with us if we get it Tom called after his friend We might take the skin answered the professor I have a standing order for such things from one of the museums I represent I d like to get it Then they are often eaten We can have a change of diet you see We d better follow him said Tom to Ned We ll have to let the turkeys go for a while He may get into trouble Come on Off they started through the jungle trailing after the impetuous professor who was intent on capturing the iguana The giant lizard s progress could be traced by the disturbance of the leaves and underbrush and the professor was following as closely as possible So fast did he go that Ned Tom and mister Damon following lost sight of him several times and Tom finally called Wait a minute We ll all be lost if you keep this up I ll have him in another minute answered the professor I can almost reach him now Then Oh His voice ended in a scream that seemed to be one of terror So sudden was the change that Tom and Ned who were together ahead of mister Damon looked at one another in fear What has happened whispered Ned pausing Don t stop to ask come on shouted Tom At that instant again came the voice of the savant Tom Ned he gasped rather than cried I m caught in the coils Quick quick if you would save me In the coils repeated Ned What does he mean Can the giant iguana Tom Swift did not stop to answer With his electric rifle in readiness he leaped forward through the jungle CHAPTER XVI A MEETING IN THE JUNGLE Before Tom and Ned reached the place whence Professor Bumper had called they heard strange noises other than the imploring voice of their friend It seemed as though some great body was threshing about in the jungle lashing the trees bushes and leaves about and when the two young men followed by mister Damon reached the scene they saw that in a measure this really accounted for what they heard Something like a great whip was beating about close to two trees that grew near together And then when the storm of twigs leaves and dirt caused by the leaping threshing thing ceased for a moment the onlookers saw something that filled them with terror Between the two trees and seemingly bound to them by a great coiled rope spotted and banded was the body of Professor Bumper His arms were pinioned to his sides and there was horror and terror on his face that looked imploringly at the youths from above the topmost coil of those encircling him What is it cried mister Damon as he ran pantingly up What has caught him Is it the giant iguana It s a snake a great boa gasped Tom It has him in its coils But it is wound around the trees too That alone prevents it from crushing the professor to death Ned be ready with your rifle Put in the heaviest charge and watch your chance to fire The great ugly head of the boa reared itself up from the coils which it had with the quickness of thought thrown about the man between the two trees This species of snake is not poisonous and kills its prey by crushing it to death making it into a pulpy mass with scarcely a bone left unbroken after which it swallows its meal The crushing power of one of these boas some of which reach a length of thirty feet with a body as large around as that of a full grown man is enormous I m going to fire suddenly cried Tom He had seen his chance and he took it There was the faint report the crack of the electric rifle and the folds of the serpent seemed to relax I see a good chance now added Ned who had taken the small charge from his weapon replacing it with a heavier one His rifle was also discharged in the direction of the snake and Tom saw that the hit was a good one right through the ugly head of the reptile One other will be enough to make him loosen his coils cried Tom as he fired again and such was the killing power of the electric bullets that the snake though an immense one and one that short of decapitation could have received many injuries without losing power seemed to shrivel up Its folds relaxed and the coils of the great body fell in a heap at the roots of the two trees between which the scientist had been standing Professor Bumper seemed to fall backward as the grip of the serpent relaxed but Tom dropping his rifle and calling to Ned to keep an eye on the snake leaped forward and caught his friend Are you hurt asked Tom carrying the limp form over to a grassy place There was no answer the savant s eyes were closed and he breathed but faintly Ned Newton fired two more electric bullets into the still writhing body of the boa I guess he s all in he called to Tom Bless my horseradish And so our friend seems to be commented mister Damon Have you anything with which to revive him Tom Yes Some ammonia See if you can find a little water I have some in my flask Tom mixed a dose of the spirits which he carried with him and this forced between the pallid lips of the scientist revived him What happened he asked faintly as he opened his eyes Oh yes I remember he added slowly The boa Don t try to talk urged Tom You re all right The snake is dead or dying Are you much hurt Professor Bumper appeared to be considering He moved first one limb then another He seemed to have the power over all his muscles I see how it happened he said as he sat up after taking a little more of the ammonia I was following the iguana and when the big lizard came to a stop in a little hollow place in the ground at the foot of those two trees I leaned over to slip a noose of rope about its neck Then I felt myself caught as if in the hands of a giant and bound fast between the two trees It was the big boa that whipped itself around you as you leaned over explained Tom as Ned came up to announce that the snake was no longer dangerous But when it coiled around you it also coiled around the two trees you fortunately slipping between them Had it not been that their trunks took off some of the pressure of the coils you wouldn t have lasted a minute Well I was pretty badly squeezed as it was remarked the professor I hardly had breath enough left to call to you I tried to fight off the serpent but it was of no use I should say not cried mister Damon Bless my circus ring one might as well try to combat an elephant But my dear professor are you all right now I think so yes Though I shall be lame and stiff for a few days I fear I can hardly walk Professor Bumper was indeed unable to go about much for a few days after his encounter with the great serpent He stretched out in a hammock under trees in the camp clearing and with his friends waited for the possible return of Tolpec and the porters Ned and Tom made one or two short hunting trips and on these occasions they kept a lookout in the direction the Indian had taken when he went away For he s sure to come back that way if he comes at all declared Ned which I am beginning to doubt Well he may not come agreed Tom who was beginning to lose some of his first hope But he won t necessarily come from the same direction he took He may have had to go in an entirely different way to get help We ll hope for the best A week passed Professor Bumper was able to be about and Tom and Ned noticed that there was an anxious look on his face Was he too beginning to despair Well this isn t hunting for golden idols very fast said mister Damon the morning of the eighth day after their desertion by the faithless Jacinto What do you say Professor Bumper ought we not to start off on our own account We had better if Tolpec does not return today was the answer They had eaten breakfast had put their camp in order and were about to have a consultation on what was best to do when Tom suddenly called to Ned who was whistling Hark Through the jungle came a faint sound of singing not a harmonious air but the somewhat barbaric chant of the natives It is Tolpec coming back cried mister Damon Hurray Now our troubles are over Bless my meal ticket Now we can start It may be Jacinto suggested Ned Nonsense you old cold water pitcher cried Tom It s Tolpec I can see him He s a good scout all right And then walking at the head of a band of Indians who were weirdly chanting while behind them came a train of mules was Tolpec a cheerful grin covering his honest if homely dark face Me come back he exclaimed in gutteral English using about half of his foreign vocabulary I see you did answered Professor Bumper in the man s own tongue Glad to see you Is everything all right All right was the answer These Indians will take you where you want to go and will not leave you as Jacinto did We ll start in the morning exclaimed the savant his own cheerful self again now that there was a prospect of going further into the interior Tell the men to get something to eat Tolpec There is plenty for all Good grunted the new guide and soon the hungry Indians who had come far were satisfying their hunger As they ate Tolpec explained to Professor Bumper who repeated it to the youths and mister Damon that it had been necessary to go farther than he had intended to get the porters and mules But the Indians were a friendly tribe of which he was a member and could be depended on There was a feast and a sort of celebration in camp that night Tom and Ned shot two deer and these formed the main part of the feast and the Indians made merry about the fire until nearly midnight They did not seem to mind in the least the swarms of mosquitoes and other bugs that flew about attracted by the light As for Tom Swift and his friends their nets protected them An early start was made the following morning Such packages of goods and supplies as could not well be carried by the Indians in their head straps were loaded on the backs of the pack mules Tolpec explained that on reaching the Indian village where he had secured the porters they could get some ox carts which would be a convenience in traveling into the interior toward the Copan valley The march onward for the next two days was tiresome but the Indians Tolpec had secured were as faithful and efficient as he had described them and good progress was made There were a few accidents One native fell into a swiftly running stream as they were fording it and lost a box containing some much needed things But as the man s life was saved Professor Bumper said it made up for the other loss Another accident did not end so auspiciously One of the bearers was bitten by a poisonous snake and though prompt measures were taken the poison spread so rapidly that the man died In due season the Indian village was reached where after a day spent in holding funeral services over the dead bearer preparations were made for proceeding farther This time some of the bearers were left behind and ox carts were substituted for them as it was possible to carry more goods this way And now we re really off for Copan exclaimed Professor Bumper one morning when the cavalcade led by Tolpec in the capacity of head guide started off I hope we have no more delays I hope not either agreed Tom That Beecher may be there ahead of us Weary marches fell to their portion There were mountains to climb streams to ford or swim sending the carts over on rudely made rafts There were storms to endure and the eternal heat to fight But finally the party emerged from the lowlands of the coast and went up in among the hills where though the going was harder the climate was better It was not so hot and moist Not wishing to attract attention in Copan itself Professor Bumper and his party made a detour and finally after much consultation with Tom over the ancient maps the scientist announced that he thought they were in the vicinity of the buried city We will begin test excavations in the morning he said The party was in camp and preparations were made for spending the night in the forest when from among the trees there floated to the ears of our friends a queer Indian chant Some one is coming said Tom to Ned Almost as he spoke there filed into the clearing where the camp had been set up a cavalcade of white men followed by Indians And at the sight of one of the white men Tom Swift uttered a cry Professor Beecher gasped the young inventor CHAPTER XVII THE LOST MAP The on marching company of white men with their Indian attendants came to a halt on the edge of the clearing as they caught sight of the tents already set up there The barbaric chant of the native bearers ceased abruptly and there was a look of surprise shown on the face of Professor Fenimore Beecher For Professor Beecher it was in the lead of the rival expedition Bless my shoe laces exclaimed mister Damon Is it really Beecher asked Ned though he knew as well as Tom that it was the young archaeologist It certainly is declared Tom And he has nerve to follow us so closely Maybe he thinks we have nerve to get here ahead of him suggested Ned smiling grimly Probably agreed Tom with a short laugh Well it evidently surprises him to find us here at all after the mean trick he played on us to get Jacinto to lead us into the jungle and desert us That s right assented Ned Well what s the next move There seemed to be some doubt about this on the part of both expeditions At the sight of Professor Beecher Professor Bumper who had come out of his tent hurriedly turned to Tom and asked him what he thought it best to do Do exclaimed the eccentric mister Damon not giving Tom time to reply Why stand your ground of course Bless my house and lot but we re here first For the matter of that I suppose the jungle is free and we can no more object to his coming here than he can to our coming First come first served I suppose is the law of the forest Meanwhile the surprise occasioned by the unexpected meeting of their rivals seemed to have spread something like consternation among the white members of the Beecher party As for the natives they evidently did not care one way or the other There was a hasty consultation among the professors accompanying mister Beecher and then the latter himself advanced toward the tents of Tom and his friends and asked How long have you been here I don t see that we are called upon to answer that question replied Professor Bumper stiffly Perhaps not and yet There is no perhaps about it said Professor Bumper quickly I know what your object is as I presume you do mine And after what I may term your disgraceful and unsportsmanlike conduct toward me and my friends I prefer not to have anything further to do with you We must meet as strangers hereafter Very well and Professor Beecher s voice was as cold and uncompromising as was his rival s Let it be as your wish But I must say I don t know what you mean by unsportsmanlike conduct An explanation would be wasted on you said Professor Bumper stiffly But in order that you may know I fully understand what you did I will say that your efforts to thwart us through your tool Jacinto came to nothing We are here ahead of you Jacinto cried Professor Beecher in real or simulated surprise Why he was not my tool as you term it Your denial is useless in the light of his confession asserted Professor Bumper Confession Now look here exclaimed the older professor I do not propose to lower myself by quarreling with you I know certainly what you and your party tried to do to prevent us from getting here But we got out of the trap you set for us and we are on the ground first I recognize your right to make explorations as well as ourselves and I presume you have not fallen so low that you will not recognize the unwritten law in a case of this kind the law which says the right of discovery belongs to the one who first makes it I shall certainly abide by such conduct as is usual under the circumstances said Professor Beecher more stiffly than before At the same time I must deny having set a trap And as for Jacinto It will be useless to discuss it further broke in Professor Bumper Then no more need be said retorted the younger man I shall give orders to my friends as well as to the natives to keep away from your camp and I shall expect you to do the same regarding mine I should have suggested the same thing myself came from Tom s friend and the two rival scientists fairly glared at one another the others of both parties looking on with interest Professor Bumper turned and walked defiantly back to his tent Professor Beecher did the same thing Then after a short consultation among the white members of the latter s organization their tents were set up in another clearing removed and separated by a screen of trees and bushes from those of Tom Swift s friends The natives of the Beecher party also withdrew a little way from those of Professor Bumper s organization and then preparations for spending the night in the jungle went on in the rival headquarters Well he certainly had nerve to deny practically that he had set Jacinto up to do what he did commented Tom I should say so agreed Ned How do you imagine he got here nearly as soon as we did when he did not start until later asked mister Damon He did not have the unfortunate experience of being deserted in the jungle replied Tom He probably had Jacinto or some of that unprincipled scoundrel s friends show him a short route to Copan and he came on from there Well I did hope we might have the ground to ourselves at least for the preliminary explorations and excavations But it is not to be My rival is here sighed Professor Bumper Don t let that discourage you exclaimed Tom We can fight all the better now the foe is in the open and we know where he is Yes Tom Swift that is true agreed the scientist I am not going to give up but I shall have to change my plans a little Perhaps you will come into the tent with me and he nodded to Tom and Ned I want to talk over certain matters with you and mister Damon Pleased to assented the young inventor and his financial secretary nodded A little later supper having been eaten the camp made shipshape and the natives settled down Tom Ned mister Damon and Professor Bumper assembled in the tent of the scientist where a dry battery lamp gave sufficient illumination to show a number of maps and papers scattered over an improvised table Now gentlemen said the professor I have called you here to go over my plans more in detail than I have hitherto done now we are on the ground You know in a general way what I hope to accomplish but the time has come when I must be specific Aside from being on the spot below which or below the vicinity where I believe lies the lost city of Kurzon and I hope the idol of gold a situation has arisen an unexpected situation I may say which calls for different action from that I had counted on I refer to the presence of my rival Professor Beecher I will not dwell now on what he has done It is better to consider what he may do That s right agreed Ned He may get up in the night dig up this city and skip with that golden image before we know it Hardly grinned Tom No said Professor Bumper Excavating buried cities in the jungle of Honduras is not as simple as that There is much work to be done But accidents may happen and in case one should occur to me and I be unable to prosecute the search I want one of you to do it For that reason I am going to show you the maps and ancient documents and point out to you where I believe the lost city lies Now if you will give me your attention I ll proceed The professor went over in detail the story of how he had found the old documents relating to the lost city of Kurzon and of how after much labor and research he had located the city in the Copan valley The great idol of gold was one of the chief possessions of Kurzon and it was often referred to in the old papers copies and translations of which the professor had with him But this is the most valuable of all he said as he opened an oiled silk packet And before I show it to you suppose you two young men take a look outside the tent What for asked mister Damon To make sure that no emissaries from the Beecher crowd are sneaking around to overhear what we say was the somewhat bitter answer of the scientist I do not trust him in spite of his attempted denial Tom and Ned took a quick but thorough observation outside the tent The blackness of the jungle night was in strange contrast to the light they had just left Doesn t seem to be any one around here remarked Ned after waiting a minute or two No All s quiet along the Potomac Those Beecher natives are having some sort of a song fest though In the distance and from the direction of their rivals camp came the weird chant Well as long as they stay there we ll be all right said Tom Come on in I m anxious to hear what the professor has to say Everything s quiet reported Ned Then give me your attention begged the scientist Carefully as though about to exhibit some precious jewel he loosened the oiled silk wrappings and showed a large map on thin but tough paper This is drawn from the old charts the professor explained I worked on it many months and it is the only copy in the world If it were to be destroyed I should have to go all the way back to New York to make another copy I have the original there in a safe deposit vault Wouldn t it have been wise to make two copies asked Tom It would have only increased the risk With one copy and that constantly in my possession I can be sure of my ground Otherwise not That is why I am so careful of this Now I will show you why I believe we are about over the ancient city of Kurzon Over it cried mister Damon Bless my gunpowder What do you mean and he looked down at the earthen floor of the tent as though expecting it to open and swallow him I mean that the city like many others of Central and South America is buried below the refuse of centuries went on the professor Very soon if we are fortunate we shall be looking on the civilization of hundreds of years ago how long no one knows Considerable excavation has been done in Central America went on Professor Bumper and certain ruins have been brought to light Near us are those of Copan while toward the frontier are those of Quirigua which are even better preserved than the former We may visit them if we have time But I have reason to believe that in this section of Copan is a large city the existence of which has not been made certain of by any one save myself and perhaps Professor Beecher Certainly no part of it has seen the light of day for many centuries It shall be our pleasure to uncover it if possible and secure the idol of gold How long ago do you think the city was buried asked Tom It would be hard to say From the carvings and hieroglyphics I have studied it would seem that the Mayan civilization lasted about five hundred years and that it began perhaps in the year A D five hundred That would mean said mister Damon that the ancient cities were in ruins buried perhaps long before Columbus discovered the new world Yes assented the professor Probably Kurzon which we now seek was buried deep for nearly five hundred years before Columbus landed at San Salvadore The specimens of writing and architecture heretofore disclosed indicate that But as a matter of fact it is very hard to decipher the Mayan pictographs So far little but the ability to read their calendars and numerical system is possessed by us though we are gradually making headway Now this is the map of the district and by the markings you can see where I hope to find what I seek We shall begin digging here and he made a small mark with a pencil on the map Of course the professor explained I may be wrong and it will take some time to discover the error if we make one When a city is buried thirty or forty feet deep beneath earth and great trees have grown over it it is not easy to dig down to it How do you ever expect to find it asked Ned Well we will sink shafts here and there If we find carved stones the remains of ancient pottery and weapons parts of buildings or building stones we shall know we are on the right track was the answer And now that I have shown you the map and explained how valuable it is I will put it away again We shall begin our excavations in the morning At what point asked Tom At a point I shall indicate after a further consultation of the map I must see the configuration of the country by daylight to decide And now let s get some rest We have had a hard day The two tents housing the four white members of the Bumper party were close together and it was decided that the night would be divided into four watches to guard against possible treachery on the part of the Beecher crowd It seems an unkind precaution to take against a fellow scientist said Professor Bumper but I can not afford to take chances after what has occurred The others agreed with him and though standing guard was not pleasant it was done However the night passed without incident and then came morning and the excitement of getting breakfast over which the Indians made merry They did not like the cold and darkness and always welcomed the sun no matter how hot And now cried Tom when the meal was over let us begin the work that has brought us here Yes agreed Professor Bumper I will consult the map and start the diggers where I think the city lies far below the surface Now gentlemen if you will give me your attention He was seeking through his outer coat pockets after an ineffectual search in the inner one A strange look came over his face What s the matter asked Tom The map the map gasped the professor The map I was showing you last night The map that tells where we are to dig for the idol of gold It s gone The map gone gasped mister Damon I I m afraid so faltered the professor I put it away carefully but now He ceased speaking to make a further search in all his pockets Maybe you left it in another coat suggested Ned Or maybe some of the Beecher crowd took it snapped Tom CHAPTER XVIII EL TIGRE The four men gazed at one another Consternation showed on the face of Professor Bumper and was reflected more or less on the countenances of his companions Are you sure the map is gone asked Tom I know how easy it is to mislay anything in a camp of this sort I couldn t at first find my safety razor this morning and when I did locate it the hoe was in one of my shoes I m sure a rat or some jungle animal must have dragged it there Now maybe they took your map Professor That oiled silk in which it was wrapped might have appealed to the taste of a rat or a snake It is no joking matter said Professor Bumper But I know you appreciate the seriousness of it as much as I do Tom But I had the map in the pocket of this coat and now it is gone When did you put it there asked Ned This morning just before I came to breakfast Oh then you have had it since last night Tom ejaculated Yes I slept with it under my clothes that I rolled up for a pillow and when it was my turn to stand guard I took it with me Then I put it back again and went to sleep When I awoke and dressed I put the packet in my pocket and ate breakfast Now when I look for it why it s gone The map or the oiled silk package asked mister Damon who once having been a businessman was sometimes a stickler for small points Both answered the professor I opened the silk to tie it more smoothly so it would not be such a lump in my pocket and I made sure the map was inside Then the whole thing has been taken or you have lost it suggested Ned I am not in the habit of losing valuable maps retorted the scientist And the pocket of my coat I had made deep for the purpose of carrying the long map It could not drop out Well we mustn t overlook any possible chances suggested Tom Come on now we ll search every inch of the ground over which you traveled this morning Professor It MUST be found murmured the scientist Without it all our work will go for naught They all went into the tent where the professor and mister Damon had slept when they were not on guard The camp was a busy place with the Indians finishing their morning meal and getting ready for the work of the day For word had been given out that there would be no more long periods of travel In consequence efforts were being directed by the head men of the bearers to making a more permanent camp in the wilderness Shelters of palm thatched huts were being built a site for cooking fires made and at the direction of mister Damon to whom this part was entrusted some sanitary regulations were insisted on Leaving this busy scene the four with solemn faces proceeded to the tent where it was hoped the map would be found But though they went through everything and traced and retraced every place the professor could remember having traversed about the canvas shelter no signs of the important document could be found I don t believe I dropped it out of my pocket said the scientist for perhaps the twentieth time Then it was taken declared Tom That s what I say chimed in Ned And by some of Beecher s party Easy my boy cautioned mister Damon We don t want to make accusations we can t prove That is true agreed Professor Bumper But though I am sorry to say it of a fellow archaelogist I can not help thinking Beecher had something to do with the taking of my map But how could any of them get it asked mister Damon You say you had the map this morning and certainly none of them has been in our camp since dawn though of course it is possible that some of them sneaked in during the night It does seem a mystery how it could have been taken in open daylight while we were about camp together said Tom But is the loss such a grave one Professor Bumper Very grave In fact I may say it is impossible to proceed with the excavating without the map Then what are we to do asked Ned We must get it back declared Tom Yes agreed the scientist we can not work without it As soon as I make a little further search to make sure it could not have dropped in some out of the way place I shall go over to Professor Beecher s camp and demand that he give me back my property Suppose he says he hasn t taken it asked Tom Well I m sure he either took it personally or one of his party did And yet I can t understand how they could have come here without our seeing them and the professor shook his head in puzzled despair A more detailed search did not reveal the missing map and mister Damon and his friend the scientist were on the point of departing for the camp of their rivals less than a mile away when Tom had what really amounted to an inspiration Look here Professor he cried Can you remember any of the details of your map say for instance where we ought to begin excavating to get at the wonders of the underground city Well Tom I did intend to compare my map with the configuration of the country about here There is a certain mountain which serves as a landmark and a guide for a starting point I think that is it over there and the scientist pointed to a distant snow capped peak The party had left the low and marshy land of the true jungle and were among the foothills though all about them was dense forest and underbush which in reality was as much a jungle as the lower plains but was less wet The point where I believe we should start to dig said the professor is near the spot where the top of the mountain casts a shadow when the sun is one hour high At least that is the direction given in the old manuscripts So though we can do little without the map we might make a start by digging there No not there exclaimed Tom Why not Because we don t want to let Beecher s crowd know that we are on the track of the idol of gold But they know anyhow for they have the map commented Ned puzzled by his chum s words Maybe not said Tom slowly I think this is a time for a big bluff It may work and it may not Beecher s crowd either has the map or they have not If they have it they will lose no time in trying to find the right place to start digging and then they ll begin excavating Very good If they do that we have a right to dig near the same place But if they have not the map which is possible and if we start to dig where the professor s memory tells him is the right spot we ll only give them the tip and they ll dig there also I m sure they have the map the professor said But I believe your plan is a good one Tom Just what do you propose doing asked Ned Fooling em exclaimed Tom quickly We ll dig in some place remote from the spot where the mountain casts its shadow They will think if they haven t the map that we are proceeding by it and they ll dig too When they find nothing as will also happen to us they may go away If on the other hand they have the map and see us digging at a spot not indicated on it they will be puzzled knowing we must have some idea of where the buried city lies They will think the map is at fault perhaps and not make use of it Then we can get it back Bless my hatband cried mister Damon I believe you re right Tom We ll dig in the wrong place to fool em And this was done Search for the precious map was given up for the time being and the professor and his friends set the natives to work digging shafts in the ground as though sinking them down to the level of the buried city But though this false work was prosecuted with vigor for several days there was a feeling of despair among the Bumper party over the loss of the map If we could only get it back exclaimed the professor again and again Meanwhile the Beecher party seemed inactive True some members of it did come over to look on from a respectful distance at what the diggers were doing Some of the rival helpers under the direction of the head of the expedition also began sinking shafts But they were not in the locality remembered by Professor Bumper as being correct I can t imagine what they re up to he said If they have my map they would act differently I should think Whatever they re up to answered Tom the time has come when we can dig at the place where we can hope for results And the following day shafts were started in the shadow of the mountain Until some evidence should have been obtained by digging as to the location beneath the surface of a buried city there was nothing for the travelers to do but wait Turns were taken in directing the efforts of the diggers and an occasional inspection was made of the shafts What do you expect to find first asked Tom of Professor Bumper one day when the latter was at the top of a shaft waiting for a bucket load of dirt to be hoisted up Potsherds and artifacts was the answer What sort of bugs are they asked Ned with a laugh He and Tom were about to go hunting with their electric rifles Artifacts are things made by the Indians or whatever members of the race who built the ancient cities were called such as household articles vases ornaments tools and so on Anything made by artificial means is called an artifact And potsherds are things with those Chinese laundry ticket scratches on them added Tom Exactly said the professor laughing Though some of the strange appearing inscriptions give much valuable information As soon as we find some of them say a broken bit of pottery with hieroglyphics on I will know I am on the right track And while the scientist and mister Damon kept watch at the top of the shaft Tom and Ned went out into the jungle to hunt They had killed some game and were stalking a fine big deer which would provide a feast for the natives when suddenly the silence of the lonely forest was broken by a piercing scream followed by an agonized cry of El tigre El tigre CHAPTER XIX POISONED ARROWS Did you hear that Tom asked Ned in a hoarse whisper Surely was the cautious answer Keep still and I ll try for a shot Better be quick advised Ned in a tense voice The chap who did that yelling seems to be in trouble And as Ned s voice trailed off into a whisper again came the cry this time in frenzied pain El tigre El tigre Then there was a jumble of words It s over this way and this time Ned shouted seeing no need for low voices since the other was so loud Tom looked to where Ned had parted the bushes alongside a jungle path Through the opening the young inventor saw in a little glade that which caused him to take a firmer grip on his electric rifle and also a firmer grip on his nerves Directly in front of him and Ned and not more than a hundred yards away was a great tawny and spotted jaguar the tigre or tiger of Central America The beast with lashing tail stood over an Indian upon whom it seemed to have sprung from some lair beating the unfortunate man to the ground Nor had he fallen scatheless for there was blood on the green leaves about him and it was not the blood of the spotted beast Oh Tom can you can you and Ned faltered The young inventor understood the unspoken question I think I can make a shot of it without hitting the man he answered never turning his head It s a question though if the beast won t claw him in the death struggle It won t last long however if the electric bullet goes to the right place and I ve got to take the chance Cautiously Tom brought his weapon to bear Quiet as Ned and he had been after the discovery the jaguar seemed to feel that something was wrong Intent on his prey for a time he had stood over it gloating Now the brute glanced uneasily from side to side its tail nervously twitching and it seemed trying to gain by a sniffing of the air some information as to the direction in which danger lay for Tom and Ned had stooped low concealing themselves by a screen of leaves The Indian after his first frenzied outburst of fear now lay quiet as though fearing to move moaning in pain Suddenly the jaguar attracted either by some slight movement on the part of Ned or Tom or perhaps by having winded them turned his head quickly and gazed with cruel eyes straight at the spot where the two young men stood behind the bushes He s seen us whispered Ned Yes assented Tom And it s a perfect shot Hope I don t miss It was not like Tom Swift to miss nor did he on this occasion There was a slight report from the electric rifle a report not unlike the crackle of the wireless and the powerful projectile sped true to its mark Straight through the throat and chest under the uplifted jaw of the jaguar it went through heart and lungs Then with a great coughing sighing snarl the beast reared up gave a convulsive leap forward toward its newly discovered enemies and fell dead in a limp heap just beyond the native over which it had been crouching before it delivered the death stroke now never to fall You did it Tom You did it cried Ned springing up from where he had been kneeling to give his chum a better chance to shoot You did it and saved the man s life And Ned would have rushed out toward the still twitching body Just a minute interposed Tom Those beasts sometimes have as many lives as a cat I ll give it one more for luck Another electric projectile through the head of the jaguar produced no further effect than to move the body slightly and this proved conclusively that there was no life left It was safe to approach which Tom and Ned did Their first thought after a glance at the jaguar was for the Indian It needed but a brief examination to show that he was not badly hurt The jaguar had leaped on him from a low tree as he passed under it as the boys learned afterward and had crushed the man to earth by the weight of the spotted body more than by a stroke of the paw The American jaguar is not so formidable a beast as the native name of tiger would cause one to suppose though they are sufficiently dangerous and this one had rather badly clawed the Indian Fortunately the scratches were on the fleshy parts of the arms and shoulders where though painful they were not necessarily serious But if you hadn t shot just when you did Tom it would have been all up with him commented Ned Oh well I guess you d have hit him if I hadn t returned the young inventor But let s see what we can do for this chap The man sat up wonderingly hardly able to believe that he had been saved from the dreaded tigre His wounds were bleeding rather freely and as Tom and Ned carried with them a first aid kit they now brought it into use The wounds were bound up the man was given water to drink and then as he was able to walk Tom and Ned offered to help him wherever he wanted to go Blessed if I can tell whether he s one of our Indians or whether he belongs to the Beecher crowd remarked Tom Senor Beecher said the Indian adding in Spanish that he lived in the vicinity and had only lately been engaged by the young professor who hoped to discover the idol of gold before Tom s scientific friend could do so Tom and Ned knew a little Spanish and with that and simple but expressive signs on the part of the Indian they learned his story He had his palm thatched hut not far from the Beecher camp in a small Indian village and he with others had been hired on the arrival of the Beecher party to help with the excavations These for some reason were delayed Delayed because they daren t use the map they stole from us commented Ned Maybe agreed Tom The Indian whose name it developed was Tal as nearly as Tom and Ned could master it had left camp to go to visit his wife and child in the jungle hut intending to return to the Beecher camp at night But as he passed through the forest the jaguar had dropped on him bearing him to earth But you saved my life Senor he said to Tom dropping on one knee and trying to kiss Tom s hand which our hero avoided And now my life is yours added the Indian Well you d better get home with it and take care of it said Tom I ll have Professor Bumper come over and dress your scratches in a better and more careful way The bandages we put on are only temporary My wife she make a poultice of leaves they cure me said the Indian I guess that will be the best way observed Ned These natives can doctor themselves for some things better than we can Well we ll take him home suggested Tom He might keel over from loss of blood Come on he added to Tal indicating his object It was not far to the native s hut from the place where the jaguar had been killed and there Tom and Ned underwent another demonstration of affection as soon as those of Tal s immediate family and the other natives understood what had happened I hate this business complained Tom after having been knelt to by the Indian s wife and child who called him the preserver and other endearing titles of the same kind Come on let s hike back But Indian hospitality especially after a life has been saved is not so simple as all that My life my house all that I own is yours said Tal in deep gratitude Take everything and he waved his hand to indicate all the possessions in his humble hut Thanks answered Tom but I guess you need all you have That s a fine specimen of blow gun though he added seeing one hanging on the wall I wouldn t mind having one like that If you get well enough to make me one Tal and some arrows to go with it I d like it for a curiosity to hang in my room at home The Senor shall have a dozen promised the Indian Look Ned went on Tom pointing to the native weapon I never saw one just like this They use small arrows or darts tipped with wild cotton instead of feathers These the arrows explained Tal s wife bringing a bundle from a corner of the one room hut As she held them out her husband gave a cry of fear Poisoned arrows Poisoned arrows he exclaimed One scratch and the senors are dead men Put them away In fear the Indian wife prepared to obey but as she did so Tom Swift caught sight of the package and uttered a strange cry Thundering hoptoads Ned he exclaimed The poisoned arrows are wrapped in the piece of oiled silk that was around the professor s missing map CHAPTER XX AN OLD LEGEND Fascinated Tom and Ned gazed at the package the Indian woman held out to them Undoubtedly it was oiled silk on the outside and through the almost transparent covering could be seen the small arrows or darts used in the blow gun Where did you get that asked Tom pointing to the bundle and gazing sternly at Tal What is the matter Senor asked the Indian in turn Is it that you are afraid of the poisoned arrows Be assured they will not harm you unless you are scratched by them Tom and Ned found it difficult to comprehend all the rapid Spanish spoken by their host but they managed to understand some and his eloquent gestures made up the rest We re not afraid Tom said noting that the oiled skin well covered the dangerous darts But where did you get that I picked it up after another Indian had thrown it away He got it in your camp Senor I will not lie to you I did not steal Valdez went to your camp to steal he is a bad Indian and he brought back this wrapping It contained something he thought was gold but it was not so he Quick Yes Tell us demanded Tom eagerly What did he do with the professor s map that was in the oiled silk Where is it Oh Senors exclaimed the Indian woman thinking perhaps her husband was about to be dealt harshly with when she heard Tom s excited voice Tal do no harm No he did no harm went on Tom in a reassuring tone But he can do a whole lot of good if he tells us what became of the map that was in this oiled silk Where is it he asked again Valdez burn it up answered Tal What burned the professor s map cried Ned If that was in this yellow cloth yes answered the injured man Valdez he is bad He say to me he is going to your camp to see what he can take How he got this I know not but he come back one morning with the yellow package I see him but he make me promise not to tell But you save my life I tell you everything Valdez open the package but it is not gold though he think so because it is yellow and the man with no hair on his head keep it in his pocket close so close and Tal hugged himself to indicate what he meant That s Professor Bumper explained Ned How did Valdez get the map out of the professor s coat asked Tom Valdez he very much smart When man with no hair on his head take coat off for a minute to eat breakfast Valdez take yellow thing out of pocket The Indian must have sneaked into camp when we were eating said Tom Those from Beecher s party and our workers look all alike to us We wouldn t know one from the other and one of our rival s might slip in One evidently did if this is really the piece of oiled silk that was around the professor s map said Ned It certainly is the same declared the young inventor See there is his name and he stretched out his hand to point Don t touch cried Tal Poisoned arrows snake poison very dead like and quick Don t worry I won t touch said Tom grimly But go on You say Valdez sneaked into our camp took the oiled silk package from the coat pocket of Professor Bumper and went back to his own camp with it thinking it was gold Yes answered Tal though it is doubtful if he understood all that Tom said as it was half Spanish and half English But the Indian knew a little English too Valdez when he find no gold is very mad Only papers in the yellow silk papers with queer marks on Valdez think it maybe a charm to work evil so he burn them up all up Burned that rare map gasped Tom All in fire went on Tal indicating by his hands the play of flames Valdez throw away yellow silk and I take for my arrows so rain not wash off poison I give to you if you like with blow gun No thank you answered Tom in disappointed tones The oiled silk is of no use without the map and that s gone Whew but this is tough he said to his chum As long as it was only stolen there was a chance to get it back but if it s burned the jig is up It looks so agreed Ned We d better get back and tell the professor It he can t get along without the map it s time he started a movement toward getting another So it wasn t Beecher after all who got it Evidently not assented Tom But I believe him capable of it You haven t much use for him remarked Ned Huh was all the answer given by his chum I am sorry Senors went on Tal but I could not stop Valdez and the burning of the papers No you could not help it interrupted the young inventor But it just happens that it brings bad luck to us You see Tal the papers in this yellow covering told of an old buried city that the bald headed professor the man with no hair on his head is very anxious to discover It is somewhere under the ground and he waved to the jungle all about them pointing earthwards Paper Valdez burn tell of lost city asked Tal his face lighting up Yes But now of course we can t tell where to dig for it The Indian turned to his wife and talked rapidly with her in their own dialect She too seemed greatly excited making quick gestures Finally she ran out of the hut Where is she going asked Tom suspiciously To get her grandfather He very old Indian He know story of buried cities under trees Very old story what you call legend maybe But Goosal know He tell same as his grandfather told him You wait Goosal come and you listen Good Ned suddenly cried Tom Maybe we ll get on the track of lost Kurzon after all through some ancient Indian legend Maybe we won t need the map It hardly seems possible said Ned slowly What can these Indians know of buried cities that were out of existence before Columbus came here Why they haven t any written history No and that may be just the reason they are more likely to be right returned Tom Legends handed down from one grandfather to another go back a good many hundred years If they were written they might be destroyed as the professor s map was Somehow or other though I can t tell why I begin to see daylight ahead of us I wish I did remarked Ned Here comes Goosal I think murmured Tom and he pointed to an Indian bent with the weight of years who led by Tal s wife was slowly approaching the hut CHAPTER XXI THE CAVERN Now Goosal can tell you said Tal evidently pleased that he had in a measure solved the problem caused by the burning of the professor s map Goosal very old Indian He know old stories legends very old Well if he can tell us how to find the buried city of Kurzon and the the things in it said Tom he s all right The aged Indian proceeded slowly toward the hut where the impatient youths awaited him I know what you seek in the buried city remarked Tal Do you cried Tom wondering if some one had indiscreetly spoken of the idol of gold Yes you want pieces of rock with strange writings on them old weapons broken pots I know I have helped white men before Yes those are the things we want agreed Tom with a glance at his chum That is some of them But does your wife s grandfather talk our language No but I can tell you what he says By this time the old man led by missus Tal as the young men called the wife of the Indian they had helped entered the hut He seemed nervous and shy and glanced from Tom and Ned to his grandson in law as the latter talked rapidly in the Indian dialect Then Goosal made answer but what it was all about the boys could not tell Goosal say translated Tal that he know a story of a very old city away down under ground Tell us about it urged Tom eagerly But a difficulty very soon developed Tal s intentions were good but he was not equal to the task of translating Nor was the understanding of Tom and Ned of Spanish quite up to the mark Say this is too much for me exclaimed Tom We are losing the most valuable part of this by not understanding what Goosal says and what Tal translates What can we do asked Ned Get the professor here as soon as possible He can manage this dialect and he ll get the information at first hand If Goosal can tell where to begin excavating for the city he ought to tell the professor not us That s right agreed Ned We ll bring the professor here as soon as we can Accordingly they stopped the somewhat difficult task of listening to the translated story and told Tal as well as they could that they would bring the man with no hair on his head to listen to the tale This seemed to suit the Indians all of whom in the small colony appeared to be very grateful to Tom and Ned for having saved the life of Tal That was a good shot you made when you bowled over the jaguar said Ned as the two young explorers started back to their camp Better than I realized if it leads to the discovery of Kurzon and the idol of gold remarked Tom And to think we should come across the oiled silk holding the poisoned arrows went on Ned That s the strangest part of the whole affair If it hadn t been that you shot the jaguar this never would have come about That Professor Bumper was astonished and mister Damon likewise when they heard the story of Tom and Ned is stating it mildly Come on exclaimed the scientist as Tom finished we must see this Goosal at once If my map is destroyed and it seems to be this old Indian may be our only hope Where did he say the buried city was Tom Oh somewhere in this vicinity as nearly as I could make out But you d better talk with him yourself We didn t say anything about the idol of gold That s right It s just as well to let the natives think we are only after ordinary relics Bless my insurance policy gasped mister Damon It does not seem possible that we are on the right track Well I think we are from what little information Goosal gave us remarked Tom This buried city of his must be a wonderful place It is if it is what I take it to be agreed the professor I told you I would bring you to a land of wonders Tom Swift and they have hardly begun yet Come I am anxious to talk to Goosal In order that the Indians in the Bumper camp might not hear rumors of the new plan to locate the hidden city and at the same time to keep rumors from spreading to the camp of the rivals the scientist and his friends started a new shaft and put a shift of men at work on it We ll pretend we are on the right track and very busy said Tom That will fool Beecher Are you glad to know he did not take your map Professor Bumper asked mister Damon Well yes It is hard to believe such things of a fellow scientist If he didn t take it he wanted to said Tom And he has done or will do things as unsportsmanlike Oh you are hardly fair perhaps Tom commented Ned Um was all the answer he received With the Indians in camp busy on the excavation work and having ascertained that similar work was going on in the Beecher outfit Professor Bumper with mister Damon and the young men set off to visit the Indian village and listen to Goosal s story They passed the place where Tom had slain the jaguar but nothing was left but the bones the ants vultures and jungle animals having picked them clean in the night On the arrival of Tom and his friends at the Indian s hut Goosal told in language which Professor Bumper could understand the ancient legend of the buried city as he had had it from his grandfather But is that all you know about it Goosal asked the savant No Learned One It is true most of what I have told you was told to me by my father and his father s father But I I myself with these eyes have looked upon the lost city You have cried the professor this time in English Where When Take us to it How do you get here Through the cavern of the dead was the answer when the questions were modified Bless my diamond ring exclaimed mister Damon when Professor Bumper translated the reply What does he mean And then after some talk this information came out Years before when Goosal was a young man he had been taken by his grandfather on a journey through the jungle They stopped one day at the foot of a high mountain and clearing away the brush and stones at a certain place an entrance to a great cavern was revealed This it appeared was the Indian burial ground and had been used for generations Goosal though in fear and trembling was lead through it and came to another cavern vaster than the first And there he saw strange and wonderful sights for it was the remains of a buried city that had once been the home of a great and powerful tribe unlike the Indians the ancient Mayas it would seem Can you take us to this cavern asked the professor Yes answered Goosal I will lead to it those who saved the life of Tal them and their friends I will take you to the lost city Good cried mister Damon when this had been translated Now let Beecher try to play any more tricks on us Ho for the cavern and the lost city of Kurzon And the idol of gold said Tom Swift to himself I hope we can get it ahead of Beecher Perhaps if I can help in that Oh well here s hoping that s all and a little smile curved his lips Greatly excited by the strange news but maintaining as calm an air outwardly as possible so as not to excite the Indians Tom and his friends returned to camp to prepare for their trip Goosal had said the cavern lay distant more than a two days journey into the jungle CHAPTER XXII THE STORM Now remarked Tom once they were back again in their camp we must go about this trip to the cavern in a way that will cause no suspicion over there as to what our object is and he nodded in the direction of the quarters of his rival Do you mean to go off quietly asked Ned Yes And to keep the work going on here at these shafts put in the scientist so that if any of their spies happen to come here they will think we still believe the buried city to be just below us To that end we must keep the Indians digging though I am convinced now that it is useless Accordingly preparations were made for an expedition into the jungle under the leadership of Goosal Tal had not sufficiently recovered from the jaguar wounds to go with the party but the old man in spite of his years was hale and hearty and capable of withstanding hardships One of the most intelligent of the Indians was put in charge of the digging gangs as foreman and told to keep them at work and not to let them stray Tolpec whose brother Tom had tried to save proved a treasure He agreed to remain behind and look after the interests of his friends and see that none of their baggage or stores were taken Well I guess we re as ready as we ever shall be remarked Tom as the cavalcade made ready to start Mules carried the supplies that were to be taken into the jungle and others of the sturdy animals were to be ridden by the travelers The trail was not an easy one Goosal warned them Tom and his friends found it even worse than they had expected for all their experience in jungle and mountain traveling In places it was necessary to dismount and lead the mules along sometimes pushing and dragging them More than once the trail fairly hung on the edge of some almost bottomless gorge and again it wound its way between great walls of rock so poised that they appeared about to topple over and crush the travelers But they kept on with dogged patience through many hardships To add to their troubles they seemed to have entered the abode of the fiercest mosquitoes encountered since coming to Honduras At times it was necessary to ride along with hats covered with mosquito netting and hands encased in gloves They had taken plenty of condensed food with them and they did not suffer in this respect Game too was plentiful and the electric rifles of Tom and Ned added to the larder One night after a somewhat sound sleep induced by hard travel on the trail that day Tom awoke to hear some one or something moving about among their goods which included their provisions Who s there asked the young inventor sharply as he reached for his electric rifle There was no answer but a rattling of the pans Speak or I ll fire Tom warned adding this in such Spanish as he could muster for he thought it might be one of the Indians No reply came and then seeing by the light of the stars a dark form moving in front of the tent occupied by himself and Ned Tom fired There was a combined grunt and squeal of pain then a savage growl and Ned yelled What s the matter Tom for he had been awakened and heard the crackle of the electrical discharge I don t know Tom answered But I shot something or somebody Maybe some of Beecher s crowd ventured his chum But when they got their electric torches and focused them on the inert black object it was found to be a bear which had come to nose about the camp for dainty morsels Bruin was quite dead and as he was in prime condition there was a feast of bear meat at the following dinner The white travelers found it rather too strong for their palates but the Indians reveled in it It was shortly after noon the next day when Goosal after remarking that a storm seemed brewing announced that they would be at the entrance to the cavern in another hour Good cried Professor Bumper At last we are near the buried city Don t be too sure advised mister Damon We may be disappointed Though I hope not for your sake my dear Professor Goosal now took the lead and the old Indian traveling on foot for he said he could better look for the old landmark that way than on the back of a mule walked slowly along a rough cliff Here somewhere is the entrance to the cavern said the aged man It was many years ago that I was here many years But it seems as though yesterday It is little changed Indeed little did change in that land of wonders Only nature caused what alterations there were The hand of man had long been absent Slowly Goosal walked along the rocky trail on one side a sheer rock towering a hundred feet or more toward the sky On the other side a deep gash leading to a great fertile valley below Suddenly the old man paused and looked about him as though uncertain Then more slowly still he put out his hand and pulled at some bushes that grew on a ledge of the rock They came away having no depth of earth and a small opening was disclosed It is here said Goosal quietly The entrance to the cavern that leads to the burial place of the dead and the city that is dead also It is here He stood aside while the others hurried forward It took but a few minutes to prove that he was right at least as to the existence of the cavern for the four men were soon peering into the opening Come on cried Tom impetuously Wait a moment suggested the professor Sometimes the air in these places is foul We must test it But a torch one of the Indians threw in burned with a steady glow That test was conclusive at least They made ready to enter Torches of a light bark that glowed with a steady flame and little smoke had been provided as well as a good supply of electric dry battery lamps and the way into the cavern was thus well lighted At first the Indians were afraid to enter but a word or two from Goosal reassured them and they followed Professor Bumper Tom and the others into the cavern For several hundred feet there was nothing remarkable about the cave It was like any other cavern of the mountains though wonderful for the number of crystal formations on the roof and walls formations that sparkled like a million diamonds in the flickering lights Talk about a wonderland cried Tom This is fairyland A moment later as Goosal walked on beside the professor and Tom the aged Indian came to a pause and pointing ahead murmured The city of the dead They saw the niches cut in the rock walls niches that held the countless bones of those who had died many many years before It was a vast Indian grave Doubtless a wealth of material of historic interest here said Professor Bumper flashing his torch on the skeletons But it will keep Where is the city you spoke of Goosal Farther on Senor Follow me Past the stone graves they went deeper and deeper into the great cave Their footsteps echoed and re echoed Suddenly Tom who with Ned had gone a little ahead came to a sudden halt and said Well this may be a burial place sure enough but I think I see something alive all right if it isn t a ghost He pointed ahead Surely those were lights flickering and moving about and yes there were men carrying them The Bumper party came to a surprised halt The other lights advanced and then to the great astonishment of Professor Bumper and his friends there confronted them in the cave several scientists of Professor Beecher s party and a score or more of Indians Professor Hylop who was known to Professor Bumper stepped forward and asked sharply What are you doing here I might ask you the same thing was the retort You might but you would not be answered came sharply We have a right here having discovered this cavern and we claim it under a concession of the Honduras Government I shall have to ask you to withdraw Do you mean leave here asked mister Damon That is it exactly We first discovered this cave We have been conducting explorations in it for several days and we wish no outsiders Are you speaking for Professor Beecher asked Tom I am But he is here in the cave and will speak for himself if you desire it But I represent him and I order you to leave If you do not go peaceably we will use force We have plenty of it and he glanced back at the Indians grouped behind him scowling savage Indians We have no wish to intrude observed Professor Bumper and I fully recognize the right of prior discovery But one member of our party he did not say which one was in this cave many years ago He led us to it Ours is a government concession exclaimed Professor Hylop harshly We want no intruders Go and he pointed toward the direction whence Tom s party had come Drive them out he ordered the Indians in Spanish and with muttered threats the dark skinned men advanced toward Tom and the others You need not use force said Professor Bumper He and Professor Hylop had quarreled bitterly years before on some scientific matter and the matter was afterward found to be wrong Perhaps this made him vindictive Tom stepped forward and started to protest but Professor Bumper interposed I guess there is no help for it but to go It seems to be theirs by right of discovery and government concession he said in disappointed tone Come friends and dejectedly they retraced their steps Followed by the threatening Indians the Bumper party made its way back to the entrance They had hoped for great things but if the cavern gave access to the buried city the ancient city of Kurzon on the chief altar of which stood the golden idol Quitzel it looked as though they were never to enter it We ll have to get our Indians and drive those fellows out declared Tom I m not going to be beaten this way and by Beecher It is galling declared Professor Bumper Still he has right on his side and I must give in to priority as I would expect him to It is the unwritten law Then we ve failed cried Tom bitterly Not yet said Professor Bumper If I can not unearth that buried city I may find another in this wonderland I shall not give up Hark What s that noise asked Tom as they approached the entrance to the cave Sounds like a great wind blowing commented Ned It was As they stood in the entrance they looked out to find a fierce storm raging The wind was sweeping down the rocky trail the rain was falling in veritable bucketfuls from the overhanging cliff and deafening thunder and blinding lightning roared and flashed Surely you would not drive us out in this storm said Professor Bumper to his former rival You can not stay in the cave You must get out was the answer as a louder crash of thunder than usual seemed to shake the very mountain CHAPTER XXIII ENTOMBED ALIVE For an instant Tom and his friends paused at the entrance to the wonderful cavern and looked at the raging storm It seemed madness to venture out into it yet they had been driven from the cave by those who had every right of discovery to say who and who should not partake of its hospitality We can t go out into that blow cried Ned It s enough to loosen the very mountains Let s stay here and defy them murmured Tom If the if what we seek is here we have as good a right to it as they have We must go out said Professor Bumper simply I recognize the right of my rival to dispossess us He may have the right but it isn t human said mister Damon Bless my overshoes If Beecher himself were here he wouldn t have the heart to send us out in this storm I would not give him the satisfaction of appealing to him remarked Professor Bumper Come we will go out We have our ponchos and we are not fair weather explorers If we can t get to the lost city one way we will another Come my friends And despite the downpour the deafening thunder and the lightning that seemed ready to sear one s eyes he walked out of the cave entrance followed by Tom and the others Come on cried Tom in a voice he tried to render confident as they went out into the terrible storm We ll beat em yet The rain fell harder than ever Small torrents were now rushing down the trail and it was only a question of a few minutes before the place where they stood would be a raging river so quickly does the rain collect in the mountains and speed toward the valleys We must take to the forest cried Tom There ll be some shelter there and I don t like the way the geography of this place is behaving There may be a landslide at any moment As he spoke he motioned upward through the mist of the rain to the sloping side of the mountain towering above them Loose stones were beginning to roll down accompanied by patches of earth loosened by the water Some of the patches carried with them bunches of grass and small bushes Yes it will be best to move into the jungle said the professor Goosal you had better take the lead It was wonderful to see how well the aged Indian bore up in spite of his years and walked on ahead They had left their mules tethered some distance back in a sheltering clump of trees and they hoped the animals would be safe The guide found a place where they could leave the trail though going down a dangerous slope and take to the forest As carefully as possible they descended this the rain continuing to fall the wind to blow the lightning to sizzle all about them and the thunder to boom in their ears They went on until they were beneath the shelter of the thick jungle growth of trees which kept off some of the pelting drops This is better exclaimed Ned shaking his poncho and getting rid of some of the water that had settled on it Bless my overcoat cried mister Damon We seem to have gotten out of the frying pan into the fire How asked Tom We are partly sheltered here though had we stayed in the cave in spite of A deafening crash interrupted him and following the flash one of the giant trees of the forest was seen to blaze up and then topple over Struck by lightning yelled Ned Yes and it may happen to us exclaimed mister Damon We were safer from the lightning in the open Maybe Again came an interruption but this time a different one The very ground beneath their feet seemed to be shaking and trembling What is it gasped Ned while Goosal fell on his knees and began fervently to pray It s an earthquake yelled Tom Swift As he spoke there came another sound the sound of a mass of earth in motion It came from the direction of the mountain trail they had just left They looked toward it and their horror stricken eyes saw the whole side of the mountain sliding down Slowly at first the earth slid down but constantly gathering force and speed In the face of this new disaster the rain seemed to have ceased and the thunder and lightning to be less severe It was as though one force of nature gave way to the other Look Look gasped Ned In silence which was broken now only by a low and ominous rumble more menacing than had been the awful fury of the elements the travelers looked Suddenly there was a quicker movement of seemingly one whole section of the mountain Great rocks and trees carried down by the appalling force of the landslide were slipping over the trail obliterating it as though it had never existed There goes the entrance to the cavern cried Ned and as the others looked to where he pointed they saw the hole in the side of the mountain the mouth of the cave that led to the lost city of Kurzon completely covered by thousands of tons of earth and stones That s the end of them exclaimed Tom as the rumble of the earthquake died away Of Ned stopped his eyes staring Of Professor Beecher s party They re entombed alive CHAPTER XXIV THE REVOLVING STONE Stunned not alone by the realization of the awfulness of the fate of their rivals but also by the terrific storm and the effect of the earthquake and the landslide Tom and his friends remained for a moment gazing toward the mouth of the cavern now completely out of sight buried by a mass of broken trees tangled bushes rocks and earth Somewhere far beyond that mass was the Beecher party held prisoners in the cave that formed the entrance to the buried city Tom was the first to come to a realization of what was needed to be done We must help them he exclaimed and it was characteristic of him that he harbored no enmity How asked Ned We must get a force of Indians and dig them out was the prompt answer At Tom s vigorous words Professor Bumper s forces were energized into action and he stated Fortunately we have plenty of excavating tools We may be in time to save them Come on the storm seems to have passed as suddenly as it came up and the earthquake which after all did not cover a wide area seems to be over We must start the work of rescue at once We must go back to camp and get all the help we can muster The storm indeed seemed to be over but it was no easy matter to get back over the soggy rain soaked ground to the trail they had left to take shelter in the forest Fortunately the earthquake had not involved that portion where they had left their mules but most of the frightened animals had broken loose and it was some little time before they could all be caught It is no use to try to get back to camp tonight said Tom when the last of the pack and saddle animals had been corralled It is getting late and there is no telling the condition of the trail We must stay here until morning But what about them and mister Damon nodded in the direction of the entombed ones We can help them best by waiting until the beginning of a new day said the professor We shall need a large force and we could not bring it up to night Besides Tom is right and if we tried to go along the trail after dark torn and disturbed as it is bound to be by the rain we might get into difficulties ourselves No we must camp here until morning and then go for help They all decided finally this was best The professor too pointed out that their rivals were in a large and roomy cave not likely to suffer from lack of air nor food or water since they must have supplies with them The only danger is that the cave has been crushed in added Tom but in that event we would be of no service to them anyhow The night seemed very long and it was a most uncomfortable one because of the shock and exertions through which the party had passed Added to this was the physical discomfort caused by the storm But in time there was the light in the east that meant morning was at hand and with it came action A hasty breakfast cups of steaming coffee forming a most welcome part put them all in better condition and once more they were on their way heading back to the main camp where they had left their force of Indians My exclaimed Tom as they made their way slowly along it surely was some storm Look at those big trees uprooted over there They re almost as big as the giant redwoods of California and yet they were bowled over as if they were tenpins I wonder if the wind did it or the earthquake ventured mister Damon No wind could do that declared Ned It must have been the landslide caused by the earthquake The wind could do it if the ground was made soft by the rain and that was probably what did it suggested Tom There is no harm in settling the point commented Professor Bumper It is not far off our trail and will take only a few minutes to go over to the trees I should like to get some photographs to accompany an article that perhaps I shall write on the effects of sudden and severe tropical storms We will go to look at the overturned trees and then we ll hurry on to camp to get the rescue party The uprooted trees lay on one side of the mountain trail perhaps a mile from the mouth of the cave which had been covered over entombing the Beecher party Leaving the mules in charge of one of the Indians Professor Bumper and his friends accompanied by Goosal approached the fallen trees As they neared them they saw that in falling the trees had lifted with their roots a large mass of earth and imbedded rocks that had clung to the twisted and gnarled fibers This mass was as large as a house Look at the hole left when the roots pulled out cried Ned Why it s like the crater of a small volcano he added And as they stood on the edge of it looking curiously at the hole made the others agreed with Tom s chum Professor Bumper was looking about trying to ascertain if there were any evidences of the earthquake in the vicinity when Tom who had cautiously gone a little way down into the excavation caused by the fallen trees uttered a cry of surprise Look he shouted Isn t that some sort of tunnel or underground passage and he pointed to a square opening perhaps seven feet high and nearly as broad which extended no one knew where downward and onward from the side of the hole made by the uprooting of the trees It s an underground passage all right said Professor Bumper eagerly and not a natural one either That was fashioned by the hand of man if I am any judge It seems to go right under the mountain too Friends we must explore this It may be of the utmost importance Come we have our electric torches and we shall need them for it s very dark in there and he peered into the passage in front of which they all stood now It seemed to have been tunneled through the earth the sides being lined by either slabs of stone or walls made by a sort of concrete But what about the rescue work asked mister Damon I am not forgetting Professor Beecher and his friends answered the scientist Perhaps this may be a better means of rescuing them than by digging them out which will take a week at least observed Tom This a better way asked Ned pointing to the tunnel That s it confirmed the savant If you will notice it extends back in the direction of the cave from which we were driven Now if there is a buried city beneath all this jungle this mountain of earth and stones the accumulation of centuries it is probably on the bottom of some vast cavern It is my opinion that we were only in one end of that cavern and this may be the entrance to another end of it Then asked mister Damon do you mean that we can enter here get into the cave that contains the buried city or part of it and find there Beecher and his friends That s it It is possible and if we could it would save an immense lot of work and probably be a surer way to save their lives than by digging a tunnel through the landslide to find the mouth of the cave where we first entered It s a chance worth taking said mister Damon Of course it is a chance But then everything connected with this expedition is so one is no worse than another As you say we may find the entombed men more easily this way than any other I wonder said Tom slowly if by any chance we shall find through this passage the lost city we are looking for And the idol of gold added Ned Goosal do you know anything about this asked Professor Bumper Did you ever hear of another passage leading to the cave where you saw the ancient city No Learned One though I have heard stories about there being many cities or parts of a big one beneath the mountain and when it was above ground there were many entrances to it That settles it cried the professor in English having talked to Goosal in Spanish We ll try this and see where it leads They entered the stone lined passage In spite of the fact that it had probably been buried and concealed from light and air for centuries as evidenced by the growth of the giant trees above it the air was fresh And this is one reason said Tom in commenting on this fact why I believe it leads to some vast cavern which is connected in some fashion with the outer air Well perhaps we shall soon make a discovery Eagerly and anxiously the little party pressed forward by the light of the pocket electric lamps They were obsessed by two thoughts what they might find and the necessity for aiding in the rescue of their rivals On and on they went the darkness illuminated only by the torches they carried But they noticed that the air was still fresh and that a gentle wind blew toward them The passage was undoubtedly artificial a tunnel made by the hands of men now long crumbled into dust It had a slightly upward slope and this Professor Bumper said indicated that it was bored upward and perhaps into the very heart of the mountain somewhere in the interior of which was the Beecher party Just how far they went they did not know but it must have been more than two miles Yet they did not tire for the way was smooth Suddenly Tom who with Professor Bumper was in the lead uttered a cry as he held his torch above his head and flashed it about in a circle We re blocked he exclaimed We re up against a stone wall It was but too true Confronting them and extending from side to side across the passage and from roof to floor was a great rough stone Immense and solid it seemed when they pushed on it in vain Nothing short of dynamite will move that said Ned in despair This is a blind lead We ll have to go back But there must be something on the other side of that stone cried Tom See it is pierced with holes and through them comes a current of air If we could only move the stone I believe it is an ancient door remarked Professor Bumper Eagerly and frantically they tried to move it by their combined weight The stone did not give the fraction of the breadth of a hair We ll have to go back and get some of your big tunnel blasting powder Tom suggested Ned As he spoke old Goosal glided forward He had remained behind them in the passage while they were trying to move the rock Now he said something in Spanish What does he mean asked Ned He asks that he be allowed to try translated Professor Bumper Sometimes he says there is a secret way of opening stone doors in these underground caves Let him try Goosal seemed to be running his fingers lightly over the outer edge of the door He was muttering to himself in his Indian tongue Suddenly he uttered an exclamation and as he did so there was a noise from the door itself It was a grinding scraping sound a rumble as though rocks were being rolled one against the other Then the astonished eyes of the adventurers saw the great stone door revolve on its axis and swing to one side leaving a passage open through which they could pass Goosal had discovered the hidden mechanism What lay before them CHAPTER XXV THE IDOL OF GOLD Forward cried Tom Swift Where asked mister Damon hanging back for an instant Bless my compass Tom do you know where you re going I haven t the least idea but it must lead to something or the ancients who made this revolving stone door wouldn t have taken such care to block the passage Ask Goosal if he knows anything about it suggested mister Damon to the professor He says he never was here before translated the savant but years ago when he went into the hidden city by the cave we left yesterday he saw doors like this which opened this way Then we re on the right track cried Tom If this is the same kind of door it must lead to the same place Ho for Kurzon and the idol of gold As they passed through the stone door Tom and Professor Bumper tried to get some idea of the mechanism by which it worked But they found this impossible it being hidden within the stone itself or in the adjoining walls But in order that it might not close of itself and entomb them the portal was blocked open with stones found in the passage It s always well to have a line of retreat open said Tom There s no telling what may lie beyond us For a time there seemed to be nothing more than the same passage along which they had come Then the passage suddenly widened like the large end of a square funnel Upward and outward the stone walls swept and they saw dimly before them in the light of their torches a vast cavern seemingly formed by the falling in of mountains which in toppling over had met overhead in a sort of rough arch thus protecting in a great measure that which lay beneath them Goosal who had brought with him some of the fiber bark torches set a bundle of them aflame As they flared up a wondrous sight was revealed to Tom Swift and his friends Stretching out before them as though they stood at the end of an elevated street and gazed down on it was a city a large city with streets houses open squares temples statues fountains dry for centuries a buried and forgotten city a city in ruins a city of the dead now dry as dust but still a city or rather the strangely preserved remains of one Look whispered Tom A louder voice just then would have seemed a sacrilege Look Is it what we are looking for asked Ned in a low voice I believe it is replied the professor It is the lost city of Kurzon or one just like it And now if we can find the idol of gold our search will be ended at least the major part of it Where did you expect to find the idol asked Tom It should be in the main temple Come we will walk in the ancient streets streets where no feet but ours have trod in many centuries Come In eager silence they pressed on through this newly discovered wonderland For it was a wonderful city or had been Though much of it was in ruins probably caused by an earthquake or an eruption from a volcano the central portion covered as it was by the overtoppling mountains that formed the arching roof was well preserved There were rude but beautiful stone buildings There were archways temples public squares and images not at all beautiful for they seemed to be of man monsters doubtless ancient gods There were smoothly paved streets wondrously carved fountains some in ruins all now as dry as bone but which must have been places of beauty where youths and maidens gathered in the ancient days Of the ancient population there was not a trace left Tom and his friends penetrated some of the houses but not so much as a bone or a heap of mouldering dust showed where the remains of the people were Either they had fled at the approaching doom of the city and were buried elsewhere or some strange fire or other force of nature had consumed and obliterated them What a wealth of historic information I shall find here murmured Professor Bumper as he caught sight of many inscriptions in strange characters on the walls and buildings I shall never get to the end of them But what about the idol of gold asked mister Damon Do you think you ll find that We must hurry on to the temple over there said the scientist indicating a building further along And then we must see about rescuing your rivals Professor put in Tom Yes Tom But fortunately we are on the ground here before them agreed the professor Undoubtedly it was the chief temple or place of worship of the long dead race which the explorers now entered It was a building beautiful in its barbaric style and yet simple There were massive walls and a great inner court at the end of which seemed to be some sort of altar And then as they lighted fresh torches and pressed forward with them and their electric lights they saw that which caused a cry of satisfaction to burst from all of them The idol of gold Yes there it squatted an ugly misshapen figure a cross between a toad and a gila monster half man half beast with big red eyes rubies probably that gleamed in the repulsive golden face And the whole figure weighing many pounds seemed to be of SOLID GOLD Eagerly the others followed Professor Bumper up the altar steps to the very throne of the golden idol The scientist touched it tried to raise it and make sure of its solidity and material This is it he cried It is the idol of gold I have found We have found it for it belongs to all of us Hurray cried Tom Swift and Ned and mister Damon joined in the cry There was no need for silence or caution now and yet as they stood about the squat and ugly figure which in spite of its hideousness was worth a fortune intrinsically and as an antique they heard from the direction of the stone passage a noise What is it asked Tom Swift There was a murmur of voices Indians cried Professor Bumper recognizing the language a mixture of Spanish and Indian The cave was illuminated by the glare of other torches which seemed to rush forward A moment later it was seen that they were being carried by a number of Indians Friends murmured Goosal using the Spanish term Amigos They are our own Indians cried Tom Swift I see Tolpec and he pointed to the native who had deserted from Jacinto s force to help them How did they get here asked Professor Bumper This was quickly told In their camp where under the leadership of Tolpec they had been left to do the excavating the natives had heard seen and felt the effects of the storm and the earthquake though it did little damage in their vicinity But they became alarmed for the safety of the professor and his party and at Tolpec s suggestion set off in search of them The Indians had seen passing along the trail the uprooted trees and had noted the footsteps of the explorers going down to the stone passage It was easy for them to determine that Tom and his friends had gone in since the marks of their boots were plainly in evidence in the soft soil None of the Indians was as much wrought up over the discovery of Kurzon and the idol as were the white adventurers The gold of course meant something to the natives but they were indifferent to the wonders of the underground city Perhaps they had heard too many legends concerning such things to be impressed That statue is yours all yours said old Goosal when he had talked with his relatives and friends among the natives They all say what you find you keep and we will help you keep it That s good murmured Professor Bumper There was some doubt in my mind as to our right to this but after all the natives who live in this land are the original owners and if they pass title to us it is clear That settles the last difficulty Except that of getting the idol out said mister Damon Oh we ll accomplish that cried Tom I can hardly believe my good luck declared Professor Bumper I shall write a whole book on this idol alone and then Once more came an interruption This time it was from another direction but it was of the same character an approaching band of torch bearers They were Indians too but leading them were a number of whites And at their head was no less personage than Professor Beecher himself For a moment as the three parties stood together in the ancient temple in the glare of many torches no one spoke Then Professor Bumper found his voice We are glad to see you he said to his rival That is glad to see you alive for we saw the landslide bury you And we were coming to dig you out We thought this cave the cave of the buried city would lead us to you easier than by digging through the slide We have just discovered this idol and he put his hand on the grim golden image Oh you have discovered it have you asked Professor Beecher and his voice was bitter Yes not ten minutes ago The natives have kindly acknowledged my right to it under the law of priority I am sorry but With a look of disgust and chagrined disappointment on his face Professor Beecher turned to the other scientists and said Let us go We are too late He has what I came after Well it is the fortune of war and discovery put in mister Hardy one of the party who seemed the least ill natured Your luck might have been ours Professor Bumper I congratulate you Thank you Are you sure your party is all right not in need of assistance How did you get out of the place you were buried Thank you We do not require any help It was good of you to think of us But we got out the way we came in We did not enter the tunnel as you did but came in through another entrance which was not closed by the landslide Then we made a turn through a gateway in a tunnel connecting with ours a gateway which seems to have been opened by the earthquake and we came here just now Too late I see to claim the discovery of the idol of gold went on mister Hardy But I trust you will be generous and allow us to make observations of the buildings and other relics As much as you please and with the greatest pleasure in the world was the prompt answer of Professor Bumper All I lay sole claim to is the golden idol You are at liberty to take whatever else you find in Kurzon and to make what observations you like That is generous of you and quite in contrast to er to the conduct of our leader I trust he may awaken to a sense of the injustice he did you But Professor Beecher was not there to hear this He had stalked away in anger Humph grunted Tom Then he continued That story about a government concession was all a fake Professor else he d have put up a fight now Contemptible sneak In fact the story of Tom Swift s trip to the underground land of wonders is ended for with the discovery of the idol of gold the main object of the expedition was accomplished But their adventures were not over by any means though there is not room in this volume to record them Suffice it to say that means were at once taken to get the golden image out of the cave of the ancient city It was not accomplished without hard work for the gold was heavy and Professor Bumper would not naturally consent to the shaving off of so much as an ear or part of the flat nose to say nothing of one of the half dozen extra arms and legs with which the ugly idol was furnished Finally it was safely taken out of the cave and along the stone passage to the opening formed by the overthrown trees and thence on to camp And at the camp a surprise awaited Tom Some long delayed mail had been forwarded from the nearest place of civilization and there were letters for all including several for our hero One in particular he picked out first and read eagerly Well is every little thing all right Tom asked Ned as he saw a cheerful grin spread itself over his chum s face I should say it is and then some Look here Ned This is a letter from I know Mary Nestor Go on How d you guess Oh I m a mind reader Huh Well you know she was away when I went to call to say good bye and I was a little afraid Beecher had got an inside edge on me Had he No but he tried hard enough He went to see Mary in Fayetteville just as you heard before he came on to join his party but he didn t pay much of a visit to her No No Mary told him he d better hurry along to Central America or wherever it was he intended going as she didn t care for him as much as he flattered himself she did Good cried Ned Shake old man I m glad They shook hands Well what s the matter Didn t you read all of her letter asked Ned when he saw his chum once more perusing the epistle No There s a postscript here Sorry I couldn t see you before you left It was a mistake but when you come back Oh that part isn t any of your affair and blushing under his tan Tom thrust the letter into his pocket and strode away while Ned laughed happily With the idol of gold safe in their possession Professor Bumper s party could devote their time to making other explorations in the buried city This they did as is testified to by a long list of books and magazine articles since turned out by the scientist dealing strictly with archaeological subjects touching on the ancient Mayan race and its civilization with particular reference to their system of computing time Professor Beecher young and foolish would not consent to delve into the riches of the ancient city being too much chagrined over the loss of the idol It seems he had really promised to give a part of it to Mary Nestor But he never got the chance His colleagues after their first disappointment at being beaten joined forces with Professor Bumper in exploring the old city and made many valuable discoveries In one point Professor Bumper had done his rival an injustice That was in thinking Professor Beecher was responsible for the treachery of Jacinto That was due to the plotter s own work It was true that Professor Beecher had tentatively engaged Jacinto and had sent word to him to keep other explorers away from the vicinity of the ancient city if possible but Jacinto who did not return Professor Bumper s money as he had promised had acted treacherously in order to enrich himself Professor Beecher had nothing to do with that nor had he with the taking of the map as has been seen the loss of which after all was a blessing in disguise for Kurzon would never have been located by following the directions given there as it was very inaccurate In another point it was demonstrated that the old documents were at fault This was in reference to the golden idol having been overthrown and another set up in its place an act which had caused the destruction of Kurzon It is true that the city was destroyed or rather buried but this catastrophe was probably brought about by an earthquake And another great idol one of clay was found perhaps a rival of Quitzel but it was this clay image which was thrown down and broken and not the golden one Perhaps an effort had been made just before the burying of the city to change idols and the system of worship but Quitzel seemed to have held his own The old manuscripts were not very reliable it was found except in general Well I guess this will hold Beecher for a while said Tom the night of the arrival of Mary s letter and after he had written one in answer which was dispatched by a runner to the nearest place whence mail could be forwarded Yes luck seems to favor you replied Ned You ve had a hand in the discovery of the idol of gold and Yes And I discovered something else I wasn t quite sure of interrupted Tom as he felt to make sure he had a certain letter safe in his pocket It was several weeks later that the explorations of Kurzon came to an end a temporary end for the rainy season set in when the tropics are unsuitable for white men Tom Professor Bumper Ned and mister Damon set sail for the United States the valuable idol of gold safe on board And there with their vessel plowing the blue waters of the Caribbean Sea we will take leave of Tom Swift and his friends End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Tom Swift in the Land of Wonders by Victor Appleton END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOM SWIFT IN
