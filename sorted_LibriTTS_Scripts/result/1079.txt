START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TRISTRAM SHANDY Produced by Sue Asscher and Stephen Radcliffe THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY GENTLEMAN By Laurence Sterne two lines in Greek To the Right Honourable mister Pitt Sir Never poor Wight of a Dedicator had less hopes from his Dedication than I have from this of mine for it is written in a bye corner of the kingdom and in a retir d thatch d house where I live in a constant endeavour to fence against the infirmities of ill health and other evils of life by mirth being firmly persuaded that every time a man smiles but much more so when he laughs it adds something to this Fragment of Life I humbly beg Sir that you will honour this book by taking it not under your Protection it must protect itself but into the country with you where if I am ever told it has made you smile or can conceive it has beguiled you of one moment s pain I shall think myself as happy as a minister of state perhaps much happier than any one one only excepted that I have read or heard of I am Great Sir and what is more to your Honour I am Good Sir Your Well wisher and most humble Fellow subject The Author THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY GENT VOLUME THE FIRST Chapter one I I wish either my father or my mother or indeed both of them as they were in duty both equally bound to it had minded what they were about when they begot me had they duly consider d how much depended upon what they were then doing that not only the production of a rational Being was concerned in it but that possibly the happy formation and temperature of his body perhaps his genius and the very cast of his mind and for aught they knew to the contrary even the fortunes of his whole house might take their turn from the humours and dispositions which were then uppermost Had they duly weighed and considered all this and proceeded accordingly I am verily persuaded I should have made a quite different figure in the world from that in which the reader is likely to see me Believe me good folks this is not so inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think it you have all I dare say heard of the animal spirits as how they are transfused from father to son c c and a great deal to that purpose Well you may take my word that nine parts in ten of a man s sense or his nonsense his successes and miscarriages in this world depend upon their motions and activity and the different tracks and trains you put them into so that when they are once set a going whether right or wrong tis not a half penny matter away they go cluttering like hey go mad and by treading the same steps over and over again they presently make a road of it as plain and as smooth as a garden walk which when they are once used to the Devil himself sometimes shall not be able to drive them off it Pray my Dear quoth my mother have you not forgot to wind up the clock Good G cried my father making an exclamation but taking care to moderate his voice at the same time Did ever woman since the creation of the world interrupt a man with such a silly question Pray what was your father saying Nothing Chapter one II Then positively there is nothing in the question that I can see either good or bad Then let me tell you Sir it was a very unseasonable question at least because it scattered and dispersed the animal spirits whose business it was to have escorted and gone hand in hand with the Homunculus and conducted him safe to the place destined for his reception The Homunculus Sir in however low and ludicrous a light he may appear in this age of levity to the eye of folly or prejudice to the eye of reason in scientific research he stands confess d a Being guarded and circumscribed with rights The minutest philosophers who by the bye have the most enlarged understandings their souls being inversely as their enquiries shew us incontestably that the Homunculus is created by the same hand engender d in the same course of nature endow d with the same loco motive powers and faculties with us That he consists as we do of skin hair fat flesh veins arteries ligaments nerves cartilages bones marrow brains glands genitals humours and articulations is a Being of as much activity and in all senses of the word as much and as truly our fellow creature as my Lord Chancellor of England He may be benefitted he may be injured he may obtain redress in a word he has all the claims and rights of humanity which Tully Puffendorf or the best ethick writers allow to arise out of that state and relation Now dear Sir what if any accident had befallen him in his way alone or that through terror of it natural to so young a traveller my little Gentleman had got to his journey s end miserably spent his muscular strength and virility worn down to a thread his own animal spirits ruffled beyond description and that in this sad disorder d state of nerves he had lain down a prey to sudden starts or a series of melancholy dreams and fancies for nine long long months together I tremble to think what a foundation had been laid for a thousand weaknesses both of body and mind which no skill of the physician or the philosopher could ever afterwards have set thoroughly to rights Chapter one III To my uncle mister Toby Shandy do I stand indebted for the preceding anecdote to whom my father who was an excellent natural philosopher and much given to close reasoning upon the smallest matters had oft and heavily complained of the injury but once more particularly as my uncle Toby well remember d upon his observing a most unaccountable obliquity as he call d it in my manner of setting up my top and justifying the principles upon which I had done it the old gentleman shook his head and in a tone more expressive by half of sorrow than reproach he said his heart all along foreboded and he saw it verified in this and from a thousand other observations he had made upon me That I should neither think nor act like any other man s child But alas continued he shaking his head a second time and wiping away a tear which was trickling down his cheeks My Tristram s misfortunes began nine months before ever he came into the world My mother who was sitting by look d up but she knew no more than her backside what my father meant but my uncle mister Toby Shandy who had been often informed of the affair understood him very well Chapter one IV I know there are readers in the world as well as many other good people in it who are no readers at all who find themselves ill at ease unless they are let into the whole secret from first to last of every thing which concerns you It is in pure compliance with this humour of theirs and from a backwardness in my nature to disappoint any one soul living that I have been so very particular already As my life and opinions are likely to make some noise in the world and if I conjecture right will take in all ranks professions and denominations of men whatever be no less read than the Pilgrim s Progress itself and in the end prove the very thing which Montaigne dreaded his Essays should turn out that is a book for a parlour window I find it necessary to consult every one a little in his turn and therefore must beg pardon for going on a little farther in the same way For which cause right glad I am that I have begun the history of myself in the way I have done and that I am able to go on tracing every thing in it as Horace says ab Ovo Horace I know does not recommend this fashion altogether But that gentleman is speaking only of an epic poem or a tragedy I forget which besides if it was not so I should beg mister Horace s pardon for in writing what I have set about I shall confine myself neither to his rules nor to any man s rules that ever lived To such however as do not choose to go so far back into these things I can give no better advice than that they skip over the remaining part of this chapter for I declare before hand tis wrote only for the curious and inquisitive Shut the door I was begot in the night betwixt the first Sunday and the first Monday in the month of March in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighteen I am positive I was But how I came to be so very particular in my account of a thing which happened before I was born is owing to another small anecdote known only in our own family but now made publick for the better clearing up this point My father you must know who was originally a Turkey merchant but had left off business for some years in order to retire to and die upon his paternal estate in the county of was I believe one of the most regular men in every thing he did whether twas matter of business or matter of amusement that ever lived As a small specimen of this extreme exactness of his to which he was in truth a slave he had made it a rule for many years of his life on the first Sunday night of every month throughout the whole year as certain as ever the Sunday night came to wind up a large house clock which we had standing on the back stairs head with his own hands And being somewhere between fifty and sixty years of age at the time I have been speaking of he had likewise gradually brought some other little family concernments to the same period in order as he would often say to my uncle Toby to get them all out of the way at one time and be no more plagued and pestered with them the rest of the month It was attended but with one misfortune which in a great measure fell upon myself and the effects of which I fear I shall carry with me to my grave namely that from an unhappy association of ideas which have no connection in nature it so fell out at length that my poor mother could never hear the said clock wound up but the thoughts of some other things unavoidably popped into her head vice versa Which strange combination of ideas the sagacious Locke who certainly understood the nature of these things better than most men affirms to have produced more wry actions than all other sources of prejudice whatsoever But this by the bye Now it appears by a memorandum in my father s pocket book which now lies upon the table That on Lady day which was on the twenty fifth of the same month in which I date my geniture my father set upon his journey to London with my eldest brother Bobby to fix him at Westminster school and as it appears from the same authority That he did not get down to his wife and family till the second week in May following it brings the thing almost to a certainty However what follows in the beginning of the next chapter puts it beyond all possibility of a doubt But pray Sir What was your father doing all December January and February Why Madam he was all that time afflicted with a Sciatica Chapter one V On the fifth day of November seventeen eighteen which to the aera fixed on was as near nine kalendar months as any husband could in reason have expected was I Tristram Shandy Gentleman brought forth into this scurvy and disastrous world of ours I wish I had been born in the Moon or in any of the planets except Jupiter or Saturn because I never could bear cold weather for it could not well have fared worse with me in any of them though I will not answer for Venus than it has in this vile dirty planet of ours which o my conscience with reverence be it spoken I take to be made up of the shreds and clippings of the rest not but the planet is well enough provided a man could be born in it to a great title or to a great estate or could any how contrive to be called up to public charges and employments of dignity or power but that is not my case and therefore every man will speak of the fair as his own market has gone in it for which cause I affirm it over again to be one of the vilest worlds that ever was made for I can truly say that from the first hour I drew my breath in it to this that I can now scarce draw it at all for an asthma I got in scating against the wind in Flanders I have been the continual sport of what the world calls Fortune and though I will not wrong her by saying She has ever made me feel the weight of any great or signal evil yet with all the good temper in the world I affirm it of her that in every stage of my life and at every turn and corner where she could get fairly at me the ungracious duchess has pelted me with a set of as pitiful misadventures and cross accidents as ever small Hero sustained Chapter one VI In the beginning of the last chapter I informed you exactly when I was born but I did not inform you how No that particular was reserved entirely for a chapter by itself besides Sir as you and I are in a manner perfect strangers to each other it would not have been proper to have let you into too many circumstances relating to myself all at once You must have a little patience I have undertaken you see to write not only my life but my opinions also hoping and expecting that your knowledge of my character and of what kind of a mortal I am by the one would give you a better relish for the other As you proceed farther with me the slight acquaintance which is now beginning betwixt us will grow into familiarity and that unless one of us is in fault will terminate in friendship O diem praeclarum then nothing which has touched me will be thought trifling in its nature or tedious in its telling Therefore my dear friend and companion if you should think me somewhat sparing of my narrative on my first setting out bear with me and let me go on and tell my story my own way Or if I should seem now and then to trifle upon the road or should sometimes put on a fool s cap with a bell to it for a moment or two as we pass along don t fly off but rather courteously give me credit for a little more wisdom than appears upon my outside and as we jog on either laugh with me or at me or in short do any thing only keep your temper Chapter one VII In the same village where my father and my mother dwelt dwelt also a thin upright motherly notable good old body of a midwife who with the help of a little plain good sense and some years full employment in her business in which she had all along trusted little to her own efforts and a great deal to those of dame Nature had acquired in her way no small degree of reputation in the world by which word world need I in this place inform your worship that I would be understood to mean no more of it than a small circle described upon the circle of the great world of four English miles diameter or thereabouts of which the cottage where the good old woman lived is supposed to be the centre She had been left it seems a widow in great distress with three or four small children in her forty seventh year and as she was at that time a person of decent carriage grave deportment a woman moreover of few words and withal an object of compassion whose distress and silence under it called out the louder for a friendly lift the wife of the parson of the parish was touched with pity and having often lamented an inconvenience to which her husband s flock had for many years been exposed inasmuch as there was no such thing as a midwife of any kind or degree to be got at let the case have been never so urgent within less than six or seven long miles riding which said seven long miles in dark nights and dismal roads the country thereabouts being nothing but a deep clay was almost equal to fourteen and that in effect was sometimes next to having no midwife at all it came into her head that it would be doing as seasonable a kindness to the whole parish as to the poor creature herself to get her a little instructed in some of the plain principles of the business in order to set her up in it As no woman thereabouts was better qualified to execute the plan she had formed than herself the gentlewoman very charitably undertook it and having great influence over the female part of the parish she found no difficulty in effecting it to the utmost of her wishes In truth the parson join d his interest with his wife s in the whole affair and in order to do things as they should be and give the poor soul as good a title by law to practise as his wife had given by institution he cheerfully paid the fees for the ordinary s licence himself amounting in the whole to the sum of eighteen shillings and four pence so that betwixt them both the good woman was fully invested in the real and corporal possession of her office together with all its rights members and appurtenances whatsoever These last words you must know were not according to the old form in which such licences faculties and powers usually ran which in like cases had heretofore been granted to the sisterhood But it was according to a neat Formula of Didius his own devising who having a particular turn for taking to pieces and new framing over again all kind of instruments in that way not only hit upon this dainty amendment but coaxed many of the old licensed matrons in the neighbourhood to open their faculties afresh in order to have this wham wham of his inserted I own I never could envy Didius in these kinds of fancies of his But every man to his own taste Did not doctor Kunastrokius that great man at his leisure hours take the greatest delight imaginable in combing of asses tails and plucking the dead hairs out with his teeth though he had tweezers always in his pocket Nay if you come to that Sir have not the wisest of men in all ages not excepting Solomon himself have they not had their Hobby Horses their running horses their coins and their cockle shells their drums and their trumpets their fiddles their pallets their maggots and their butterflies and so long as a man rides his Hobby Horse peaceably and quietly along the King s highway and neither compels you or me to get up behind him pray Sir what have either you or I to do with it Chapter one VIII De gustibus non est disputandum that is there is no disputing against Hobby Horses and for my part I seldom do nor could I with any sort of grace had I been an enemy to them at the bottom for happening at certain intervals and changes of the moon to be both fidler and painter according as the fly stings Be it known to you that I keep a couple of pads myself upon which in their turns nor do I care who knows it I frequently ride out and take the air though sometimes to my shame be it spoken I take somewhat longer journies than what a wise man would think altogether right But the truth is I am not a wise man and besides am a mortal of so little consequence in the world it is not much matter what I do so I seldom fret or fume at all about it Nor does it much disturb my rest when I see such great Lords and tall Personages as hereafter follow such for instance as my Lord A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q and so on all of a row mounted upon their several horses some with large stirrups getting on in a more grave and sober pace others on the contrary tucked up to their very chins with whips across their mouths scouring and scampering it away like so many little party coloured devils astride a mortgage and as if some of them were resolved to break their necks So much the better say I to myself for in case the worst should happen the world will make a shift to do excellently well without them and for the rest why God speed them e en let them ride on without opposition from me for were their lordships unhorsed this very night tis ten to one but that many of them would be worse mounted by one half before tomorrow morning Not one of these instances therefore can be said to break in upon my rest But there is an instance which I own puts me off my guard and that is when I see one born for great actions and what is still more for his honour whose nature ever inclines him to good ones when I behold such a one my Lord like yourself whose principles and conduct are as generous and noble as his blood and whom for that reason a corrupt world cannot spare one moment when I see such a one my Lord mounted though it is but for a minute beyond the time which my love to my country has prescribed to him and my zeal for his glory wishes then my Lord I cease to be a philosopher and in the first transport of an honest impatience I wish the Hobby Horse with all his fraternity at the Devil My Lord I maintain this to be a dedication notwithstanding its singularity in the three great essentials of matter form and place I beg therefore you will accept it as such and that you will permit me to lay it with the most respectful humility at your Lordship s feet when you are upon them which you can be when you please and that is my Lord whenever there is occasion for it and I will add to the best purposes too I have the honour to be My Lord Your Lordship s most obedient and most devoted and most humble servant Tristram Shandy Chapter one IX I solemnly declare to all mankind that the above dedication was made for no one Prince Prelate Pope or Potentate Duke Marquis Earl Viscount or Baron of this or any other Realm in Christendom nor has it yet been hawked about or offered publicly or privately directly or indirectly to any one person or personage great or small but is honestly a true Virgin Dedication untried on upon any soul living I labour this point so particularly merely to remove any offence or objection which might arise against it from the manner in which I propose to make the most of it which is the putting it up fairly to public sale which I now do Every author has a way of his own in bringing his points to bear for my own part as I hate chaffering and higgling for a few guineas in a dark entry I resolved within myself from the very beginning to deal squarely and openly with your Great Folks in this affair and try whether I should not come off the better by it If therefore there is any one Duke Marquis Earl Viscount or Baron in these his Majesty s dominions who stands in need of a tight genteel dedication and whom the above will suit for by the bye unless it suits in some degree I will not part with it it is much at his service for fifty guineas which I am positive is twenty guineas less than it ought to be afforded for by any man of genius My Lord if you examine it over again it is far from being a gross piece of daubing as some dedications are The design your Lordship sees is good the colouring transparent the drawing not amiss or to speak more like a man of science and measure my piece in the painter s scale divided into twenty I believe my Lord the outlines will turn out as twelve the composition as nine the colouring as six the expression thirteen and a half and the design if I may be allowed my Lord to understand my own design and supposing absolute perfection in designing to be as twenty I think it cannot well fall short of nineteen Besides all this there is keeping in it and the dark strokes in the Hobby Horse which is a secondary figure and a kind of back ground to the whole give great force to the principal lights in your own figure and make it come off wonderfully and besides there is an air of originality in the tout ensemble Be pleased my good Lord to order the sum to be paid into the hands of mister Dodsley for the benefit of the author and in the next edition care shall be taken that this chapter be expunged and your Lordship s titles distinctions arms and good actions be placed at the front of the preceding chapter All which from the words De gustibus non est disputandum and whatever else in this book relates to Hobby Horses but no more shall stand dedicated to your Lordship The rest I dedicate to the Moon who by the bye of all the Patrons or Matrons I can think of has most power to set my book a going and make the world run mad after it Bright Goddess If thou art not too busy with Candid and Miss Cunegund s affairs take Tristram Shandy s under thy protection also Chapter one X Whatever degree of small merit the act of benignity in favour of the midwife might justly claim or in whom that claim truly rested at first sight seems not very material to this history certain however it was that the gentlewoman the parson s wife did run away at that time with the whole of it And yet for my life I cannot help thinking but that the parson himself though he had not the good fortune to hit upon the design first yet as he heartily concurred in it the moment it was laid before him and as heartily parted with his money to carry it into execution had a claim to some share of it if not to a full half of whatever honour was due to it The world at that time was pleased to determine the matter otherwise Lay down the book and I will allow you half a day to give a probable guess at the grounds of this procedure Be it known then that for about five years before the date of the midwife s licence of which you have had so circumstantial an account the parson we have to do with had made himself a country talk by a breach of all decorum which he had committed against himself his station and his office and that was in never appearing better or otherwise mounted than upon a lean sorry jackass of a horse value about one pound fifteen shillings who to shorten all description of him was full brother to Rosinante as far as similitude congenial could make him for he answered his description to a hair breadth in every thing except that I do not remember tis any where said that Rosinante was broken winded and that moreover Rosinante as is the happiness of most Spanish horses fat or lean was undoubtedly a horse at all points I know very well that the Hero s horse was a horse of chaste deportment which may have given grounds for the contrary opinion But it is as certain at the same time that Rosinante s continency as may be demonstrated from the adventure of the Yanguesian carriers proceeded from no bodily defect or cause whatsoever but from the temperance and orderly current of his blood And let me tell you Madam there is a great deal of very good chastity in the world in behalf of which you could not say more for your life Let that be as it may as my purpose is to do exact justice to every creature brought upon the stage of this dramatic work I could not stifle this distinction in favour of Don Quixote s horse in all other points the parson s horse I say was just such another for he was as lean and as lank and as sorry a jade as Humility herself could have bestrided In the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment it was greatly in the parson s power to have helped the figure of this horse of his for he was master of a very handsome demi peaked saddle quilted on the seat with green plush garnished with a double row of silver headed studs and a noble pair of shining brass stirrups with a housing altogether suitable of grey superfine cloth with an edging of black lace terminating in a deep black silk fringe poudre d or all which he had purchased in the pride and prime of his life together with a grand embossed bridle ornamented at all points as it should be But not caring to banter his beast he had hung all these up behind his study door and in lieu of them had seriously befitted him with just such a bridle and such a saddle as the figure and value of such a steed might well and truly deserve In the several sallies about his parish and in the neighbouring visits to the gentry who lived around him you will easily comprehend that the parson so appointed would both hear and see enough to keep his philosophy from rusting To speak the truth he never could enter a village but he caught the attention of both old and young Labour stood still as he pass d the bucket hung suspended in the middle of the well the spinning wheel forgot its round even chuck farthing and shuffle cap themselves stood gaping till he had got out of sight and as his movement was not of the quickest he had generally time enough upon his hands to make his observations to hear the groans of the serious and the laughter of the light hearted all which he bore with excellent tranquillity His character was he loved a jest in his heart and as he saw himself in the true point of ridicule he would say he could not be angry with others for seeing him in a light in which he so strongly saw himself So that to his friends who knew his foible was not the love of money and who therefore made the less scruple in bantering the extravagance of his humour instead of giving the true cause he chose rather to join in the laugh against himself and as he never carried one single ounce of flesh upon his own bones being altogether as spare a figure as his beast he would sometimes insist upon it that the horse was as good as the rider deserved that they were centaur like both of a piece At other times and in other moods when his spirits were above the temptation of false wit he would say he found himself going off fast in a consumption and with great gravity would pretend he could not bear the sight of a fat horse without a dejection of heart and a sensible alteration in his pulse and that he had made choice of the lean one he rode upon not only to keep himself in countenance but in spirits At different times he would give fifty humorous and apposite reasons for riding a meek spirited jade of a broken winded horse preferably to one of mettle for on such a one he could sit mechanically and meditate as delightfully de vanitate mundi et fuga saeculi as with the advantage of a death s head before him that in all other exercitations he could spend his time as he rode slowly along to as much account as in his study that he could draw up an argument in his sermon or a hole in his breeches as steadily on the one as in the other that brisk trotting and slow argumentation like wit and judgment were two incompatible movements But that upon his steed he could unite and reconcile every thing he could compose his sermon he could compose his cough and in case nature gave a call that way he could likewise compose himself to sleep In short the parson upon such encounters would assign any cause but the true cause and he withheld the true one only out of a nicety of temper because he thought it did honour to him But the truth of the story was as follows In the first years of this gentleman s life and about the time when the superb saddle and bridle were purchased by him it had been his manner or vanity or call it what you will to run into the opposite extreme In the language of the county where he dwelt he was said to have loved a good horse and generally had one of the best in the whole parish standing in his stable always ready for saddling and as the nearest midwife as I told you did not live nearer to the village than seven miles and in a vile country it so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together without some piteous application for his beast and as he was not an unkind hearted man and every case was more pressing and more distressful than the last as much as he loved his beast he had never a heart to refuse him the upshot of which was generally this that his horse was either clapp d or spavin d or greaz d or he was twitter bon d or broken winded or something in short or other had befallen him which would let him carry no flesh so that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid of and a good horse to purchase in his stead What the loss in such a balance might amount to communibus annis I would leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffick to determine but let it be what it would the honest gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur till at length by repeated ill accidents of the kind he found it necessary to take the thing under consideration and upon weighing the whole and summing it up in his mind he found it not only disproportioned to his other expences but withal so heavy an article in itself as to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish Besides this he considered that with half the sum thus galloped away he could do ten times as much good and what still weighed more with him than all other considerations put together was this that it confined all his charity into one particular channel and where as he fancied it was the least wanted namely to the child bearing and child getting part of his parish reserving nothing for the impotent nothing for the aged nothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called forth to visit where poverty and sickness and affliction dwelt together For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence and there appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of it and these were either to make it an irrevocable law never more to lend his steed upon any application whatever or else be content to ride the last poor devil such as they had made him with all his aches and infirmities to the very end of the chapter As he dreaded his own constancy in the first he very chearfully betook himself to the second and though he could very well have explained it as I said to his honour yet for that very reason he had a spirit above it choosing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies and the laughter of his friends than undergo the pain of telling a story which might seem a panegyrick upon himself I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this reverend gentleman from this single stroke in his character which I think comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight of La Mancha whom by the bye with all his follies I love more and would actually have gone farther to have paid a visit to than the greatest hero of antiquity But this is not the moral of my story The thing I had in view was to shew the temper of the world in the whole of this affair For you must know that so long as this explanation would have done the parson credit the devil a soul could find it out I suppose his enemies would not and that his friends could not But no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf of the midwife and pay the expences of the ordinary s licence to set her up but the whole secret came out every horse he had lost and two horses more than ever he had lost with all the circumstances of their destruction were known and distinctly remembered The story ran like wild fire The parson had a returning fit of pride which had just seized him and he was going to be well mounted once again in his life and if it was so twas plain as the sun at noon day he would pocket the expence of the licence ten times told the very first year So that every body was left to judge what were his views in this act of charity What were his views in this and in every other action of his life or rather what were the opinions which floated in the brains of other people concerning it was a thought which too much floated in his own and too often broke in upon his rest when he should have been sound asleep About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be made entirely easy upon that score it being just so long since he left his parish and the whole world at the same time behind him and stands accountable to a Judge of whom he will have no cause to complain But there is a fatality attends the actions of some men Order them as they will they pass thro a certain medium which so twists and refracts them from their true directions that with all the titles to praise which a rectitude of heart can give the doers of them are nevertheless forced to live and die without it Of the truth of which this gentleman was a painful example But to know by what means this came to pass and to make that knowledge of use to you I insist upon it that you read the two following chapters which contain such a sketch of his life and conversation as will carry its moral along with it When this is done if nothing stops us in our way we will go on with the midwife Chapter one XI Yorick was this parson s name and what is very remarkable in it as appears from a most ancient account of the family wrote upon strong vellum and now in perfect preservation it had been exactly so spelt for near I was within an ace of saying nine hundred years but I would not shake my credit in telling an improbable truth however indisputable in itself and therefore I shall content myself with only saying It had been exactly so spelt without the least variation or transposition of a single letter for I do not know how long which is more than I would venture to say of one half of the best surnames in the kingdom which in a course of years have generally undergone as many chops and changes as their owners Has this been owing to the pride or to the shame of the respective proprietors In honest truth I think sometimes to the one and sometimes to the other just as the temptation has wrought But a villainous affair it is and will one day so blend and confound us all together that no one shall be able to stand up and swear That his own great grandfather was the man who did either this or that This evil had been sufficiently fenced against by the prudent care of the Yorick s family and their religious preservation of these records I quote which do farther inform us That the family was originally of Danish extraction and had been transplanted into England as early as in the reign of Horwendillus king of Denmark in whose court it seems an ancestor of this mister Yorick s and from whom he was lineally descended held a considerable post to the day of his death Of what nature this considerable post was this record saith not it only adds That for near two centuries it had been totally abolished as altogether unnecessary not only in that court but in every other court of the Christian world It has often come into my head that this post could be no other than that of the king s chief Jester and that Hamlet s Yorick in our Shakespeare many of whose plays you know are founded upon authenticated facts was certainly the very man I have not the time to look into Saxo Grammaticus s Danish history to know the certainty of this but if you have leisure and can easily get at the book you may do it full as well yourself I had just time in my travels through Denmark with mister Noddy s eldest son whom in the year seventeen forty one I accompanied as governor riding along with him at a prodigious rate thro most parts of Europe and of which original journey performed by us two a most delectable narrative will be given in the progress of this work I had just time I say and that was all to prove the truth of an observation made by a long sojourner in that country namely That nature was neither very lavish nor was she very stingy in her gifts of genius and capacity to its inhabitants but like a discreet parent was moderately kind to them all observing such an equal tenor in the distribution of her favours as to bring them in those points pretty near to a level with each other so that you will meet with few instances in that kingdom of refined parts but a great deal of good plain houshold understanding amongst all ranks of people of which every body has a share which is I think very right With us you see the case is quite different we are all ups and downs in this matter you are a great genius or tis fifty to one Sir you are a great dunce and a blockhead not that there is a total want of intermediate steps no we are not so irregular as that comes to but the two extremes are more common and in a greater degree in this unsettled island where nature in her gifts and dispositions of this kind is most whimsical and capricious fortune herself not being more so in the bequest of her goods and chattels than she This is all that ever staggered my faith in regard to Yorick s extraction who by what I can remember of him and by all the accounts I could ever get of him seemed not to have had one single drop of Danish blood in his whole crasis in nine hundred years it might possibly have all run out I will not philosophize one moment with you about it for happen how it would the fact was this That instead of that cold phlegm and exact regularity of sense and humours you would have looked for in one so extracted he was on the contrary as mercurial and sublimated a composition as heteroclite a creature in all his declensions with as much life and whim and gaite de coeur about him as the kindliest climate could have engendered and put together With all this sail poor Yorick carried not one ounce of ballast he was utterly unpractised in the world and at the age of twenty six knew just about as well how to steer his course in it as a romping unsuspicious girl of thirteen So that upon his first setting out the brisk gale of his spirits as you will imagine ran him foul ten times in a day of somebody s tackling and as the grave and more slow paced were oftenest in his way you may likewise imagine twas with such he had generally the ill luck to get the most entangled For aught I know there might be some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom of such Fracas For to speak the truth Yorick had an invincible dislike and opposition in his nature to gravity not to gravity as such for where gravity was wanted he would be the most grave or serious of mortal men for days and weeks together but he was an enemy to the affectation of it and declared open war against it only as it appeared a cloak for ignorance or for folly and then whenever it fell in his way however sheltered and protected he seldom gave it much quarter Sometimes in his wild way of talking he would say that Gravity was an errant scoundrel and he would add of the most dangerous kind too because a sly one and that he verily believed more honest well meaning people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in one twelve month than by pocket picking and shop lifting in seven In the naked temper which a merry heart discovered he would say there was no danger but to itself whereas the very essence of gravity was design and consequently deceit twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth and that with all its pretensions it was no better but often worse than what a French wit had long ago defined it viz A mysterious carriage of the body to cover the defects of the mind which definition of gravity Yorick with great imprudence would say deserved to be wrote in letters of gold But in plain truth he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in the world and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every other subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress restraint Yorick had no impression but one and that was what arose from the nature of the deed spoken of which impression he would usually translate into plain English without any periphrasis and too oft without much distinction of either person time or place so that when mention was made of a pitiful or an ungenerous proceeding he never gave himself a moment s time to reflect who was the hero of the piece what his station or how far he had power to hurt him hereafter but if it was a dirty action without more ado The man was a dirty fellow and so on And as his comments had usually the ill fate to be terminated either in a bon mot or to be enlivened throughout with some drollery or humour of expression it gave wings to Yorick s indiscretion In a word tho he never sought yet at the same time as he seldom shunned occasions of saying what came uppermost and without much ceremony he had but too many temptations in life of scattering his wit and his humour his gibes and his jests about him They were not lost for want of gathering What were the consequences and what was Yorick s catastrophe thereupon you will read in the next chapter Chapter one XII The Mortgager and Mortgagee differ the one from the other not more in length of purse than the Jester and Jestee do in that of memory But in this the comparison between them runs as the scholiasts call it upon all four which by the bye is upon one or two legs more than some of the best of Homer s can pretend to namely That the one raises a sum and the other a laugh at your expence and thinks no more about it Interest however still runs on in both cases the periodical or accidental payments of it just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive till at length in some evil hour pop comes the creditor upon each and by demanding principal upon the spot together with full interest to the very day makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations As the reader for I hate your ifs has a thorough knowledge of human nature I need not say more to satisfy him that my Hero could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of these incidental mementos To speak the truth he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book debts of this stamp which notwithstanding Eugenius s frequent advice he too much disregarded thinking that as not one of them was contracted thro any malignancy but on the contrary from an honesty of mind and a mere jocundity of humour they would all of them be cross d out in course Eugenius would never admit this and would often tell him that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with and he would often add in an accent of sorrowful apprehension to the uttermost mite To which Yorick with his usual carelessness of heart would as often answer with a pshaw and if the subject was started in the fields with a hop skip and a jump at the end of it but if close pent up in the social chimney corner where the culprit was barricado d in with a table and a couple of arm chairs and could not so readily fly off in a tangent Eugenius would then go on with his lecture upon discretion in words to this purpose though somewhat better put together Trust me dear Yorick this unwary pleasantry of thine will sooner or later bring thee into scrapes and difficulties which no after wit can extricate thee out of In these sallies too oft I see it happens that a person laughed at considers himself in the light of a person injured with all the rights of such a situation belonging to him and when thou viewest him in that light too and reckons up his friends his family his kindred and allies and musters up with them the many recruits which will list under him from a sense of common danger tis no extravagant arithmetic to say that for every ten jokes thou hast got an hundred enemies and till thou hast gone on and raised a swarm of wasps about thine ears and art half stung to death by them thou wilt never be convinced it is so I cannot suspect it in the man whom I esteem that there is the least spur from spleen or malevolence of intent in these sallies I believe and know them to be truly honest and sportive But consider my dear lad that fools cannot distinguish this and that knaves will not and thou knowest not what it is either to provoke the one or to make merry with the other whenever they associate for mutual defence depend upon it they will carry on the war in such a manner against thee my dear friend as to make thee heartily sick of it and of thy life too Revenge from some baneful corner shall level a tale of dishonour at thee which no innocence of heart or integrity of conduct shall set right The fortunes of thy house shall totter thy character which led the way to them shall bleed on every side of it thy faith questioned thy works belied thy wit forgotten thy learning trampled on To wind up the last scene of thy tragedy Cruelty and Cowardice twin ruffians hired and set on by Malice in the dark shall strike together at all thy infirmities and mistakes The best of us my dear lad lie open there and trust me trust me Yorick when to gratify a private appetite it is once resolved upon that an innocent and an helpless creature shall be sacrificed tis an easy matter to pick up sticks enough from any thicket where it has strayed to make a fire to offer it up with Yorick scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his destiny read over to him but with a tear stealing from his eye and a promissory look attending it that he was resolved for the time to come to ride his tit with more sobriety But alas too late a grand confederacy with and at the head of it was formed before the first prediction of it The whole plan of the attack just as Eugenius had foreboded was put in execution all at once with so little mercy on the side of the allies and so little suspicion in Yorick of what was carrying on against him that when he thought good easy man full surely preferment was o ripening they had smote his root and then he fell as many a worthy man had fallen before him Yorick however fought it out with all imaginable gallantry for some time till overpowered by numbers and worn out at length by the calamities of the war but more so by the ungenerous manner in which it was carried on he threw down the sword and though he kept up his spirits in appearance to the last he died nevertheless as was generally thought quite broken hearted What inclined Eugenius to the same opinion was as follows A few hours before Yorick breathed his last Eugenius stept in with an intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him Upon his drawing Yorick s curtain and asking how he felt himself Yorick looking up in his face took hold of his hand and after thanking him for the many tokens of his friendship to him for which he said if it was their fate to meet hereafter he would thank him again and again he told him he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the slip for ever I hope not answered Eugenius with tears trickling down his cheeks and with the tenderest tone that ever man spoke I hope not Yorick said he Yorick replied with a look up and a gentle squeeze of Eugenius s hand and that was all but it cut Eugenius to his heart Come come Yorick quoth Eugenius wiping his eyes and summoning up the man within him my dear lad be comforted let not all thy spirits and fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou most wants them who knows what resources are in store and what the power of God may yet do for thee Yorick laid his hand upon his heart and gently shook his head For my part continued Eugenius crying bitterly as he uttered the words I declare I know not Yorick how to part with thee and would gladly flatter my hopes added Eugenius chearing up his voice that there is still enough left of thee to make a bishop and that I may live to see it I beseech thee Eugenius quoth Yorick taking off his night cap as well as he could with his left hand his right being still grasped close in that of Eugenius I beseech thee to take a view of my head I see nothing that ails it replied Eugenius Then alas my friend said Yorick let me tell you that tis so bruised and mis shapened with the blows which and and some others have so unhandsomely given me in the dark that I might say with Sancho Panca that should I recover and Mitres thereupon be suffered to rain down from heaven as thick as hail not one of them would fit it Yorick s last breath was hanging upon his trembling lips ready to depart as he uttered this yet still it was uttered with something of a Cervantick tone and as he spoke it Eugenius could perceive a stream of lambent fire lighted up for a moment in his eyes faint picture of those flashes of his spirit which as Shakespeare said of his ancestor were wont to set the table in a roar Eugenius was convinced from this that the heart of his friend was broke he squeezed his hand and then walked softly out of the room weeping as he walked Yorick followed Eugenius with his eyes to the door he then closed them and never opened them more He lies buried in the corner of his church yard in the parish of under a plain marble slab which his friend Eugenius by leave of his executors laid upon his grave with no more than these three words of inscription serving both for his epitaph and elegy Alas poor Yorick Ten times a day has Yorick s ghost the consolation to hear his monumental inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones as denote a general pity and esteem for him a foot way crossing the church yard close by the side of his grave not a passenger goes by without stopping to cast a look upon it and sighing as he walks on Alas poor Yorick Chapter one XIII It is so long since the reader of this rhapsodical work has been parted from the midwife that it is high time to mention her again to him merely to put him in mind that there is such a body still in the world and whom upon the best judgment I can form upon my own plan at present I am going to introduce to him for good and all But as fresh matter may be started and much unexpected business fall out betwixt the reader and myself which may require immediate dispatch twas right to take care that the poor woman should not be lost in the mean time because when she is wanted we can no way do without her I think I told you that this good woman was a person of no small note and consequence throughout our whole village and township that her fame had spread itself to the very out edge and circumference of that circle of importance of which kind every soul living whether he has a shirt to his back or no has one surrounding him which said circle by the way whenever tis said that such a one is of great weight and importance in the world I desire may be enlarged or contracted in your worship s fancy in a compound ratio of the station profession knowledge abilities height and depth measuring both ways of the personage brought before you In the present case if I remember I fixed it about four or five miles which not only comprehended the whole parish but extended itself to two or three of the adjacent hamlets in the skirts of the next parish which made a considerable thing of it I must add That she was moreover very well looked on at one large grange house and some other odd houses and farms within two or three miles as I said from the smoke of her own chimney But I must here once for all inform you that all this will be more exactly delineated and explain d in a map now in the hands of the engraver which with many other pieces and developements of this work will be added to the end of the twentieth volume not to swell the work I detest the thought of such a thing but by way of commentary scholium illustration and key to such passages incidents or inuendos as shall be thought to be either of private interpretation or of dark or doubtful meaning after my life and my opinions shall have been read over now don t forget the meaning of the word by all the world which betwixt you and me and in spite of all the gentlemen reviewers in Great Britain and of all that their worships shall undertake to write or say to the contrary I am determined shall be the case I need not tell your worship that all this is spoke in confidence Chapter one XIV Upon looking into my mother s marriage settlement in order to satisfy myself and reader in a point necessary to be cleared up before we could proceed any farther in this history I had the good fortune to pop upon the very thing I wanted before I had read a day and a half straight forwards it might have taken me up a month which shews plainly that when a man sits down to write a history tho it be but the history of Jack Hickathrift or Tom Thumb he knows no more than his heels what lets and confounded hindrances he is to meet with in his way or what a dance he may be led by one excursion or another before all is over Could a historiographer drive on his history as a muleteer drives on his mule straight forward for instance from Rome all the way to Loretto without ever once turning his head aside either to the right hand or to the left he might venture to foretell you to an hour when he should get to his journey s end but the thing is morally speaking impossible For if he is a man of the least spirit he will have fifty deviations from a straight line to make with this or that party as he goes along which he can no ways avoid He will have views and prospects to himself perpetually soliciting his eye which he can no more help standing still to look at than he can fly he will moreover have various Accounts to reconcile Anecdotes to pick up Inscriptions to make out Stories to weave in Traditions to sift Personages to call upon Panegyricks to paste up at this door Pasquinades at that All which both the man and his mule are quite exempt from To sum up all there are archives at every stage to be look d into and rolls records documents and endless genealogies which justice ever and anon calls him back to stay the reading of In short there is no end of it for my own part I declare I have been at it these six weeks making all the speed I possibly could and am not yet born I have just been able and that s all to tell you when it happen d but not how so that you see the thing is yet far from being accomplished These unforeseen stoppages which I own I had no conception of when I first set out but which I am convinced now will rather increase than diminish as I advance have struck out a hint which I am resolved to follow and that is not to be in a hurry but to go on leisurely writing and publishing two volumes of my life every year which if I am suffered to go on quietly and can make a tolerable bargain with my bookseller I shall continue to do as long as I live Chapter one XV The article in my mother s marriage settlement which I told the reader I was at the pains to search for and which now that I have found it I think proper to lay before him is so much more fully express d in the deed itself than ever I can pretend to do it that it would be barbarity to take it out of the lawyer s hand It is as follows And this Indenture further witnesseth That the said

and free disposition of the rectory or parsonage of Shandy aforesaid and all and every the tenths tythes glebe lands In three words My mother was to lay in if she chose it in London But in order to put a stop to the practice of any unfair play on the part of my mother which a marriage article of this nature too manifestly opened a door to and which indeed had never been thought of at all but for my uncle Toby Shandy a clause was added in security of my father which was this That in case my mother hereafter should at any time put my father to the trouble and expence of a London journey upon false cries and tokens that for every such instance she should forfeit all the right and title which the covenant gave her to the next turn but to no more and so on toties quoties in as effectual a manner as if such a covenant betwixt them had not been made This by the way was no more than what was reasonable and yet as reasonable as it was I have ever thought it hard that the whole weight of the article should have fallen entirely as it did upon myself But I was begot and born to misfortunes for my poor mother whether it was wind or water or a compound of both or neither or whether it was simply the mere swell of imagination and fancy in her or how far a strong wish and desire to have it so might mislead her judgment in short whether she was deceived or deceiving in this matter it no way becomes me to decide The fact was this That in the latter end of September seventeen seventeen which was the year before I was born my mother having carried my father up to town much against the grain he peremptorily insisted upon the clause so that I was doom d by marriage articles to have my nose squeez d as flat to my face as if the destinies had actually spun me without one How this event came about and what a train of vexatious disappointments in one stage or other of my life have pursued me from the mere loss or rather compression of this one single member shall be laid before the reader all in due time Chapter one XVI My father as any body may naturally imagine came down with my mother into the country in but a pettish kind of a humour The first twenty or five and twenty miles he did nothing in the world but fret and teaze himself and indeed my mother too about the cursed expence which he said might every shilling of it have been saved then what vexed him more than every thing else was the provoking time of the year which as I told you was towards the end of September when his wall fruit and green gages especially in which he was very curious were just ready for pulling Had he been whistled up to London upon a Tom Fool s errand in any other month of the whole year he should not have said three words about it For the next two whole stages no subject would go down but the heavy blow he had sustain d from the loss of a son whom it seems he had fully reckon d upon in his mind and register d down in his pocket book as a second staff for his old age in case Bobby should fail him The disappointment of this he said was ten times more to a wise man than all the money which the journey c had cost him put together rot the hundred and twenty pounds he did not mind it a rush From Stilton all the way to Grantham nothing in the whole affair provoked him so much as the condolences of his friends and the foolish figure they should both make at church the first Sunday of which in the satirical vehemence of his wit now sharpen d a little by vexation he would give so many humorous and provoking descriptions and place his rib and self in so many tormenting lights and attitudes in the face of the whole congregation that my mother declared these two stages were so truly tragi comical that she did nothing but laugh and cry in a breath from one end to the other of them all the way From Grantham till they had cross d the Trent my father was out of all kind of patience at the vile trick and imposition which he fancied my mother had put upon him in this affair Certainly he would say to himself over and over again the woman could not be deceived herself if she could what weakness tormenting word which led his imagination a thorny dance and before all was over play d the duce and all with him for sure as ever the word weakness was uttered and struck full upon his brain so sure it set him upon running divisions upon how many kinds of weaknesses there were that there was such a thing as weakness of the body as well as weakness of the mind and then he would do nothing but syllogize within himself for a stage or two together How far the cause of all these vexations might or might not have arisen out of himself In short he had so many little subjects of disquietude springing out of this one affair all fretting successively in his mind as they rose up in it that my mother whatever was her journey up had but an uneasy journey of it down In a word as she complained to my uncle Toby he would have tired out the patience of any flesh alive Chapter one XVII Though my father travelled homewards as I told you in none of the best of moods pshawing and pishing all the way down yet he had the complaisance to keep the worst part of the story still to himself which was the resolution he had taken of doing himself the justice which my uncle Toby s clause in the marriage settlement empowered him nor was it till the very night in which I was begot which was thirteen months after that she had the least intimation of his design when my father happening as you remember to be a little chagrin d and out of temper took occasion as they lay chatting gravely in bed afterwards talking over what was to come to let her know that she must accommodate herself as well as she could to the bargain made between them in their marriage deeds which was to lye in of her next child in the country to balance the last year s journey My father was a gentleman of many virtues but he had a strong spice of that in his temper which might or might not add to the number Tis known by the name of perseverance in a good cause and of obstinacy in a bad one Of this my mother had so much knowledge that she knew twas to no purpose to make any remonstrance so she e en resolved to sit down quietly and make the most of it Chapter one XVIII As the point was that night agreed or rather determined that my mother should lye in of me in the country she took her measures accordingly for which purpose when she was three days or thereabouts gone with child she began to cast her eyes upon the midwife whom you have so often heard me mention and before the week was well got round as the famous doctor Manningham was not to be had she had come to a final determination in her mind notwithstanding there was a scientific operator within so near a call as eight miles of us and who moreover had expressly wrote a five shillings book upon the subject of midwifery in which he had exposed not only the blunders of the sisterhood itself but had likewise super added many curious improvements for the quicker extraction of the foetus in cross births and some other cases of danger which belay us in getting into the world notwithstanding all this my mother I say was absolutely determined to trust her life and mine with it into no soul s hand but this old woman s only Now this I like when we cannot get at the very thing we wish never to take up with the next best in degree to it no that s pitiful beyond description it is no more than a week from this very day in which I am now writing this book for the edification of the world which is March nine seventeen fifty nine that my dear dear Jenny observing I looked a little grave as she stood cheapening a silk of five and twenty shillings a yard told the mercer she was sorry she had given him so much trouble and immediately went and bought herself a yard wide stuff of ten pence a yard Tis the duplication of one and the same greatness of soul only what lessened the honour of it somewhat in my mother s case was that she could not heroine it into so violent and hazardous an extreme as one in her situation might have wished because the old midwife had really some little claim to be depended upon as much at least as success could give her having in the course of her practice of near twenty years in the parish brought every mother s son of them into the world without any one slip or accident which could fairly be laid to her account These facts tho they had their weight yet did not altogether satisfy some few scruples and uneasinesses which hung upon my father s spirits in relation to this choice To say nothing of the natural workings of humanity and justice or of the yearnings of parental and connubial love all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in a case of this kind he felt himself concerned in a particular manner that all should go right in the present case from the accumulated sorrow he lay open to should any evil betide his wife and child in lying in at Shandy Hall He knew the world judged by events and would add to his afflictions in such a misfortune by loading him with the whole blame of it Alas o day had missus Shandy poor gentlewoman had but her wish in going up to town just to lye in and come down again which they say she begged and prayed for upon her bare knees and which in my opinion considering the fortune which mister Shandy got with her was no such mighty matter to have complied with the lady and her babe might both of them have been alive at this hour This exclamation my father knew was unanswerable and yet it was not merely to shelter himself nor was it altogether for the care of his offspring and wife that he seemed so extremely anxious about this point my father had extensive views of things and stood moreover as he thought deeply concerned in it for the publick good from the dread he entertained of the bad uses an ill fated instance might be put to He was very sensible that all political writers upon the subject had unanimously agreed and lamented from the beginning of Queen Elizabeth s reign down to his own time that the current of men and money towards the metropolis upon one frivolous errand or another set in so strong as to become dangerous to our civil rights though by the bye a current was not the image he took most delight in a distemper was here his favourite metaphor and he would run it down into a perfect allegory by maintaining it was identically the same in the body national as in the body natural where the blood and spirits were driven up into the head faster than they could find their ways down a stoppage of circulation must ensue which was death in both cases There was little danger he would say of losing our liberties by French politicks or French invasions nor was he so much in pain of a consumption from the mass of corrupted matter and ulcerated humours in our constitution which he hoped was not so bad as it was imagined but he verily feared that in some violent push we should go off all at once in a state apoplexy and then he would say The Lord have mercy upon us all My father was never able to give the history of this distemper without the remedy along with it Was I an absolute prince he would say pulling up his breeches with both his hands as he rose from his arm chair I would appoint able judges at every avenue of my metropolis who should take cognizance of every fool s business who came there and if upon a fair and candid hearing it appeared not of weight sufficient to leave his own home and come up bag and baggage with his wife and children farmer s sons c c at his backside they should be all sent back from constable to constable like vagrants as they were to the place of their legal settlements By this means I shall take care that my metropolis totter d not thro its own weight that the head be no longer too big for the body that the extremes now wasted and pinn d in be restored to their due share of nourishment and regain with it their natural strength and beauty I would effectually provide That the meadows and corn fields of my dominions should laugh and sing that good chear and hospitality flourish once more and that such weight and influence be put thereby into the hands of the Squirality of my kingdom as should counterpoise what I perceive my Nobility are now taking from them Why are there so few palaces and gentlemen s seats he would ask with some emotion as he walked across the room throughout so many delicious provinces in France Whence is it that the few remaining Chateaus amongst them are so dismantled so unfurnished and in so ruinous and desolate a condition Because Sir he would say in that kingdom no man has any country interest to support the little interest of any kind which any man has any where in it is concentrated in the court and the looks of the Grand Monarch by the sunshine of whose countenance or the clouds which pass across it every French man lives or dies Another political reason which prompted my father so strongly to guard against the least evil accident in my mother s lying in in the country was That any such instance would infallibly throw a balance of power too great already into the weaker vessels of the gentry in his own or higher stations which with the many other usurped rights which that part of the constitution was hourly establishing would in the end prove fatal to the monarchical system of domestick government established in the first creation of things by God In this point he was entirely of Sir Robert Filmer s opinion That the plans and institutions of the greatest monarchies in the eastern parts of the world were originally all stolen from that admirable pattern and prototype of this houshold and paternal power which for a century he said and more had gradually been degenerating away into a mix d government the form of which however desirable in great combinations of the species was very troublesome in small ones and seldom produced any thing that he saw but sorrow and confusion For all these reasons private and publick put together my father was for having the man midwife by all means my mother by no means My father begg d and intreated she would for once recede from her prerogative in this matter and suffer him to choose for her my mother on the contrary insisted upon her privilege in this matter to choose for herself and have no mortal s help but the old woman s What could my father do He was almost at his wit s end talked it over with her in all moods placed his arguments in all lights argued the matter with her like a christian like a heathen like a husband like a father like a patriot like a man My mother answered every thing only like a woman which was a little hard upon her for as she could not assume and fight it out behind such a variety of characters twas no fair match twas seven to one What could my mother do She had the advantage otherwise she had been certainly overpowered of a small reinforcement of chagrin personal at the bottom which bore her up and enabled her to dispute the affair with my father with so equal an advantage that both sides sung Te Deum In a word my mother was to have the old woman and the operator was to have licence to drink a bottle of wine with my father and my uncle Toby Shandy in the back parlour for which he was to be paid five guineas I must beg leave before I finish this chapter to enter a caveat in the breast of my fair reader and it is this Not to take it absolutely for granted from an unguarded word or two which I have dropp d in it That I am a married man I own the tender appellation of my dear dear Jenny with some other strokes of conjugal knowledge interspersed here and there might naturally enough have misled the most candid judge in the world into such a determination against me All I plead for in this case Madam is strict justice and that you do so much of it to me as well as to yourself as not to prejudge or receive such an impression of me till you have better evidence than I am positive at present can be produced against me Not that I can be so vain or unreasonable Madam as to desire you should therefore think that my dear dear Jenny is my kept mistress no that would be flattering my character in the other extreme and giving it an air of freedom which perhaps it has no kind of right to All I contend for is the utter impossibility for some volumes that you or the most penetrating spirit upon earth should know how this matter really stands It is not impossible but that my dear dear Jenny tender as the appellation is may be my child Consider I was born in the year eighteen Nor is there any thing unnatural or extravagant in the supposition that my dear Jenny may be my friend Friend My friend Surely Madam a friendship between the two sexes may subsist and be supported without Fy mister Shandy Without any thing Madam but that tender and delicious sentiment which ever mixes in friendship where there is a difference of sex Let me intreat you to study the pure and sentimental parts of the best French Romances it will really Madam astonish you to see with what a variety of chaste expressions this delicious sentiment which I have the honour to speak of is dress d out Chapter one XIX I would sooner undertake to explain the hardest problem in geometry than pretend to account for it that a gentleman of my father s great good sense knowing as the reader must have observed him and curious too in philosophy wise also in political reasoning and in polemical as he will find no way ignorant could be capable of entertaining a notion in his head so out of the common track that I fear the reader when I come to mention it to him if he is the least of a cholerick temper will immediately throw the book by if mercurial he will laugh most heartily at it and if he is of a grave and saturnine cast he will at first sight absolutely condemn as fanciful and extravagant and that was in respect to the choice and imposition of christian names on which he thought a great deal more depended than what superficial minds were capable of conceiving His opinion in this matter was That there was a strange kind of magick bias which good or bad names as he called them irresistibly impressed upon our characters and conduct The hero of Cervantes argued not the point with more seriousness nor had he more faith or more to say on the powers of necromancy in dishonouring his deeds or on Dulcinea s name in shedding lustre upon them than my father had on those of Trismegistus or Archimedes on the one hand or of Nyky and Simkin on the other How many Caesars and Pompeys he would say by mere inspiration of the names have been rendered worthy of them And how many he would add are there who might have done exceeding well in the world had not their characters and spirits been totally depressed and Nicodemus d into nothing I see plainly Sir by your looks or as the case happened my father would say that you do not heartily subscribe to this opinion of mine which to those he would add who have not carefully sifted it to the bottom I own has an air more of fancy than of solid reasoning in it and yet my dear Sir if I may presume to know your character I am morally assured I should hazard little in stating a case to you not as a party in the dispute but as a judge and trusting my appeal upon it to your own good sense and candid disquisition in this matter you are a person free from as many narrow prejudices of education as most men and if I may presume to penetrate farther into you of a liberality of genius above bearing down an opinion merely because it wants friends Your son your dear son from whose sweet and open temper you have so much to expect Your Billy Sir would you for the world have called him Judas Would you my dear Sir he would say laying his hand upon your breast with the genteelest address and in that soft and irresistible piano of voice which the nature of the argumentum ad hominem absolutely requires Would you Sir if a Jew of a godfather had proposed the name for your child and offered you his purse along with it would you have consented to such a desecration of him O my God he would say looking up if I know your temper right Sir you are incapable of it you would have trampled upon the offer you would have thrown the temptation at the tempter s head with abhorrence Your greatness of mind in this action which I admire with that generous contempt of money which you shew me in the whole transaction is really noble and what renders it more so is the principle of it the workings of a parent s love upon the truth and conviction of this very hypothesis namely That was your son called Judas the forbid and treacherous idea so inseparable from the name would have accompanied him through life like his shadow and in the end made a miser and a rascal of him in spite Sir of your example I never knew a man able to answer this argument But indeed to speak of my father as he was he was certainly irresistible both in his orations and disputations he was born an orator Greek Persuasion hung upon his lips and the elements of Logick and Rhetorick were so blended up in him and withal he had so shrewd a guess at the weaknesses and passions of his respondent that Nature might have stood up and said This man is eloquent In short whether he was on the weak or the strong side of the question twas hazardous in either case to attack him And yet tis strange he had never read Cicero nor Quintilian de Oratore nor Isocrates nor Aristotle nor Longinus amongst the antients nor Vossius nor Skioppius nor Ramus nor Farnaby amongst the moderns and what is more astonishing he had never in his whole life the least light or spark of subtilty struck into his mind by one single lecture upon Crackenthorp or Burgersdicius or any Dutch logician or commentator he knew not so much as in what the difference of an argument ad ignorantiam and an argument ad hominem consisted so that I well remember when he went up along with me to enter my name at Jesus College in it was a matter of just wonder with my worthy tutor and two or three fellows of that learned society that a man who knew not so much as the names of his tools should be able to work after that fashion with them To work with them in the best manner he could was what my father was however perpetually forced upon for he had a thousand little sceptical notions of the comick kind to defend most of which notions I verily believe at first entered upon the footing of mere whims and of a vive la Bagatelle and as such he would make merry with them for half an hour or so and having sharpened his wit upon them dismiss them till another day I mention this not only as matter of hypothesis or conjecture upon the progress and establishment of my father s many odd opinions but as a warning to the learned reader against the indiscreet reception of such guests who after a free and undisturbed entrance for some years into our brains at length claim a kind of settlement there working sometimes like yeast but more generally after the manner of the gentle passion beginning in jest but ending in downright earnest Whether this was the case of the singularity of my father s notions or that his judgment at length became the dupe of his wit or how far in many of his notions he might though odd be absolutely right the reader as he comes at them shall decide All that I maintain here is that in this one of the influence of christian names however it gained footing he was serious he was all uniformity he was systematical and like all systematic reasoners he would move both heaven and earth and twist and torture every thing in nature to support his hypothesis In a word I repeat it over again he was serious and in consequence of it he would lose all kind of patience whenever he saw people especially of condition who should have known better as careless and as indifferent about the name they imposed upon their child or more so than in the choice of Ponto or Cupid for their puppy dog This he would say look d ill and had moreover this particular aggravation in it viz That when once a vile name was wrongfully or injudiciously given twas not like the case of a man s character which when wrong d might hereafter be cleared and possibly some time or other if not in the man s life at least after his death be somehow or other set to rights with the world But the injury of this he would say could never be undone nay he doubted even whether an act of parliament could reach it He knew as well as you that the legislature assumed a power over surnames but for very strong reasons which he could give it had never yet adventured he would say to go a step farther It was observable that tho my father in consequence of this opinion had as I have told you the strongest likings and dislikings towards certain names that there were still numbers of names which hung so equally in the balance before him that they were absolutely indifferent to him Jack Dick and Tom were of this class These my father called neutral names affirming of them without a satire That there had been as many knaves and fools at least as wise and good men since the world began who had indifferently borne them so that like equal forces acting against each other in contrary directions he thought they mutually destroyed each other s effects for which reason he would often declare He would not give a cherry stone to choose amongst them Bob which was my brother s name was another of these neutral kinds of christian names which operated very little either way and as my father happen d to be at Epsom when it was given him he would oft times thank Heaven it was no worse Andrew was something like a negative quantity in Algebra with him twas worse he said than nothing William stood pretty high Numps again was low with him and Nick he said was the Devil But of all names in the universe he had the most unconquerable aversion for Tristram he had the lowest and most contemptible opinion of it of any thing in the world thinking it could possibly produce nothing in rerum natura but what was extremely mean and pitiful So that in the midst of a dispute on the subject in which by the bye he was frequently involved he would sometimes break off in a sudden and spirited Epiphonema or rather Erotesis raised a third and sometimes a full fifth above the key of the discourse and demand it categorically of his antagonist Whether he would take upon him to say he had ever remembered whether he had ever read or even whether he had ever heard tell of a man called Tristram performing any thing great or worth recording No he would say Tristram The thing is impossible What could be wanting in my father but to have wrote a book to publish this notion of his to the world Little boots it to the subtle speculatist to stand single in his opinions unless he gives them proper vent It was the identical thing which my father did for in the year sixteen which was two years before I was born he was at the pains of writing an express Dissertation simply upon the word Tristram shewing the world with great candour and modesty the grounds of his great abhorrence to the name When this story is compared with the title page Will not the gentle reader pity my father from his soul to see an orderly and well disposed gentleman who tho singular yet inoffensive in his notions so played upon in them by cross purposes to look down upon the stage and see him baffled and overthrown in all his little systems and wishes to behold a train of events perpetually falling out against him and in so critical and cruel a way as if they had purposedly been plann d and pointed against him merely to insult his speculations In a word to behold such a one in his old age ill fitted for troubles ten times in a day suffering sorrow ten times in a day calling the child of his prayers Tristram Melancholy dissyllable of sound which to his ears was unison to Nincompoop and every name vituperative under heaven By his ashes I swear it if ever malignant spirit took pleasure or busied itself in traversing the purposes of mortal man it must have been here and if it was not necessary I should be born before I was christened I would this moment give the reader an account of it Chapter one XX How could you Madam be so inattentive in reading the last chapter I told you in it That my mother was not a papist Papist You told me no such thing Sir Madam I beg leave to repeat it over again that I told you as plain at least as words by direct inference could tell you such a thing Then Sir I must have miss d a page No Madam you have not miss d a word Then I was asleep Sir My pride Madam cannot allow you that refuge Then I declare I know nothing at all about the matter That Madam is the very fault I lay to your charge and as a punishment for it I do insist upon it that you immediately turn back that is as soon as you get to the next full stop and read the whole chapter over again I have imposed this penance upon the lady neither out of wantonness nor cruelty but from the best of motives and therefore shall make her no apology for it when she returns back Tis to rebuke a vicious taste which has crept into thousands besides herself of reading straight forwards more in quest of the adventures than of the deep erudition and knowledge which a book of this cast if read over as it should be would infallibly impart with them The mind should be accustomed to make wise reflections and draw curious conclusions as it goes along the habitude of which made Pliny the younger affirm That he never read a book so bad but he drew some profit from it The stories of Greece and Rome run over without this turn and application do less service I affirm it than the history of Parismus and Parismenus or of the Seven Champions of England read with it But here comes my fair lady Have you read over again the chapter Madam as I desired you You have And did you not observe the passage upon the second reading which admits the inference Not a word like it Then Madam be pleased to ponder well the last line but one of the chapter where I take upon me to say It was necessary I should be born before I was christen d Had my mother Madam been a Papist that consequence did not follow The Romish Rituals direct the baptizing of the child in cases of danger before it is born but upon this proviso That some part or other of the child s body be seen by the baptizer But the Doctors of the Sorbonne by a deliberation held amongst them April ten seventeen thirty three have enlarged the powers of the midwives by determining That though no part of the child s body should appear that baptism shall nevertheless be administered to it by injection par le moyen d une petite canulle Anglice a squirt Tis very strange that saint Thomas Aquinas who had so good a mechanical head both for tying and untying the knots of school divinity should after so much pains bestowed upon this give up the point at last as a second La chose impossible Infantes in maternis uteris existentes quoth saint Thomas baptizari possunt nullo modo O Thomas Thomas If the reader has the curiosity to see the question upon baptism by injection as presented to the Doctors of the Sorbonne with their consultation thereupon it is as follows It is a terrible misfortune for this same book of mine but more so to the Republick of letters so that my own is quite swallowed up in the consideration of it that this self same vile pruriency for fresh adventures in all things has got so strongly into our habit and humour and so wholly intent are we upon satisfying the impatience of our concupiscence that way that nothing but the gross and more carnal parts of a composition will go down The subtle hints and sly communications of science fly off like spirits upwards the heavy moral escapes downwards and both the one and the other are as much lost to the world as if they were still left in the bottom of the ink horn I wish the male reader has not pass d by many a one as quaint and curious as this one in which the female reader has been detected I wish it may have its effects and that all good people both male and female from example may be taught to think as well as read Memoire presente a Messieurs les Docteurs de Sorbonne Vide Deventer Paris Edit fourto seventeen thirty four p three hundred sixty six Un Chirurgien Accoucheur represente a Messieurs les Docteurs de Sorbonne qu il y a des cas quoique tres rares ou une mere ne scauroit accoucher meme ou l enfant est tellement renferme dans le sein de sa mere qu il ne fait paroitre aucune partie de son corps ce qui seroit un cas suivant les Rituels de lui conferer du moins sous condition le bapteme Le Chirurgien qui consulte pretend par le moyen d une petite canulle de pouvoir baptiser immediatement l enfant sans faire aucun tort a la mere Il demand si ce moyen qu il vient de proposer est permis legitime s il peut s en servir dans les cas qu il vient d exposer Reponse Le Conseil estime que la question proposee souffre de grandes difficultes Les Theologiens posent d un cote pour principe que le bapteme qui est une naissance spirituelle suppose une premiere naissance il faut etre ne dans le monde pour renaitre en Jesus Christ comme ils l enseignent S Thomas three part quaest eighty eight artic II suit cette doctrine comme une verite constante l on ne peut dit ce S Docteur baptiser les enfans qui sont renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres S Thomas est fonde sur ce que les enfans ne sont point nes ne peuvent etre comptes parmi les autres hommes d ou il conclud qu ils ne peuvent etre l objet d une action exterieure pour recevoir par leur ministere les sacremens necessaires au salut Pueri in maternis uteris existentes nondum prodierunt in lucem ut cum aliis hominibus vitam ducant unde non possunt subjici actioni humanae ut per eorum ministerium sacramenta recipiant ad salutem Les rituels ordonnent dans la pratique ce que les theologiens ont etabli sur les memes matieres ils deffendent tous d une maniere uniforme de baptiser les enfans qui sont renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres s ils ne sont paroitre quelque partie de leurs corps Le concours des theologiens des rituels qui sont les regles des dioceses paroit former une autorite qui termine la question presente cependant le conseil de conscience considerant d un cote que le raisonnement des theologiens est uniquement fonde sur une raison de convenance que la deffense des rituels suppose que l on ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres ce qui est contre la supposition presente d un autre cote considerant que les memes theologiens enseignent que l on peut risquer les sacremens que Jesus Christ a etablis comme des moyens faciles mais necessaires pour sanctifier les hommes d ailleurs estimant que les enfans renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres pourroient etre capables de salut parcequ ils sont capables de damnation pour ces considerations en egard a l expose suivant lequel on assure avoir trouve un moyen certain de baptiser ces enfans ainsi renfermes sans faire aucun tort a la mere le Conseil estime que l on pourroit se servir du moyen propose dans la confiance qu il a que Dieu n a point laisse ces sortes d enfans sans aucuns secours supposant comme il est expose que le moyen dont il s agit est propre a leur procurer le bapteme cependant comme il s agiroit en autorisant la pratique proposee de changer une regle universellement etablie le Conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit s addresser a son eveque a qui il appartient de juger de l utilite du danger du moyen propose comme sous le bon plaisir de l eveque le Conseil estime qu il faudroit recourir au Pape qui a le droit d expliquer les regles de l eglise d y deroger dans le cas ou la loi ne scauroit obliger quelque sage quelque utile que paroisse la maniere de baptiser dont il s agit le Conseil ne pourroit l approver sans le concours de ces deux autorites On conseile au moins a celui qui consulte de s addresser a son eveque de lui faire part de la presente decision afin que si le prelat entre dans les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussignes s appuyent il puisse etre autorise dans le cas de necessite ou il risqueroit trop d attendre que la permission fut demandee accordee d employer le moyen qu il propose si avantageux au salut de l enfant Au reste le Conseil en estimant que l on pourroit s en servir croit cependant que si les enfans dont il s agit venoient au monde contre l esperance de ceux qui se seroient servis du meme moyen il seroit necessaire de les baptiser sous condition en cela le Conseil se conforme a tous les rituels qui en autorisant le bapteme d un enfant qui fait paroitre quelque partie de son corps enjoignent neantmoins ordonnent de le baptiser sous condition s il vient heureusement au monde Delibere en Sorbonne le ten Avril seventeen thirty three A Le Moyne L De Romigny De Marcilly mister Tristram Shandy s compliments to Messrs Le Moyne De Romigny and De Marcilly hopes they all rested well the night after so tiresome a consultation He begs to know whether after the ceremony of marriage and before that of consummation the baptizing all the Homunculi at once slapdash by injection would not be a shorter and safer cut still on condition as above That if the Homunculi do well and come safe into the world after this that each and every of them shall be baptized again sous condition And provided in the second place That the thing can be done which mister Shandy apprehends it may par le moyen d une petite canulle and sans faire aucune tort au pere Chapter one XXI I wonder what s all that noise and running backwards and forwards for above stairs quoth my father addressing himself after an hour and a half s silence to my uncle Toby who you must know was sitting on the opposite side of the fire smoaking his social pipe all the time in mute contemplation of a new pair of black plush breeches which he had got on What can they be doing brother quoth my father we can scarce hear ourselves talk I think replied my uncle Toby taking his pipe from his mouth and striking the head of it two or three times upon the nail of his left thumb as he began his sentence I think says he But to enter rightly into my uncle Toby s sentiments upon this matter you must be made to enter first a little into his character the out lines of which I shall just give you and then the dialogue between him and my father will go on as well again Pray what was that man s name for I write in such a hurry I have no time to recollect or look for it who first made the observation That there was great inconstancy in our air and climate Whoever he was twas a just and good observation in him But the corollary drawn from it namely That it is this which has furnished us with such a variety of odd and whimsical characters that was not his it was found out by another man at least a century and a half after him Then again that this copious store house of original materials is the true and natural cause that our Comedies are so much better than those of France or any others that either have or can be wrote upon the Continent that discovery was not fully made till about the middle of King William s reign when the great Dryden in writing one of his long prefaces if I mistake not most fortunately hit upon it Indeed toward the latter end of queen Anne the great Addison began to patronize the notion and more fully explained it to the world in one or two of his Spectators but the discovery was not his Then fourthly and lastly that this strange irregularity in our climate producing so strange an irregularity in our characters doth thereby in some sort make us amends by giving us somewhat to make us merry with when the weather will not suffer us to go out of doors that observation is my own and was struck out by me this very rainy day March twenty six seventeen fifty nine and betwixt the hours of nine and ten in the morning Thus thus my fellow labourers and associates in this great harvest of our learning now ripening before our eyes thus it is by slow steps of casual increase that our knowledge physical metaphysical physiological polemical nautical mathematical aenigmatical technical biographical romantical chemical and obstetrical with fifty other branches of it most of em ending as these do in ical have for these two last centuries and more gradually been creeping upwards towards that Akme of their perfections from which if we may form a conjecture from the advances of these last seven years we cannot possibly be far off When that happens it is to be hoped it will put an end to all kind of writings whatsoever the want of all kind of writing will put an end to all kind of reading and that in time As war begets poverty poverty peace must in course put an end to all kind of knowledge and then we shall have all to begin over again or in other words be exactly where we started Happy Thrice happy times I only wish that the aera of my begetting as well as the mode and manner of it had been a little alter d or that it could have been put off with any convenience to my father or mother for some twenty or five and twenty years longer when a man in the literary world might have stood some chance But I forget my uncle Toby whom all this while we have left knocking the ashes out of his tobacco pipe His humour was of that particular species which does honour to our atmosphere and I should have made no scruple of ranking him amongst one of the first rate productions of it had not there appeared too many strong lines in it of a family likeness which shewed that he derived the singularity of his temper more from blood than either wind or water or any modifications or combinations of them whatever And I have therefore oft times wondered that my father tho I believe he had his reasons for it upon his observing some tokens of eccentricity in my course when I was a boy should never once endeavour to account for them in this way for all the Shandy Family were of an original character throughout I mean the males the females had no character at all except indeed my great aunt Dinah who about sixty years ago was married and got with child by the coachman for which my father according to his hypothesis of christian names would often say She might thank her godfathers and godmothers It will seem strange and I would as soon think of dropping a riddle in the reader s way which is not my interest to do as set him upon guessing how it could come to pass that an event of this kind so many years after it had happened should be reserved for the interruption of the peace and unity which otherwise so cordially subsisted between my father and my uncle Toby One would have thought that the whole force of the misfortune should have spent and wasted itself in the family at first as is generally the case But nothing ever wrought with our family after the ordinary way Possibly at the very time this happened it might have something else to afflict it and as afflictions are sent down for our good and that as this had never done the Shandy Family any good at all it might lie waiting till apt times and circumstances should give it an opportunity to discharge its office Observe I determine nothing upon this My way is ever to point out to the curious different tracts of investigation to come at the first springs of the events I tell not with a pedantic Fescue or in the decisive manner or Tacitus who outwits himself and his reader but with the officious humility of a heart devoted to the assistance merely of the inquisitive to them I write and by them I shall be read if any such reading as this could be supposed to hold out so long to the very end of the world Why this cause of sorrow therefore was thus reserved for my father and uncle is undetermined by me But how and in what direction it exerted itself so as to become the cause of dissatisfaction between them after it began to operate is what I am able to explain with great exactness and is as follows My uncle Toby Shandy Madam was a gentleman who with the virtues which usually constitute the character of a man of honour and rectitude possessed one in a very eminent degree which is seldom or never put into the catalogue and that was a most extreme and unparallel d modesty of nature though I correct the word nature for this reason that I may not prejudge a point which must shortly come to a hearing and that is Whether this modesty of his was natural or acquir d Whichever way my uncle Toby came by it twas nevertheless modesty in the truest sense of it and that is Madam not in regard to words for he was so unhappy as to have very little choice in them but to things and this kind of modesty so possessed him and it arose to such a height in him as almost to equal if such a thing could be even the modesty of a woman That female nicety Madam and inward cleanliness of mind and fancy in your sex which makes you so much the awe of ours You will imagine Madam that my uncle Toby had contracted all this from this very source that he had spent a great part of his time in converse with your sex and that from a thorough knowledge of you and the force of imitation which such fair examples render irresistible he had acquired this amiable turn of mind I wish I could say so for unless it was with his sister in law my father s wife and my mother my uncle Toby scarce exchanged three words with the sex in as many years no he got it Madam by a blow A blow Yes Madam it was owing to a blow from a stone broke off by a ball from the parapet of a horn work at the siege of Namur which struck full upon my uncle Toby s groin Which way could that effect it The story of that Madam is long and interesting but it would be running my history all upon heaps to give it you here Tis for an episode hereafter and every circumstance relating to it in its proper place shall be faithfully laid before you Till then it is not in my power to give farther light into this matter or say more than what I have said already That my uncle Toby was a gentleman of unparallel d modesty which happening to be somewhat subtilized and rarified by the constant heat of a little family pride they both so wrought together within him that he could never bear to hear the affair of my aunt Dinah touch d upon but with the greatest emotion The least hint of it was enough to make the blood fly into his face but when my father enlarged upon the story in mixed companies which the illustration of his hypothesis frequently obliged him to do the unfortunate blight of one of the fairest branches of the family would set my uncle Toby s honour and modesty o bleeding and he would often take my father aside in the greatest concern imaginable to expostulate and tell him he would give him any thing in the world only to let the story rest My father I believe had the truest love and tenderness for my uncle Toby that ever one brother bore towards another and would have done any thing in nature which one brother in reason could have desir d of another to have made my uncle Toby s heart easy in this or any other point But this lay out of his power My father as I told you was a philosopher in grain speculative systematical and my aunt Dinah s affair was a matter of as much consequence to him as the retrogradation of the planets to Copernicus The backslidings of Venus in her orbit fortified the Copernican system called so after his name and the backslidings of my aunt Dinah in her orbit did the same service in establishing my father s system which I trust will for ever hereafter be called the Shandean System after his In any other family dishonour my father I believe had as nice a sense of shame as any man whatever and neither he nor I dare say Copernicus would have divulged the affair in either case or have taken the least notice of it to the world but for the obligations they owed as they thought to truth Amicus Plato my father would say construing the words to my uncle Toby as he went along Amicus Plato that is Dinah was my aunt sed magis amica veritas but Truth is my sister This contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle was the source of many a fraternal squabble The one could not bear to hear the tale of family disgrace recorded and the other would scarce ever let a day pass to an end without some hint at it For God s sake my uncle Toby would cry and for my sake and for all our sakes my dear brother Shandy do let this story of our aunt s and her ashes sleep in peace how can you how can you have so little feeling and compassion for the character of our family What is the character of a family to an hypothesis my father would reply Nay if you come to that what is the life of a family The life of a family my uncle Toby would say throwing himself back in his arm chair and lifting up his hands his eyes and one leg Yes the life my father would say maintaining his point How many thousands of em are there every year that come cast away in all civilized countries at least and considered as nothing but common air in competition of an hypothesis In my plain sense of things my uncle Toby would answer every such instance is downright Murder let who will commit it There lies your mistake my father would reply for in Foro Scientiae there is no such thing as Murder tis only Death brother My uncle Toby would never offer to answer this by any other kind of argument than that of whistling half a dozen bars of Lillebullero You must know it was the usual channel thro which his passions got vent when any thing shocked or surprized him but especially when any thing which he deem d very absurd was offered As not one of our logical writers nor any of the commentators upon them that I remember have thought proper to give a name to this particular species of argument I here take the liberty to do it myself for two reasons First That in order to prevent all confusion in disputes it may stand as much distinguished for ever from every other species of argument as the Argumentum ad Verecundiam ex Absurdo ex Fortiori or any other argument whatsoever And secondly That it may be said by my children s children when my head is laid to rest that their learn d grandfather s head had been busied to as much purpose once as other people s That he had invented a name and generously thrown it into the Treasury of the Ars Logica for one of the most unanswerable arguments in the whole science And if the end of disputation is more to silence than convince they may add if they please to one of the best arguments too I do therefore by these presents strictly order and command That it be known and distinguished by the name and title of the Argumentum Fistulatorium and no other and that it rank hereafter with the Argumentum Baculinum and the Argumentum ad Crumenam and for ever hereafter be treated of in the same chapter As for the Argumentum Tripodium which is never used but by the woman against the man and the Argumentum ad Rem which contrarywise is made use of by the man only against the woman As these two are enough in conscience for one lecture and moreover as the one is the best answer to the other let them likewise be kept apart and be treated of in a place by themselves Chapter one XXII The learned Bishop Hall I mean the famous doctor Joseph Hall

2021-169435-0004	train-other-500	This is precisely my situation For in this long digression which I was accidentally led into as in all my digressions one only excepted there is a master stroke of digressive skill
2021-169435-0005	train-other-500	the merit of which has all along I fear been over looked by my reader not for want of penetration in him but because tis an excellence seldom looked for or expected indeed in a digression and it is this
2021-169435-0006	train-other-500	That tho my digressions are all fair as you observe and that I fly off from what I am about as far and as often too as any writer in Great Britain yet I constantly take care
none	none	 to order affairs 
2021-169435-0007	train-other-500	so that my main business does not stand still in my absence I was just going for example to have given you the great out lines of my uncle Toby s most whimsical character
2021-169435-0008	train-other-500	when my aunt Dinah and the coachman came across us and led us a vagary some millions of miles into the very heart of the planetary system Notwithstanding all this you perceive that
none	none	 the drawing of my uncle Toby s character went on gently all the time not the great contours of it that was impossible but some familiar strokes and faint designations of it were here and there touch d on 
2021-169435-0009	train-other-500	as we went along so that you are much better acquainted with my uncle Toby now than you was before By this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a species by itself two contrary motions
none	none	 are introduced into it and reconciled which were thought to be at variance with each other In a word my work is digressive and it is progressive too and at the same time This Sir is a very different story 
2021-169435-0010	train-other-500	from that of the earth s moving round her axis
none	none	 in her diurnal rotation with her progress in her elliptick orbit 
2021-169435-0011	train-other-500	which brings about the year and constitutes that variety and vicissitude of seasons we enjoy though I own it suggested the thought as I believe the greatest of our
2021-169435-0012	train-other-500	boasted improvements and discoveries have come from such trifling hints Digressions incontestably are the sunshine they are the life the soul of reading take them out of this book for instance
2021-169435-0013	train-other-500	you might as well take the book along with them one cold eternal winter would reign in every page of it restore them to the writer he steps forth like a bridegroom bids All hail brings in variety
2021-169435-0014	train-other-500	and forbids the appetite to fail All the dexterity is in the good cookery and management of them so as to be not only for the advantage of the reader but also of the author
none	none	 whose distress in this matter is truly pitiable For if he begins a digression from that moment I observe his whole work stands stock still and if he goes on with his main work then there is an end of his digression This is vile work For which reason from the beginning of this you see I have constructed the main work and the adventitious parts of it with such intersections and have so complicated and involved the digressive and progressive movements 
2021-169435-0015	train-other-500	one wheel within another that the whole machine in general has been kept a going and what s more it shall be kept a going these forty years
none	none	 if it pleases the fountain of health 
2021-169435-0016	train-other-500	to bless me so long with life and good spirits
none	none	 Chapter one XXIII I have a strong propensity in me to begin this chapter very nonsensically 
2021-169435-0017	train-other-500	and I will not balk my fancy Accordingly I set off thus
none	none	 If the fixture of Momus s glass in the human breast 
2021-169435-0018	train-other-500	according to the proposed emendation of that arch critick had taken place first This foolish consequence would certainly have followed That the very wisest and very gravest of us all in one coin or other
2021-169435-0019	train-other-500	must have paid window money every day of our lives And secondly
none	none	 that had the said glass been there set up nothing more would have been wanting 
2021-169435-0020	train-other-500	in order to have taken a man s character but to have taken a chair and gone softly as you would to a dioptrical bee hive and look d in view d the soul stark naked observed all her motions her machinations
none	none	 traced all her maggots from their first engendering to their crawling forth watched her loose in her frisks her gambols her capricios 
2021-169435-0021	train-other-500	and after some notice of her more solemn deportment
none	none	 consequent upon such frisks c then taken your pen and ink and set down 
2021-169435-0022	train-other-500	nothing but what you had seen and could have sworn to But this is an advantage not to be had by the biographer in this planet in the planet Mercury belike it may be so if not better still for him
2021-169435-0023	train-other-500	for there the intense heat of the country which is proved by computators from its vicinity to the sun to be more than equal to that of red hot iron must I think long ago have vitrified the bodies of the inhabitants
2021-169435-0024	train-other-500	as the efficient cause
none	none	 to suit them for the climate which is the final cause 
2021-169435-0025	train-other-500	so that betwixt them both all the tenements of their souls from top to bottom may be nothing else for aught the soundest philosophy can shew to the contrary but one fine transparent body
2021-169435-0026	train-other-500	of clear glass bating the umbilical knot so that till the inhabitants grow old and tolerably wrinkled whereby the rays of light in passing through them become so monstrously refracted
2021-169435-0027	train-other-500	or return reflected from their surfaces in such transverse lines to the eye that a man cannot be seen through his soul might as well unless for mere ceremony
2021-169435-0028	train-other-500	or the trifling advantage which the umbilical point gave her might upon all other accounts I say as well play the fool out o doors as in her own house But this as I said above
none	none	 is not the case of the inhabitants of this earth our minds shine not through the body but are wrapt up here in a dark covering of uncrystalized flesh and blood so that if we would come to the specific characters of them 
2021-169435-0029	train-other-500	we must go some other way to work Many in good truth are the ways which human wit has been forced to take to do this thing with exactness Some for instance draw all their characters with wind instruments
none	none	 Virgil takes notice of that way in the affair of Dido and Aeneas 
2021-169435-0030	train-other-500	but it is as fallacious as the breath of fame and moreover bespeaks a narrow genius I am not ignorant that the Italians pretend to a mathematical exactness
none	none	 in their designations 
2021-169435-0031	train-other-500	of one particular sort of character among them from the forte or piano of a certain wind instrument they use which they say is infallible
none	none	 I dare not mention the name of the instrument in this place tis sufficient we have it amongst us 
2021-169435-0032	train-other-500	but never think of making a drawing by it this is aenigmatical and intended to be so at least ad populum
none	none	 And therefore I beg Madam 
2021-169435-0033	train-other-500	when you come here that you read on as fast as you can and never stop to make any inquiry about it There are others again who will draw a man s character from no other helps in the world but merely from his evacuations
2021-169435-0034	train-other-500	but this often gives a very incorrect outline unless indeed you take a sketch of his repletions too and by correcting one drawing from the other compound one good figure out of them both
2021-169435-0035	train-other-500	I should have no objection to this method but that I think it must smell too strong of the lamp and be render d still more operose
none	none	 by forcing you to have an eye to the rest of his Non naturals Why the most natural actions of a man s life should be called his Non naturals is another question There are others fourthly who disdain every one of these expedients not from any fertility of their own but from the various ways of doing it which they have borrowed from the honourable devices which the Pentagraphic Brethren Pentagraph an instrument to copy Prints and Pictures mechanically and in any proportion of the brush have shewn in taking copies These you must know are your great historians 
2021-169435-0036	train-other-500	One of these you will see drawing a full length character against the light that s illiberal dishonest and hard upon the character of the man who sits
none	none	 Others to mend the matter will make a drawing of you in the Camera 
2021-169435-0037	train-other-500	that is most unfair of all because
none	none	 there you are sure to be represented in some of your most ridiculous attitudes 
2021-169435-0038	train-other-500	To avoid all and every one of these errors in giving you my uncle Toby s character
none	none	 I am determined to draw it by no mechanical help whatever 
2021-169435-0039	train-other-500	nor shall my pencil be guided by any one wind instrument which ever was blown upon either on this
none	none	 or on the other side of the Alps nor will I consider either his repletions or his discharges or touch upon his Non naturals but in a word I will draw my uncle Toby s character from his Hobby Horse Chapter one XXIV If I was not morally sure that the reader must be out of all patience for my uncle Toby s character I would here previously have convinced him that there is no instrument so fit to draw such a thing with as that which I have pitch d upon A man and his Hobby Horse tho I cannot say that they act and re act exactly after the same manner in which the soul and body do upon each other Yet doubtless there is a communication between them of some kind and my opinion rather is that there is something in it more of the manner of electrified bodies and that by means of the heated parts of the rider which come immediately into contact with the back of the Hobby Horse by long journies and much friction it so happens that the body of the rider is at length fill d as full of Hobby Horsical matter as it can hold so that if you are able to give but a clear description of the nature of the one you may form a pretty exact notion of the genius and character of the other Now the Hobby Horse which my uncle Toby always rode upon was in my opinion an Hobby Horse well worth giving a description of if it was only upon the score of his great singularity for you might have travelled from York to Dover from Dover to Penzance in Cornwall and from Penzance to York back again and not have seen such another upon the road or if you had seen such a one whatever haste you had been in you must infallibly have stopp d to have taken a view of him Indeed the gait and figure of him was so strange and so utterly unlike was he from his head to his tail to any one of the whole species that it was now and then made a matter of dispute whether he was really a Hobby Horse or no But as the Philosopher would use no other argument to the Sceptic who disputed with him against the reality of motion save that of rising up upon his legs and walking across the room so would my uncle Toby use no other argument to prove his Hobby Horse was a Hobby Horse indeed but by getting upon his back and riding him about leaving the world after that to determine the point as it thought fit In good truth my uncle Toby mounted him with so much pleasure and he carried my uncle Toby so well that he troubled his head very little with what the world either said or thought about it It is now high time however that I give you a description of him But to go on regularly I only beg you will give me leave to acquaint you first how my uncle Toby came by him Chapter one XXV The wound in my uncle Toby s groin which he received at the siege of Namur rendering him unfit for the service it was thought expedient he should return to England in order if possible to be set to rights He was four years totally confined part of it to his bed and all of it to his room and in the course of his cure which was all that time in hand suffer d unspeakable miseries owing to a succession of exfoliations from the os pubis and the outward edge of that part of the coxendix called the os illium both which bones were dismally crush d as much by the irregularity of the stone which I told you was broke off the parapet as by its size tho it was pretty large which inclined the surgeon all along to think that the great injury which it had done my uncle Toby s groin was more owing to the gravity of the stone itself than to the projectile force of it which he would often tell him was a great happiness My father at that time was just beginning business in London and had taken a house and as the truest friendship and cordiality subsisted between the two brothers and that my father thought my uncle Toby could no where be so well nursed and taken care of as in his own house he assign d him the very best apartment in it And what was a much more sincere mark of his affection still he would never suffer a friend or an acquaintance to step into the house on any occasion but he would take him by the hand and lead him up stairs to see his brother Toby and chat an hour by his bed side The history of a soldier s wound beguiles the pain of it my uncle s visitors at least thought so and in their daily calls upon him from the courtesy arising out of that belief they would frequently turn the discourse to that subject and from that subject the discourse would generally roll on to the siege itself These conversations were infinitely kind and my uncle Toby received great relief from them and would have received much more but that they brought him into some unforeseen perplexities which for three months together retarded his cure greatly and if he had not hit upon an expedient to extricate himself out of them I verily believe they would have laid him in his grave What these perplexities of my uncle Toby were tis impossible for you to guess if you could I should blush not as a relation not as a man nor even as a woman but I should blush as an author inasmuch as I set no small store by myself upon this very account that my reader has never yet been able to guess at any thing And in this Sir I am of so nice and singular a humour that if I thought you was able to form the least judgment or probable conjecture to yourself of what was to come in the next page I would tear it out of my book Chapter one XXVI I have begun a new book on purpose that I might have room enough to explain the nature of the perplexities in which my uncle Toby was involved from the many discourses and interrogations about the siege of Namur where he received his wound I must remind the reader in case he has read the history of King William s wars but if he has not I then inform him that one of the most memorable attacks in that siege was that which was made by the English and Dutch upon the point of the advanced counterscarp between the gate of saint Nicolas which inclosed the great sluice or water stop where the English were terribly exposed to the shot of the counter guard and demi bastion of saint Roch The issue of which hot dispute in three words was this That the Dutch lodged themselves upon the counter guard and that the English made themselves masters of the covered way before saint Nicolas gate notwithstanding the gallantry of the French officers who exposed themselves upon the glacis sword in hand As this was the principal attack of which my uncle Toby was an eye witness at Namur the army of the besiegers being cut off by the confluence of the Maes and Sambre from seeing much of each other s operations my uncle Toby was generally more eloquent and particular in his account of it and the many perplexities he was in arose out of the almost insurmountable difficulties he found in telling his story intelligibly and giving such clear ideas of the differences and distinctions between the scarp and counterscarp the glacis and covered way the half moon and ravelin as to make his company fully comprehend where and what he was about Writers themselves are too apt to confound these terms so that you will the less wonder if in his endeavours to explain them and in opposition to many misconceptions that my uncle Toby did oft times puzzle his visitors and sometimes himself too To speak the truth unless the company my father led up stairs were tolerably clear headed or my uncle Toby was in one of his explanatory moods twas a difficult thing do what he could to keep the discourse free from obscurity What rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to my uncle Toby was this that in the attack of the counterscarp before the gate of saint Nicolas extending itself from the bank of the Maes quite up to the great water stop the ground was cut and cross cut with such a multitude of dykes drains rivulets and sluices on all sides and he would get so sadly bewildered and set fast amongst them that frequently he could neither get backwards or forwards to save his life and was oft times obliged to give up the attack upon that very account only These perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle Toby Shandy more perturbations than you would imagine and as my father s kindness to him was continually dragging up fresh friends and fresh enquirers he had but a very uneasy task of it No doubt my uncle Toby had great command of himself and could guard appearances I believe as well as most men yet any one may imagine that when he could not retreat out of the ravelin without getting into the half moon or get out of the covered way without falling down the counterscarp nor cross the dyke without danger of slipping into the ditch but that he must have fretted and fumed inwardly He did so and the little and hourly vexations which may seem trifling and of no account to the man who has not read Hippocrates yet whoever has read Hippocrates or doctor James Mackenzie and has considered well the effects which the passions and affections of the mind have upon the digestion Why not of a wound as well as of a dinner may easily conceive what sharp paroxysms and exacerbations of his wound my uncle Toby must have undergone upon that score only My uncle Toby could not philosophize upon it twas enough he felt it was so and having sustained the pain and sorrows of it for three months together he was resolved some way or other to extricate himself He was one morning lying upon his back in his bed the anguish and nature of the wound upon his groin suffering him to lie in no other position when a thought came into his head that if he could purchase such a thing and have it pasted down upon a board as a large map of the fortification of the town and citadel of Namur with its environs it might be a means of giving him ease I take notice of his desire to have the environs along with the town and citadel for this reason because my uncle Toby s wound was got in one of the traverses about thirty toises from the returning angle of the trench opposite to the salient angle of the demi bastion of saint Roch so that he was pretty confident he could stick a pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing on when the stone struck him All this succeeded to his wishes and not only freed him from a world of sad explanations but in the end it proved the happy means as you will read of procuring my uncle Toby his Hobby Horse Chapter one XXVII There is nothing so foolish when you are at the expence of making an entertainment of this kind as to order things so badly as to let your criticks and gentry of refined taste run it down Nor is there any thing so likely to make them do it as that of leaving them out of the party or what is full as offensive of bestowing your attention upon the rest of your guests in so particular a way as if there was no such thing as a critick by occupation at table I guard against both for in the first place I have left half a dozen places purposely open for them and in the next place I pay them all court Gentlemen I kiss your hands I protest no company could give me half the pleasure by my soul I am glad to see you I beg only you will make no strangers of yourselves but sit down without any ceremony and fall on heartily I said I had left six places and I was upon the point of carrying my complaisance so far as to have left a seventh open for them and in this very spot I stand on but being told by a Critick tho not by occupation but by nature that I had acquitted myself well enough I shall fill it up directly hoping in the mean time that I shall be able to make a great deal of more room next year How in the name of wonder could your uncle Toby who it seems was a military man and whom you have represented as no fool be at the same time such a confused pudding headed muddle headed fellow as Go look So Sir Critick I could have replied but I scorn it Tis language unurbane and only befitting the man who cannot give clear and satisfactory accounts of things or dive deep enough into the first causes of human ignorance and confusion It is moreover the reply valiant and therefore I reject it for tho it might have suited my uncle Toby s character as a soldier excellently well and had he not accustomed himself in such attacks to whistle the Lillabullero as he wanted no courage tis the very answer he would have given yet it would by no means have done for me You see as plain as can be that I write as a man of erudition that even my similies my allusions my illustrations my metaphors are erudite and that I must sustain my character properly and contrast it properly too else what would become of me Why Sir I should be undone at this very moment that I am going here to fill up one place against a critick I should have made an opening for a couple Therefore I answer thus Pray Sir in all the reading which you have ever read did you ever read such a book as Locke s Essay upon the Human Understanding Don t answer me rashly because many I know quote the book who have not read it and many have read it who understand it not If either of these is your case as I write to instruct I will tell you in three words what the book is It is a history A history of who what where when Don t hurry yourself It is a history book Sir which may possibly recommend it to the world of what passes in a man s own mind and if you will say so much of the book and no more believe me you will cut no contemptible figure in a metaphysick circle But this by the way Now if you will venture to go along with me and look down into the bottom of this matter it will be found that the cause of obscurity and confusion in the mind of a man is threefold Dull organs dear Sir in the first place Secondly slight and transient impressions made by the objects when the said organs are not dull And thirdly a memory like unto a sieve not able to retain what it has received Call down Dolly your chamber maid and I will give you my cap and bell along with it if I make not this matter so plain that Dolly herself should understand it as well as Malbranch When Dolly has indited her epistle to Robin and has thrust her arm into the bottom of her pocket hanging by her right side take that opportunity to recollect that the organs and faculties of perception can by nothing in this world be so aptly typified and explained as by that one thing which Dolly s hand is in search of Your organs are not so dull that I should inform you tis an inch Sir of red seal wax When this is melted and dropped upon the letter if Dolly fumbles too long for her thimble till the wax is over hardened it will not receive the mark of her thimble from the usual impulse which was wont to imprint it Very well If Dolly s wax for want of better is bees wax or of a temper too soft tho it may receive it will not hold the impression how hard soever Dolly thrusts against it and last of all supposing the wax good and eke the thimble but applied thereto in careless haste as her Mistress rings the bell in any one of these three cases the print left by the thimble will be as unlike the prototype as a brass jack Now you must understand that not one of these was the true cause of the confusion in my uncle Toby s discourse and it is for that very reason I enlarge upon them so long after the manner of great physiologists to shew the world what it did not arise from What it did arise from I have hinted above and a fertile source of obscurity it is and ever will be and that is the unsteady uses of words which have perplexed the clearest and most exalted understandings It is ten to one at Arthur s whether you have ever read the literary histories of past ages if you have what terrible battles yclept logomachies have they occasioned and perpetuated with so much gall and ink shed that a good natured man cannot read the accounts of them without tears in his eyes Gentle critick when thou hast weighed all this and considered within thyself how much of thy own knowledge discourse and conversation has been pestered and disordered at one time or other by this and this only What a pudder and racket in Councils about Greek and in the Schools of the learned about power and about spirit about essences and about quintessences about substances and about space What confusion in greater Theatres from words of little meaning and as indeterminate a sense when thou considerest this thou wilt not wonder at my uncle Toby s perplexities thou wilt drop a tear of pity upon his scarp and his counterscarp his glacis and his covered way his ravelin and his half moon Twas not by ideas by Heaven his life was put in jeopardy by words Chapter one XXVIII When my uncle Toby got his map of Namur to his mind he began immediately to apply himself and with the utmost diligence to the study of it for nothing being of more importance to him than his recovery and his recovery depending as you have read upon the passions and affections of his mind it behoved him to take the nicest care to make himself so far master of his subject as to be able to talk upon it without emotion In a fortnight s close and painful application which by the bye did my uncle Toby s wound upon his groin no good he was enabled by the help of some marginal documents at the feet of the elephant together with Gobesius s military architecture and pyroballogy translated from the Flemish to form his discourse with passable perspicuity and before he was two full months gone he was right eloquent upon it and could make not only the attack of the advanced counterscarp with great order but having by that time gone much deeper into the art than what his first motive made necessary my uncle Toby was able to cross the Maes and Sambre make diversions as far as Vauban s line the abbey of Salsines c and give his visitors as distinct a history of each of their attacks as of that of the gate of saint Nicolas where he had the honour to receive his wound But desire of knowledge like the thirst of riches increases ever with the acquisition of it The more my uncle Toby pored over his map the more he took a liking to it by the same process and electrical assimilation as I told you through which I ween the souls of connoisseurs themselves by long friction and incumbition have the happiness at length to get all be virtu d be pictured be butterflied and be fiddled The more my uncle Toby drank of this sweet fountain of science the greater was the heat and impatience of his thirst so that before the first year of his confinement had well gone round there was scarce a fortified town in Italy or Flanders of which by one means or other he had not procured a plan reading over as he got them and carefully collating therewith the histories of their sieges their demolitions their improvements and new works all which he would read with that intense application and delight that he would forget himself his wound his confinement his dinner In the second year my uncle Toby purchased Ramelli and Cataneo translated from the Italian likewise Stevinus Moralis the Chevalier de Ville Lorini Cochorn Sheeter the Count de Pagan the Marshal Vauban Mons Blondel with almost as many more books of military architecture as Don Quixote was found to have of chivalry when the curate and barber invaded his library Towards the beginning of the third year which was in August ninety nine my uncle Toby found it necessary to understand a little of projectiles and having judged it best to draw his knowledge from the fountain head he began with N Tartaglia who it seems was the first man who detected the imposition of a cannon ball s doing all that mischief under the notion of a right line This N Tartaglia proved to my uncle Toby to be an impossible thing Endless is the search of Truth No sooner was my uncle Toby satisfied which road the cannon ball did not go but he was insensibly led on and resolved in his mind to enquire and find out which road the ball did go For which purpose he was obliged to set off afresh with old Maltus and studied him devoutly He proceeded next to Galileo and Torricellius wherein by certain Geometrical rules infallibly laid down he found the precise path to be a Parabola or else an Hyperbola and that the parameter or latus rectum of the conic section of the said path was to the quantity and amplitude in a direct ratio as the whole line to the sine of double the angle of incidence formed by the breech upon an horizontal plane and that the semiparameter stop my dear uncle Toby stop go not one foot farther into this thorny and bewildered track intricate are the steps intricate are the mazes of this labyrinth intricate are the troubles which the pursuit of this bewitching phantom Knowledge will bring upon thee O my uncle fly fly fly from it as from a serpent Is it fit goodnatured man thou should saint sit up with the wound upon thy groin whole nights baking thy blood with hectic watchings Alas twill exasperate thy symptoms check thy perspirations evaporate thy spirits waste thy animal strength dry up thy radical moisture bring thee into a costive habit of body impair thy health and hasten all the infirmities of thy old age O my uncle my uncle Toby Chapter one XXIX I would not give a groat for that man s knowledge in pen craft who does not understand this That the best plain narrative in the world tacked very close to the last spirited apostrophe to my uncle Toby would have felt both cold and vapid upon the reader s palate therefore I forthwith put an end to the chapter though I was in the middle of my story Writers of my stamp have one principle in common with painters Where an exact copying makes our pictures less striking we choose the less evil deeming it even more pardonable to trespass against truth than beauty This is to be understood cum grano salis but be it as it will as the parallel is made more for the sake of letting the apostrophe cool than any thing else tis not very material whether upon any other score the reader approves of it or not In the latter end of the third year my uncle Toby perceiving that the parameter and semi parameter of the conic section angered his wound he left off the study of projectiles in a kind of a huff and betook himself to the practical part of fortification only the pleasure of which like a spring held back returned upon him with redoubled force It was in this year that my uncle began to break in upon the daily regularity of a clean shirt to dismiss his barber unshaven and to allow his surgeon scarce time sufficient to dress his wound concerning himself so little about it as not to ask him once in seven times dressing how it went on when lo all of a sudden for the change was quick as lightning he began to sigh heavily for his recovery complained to my father grew impatient with the surgeon and one morning as he heard his foot coming up stairs he shut up his books and thrust aside his instruments in order to expostulate with him upon the protraction of the cure which he told him might surely have been accomplished at least by that time He dwelt long upon the miseries he had undergone and the sorrows of his four years melancholy imprisonment adding that had it not been for the kind looks and fraternal chearings of the best of brothers he had long since sunk under his misfortunes My father was by My uncle Toby s eloquence brought tears into his eyes twas unexpected My uncle Toby by nature was not eloquent it had the greater effect The surgeon was confounded not that there wanted grounds for such or greater marks of impatience but twas unexpected too in the four years he had attended him he had never seen any thing like it in my uncle Toby s carriage he had never once dropped one fretful or discontented word he had been all patience all submission We lose the right of complaining sometimes by forbearing it but we often treble the force The surgeon was astonished but much more so when he heard my uncle Toby go on and peremptorily insist upon his healing up the wound directly or sending for Monsieur Ronjat the king s serjeant surgeon to do it for him The desire of life and health is implanted in man s nature the love of liberty and enlargement is a sister passion to it These my uncle Toby had in common with his species and either of them had been sufficient to account for his earnest desire to get well and out of doors but I have told you before that nothing wrought with our family after the common way and from the time and manner in which this eager desire shewed itself in the present case the penetrating reader will suspect there was some other cause or crotchet for it in my uncle Toby s head There was so and tis the subject of the next chapter to set forth what that cause and crotchet was I own when that s done twill be time to return back to the parlour fire side where we left my uncle Toby in the middle of his sentence Chapter one XXX When a man gives himself up to the government of a ruling passion or in other words when his Hobby Horse grows headstrong farewell cool reason and fair discretion My uncle Toby s wound was near well and as soon as the surgeon recovered his surprize and could get leave to say as much he told him twas just beginning to incarnate and that if no fresh exfoliation happened which there was no sign of it would be dried up in five or six weeks The sound of as many Olympiads twelve hours before would have conveyed an idea of shorter duration to my uncle Toby s mind The succession of his ideas was now rapid he broiled with impatience to put his design in execution and so without consulting farther with any soul living which by the bye I think is right when you are predetermined to take no one soul s advice he privately ordered Trim his man to pack up a bundle of lint and dressings and hire a chariot and four to be at the door exactly by twelve o clock that day when he knew my father would be upon Change So leaving a bank note upon the table for the surgeon s care of him and a letter of tender thanks for his brother s he packed up his maps his books of fortification his instruments c and by the help of a crutch on one side and Trim on the other my uncle Toby embarked for Shandy Hall The reason or rather the rise of this sudden demigration was as follows The table in my uncle Toby s room and at which the night before this change happened he was sitting with his maps c about him being somewhat of the smallest for that infinity of great and small instruments of knowledge which usually lay crowded upon it he had the accident in reaching over for his tobacco box to throw down his compasses and in stooping to take the compasses up with his sleeve he threw down his case of instruments and snuffers and as the dice took a run against him in his endeavouring to catch the snuffers in falling he thrust Monsieur Blondel off the table and Count de Pagon o top of him Twas to no purpose for a man lame as my uncle Toby was to think of redressing these evils by himself he rung his bell for his man Trim Trim quoth my uncle Toby prithee see what confusion I have here been making I must have some better contrivance Trim Can saint not thou take my rule and measure the length and breadth of this table and then go and bespeak me one as big again Yes an please your Honour replied Trim making a bow but I hope your Honour will be soon well enough to get down to your country seat where as your Honour takes so much pleasure in fortification we could manage this matter to a T I must here inform you that this servant of my uncle Toby s who went by the name of Trim had been a corporal in my uncle s own company his real name was James Butler but having got the nick name of Trim in the regiment my uncle Toby unless when he happened to be very angry with him would never call him by any other name The poor fellow had been disabled for the service by a wound on his left knee by a musket bullet at the battle of Landen which was two years before the affair of Namur and as the fellow was well beloved in the regiment and a handy fellow into the bargain my uncle Toby took him for his servant and of an excellent use was he attending my uncle Toby in the camp and in his quarters as a valet groom barber cook sempster and nurse and indeed from first to last waited upon him and served him with great fidelity and affection My uncle Toby loved the man in return and what attached him more to him still was the similitude of their knowledge For Corporal Trim for so for the future I shall call him by four years occasional attention to his Master s discourse upon fortified towns and the advantage of prying and peeping continually into his Master s plans c exclusive and besides what he gained Hobby Horsically as a body servant Non Hobby Horsical per se had become no mean proficient in the science and was thought by the cook and chamber maid to know as much of the nature of strong holds as my uncle Toby himself I have but one more stroke to give to finish Corporal Trim s character and it is the only dark line in it The fellow loved to advise or rather to hear himself talk his carriage however was so perfectly respectful twas easy to keep him silent when you had him so but set his tongue a going you had no hold of him he was voluble the eternal interlardings of your Honour with the respectfulness of Corporal Trim s manner interceding so strong in behalf of his elocution that though you might have been incommoded you could not well be angry My uncle Toby was seldom either the one or the other with him or at least this fault in Trim broke no squares with them My uncle Toby as I said loved the man and besides as he ever looked upon a faithful servant but as an humble friend he could not bear to stop his mouth Such was Corporal Trim If I durst presume continued Trim to give your Honour my advice and speak my opinion in this matter Thou art welcome Trim quoth my uncle Toby speak speak what thou thinkest upon the subject man without fear Why then replied Trim not hanging his ears and scratching his head like a country lout but stroking his hair back from his forehead and standing erect as before his division I think quoth Trim advancing his left which was his lame leg a little forwards and pointing with his right hand open towards a map of Dunkirk which was pinned against the hangings I think quoth Corporal Trim with humble submission to your Honour s better judgment that these ravelins bastions curtins and hornworks make but a poor contemptible fiddle faddle piece of work of it here upon paper compared to what your Honour and I could make of it were we in the country by ourselves and had but a rood or a rood and a half of ground to do what we pleased with As summer is coming on continued Trim your Honour might sit out of doors and give me the nography Call it ichnography quoth my uncle of the town or citadel your Honour was pleased to sit down before and I will be shot by your Honour upon the glacis of it if I did not fortify it to your Honour s mind I dare say thou would saint Trim quoth my uncle For if your Honour continued the Corporal could but mark me the polygon with its exact lines and angles That I could do very well quoth my uncle I would begin with the fosse and if your Honour could tell me the proper depth and breadth I can to a hair s breadth Trim replied my uncle I would throw out the earth upon this hand towards the town for the scarp and on that hand towards the campaign for the counterscarp Very right Trim quoth my uncle Toby And when I had sloped them to your mind an please your Honour I would face the glacis as the finest fortifications are done in Flanders with sods and as your Honour knows they should be and I would make the walls and parapets with sods too The best engineers call them gazons Trim said my uncle Toby Whether they are gazons or sods is not much matter replied Trim your Honour knows they are ten times beyond a facing either of brick or stone I know they are Trim in some respects quoth my uncle Toby nodding his head for a cannon ball enters into the gazon right onwards without bringing any rubbish down with it which might fill the fosse as was the case at saint Nicolas s gate and facilitate the passage over it Your Honour understands these matters replied Corporal Trim better than any officer in his Majesty s service but would your Honour please to let the bespeaking of the table alone and let us but go into the country I would work under your Honour s directions like a horse and make fortifications for you something like a tansy with all their batteries saps ditches and palisadoes that it should be worth all the world s riding twenty miles to go and see it My uncle Toby blushed as red as scarlet as Trim went on but it was not a blush of guilt of modesty or of anger it was a blush of joy he was fired with Corporal Trim s project and description Trim said my uncle Toby thou hast said enough We might begin the campaign continued Trim on the very day that his Majesty and the Allies take the field and demolish them town by town as fast as Trim quoth my uncle Toby say no more Your Honour continued Trim might sit in your arm chair pointing to it this fine weather giving me your orders and I would Say no more Trim quoth my uncle Toby Besides your Honour would get not only pleasure and good pastime but good air and good exercise and good health and your Honour s wound would be well in a month Thou hast said enough Trim quoth my uncle Toby putting his hand into his breeches pocket I like thy project mightily And if your Honour pleases I ll this moment go and buy a pioneer s spade to take down with us and I ll bespeak a shovel and a pick axe and a couple of Say no more Trim quoth my uncle Toby leaping up upon one leg quite overcome with rapture and thrusting a guinea into Trim s hand Trim said my uncle Toby say no more but go down Trim this moment my lad and bring up my supper this instant Trim ran down and brought up his master s supper to no purpose Trim s plan of operation ran so in my uncle Toby s head he could not taste it Trim quoth my uncle Toby get me to bed Twas all one Corporal Trim s description had fired his imagination my uncle Toby could not shut his eyes The more he considered it the more bewitching the scene appeared to him so that two full hours before day light he had come to a final determination and had concerted the whole plan of his and Corporal Trim s decampment My uncle Toby had a little neat country house of his own in the village where my father s estate lay at Shandy which had been left him by an old uncle with a small estate of about one hundred pounds a year Behind this house and contiguous to it was a kitchen garden of about half an acre and at the bottom of the garden and cut off from it by a tall yew hedge was a bowling green containing just about as much ground as Corporal Trim wished for so that as Trim uttered the words A rood and a half of ground to do what they would with this identical bowling green instantly presented itself and became curiously painted all at once upon the retina of my uncle Toby s fancy which was the physical cause of making him change colour or at least of heightening his blush to that immoderate degree I spoke of Never did lover post down to a beloved mistress with more heat and expectation than my uncle Toby did to enjoy this self same thing in private I say in private for it was sheltered from the house as I told you by a tall yew hedge and was covered on the other three sides from mortal sight by rough holly and thick set flowering shrubs so that the idea of not being seen did not a little contribute to the idea of pleasure pre conceived in my uncle Toby s mind Vain thought however thick it was planted about or private soever it might seem to think dear uncle Toby of enjoying a thing which took up a whole rood and a half of ground and not have it known How my uncle Toby and Corporal Trim managed this matter with the history of their campaigns which were no way barren of events may make no uninteresting under plot in the epitasis and working up of this drama At present the scene must drop and change for the parlour fire side Chapter one XXXI What can they be doing brother said my father I think replied my uncle Toby taking as I told you his pipe from his mouth and striking the ashes out of it as he began his sentence I think replied he it would not be amiss brother if we rung the bell Pray what s all that racket over our heads Obadiah quoth my father my brother and I can scarce hear ourselves speak Sir answered Obadiah making a bow towards his left shoulder my Mistress is taken very badly And where s Susannah running down the garden there as if they were going to ravish her Sir she is running the shortest cut into the town replied Obadiah to fetch the old midwife Then saddle a horse quoth my father and do you go directly for doctor Slop the man midwife with all our services and let him know your mistress is fallen into labour and that I desire he will return with you with all speed It is very strange says my father addressing himself to my uncle Toby as Obadiah shut the door as there is so expert an operator as doctor Slop so near that my wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate humour of hers in trusting the life of my child who has had one misfortune already to the ignorance of an old woman and not only the life of my child brother but her own life and with it the lives of all the children I might peradventure have begot out of her hereafter Mayhap brother replied my uncle Toby my sister does it to save the expence A pudding s end replied my father the Doctor must be paid the same for inaction as action if not better to keep him in temper Then it can be out of nothing in the whole world quoth my uncle Toby in the simplicity of his heart but Modesty My sister I dare say added he does not care to let a man come so near her I will not say whether my uncle Toby had completed the sentence or not tis for his advantage to suppose he had as I think he could have added no One Word which would have improved it If on the contrary my uncle Toby had not fully arrived at the period s end then the world stands indebted to the sudden snapping of my father s tobacco pipe for one of the neatest examples of that ornamental figure in oratory which Rhetoricians stile the Aposiopesis Just Heaven how does the Poco piu and the Poco meno of the Italian artists the insensible more or less determine the precise line of beauty in the sentence as well as in the statue How do the slight touches of the chisel the pencil the pen the fiddle stick et caetera give the true swell which gives the true pleasure O my countrymen be nice be cautious of your language and never O never let it be forgotten upon what small particles your eloquence and your fame depend My sister mayhap quoth my uncle Toby does not choose to let a man come so near her Make this dash tis an Aposiopesis Take the dash away and write Backside tis Bawdy Scratch Backside out and put Cover d way in tis a Metaphor and I dare say as fortification ran so much in my uncle Toby s head that if he had been left to have added one word to the sentence that word was it But whether that was the case or not the case or whether the snapping of my father s tobacco pipe so critically happened through accident or anger will be seen in due time Chapter one XXXII Tho my father was a good natural philosopher yet he was something of a moral philosopher too for which reason when his tobacco pipe snapp d short in the middle he had nothing to do as such but to have taken hold of the two pieces and thrown them gently upon the back of the fire He did no such thing he threw them with all the violence in the world and to give the action still more emphasis he started upon both his legs to do it This looked something like heat and the manner of his reply to what my uncle Toby was saying proved it was so Not choose quoth my father repeating my uncle Toby s words to let a man come so near her By Heaven brother Toby you would try the patience of Job and I think I have the plagues of one already without it Why Where Wherein Wherefore Upon what account replied my uncle Toby in the utmost astonishment To think said my father of a man living to your age brother and knowing so little about women I know nothing at all about them replied my uncle Toby And I think continued he that the shock I received the year after the demolition of Dunkirk in my affair with widow Wadman which shock you know I should not have received but from my total ignorance of the sex has given me just cause to say That I neither know nor do pretend to know any thing about em or their concerns either Methinks brother replied my father you might at least know so much as the right end of a woman from the wrong It is said in Aristotle s Master Piece That when a man doth think of any thing which is past he looketh down upon the ground but that when he thinketh of something that is to come he looketh up towards the heavens My uncle Toby I suppose thought of neither for he look d horizontally Right end quoth my uncle Toby muttering the two words low to himself and fixing his two eyes insensibly as he muttered them upon a small crevice formed by a bad joint in the chimney piece Right end of a woman I declare quoth my uncle I know no more which it is than the man in the moon and if I was to think continued my uncle Toby keeping his eyes still fixed upon the bad joint this month together I am sure I should not be able to find it out Then brother Toby replied my father I will tell you Every thing in this world continued my father filling a fresh pipe every thing in this world 
3699_19401_000024_000000	train-clean-100	my dear brother Toby 
none	none	has two handles Not always quoth my uncle Toby At least replied my father every one has two hands which comes to the same thing Now if a man was to sit down coolly and consider within himself the make the shape the construction come at ability and convenience of all the parts which constitute the whole of that animal called Woman and compare them analogically I never understood rightly the meaning of that word quoth my uncle Toby Analogy replied my father is the certain relation and agreement which different Here a devil of a rap at the door snapped my father s definition like his tobacco pipe in two and at the same time crushed the head of as notable and curious a dissertation as ever was engendered in the womb of speculation it was some months before my father could get an opportunity to be safely delivered of it And at this hour it is a thing full as problematical as the subject of the dissertation itself considering the confusion and distresses of our domestick misadventures which are now coming thick one upon the back of another whether I shall be able to find a place for it in the third volume or not Chapter one XXXIII It is about an hour and a half s tolerable good reading since my uncle Toby rung the bell when Obadiah was ordered to saddle a horse and go for doctor Slop the man midwife so that no one can say with reason that I have not allowed Obadiah time enough poetically speaking and considering the emergency too both to go and come though morally and truly speaking the man perhaps has scarce had time to get on his boots If the hypercritick will go upon this and is resolved after all to take a pendulum and measure the true distance betwixt the ringing of the bell and the rap at the door and after finding it to be no more than two minutes thirteen seconds and three fifths should take upon him to insult over me for such a breach in the unity or rather probability of time I would remind him that the idea of duration and of its simple modes is got merely from the train and succession of our ideas and is the true scholastic pendulum and by which as a scholar I will be tried in this matter abjuring and detesting the jurisdiction of all other pendulums whatever I would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor eight miles from Shandy Hall to doctor Slop the man midwife s house and that whilst Obadiah has been going those said miles and back I have brought my uncle Toby from Namur quite across all Flanders into England That I have had him ill upon my hands near four years and have since travelled him and Corporal Trim in a chariot and four a journey of near two hundred miles down into Yorkshire all which put together must have prepared the reader s imagination for the entrance of doctor Slop upon the stage as much at least I hope as a dance a song or a concerto between the acts If my hypercritick is intractable alledging that two minutes and thirteen seconds are no more than two minutes and thirteen seconds when I have said all I can about them and that this plea though it might save me dramatically will damn me biographically rendering my book from this very moment a professed Romance which before was a book apocryphal If I am thus pressed I then put an end to the whole objection and controversy about it all at once by acquainting him that Obadiah had not got above threescore yards from the stable yard before he met with doctor Slop and indeed he gave a dirty proof that he had met with him and was within an ace of giving a tragical one too Imagine to yourself but this had better begin a new chapter Chapter one XXXIV Imagine to yourself a little squat uncourtly figure of a Doctor Slop of about four feet and a half perpendicular height with a breadth of back and a sesquipedality of belly which might have done honour to a serjeant in the horse guards Such were the out lines of doctor Slop s figure which if you have read Hogarth s analysis of beauty and if you have not I wish you would you must know may as certainly be caricatured and conveyed to the mind by three strokes as three hundred Imagine such a one for such I say were the outlines of doctor Slop s figure coming slowly along foot by foot waddling thro the dirt upon the vertebrae of a little diminutive pony of a pretty colour but of strength alack scarce able to have made an amble of it under such a fardel had the roads been in an ambling condition They were not Imagine to yourself Obadiah mounted upon a strong monster of a coach horse pricked into a full gallop and making all practicable speed the adverse way Pray Sir let me interest you a moment in this description Had doctor Slop beheld Obadiah a mile off posting in a narrow lane directly towards him at that monstrous rate splashing and plunging like a devil thro thick and thin as he approached would not such a phaenomenon with such a vortex of mud and water moving along with it round its axis have been a subject of juster apprehension to doctor Slop in his situation than the worst of Whiston s comets To say nothing of the Nucleus that is of Obadiah and the coach horse In my idea the vortex alone of em was enough to have involved and carried if not the doctor at least the doctor s pony quite away with it What then do you think must the terror and hydrophobia of doctor Slop have been when you read which you are just going to do that he was advancing thus warily along towards Shandy Hall and had approached to within sixty yards of it and within five yards of a sudden turn made by an acute angle of the garden wall and in the dirtiest part of a dirty lane when Obadiah and his coach horse turned the corner rapid furious pop full upon him Nothing I think in nature can be supposed more terrible than such a rencounter so imprompt so ill prepared to stand the shock of it as doctor Slop was What could doctor Slop do he crossed himself Pugh but the doctor Sir was a Papist No matter he had better have kept hold of the pummel He had so nay as it happened he had better have done nothing at all for in crossing himself he let go his whip and in attempting to save his whip betwixt his knee and his saddle s skirt as it slipped he lost his stirrup in losing which he lost his seat and in the multitude of all these losses which by the bye shews what little advantage there is in crossing the unfortunate doctor lost his presence of mind So that without waiting for Obadiah s onset he left his pony to its destiny tumbling off it diagonally something in the stile and manner of a pack of wool and without any other consequence from the fall save that of being left as it would have been with the broadest part of him sunk about twelve inches deep in the mire Obadiah pull d off his cap twice to doctor Slop once as he was falling and then again when he saw him seated Ill timed complaisance had not the fellow better have stopped his horse and got off and help d him Sir he did all that his situation would allow but the Momentum of the coach horse was so great that Obadiah could not do it all at once he rode in a circle three times round doctor Slop before he could fully accomplish it any how and at the last when he did stop his beast twas done with such an explosion of mud that Obadiah had better have been a league off In short never was a doctor Slop so beluted and so transubstantiated since that affair came into fashion Chapter one XXXV When doctor Slop entered the back parlour where my father and my uncle Toby were discoursing upon the nature of women it was hard to determine whether doctor Slop s figure or doctor Slop s presence occasioned more surprize to them for as the accident happened so near the house as not to make it worth while for Obadiah to remount him Obadiah had led him in as he was unwiped unappointed unannealed with all his stains and blotches on him He stood like Hamlet s ghost motionless and speechless for a full minute and a half at the parlour door Obadiah still holding his hand with all the majesty of mud His hinder parts upon which he had received his fall totally besmeared and in every other part of him blotched over in such a manner with Obadiah s explosion that you would have sworn without mental reservation that every grain of it had taken effect Here was a fair opportunity for my uncle Toby to have triumphed over my father in his turn for no mortal who had beheld doctor Slop in that pickle could have dissented from so much at least of my uncle Toby s opinion That mayhap his sister might not care to let such a doctor Slop come so near her But it was the Argumentum ad hominem and if my uncle Toby was not very expert at it you may think he might not care to use it No the reason was twas not his nature to insult doctor Slop s presence at that time was no less problematical than the mode of it tho it is certain one moment s reflexion in my father might have solved it for he had apprized doctor Slop but the week before that my mother was at her full reckoning and as the doctor had heard nothing since twas natural and very political too in him to have taken a ride to Shandy Hall as he did merely to see how matters went on But my father s mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in the investigation running like the hypercritick s altogether upon the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door measuring their distance and keeping his mind so intent upon the operation as to have power to think of nothing else common place infirmity of the greatest mathematicians working with might and main at the demonstration and so wasting all their strength upon it that they have none left in them to draw the corollary to do good with The ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door struck likewise strong upon the sensorium of my uncle Toby but it excited a very different train of thoughts the two irreconcileable pulsations instantly brought Stevinus the great engineer along with them into my uncle Toby s mind What business Stevinus had in this affair is the greatest problem of all It shall be solved but not in the next chapter Chapter one XXXVI Writing when properly managed as you may be sure I think mine is is but a different name for conversation As no one who knows what he is about in good company would venture to talk all so no author who understands the just boundaries of decorum and good breeding would presume to think all The truest respect which you can pay to the reader s understanding is to halve this matter amicably and leave him something to imagine in his turn as well as yourself For my own part I am eternally paying him compliments of this kind and do all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as busy as my own Tis his turn now I have given an ample description of doctor Slop s sad overthrow and of his sad appearance in the back parlour his imagination must now go on with it for a while Let the reader imagine then that doctor Slop has told his tale and in what words and with what aggravations his fancy chooses Let him suppose that Obadiah has told his tale also and with such rueful looks of affected concern as he thinks best will contrast the two figures as they stand by each other Let him imagine that my father has stepped up stairs to see my mother And to conclude this work of imagination let him imagine the doctor washed rubbed down and condoled felicitated got into a pair of Obadiah s pumps stepping forwards towards the door upon the very point of entering upon action Truce truce good doctor Slop stay thy obstetrick hand return it safe into thy bosom to keep it warm little dost thou know what obstacles little dost thou think what hidden causes retard its operation Hast thou doctor Slop hast thou been entrusted with the secret articles of the solemn treaty which has brought thee into this place Art thou aware that at this instant a daughter of Lucina is put obstetrically over thy head Alas tis too true Besides great son of Pilumnus what canst thou do Thou hast come forth unarm d thou hast left thy tire tete thy new invented forceps thy crotchet thy squirt and all thy instruments of salvation and deliverance behind thee By Heaven at this moment they are hanging up in a green bays bag betwixt thy two pistols at the bed s head Ring call send Obadiah back upon the coach horse to bring them with all speed Make great haste Obadiah quoth my father and I ll give thee a crown and quoth my uncle Toby I ll give him another Chapter one XXXVII Your sudden and unexpected arrival quoth my uncle Toby addressing himself to doctor Slop all three of them sitting down to the fire together as my uncle Toby began to speak 
1085-169444-0000	train-other-500	instantly brought the great Stevinus into my head who you must know is a favourite author with me Then added my father making use of the argument Ad Crumenam I will lay twenty guineas to a single crown piece
1085-169444-0001	train-other-500	which will serve to give away to Obadiah when he gets back that this same Stevinus was some engineer or other or has wrote something or other either directly or indirectly upon the science of fortification
1085-169444-0002	train-other-500	He has so replied my uncle Toby I knew it said my father though for the soul of me I cannot see what kind of connection there can be betwixt doctor Slop s sudden coming and a discourse upon fortification yet I fear d it
1085-169444-0003	train-other-500	Talk of what we will brother or let the occasion be never so foreign or unfit for the subject you are sure to bring it in I would not brother Toby continued my father
none	none	 I declare I would not have my head so full of curtins and horn works That I dare say you would not quoth doctor Slop 
1085-169444-0004	train-other-500	interrupting him and laughing most immoderately at his pun
none	none	 Dennis the critic could not detest and abhor a pun 
1085-169444-0005	train-other-500	or the insinuation of a pun more cordially than my father he would grow testy upon it at any time but to be broke in upon by one in a serious discourse was as bad he would say as a fillip upon the nose
1085-169444-0006	train-other-500	he saw no difference Sir quoth my uncle Toby addressing himself to doctor Slop the curtins my brother Shandy mentions here have nothing to do with beadsteads
none	none	 tho I know Du Cange says 
1085-169444-0007	train-other-500	That bed curtains in all probability have taken their name from them nor have the horn works he speaks of any thing in the world to do with the horn works of cuckoldom But the Curtin Sir is the word we use in fortification
1085-169444-0008	train-other-500	for that part of the wall or rampart which lies between the two bastions and joins them Besiegers seldom offer to carry on their attacks directly against the curtin for this reason because they are so well flanked
1085-169444-0009	train-other-500	Tis the case of other curtains quoth doctor Slop laughing However continued my uncle Toby to make them sure we generally choose to place ravelins before them
none	none	 taking care only to extend them beyond the fosse or ditch 
1085-169444-0010	train-other-500	The common men who know very little of fortification confound the ravelin and the half moon together tho they are very different things not in their figure or construction for we make them exactly alike in all points
1085-169444-0011	train-other-500	for they always consist of two faces making a salient angle with the gorges not straight but in form of a crescent Where then lies the difference quoth my father a little testily
1085-169444-0012	train-other-500	In their situations answered my uncle Toby For when a ravelin brother stands before the curtin it is a ravelin and when a ravelin stands before a bastion then the ravelin is not a ravelin it is a half moon
1085-169444-0013	train-other-500	a half moon likewise is a half moon and no more so long as it stands before its bastion but was it to change place and get before the curtin
none	none	 twould be no longer a half moon 
1085-169444-0014	train-other-500	a half moon in that case is not a half moon
none	none	 tis no more than a ravelin 
1085-169444-0015	train-other-500	I think quoth my father that the noble science of defence has its weak sides as well as others As for the horn work high ho sigh d my father which continued my uncle Toby my brother was speaking of
1085-169444-0016	train-other-500	they are a very considerable part of an outwork they are called by the French engineers Ouvrage a corne and we generally make them to cover such places as we suspect to be weaker than the rest
none	none	 tis formed by two epaulments or demi bastions they are very pretty and if you will take a walk I ll engage to shew you one well worth your trouble 
1085-169444-0017	train-other-500	I own continued my uncle Toby when we crown them they are much stronger but then they are very expensive and take up a great deal of ground so that in my opinion they are most of use to cover or defend the head of a camp
none	none	 otherwise the double tenaille 
1085-169444-0018	train-other-500	By the mother who bore us brother Toby quoth my father
none	none	 not able to hold out any longer 
1085-169444-0019	train-other-500	you would provoke a saint here have you got us I know not how
none	none	 not only souse into the middle of the old subject again 
1085-169444-0020	train-other-500	But so full is your head of these confounded works that though my wife is this moment in the pains of labour and you hear her cry out yet nothing will serve you but to carry off the man midwife
1085-169444-0021	train-other-500	Accoucheur if you please quoth doctor Slop With all my heart replied my father I don t care what they call you but I wish the whole science of fortification with all its inventors at the devil it has been the death of thousands
1085-169444-0022	train-other-500	and it will be mine in the end I would not I would not brother Toby have my brains so full of saps mines blinds gabions pallisadoes ravelins half moons and such trumpery
none	none	 to be proprietor of Namur and of all the towns in Flanders with it 
1085-169444-0023	train-other-500	My uncle Toby was a man patient of injuries not from want of courage I have told you in a former chapter that he was a man of courage And will add here that where just occasions presented or called it forth
1085-169444-0024	train-other-500	I know no man under whose arm I would have sooner taken shelter nor did this arise from any insensibility or obtuseness of his intellectual parts for he felt this insult of my father s as feelingly as a man could do
1085-169444-0025	train-other-500	but he was of a peaceful placid nature no jarring element in it all was mixed up so kindly within him my uncle Toby had scarce a heart to retaliate upon a fly Go says he one day at dinner
1085-169444-0026	train-other-500	to an over grown one which had buzzed about his nose and tormented him cruelly all dinner time and which after infinite attempts he had caught at last as it flew by him I ll not hurt thee says my uncle Toby rising from his chair
1085-169444-0027	train-other-500	and going across the room with the fly in his hand I ll not hurt a hair of thy head Go says he lifting up the sash and opening his hand as he spoke to let it escape go poor devil get thee gone why should I hurt thee
1085-169444-0028	train-other-500	This world surely is wide enough to hold both thee and me I was but ten years old when this happened but whether it was that the action itself was more in unison to my nerves at that age of pity
1085-169444-0029	train-other-500	which instantly set my whole frame into one vibration of most pleasurable sensation or how far the manner and expression of it might go towards it or in what degree or by what secret magick a tone of voice and harmony of movement
1085-169444-0030	train-other-500	attuned by mercy might find a passage to my heart I know not this I know that the lesson of universal good will then taught and imprinted by my uncle Toby has never since been worn out of my mind
none	none	 And tho I would not depreciate what the study of the Literae humaniores at the university 
1085-169444-0031	train-other-500	have done for me in that respect or discredit the other helps of an expensive education bestowed upon me both at home and abroad since yet I often think that I owe one half of my philanthropy to that one accidental impression
1085-169444-0032	train-other-500	This is to serve for parents and governors instead of a whole volume upon the subject I could not give the reader this stroke in my uncle Toby s picture by the instrument with which I drew the other parts of it
1085-169444-0033	train-other-500	that taking in no more than the mere Hobby Horsical likeness this is a part of his moral character My father in this patient endurance of wrongs which I mention was very different as the reader must long ago have noted
1085-169444-0034	train-other-500	he had a much more acute and quick sensibility of nature attended with a little soreness of temper tho this never transported him to any thing which looked like malignancy
1085-169444-0035	train-other-500	yet in the little rubs and vexations of life twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty kind of peevishness He was however frank and generous in his nature at all times open to conviction
1085-169444-0036	train-other-500	and in the little ebullitions of this subacid humour towards others but particularly towards my uncle Toby whom he truly loved he would feel more pain ten times told
1085-169444-0037	train-other-500	except in the affair of my aunt Dinah or where an hypothesis was concerned than what he ever gave The characters of the two brothers in this view of them
1085-169444-0038	train-other-500	reflected light upon each other and appeared with great advantage in this affair which arose about Stevinus I need not tell the reader if he keeps a Hobby Horse that a man s Hobby Horse is as tender a part as he has about him
1085-169444-0039	train-other-500	and that these unprovoked strokes at my uncle Toby s could not be unfelt by him No as I said above my uncle Toby did feel them and very sensibly too
1085-169444-0040	train-other-500	Pray Sir what said he How did he behave O Sir it was great For as soon as my father had done insulting his Hobby Horse he turned his head without the least emotion from doctor Slop to whom he was addressing his discourse
1085-169444-0041	train-other-500	and looking up into my father s face with a countenance spread over with so much good nature so placid so fraternal so inexpressibly tender towards him it penetrated my father to his heart
1085-169444-0042	train-other-500	He rose up hastily from his chair and seizing hold of both my uncle Toby s hands as he spoke Brother Toby said he I beg thy pardon forgive I pray thee this rash humour which my mother gave me
none	none	 My dear dear brother answered my uncle Toby 
1085-169444-0043	train-other-500	rising up by my father s help say no more about it you are heartily welcome had it been ten times as much brother
none	none	 But tis ungenerous replied my father to hurt any man a brother worse but to hurt a brother of such gentle manners so unprovoking and so unresenting tis base 
1085-169444-0044	train-other-500	By Heaven tis cowardly You are heartily welcome brother quoth my uncle Toby had it been fifty times as much Besides what have I to do my dear Toby cried my father either with your amusements or your pleasures
1085-169444-0045	train-other-500	unless it was in my power which it is not to increase their measure Brother Shandy answered my uncle Toby looking wistfully in his face you are much mistaken in this point
none	none	 for you do increase my pleasure very much in begetting children for the Shandy family at your time of life But by that Sir quoth doctor Slop mister Shandy increases his own Not a jot quoth my father Chapter one XXXVIII My brother does it quoth my uncle Toby out of principle In a family way I suppose quoth doctor Slop Pshaw said my father tis not worth talking of Chapter one XXXIX At the end of the last chapter my father and my uncle Toby were left both standing like Brutus and Cassius at the close of the scene making up their accounts As my father spoke the three last words he sat down my uncle Toby exactly followed his example only that before he took his chair he rung the bell to order Corporal Trim who was in waiting to step home for Stevinus my uncle Toby s house being no farther off than the opposite side of the way Some men would have dropped the subject of Stevinus but my uncle Toby had no resentment in his heart and he went on with the subject to shew my father that he had none Your sudden appearance doctor Slop quoth my uncle resuming the discourse instantly brought Stevinus into my head My father you may be sure did not offer to lay any more wagers upon Stevinus s head Because continued my uncle Toby the celebrated sailing chariot which belonged to Prince Maurice and was of such wonderful contrivance and velocity as to carry half a dozen people thirty German miles in I don t know how few minutes was invented by Stevinus that great mathematician and engineer You might have spared your servant the trouble quoth doctor Slop as the fellow is lame of going for Stevinus s account of it because in my return from Leyden thro the Hague I walked as far as Schevling which is two long miles on purpose to take a view of it That s nothing replied my uncle Toby to what the learned Peireskius did who walked a matter of five hundred miles reckoning from Paris to Schevling and from Schevling to Paris back again in order to see it and nothing else Some men cannot bear to be out gone The more fool Peireskius replied doctor Slop But mark twas out of no contempt of Peireskius at all but that Peireskius s indefatigable labour in trudging so far on foot out of love for the sciences reduced the exploit of doctor Slop in that affair to nothing the more fool Peireskius said he again Why so replied my father taking his brother s part not only to make reparation as fast as he could for the insult he had given him which sat still upon my father s mind but partly that my father began really to interest himself in the discourse Why so said he Why is Peireskius or any man else to be abused for an appetite for that or any other morsel of sound knowledge For notwithstanding I know nothing of the chariot in question continued he the inventor of it must have had a very mechanical head and tho I cannot guess upon what principles of philosophy he has atchieved it yet certainly his machine has been constructed upon solid ones be they what they will or it could not have answered at the rate my brother mentions It answered replied my uncle Toby as well if not better for as Peireskius elegantly expresses it speaking of the velocity of its motion Tam citus erat quam erat ventus which unless I have forgot my Latin is that it was as swift as the wind itself But pray doctor Slop quoth my father interrupting my uncle tho not without begging pardon for it at the same time upon what principles was this self same chariot set a going Upon very pretty principles to be sure replied doctor Slop And I have often wondered continued he evading the question why none of our gentry who live upon large plains like this of ours especially they whose wives are not past child bearing attempt nothing of this kind for it would not only be infinitely expeditious upon sudden calls to which the sex is subject if the wind only served but would be excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds which cost nothing and which eat nothing rather than horses which the devil take em both cost and eat a great deal For that very reason replied my father Because they cost nothing and because they eat nothing the scheme is bad it is the consumption of our products as well as the manufactures of them which gives bread to the hungry circulates trade brings in money and supports the value of our lands and tho I own if I was a Prince I would generously recompense the scientifick head which brought forth such contrivances yet I would as peremptorily suppress the use of them My father here had got into his element and was going on as prosperously with his dissertation upon trade as my uncle Toby had before upon his of fortification but to the loss of much sound knowledge the destinies in the morning had decreed that no dissertation of any kind should be spun by my father that day for as he opened his mouth to begin the next sentence Chapter one XL In popped Corporal Trim with Stevinus But twas too late all the discourse had been exhausted without him and was running into a new channel You may take the book home again Trim said my uncle Toby nodding to him But prithee Corporal quoth my father drolling look first into it and see if thou canst spy aught of a sailing chariot in it Corporal Trim by being in the service had learned to obey and not to remonstrate so taking the book to a side table and running over the leaves An please your Honour said Trim I can see no such thing however continued the Corporal drolling a little in his turn I ll make sure work of it an please your Honour so taking hold of the two covers of the book one in each hand and letting the leaves fall down as he bent the covers back he gave the book a good sound shake There is something falling out however said Trim an please your Honour but it is not a chariot or any thing like one Prithee Corporal said my father smiling what is it then I think answered Trim stooping to take it up tis more like a sermon for it begins with a text of scripture and the chapter and verse and then goes on not as a chariot but like a sermon directly The company smiled I cannot conceive how it is possible quoth my uncle Toby for such a thing as a sermon to have got into my Stevinus I think tis a sermon replied Trim but if it please your Honours as it is a fair hand I will read you a page for Trim you must know loved to hear himself read almost as well as talk I have ever a strong propensity said my father to look into things which cross my way by such strange fatalities as these and as we have nothing better to do at least till Obadiah gets back I shall be obliged to you brother if doctor Slop has no objection to it to order the Corporal to give us a page or two of it if he is as able to do it as he seems willing An please your honour quoth Trim I officiated two whole campaigns in Flanders as clerk to the chaplain of the regiment He can read it quoth my uncle Toby as well as I can Trim I assure you was the best scholar in my company and should have had the next halberd but for the poor fellow s misfortune Corporal Trim laid his hand upon his heart and made an humble bow to his master then laying down his hat upon the floor and taking up the sermon in his left hand in order to have his right at liberty he advanced nothing doubting into the middle of the room where he could best see and be best seen by his audience Chapter one XLI If you have any objection said my father addressing himself to doctor Slop Not in the least replied doctor Slop for it does not appear on which side of the question it is wrote it may be a composition of a divine of our church as well as yours so that we run equal risques Tis wrote upon neither side quoth Trim for tis only upon Conscience an please your Honours Trim s reason put his audience into good humour all but doctor Slop who turning his head about towards Trim looked a little angry Begin Trim and read distinctly quoth my father I will an please your Honour replied the Corporal making a bow and bespeaking attention with a slight movement of his right hand Chapter one XLII But before the Corporal begins I must first give you a description of his attitude otherwise he will naturally stand represented by your imagination in an uneasy posture stiff perpendicular dividing the weight of his body equally upon both legs his eye fixed as if on duty his look determined clenching the sermon in his left hand like his firelock In a word you would be apt to paint Trim as if he was standing in his platoon ready for action His attitude was as unlike all this as you can conceive He stood before them with his body swayed and bent forwards just so far as to make an angle of eighty five degrees and a half upon the plain of the horizon which sound orators to whom I address this know very well to be the true persuasive angle of incidence in any other angle you may talk and preach tis certain and it is done every day but with what effect I leave the world to judge The necessity of this precise angle of eighty five degrees and a half to a mathematical exactness does it not shew us by the way how the arts and sciences mutually befriend each other How the duce Corporal Trim who knew not so much as an acute angle from an obtuse one came to hit it so exactly or whether it was chance or nature or good sense or imitation c shall be commented upon in that part of the cyclopaedia of arts and sciences where the instrumental parts of the eloquence of the senate the pulpit and the bar the coffee house the bed chamber and fire side fall under consideration He stood for I repeat it to take the picture of him in at one view with his body swayed and somewhat bent forwards his right leg from under him sustaining seven eighths of his whole weight the foot of his left leg the defect of which was no disadvantage to his attitude advanced a little not laterally nor forwards but in a line betwixt them his knee bent but that not violently but so as to fall within the limits of the line of beauty and I add of the line of science too for consider it had one eighth part of his body to bear up so that in this case the position of the leg is determined because the foot could be no farther advanced or the knee more bent than what would allow him mechanically to receive an eighth part of his whole weight under it and to carry it too This I recommend to painters need I add to orators I think not for unless they practise it they must fall upon their noses So much for Corporal Trim s body and legs He held the sermon loosely not carelessly in his left hand raised something above his stomach and detached a little from his breast his right arm falling negligently by his side as nature and the laws of gravity ordered it but with the palm of it open and turned towards his audience ready to aid the sentiment in case it stood in need Corporal Trim s eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony with the other parts of him he looked frank unconstrained something assured but not bordering upon assurance Let not the critic ask how Corporal Trim could come by all this I ve told him it should be explained but so he stood before my father my uncle Toby and doctor Slop so swayed his body so contrasted his limbs and with such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole figure a statuary might have modelled from it nay I doubt whether the oldest Fellow of a College or the Hebrew Professor himself could have much mended it Trim made a bow and read as follows The Sermon Hebrews xiii eighteen For we trust we have a good Conscience Trust Trust we have a good conscience Certainly Trim quoth my father interrupting him you give that sentence a very improper accent for you curl up your nose man and read it with such a sneering tone as if the Parson was going to abuse the Apostle He is an please your Honour replied Trim Pugh said my father smiling Sir quoth doctor Slop Trim is certainly in the right for the writer who I perceive is a Protestant by the snappish manner in which he takes up the apostle is certainly going to abuse him if this treatment of him has not done it already But from whence replied my father have you concluded so soon doctor Slop that the writer is of our church for aught I can see yet he may be of any church Because answered doctor Slop if he was of ours he durst no more take such a licence than a bear by his beard If in our communion Sir a man was to insult an apostle a saint or even the paring of a saint s nail he would have his eyes scratched out What by the saint quoth my uncle Toby No replied doctor Slop he would have an old house over his head Pray is the Inquisition an ancient building answered my uncle Toby or is it a modern one I know nothing of architecture replied doctor Slop An please your Honours quoth Trim the Inquisition is the vilest Prithee spare thy description Trim I hate the very name of it said my father No matter for that answered doctor Slop it has its uses for tho I m no great advocate for it yet in such a case as this he would soon be taught better manners and I can tell him if he went on at that rate would be flung into the Inquisition for his pains God help him then quoth my uncle Toby Amen added Trim for Heaven above knows I have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in it I never heard one word of it before said my uncle Toby hastily How came he there Trim O Sir the story will make your heart bleed as it has made mine a thousand times but it is too long to be told now your Honour shall hear it from first to last some day when I am working beside you in our fortifications but the short of the story is this That my brother Tom went over a servant to Lisbon and then married a Jew s widow who kept a small shop and sold sausages which somehow or other was the cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed where he was lying with his wife and two small children and carried directly to the Inquisition where God help him continued Trim fetching a sigh from the bottom of his heart the poor honest lad lies confined at this hour he was as honest a soul added Trim pulling out his handkerchief as ever blood warmed The tears trickled down Trim s cheeks faster than he could well wipe them away A dead silence in the room ensued for some minutes Certain proof of pity Come Trim quoth my father after he saw the poor fellow s grief had got a little vent read on and put this melancholy story out of thy head I grieve that I interrupted thee but prithee begin the sermon again for if the first sentence in it is matter of abuse as thou sayest I have a great desire to know what kind of provocation the apostle has given Corporal Trim wiped his face and returned his handkerchief into his pocket and making a bow as he did it he began again The Sermon Hebrews xiii eighteen For we trust we have a good Conscience Trust trust we have a good conscience Surely if there is any thing in this life which a man may depend upon and to the knowledge of which he is capable of arriving upon the most indisputable evidence it must be this very thing whether he has a good conscience or no I am positive I am right quoth doctor Slop If a man thinks at all he cannot well be a stranger to the true state of this account he must be privy to his own thoughts and desires he must remember his past pursuits and know certainly the true springs and motives which in general have governed the actions of his life I defy him without an assistant quoth doctor Slop In other matters we may be deceived by false appearances and as the wise man complains hardly do we guess aright at the things that are upon the earth and with labour do we find the things that are before us But here the mind has all the evidence and facts within herself is conscious of the web she has wove knows its texture and fineness and the exact share which every passion has had in working upon the several designs which virtue or vice has planned before her The language is good and I declare Trim reads very well quoth my father Now as conscience is nothing else but the knowledge which the mind has within herself of this and the judgment either of approbation or censure which it unavoidably makes upon the successive actions of our lives tis plain you will say from the very terms of the proposition whenever this inward testimony goes against a man and he stands self accused that he must necessarily be a guilty man And on the contrary when the report is favourable on his side and his heart condemns him not that it is not a matter of trust as the apostle intimates but a matter of certainty and fact that the conscience is good and that the man must be good also Then the apostle is altogether in the wrong I suppose quoth doctor Slop and the Protestant divine is in the right Sir have patience replied my father for I think it will presently appear that saint Paul and the Protestant divine are both of an opinion As nearly so quoth doctor Slop as east is to west but this continued he lifting both hands comes from the liberty of the press It is no more at the worst replied my uncle Toby than the liberty of the pulpit for it does not appear that the sermon is printed or ever likely to be Go on Trim quoth my father At first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case and I make no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so truly impressed upon the mind of man that did no such thing ever happen as that the conscience of a man by long habits of sin might as the scripture assures it may insensibly become hard and like some tender parts of his body by much stress and continual hard usage lose by degrees that nice sense and perception with which God and nature endowed it Did this never happen or was it certain that self love could never hang the least bias upon the judgment or that the little interests below could rise up and perplex the faculties of our upper regions and encompass them about with clouds and thick darkness Could no such thing as favour and affection enter this sacred Court Did Wit disdain to take a bribe in it or was ashamed to shew its face as an advocate for an unwarrantable enjoyment Or lastly were we assured that Interest stood always unconcerned whilst the cause was hearing and that Passion never got into the judgment seat and pronounced sentence in the stead of Reason which is supposed always to preside and determine upon the case Was this truly so as the objection must suppose no doubt then the religious and moral state of a man would be exactly what he himself esteemed it and the guilt or innocence of every man s life could be known in general by no better measure than the degrees of his own approbation and censure I own in one case whenever a man s conscience does accuse him as it seldom errs on that side that he is guilty and unless in melancholy and hypocondriac cases we may safely pronounce upon it that there is always sufficient grounds for the accusation But the converse of the proposition will not hold true namely that whenever there is guilt the conscience must accuse and if it does not that a man is therefore innocent This is not fact So that the common consolation which some good christian or other is hourly administering to himself that he thanks God his mind does not misgive him and that consequently he has a good conscience because he hath a quiet one is fallacious and as current as the inference is and as infallible as the rule appears at first sight yet when you look nearer to it and try the truth of this rule upon plain facts you see it liable to so much error from a false application the principle upon which it goes so often perverted the whole force of it lost and sometimes so vilely cast away that it is painful to produce the common examples from human life which confirm the account A man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his principles exceptionable in his conduct to the world shall live shameless in the open commission of a sin which no reason or pretence can justify a sin by which contrary to all the workings of humanity he shall ruin for ever the deluded partner of his guilt rob her of her best dowry and not only cover her own head with dishonour but involve a whole virtuous family in shame and sorrow for her sake Surely you will think conscience must lead such a man a troublesome life he can have no rest night and day from its reproaches Alas Conscience had something else to do all this time than break in upon him as Elijah reproached the god Baal this domestic god was either talking or pursuing or was in a journey or peradventure he slept and could not be awoke Perhaps He was gone out in company with Honour to fight a duel to pay off some debt at play or dirty annuity the bargain of his lust Perhaps Conscience all this time was engaged at home talking aloud against petty larceny and executing vengeance upon some such puny crimes as his fortune and rank of life secured him against all temptation of committing so that he lives as merrily If he was of our church tho quoth doctor Slop he could not sleeps as soundly in his bed and at last meets death unconcernedly perhaps much more so than a much better man All this is impossible with us quoth doctor Slop turning to my father the case could not happen in our church It happens in ours however replied my father but too often I own quoth doctor Slop struck a little with my father s frank acknowledgment that a man in the Romish church may live as badly but then he cannot easily die so Tis little matter replied my father with an air of indifference how a rascal dies I mean answered doctor Slop he would be denied the benefits of the last sacraments Pray how many have you in all said my uncle Toby for I always forget Seven answered doctor Slop Humph said my uncle Toby tho not accented as a note of acquiescence but as an interjection of that particular species of surprize when a man in looking into a drawer finds more of a thing than he expected Humph replied my uncle Toby doctor Slop who had an ear understood my uncle Toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume against the seven sacraments Humph replied doctor Slop stating my uncle Toby s argument over again to him Why Sir are there not seven cardinal virtues Seven mortal sins Seven golden candlesticks Seven heavens Tis more than I know replied my uncle Toby Are there not seven wonders of the world Seven days of the creation Seven planets Seven plagues That there are quoth my father with a most affected gravity But prithee continued he go on with the rest of thy characters Trim Another is sordid unmerciful here Trim waved his right hand a strait hearted selfish wretch incapable either of private friendship or public spirit Take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in their distress and sees all the miseries incident to human life without a sigh or a prayer An please your honours cried Trim I think this a viler man than the other Shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such occasions No thank God there is no occasion I pay every man his own I have no fornication to answer to my conscience no faithless vows or promises to make up I have debauched no man s wife or child thank God I am not as other men adulterers unjust or even as this libertine who stands before me A third is crafty and designing in his nature View his whole life tis nothing but a cunning contexture of dark arts and unequitable subterfuges basely to defeat the true intent of all laws plain dealing and the safe enjoyment of our several properties You will see such a one working out a frame of little designs upon the ignorance and perplexities of the poor and needy man shall raise a fortune upon the inexperience of a youth or the unsuspecting temper of his friend who would have trusted him with his life When old age comes on and repentance calls him to look back upon this black account and state it over again with his conscience Conscience looks into the Statutes at Large finds no express law broken by what he has done perceives no penalty or forfeiture of goods and chattels incurred sees no scourge waving over his head or prison opening his gates upon him What is there to affright his conscience Conscience has got safely entrenched behind the Letter of the Law sits there invulnerable fortified with Cases and Reports so strongly on all sides that it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold Here Corporal Trim and my uncle Toby exchanged looks with each other Aye Aye Trim quoth my uncle Toby shaking his head these are but sorry fortifications Trim O very poor work answered Trim to what your Honour and I make of it The character of this last man said doctor Slop interrupting Trim is more detestable than all the rest and seems to have been taken from some pettifogging Lawyer amongst you Amongst us a man s conscience could not possibly continue so long blinded three times in a year at least he must go to confession Will that restore it to sight quoth my uncle Toby Go on Trim quoth my father or Obadiah will have got back before thou has got to the end of thy sermon Tis a very short one replied Trim I wish it was longer quoth my uncle Toby for I like it hugely Trim went on A fourth man shall want even this refuge shall break through all their ceremony of slow chicane scorns the doubtful workings of secret plots and cautious trains to bring about his purpose See the bare faced villain how he cheats lies perjures robs murders Horrid But indeed much better was not to be expected in the present case the poor man was in the dark his priest had got the keeping of his conscience and all he would let him know of it was That he must believe in the Pope go to Mass cross himself tell his beads be a good Catholic and that this in all conscience was enough to carry him to heaven What if he perjures Why he had a mental reservation in it But if he is so wicked and abandoned a wretch as you represent him if he robs if he stabs will not conscience on every such act receive a wound itself Aye but the man has carried it to confession the wound digests there and will do well enough and in a short time be quite healed up by absolution O Popery what hast thou to answer for when not content with the too many natural and fatal ways thro which the heart of man is every day thus treacherous to itself above all things thou hast wilfully set open the wide gate of deceit before the face of this unwary traveller too apt God knows to go astray of himself and confidently speak peace to himself when there is no peace Of this the common instances which I have drawn out of life are too notorious to require much evidence If any man doubts the reality of them or thinks it impossible for a man to be such a bubble to himself I must refer him a moment to his own reflections and will then venture to trust my appeal with his own heart Let him consider in how different a degree of detestation numbers of wicked actions stand there tho equally bad and vicious in their own natures he will soon find that such of them as strong inclination and custom have prompted him to commit are generally dressed out and painted with all the false beauties which a soft and a flattering hand can give them and that the others to which he feels no propensity appear at once naked and deformed surrounded with all the true circumstances of folly and dishonour When David surprized Saul sleeping in the cave and cut off the skirt of his robe we read his heart smote him for what he had done But in the matter of Uriah where a faithful and gallant servant whom he ought to have loved and honoured fell to make way for his lust where conscience had so much greater reason to take the alarm his heart smote him not A whole year had almost passed from first commission of that crime to the time Nathan was sent to reprove him and we read not once of the least sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified during all that time for what he had done Thus conscience this once able monitor placed on high as a judge within us and intended by our maker as a just and equitable one too by an unhappy train of causes and impediments takes often such imperfect cognizance of what passes does its office so negligently sometimes so corruptly that it is not to be trusted alone and therefore we find there is a necessity an absolute necessity of joining another principle with it to aid if not govern its determinations So that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite importance to you not to be misled in namely in what degree of real merit you stand either as an honest man an useful citizen a faithful subject to your king or a good servant to your God call in religion and morality Look What is written in the law of God How readest thou Consult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice and truth what say they Let Conscience determine the matter upon these reports and then if thy heart condemns thee not which is the case the apostle supposes the rule will be infallible Here doctor Slop fell asleep thou wilt have confidence towards God that is have just grounds to believe the judgment thou hast past upon thyself is the judgment of God and nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous sentence which will be pronounced upon thee hereafter by that Being to whom thou art finally to give an account of thy actions Blessed is the man indeed then as the author of the book of Ecclesiasticus expresses it who is not pricked with the multitude of his sins Blessed is the man whose heart hath not condemned him whether he be rich or whether he be poor if he have a good heart a heart thus guided and informed he shall at all times rejoice in a chearful countenance his mind shall tell him more than seven watch men that sit above upon a tower on high A tower has no strength quoth my uncle Toby unless tis flank d in the darkest doubts it shall conduct him safer than a thousand casuists and give the state he lives in a better security for his behaviour than all the causes and restrictions put together which law makers are forced to multiply Forced I say as things stand human laws not being a matter of original choice but of pure necessity brought in to fence against the mischievous effects of those consciences which are no law unto themselves well intending by the many provisions made that in all such corrupt and misguided cases where principles and the checks of conscience will not make us upright to supply their force and by the terrors of gaols and halters oblige us to it I see plainly said my father that this sermon has been composed to be preached at the Temple or at some Assize I like the reasoning and am sorry that doctor Slop has fallen asleep before the time of his conviction for it is now clear that the Parson as I thought at first never insulted saint Paul in the least nor has there been brother the least difference between them A great matter if they had differed replied my uncle Toby the best friends in the world may differ sometimes True brother Toby quoth my father shaking hands with him we ll fill our pipes brother and then Trim shall go on Well what dost thou think of it said my father speaking to Corporal Trim as he reached his tobacco box I think answered the Corporal that the seven watch men upon the tower who I suppose are all centinels there are more an please your Honour than were necessary and to go on at that rate would harrass a regiment all to pieces which a commanding officer who loves his men will never do if he can help it because two centinels added the Corporal are as good as twenty I have been a commanding officer myself in the Corps de Garde a hundred times continued Trim rising an inch higher in his figure as he spoke and all the time I had the honour to serve his Majesty King William in relieving the most considerable posts I never left more than two in my life Very right Trim quoth my uncle Toby but you do not consider Trim that the towers in Solomon s days were not such things as our bastions flanked and defended by other works this Trim was an invention since Solomon s death nor had they horn works or ravelins before the curtin in his time or such a fosse as we make with a cuvette in the middle of it and with covered ways and counterscarps pallisadoed along it to guard against a Coup de main So that the seven men upon the tower were a party I dare say from the Corps de Garde set there not only to look out but to defend it They could be no more an please your Honour than a Corporal s Guard My father smiled inwardly but not outwardly the subject being rather too serious considering what had happened to make a jest of So putting his pipe into his mouth which he had just lighted he contented himself with ordering Trim to read on He read on as follows To have the fear of God before our eyes and in our mutual dealings with each other to govern our actions by the eternal measures of right and wrong The first of these will comprehend the duties of religion the second those of morality which are so inseparably connected together that you cannot divide these two tables even in imagination tho the attempt is often made in practice without breaking and mutually destroying them both I said the attempt is often made and so it is there being nothing more common than to see a man who has no sense at all of religion and indeed has so much honesty as to pretend to none who would take it as the bitterest affront should you but hint at a suspicion of his moral character or imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite When there is some appearance that it is so tho one is unwilling even to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty yet were we to look into the grounds of it in the present case I am persuaded we should find little reason to envy such a one the honour of his motive Let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject it will be found to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest his pride his ease or some such little and changeable passion as will give us but small dependence upon his actions in matters of great distress I will illustrate this by an example I know the banker I deal with or the physician I usually call in There is no need cried doctor Slop waking to call in any physician in this case to be neither of them men of much religion I hear them make a jest of it every day and treat all its sanctions with so much scorn as to put the matter past doubt Well notwithstanding this I put my fortune into the hands of the one and what is dearer still to me I trust my life to the honest skill of the other Now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence Why in the first place I believe there is no probability that either of them will employ the power I put into their hands to my disadvantage I consider that honesty serves the purposes of this life I know their success in the world depends upon the fairness of their characters In a word I m persuaded that they cannot hurt me without hurting themselves more But put it otherwise namely that interest lay for once on the other side that a case should happen wherein the one without stain to his reputation could secrete my fortune and leave me naked in the world or that the other could send me out of it and enjoy an estate by my death without dishonour to himself or his art In this case what hold have I of either of them Religion the strongest of all motives is out of the question Interest the next most powerful motive in the world is strongly against me What have I left to cast into the opposite scale to balance this temptation Alas I have nothing nothing but what is lighter than a bubble I must lie at the mercy of Honour or some such capricious principle Strait security for two of the most valuable blessings my property and myself As therefore we can have no dependence upon morality without religion so on the other hand there is nothing better to be expected from religion without morality nevertheless tis no prodigy to see a man whose real moral character stands very low who yet entertains the highest notion of himself in the light of a religious man He shall not only be covetous revengeful implacable but even wanting in points of common honesty yet inasmuch as he talks aloud against the infidelity of the age is zealous for some points of religion goes twice a day to church attends the sacraments and amuses himself with a few instrumental parts of religion shall cheat his conscience into a judgment that for this he is a religious man and has discharged truly his duty to God And you will find that such a man through force of this delusion generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man who has less affectation of piety though perhaps ten times more real honesty than himself This likewise is a sore evil under the sun and I believe there is no one mistaken principle which for its time has wrought more serious mischiefs For a general proof of this examine the history of the Romish church Well what can you make of that cried doctor Slop see what scenes of cruelty murder rapine bloodshed They may thank their own obstinacy cried doctor Slop have all been sanctified by a religion not strictly governed by morality In how many kingdoms of the world Here Trim kept waving his right hand from the sermon to the extent of his arm returning it backwards and forwards to the conclusion of the paragraph In how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this misguided saint errant spared neither age or merit or sex or condition and as he fought under the banners of a religion which set him loose from justice and humanity he shewed none mercilessly trampled upon both heard neither the cries of the unfortunate nor pitied their distresses I have been in many a battle an please your Honour quoth Trim sighing but never in so melancholy a one as this I would not have drawn a tricker in it against these poor souls to have been made a general officer Why what do you understand of the affair said doctor Slop looking towards Trim with something more of contempt than the Corporal s honest heart deserved What do you know friend about this battle you talk of I know replied Trim that I never refused quarter in my life to any man who cried out for it but to a woman or a child continued Trim before I would level my musket at them I would loose my life a thousand times Here s a crown for thee Trim to drink with Obadiah to night quoth my uncle Toby and I ll give Obadiah another too God bless your Honour replied Trim I had rather these poor women and children had it thou art an honest fellow quoth my uncle Toby My father nodded his head as much as to say and so he is But prithee Trim said my father make an end for I see thou hast but a leaf or two left Corporal Trim read on If the testimony of past centuries in this matter is not sufficient consider at this instant how the votaries of that religion are every day thinking to do service and honour to God by actions which are a dishonour and scandal to themselves To be convinced of this go with me for a moment into the prisons of the Inquisition God help my poor brother Tom Behold Religion with Mercy and Justice chained down under her feet there sitting ghastly upon a black tribunal propped up with racks and instruments of torment Hark hark what a piteous groan Here Trim s face turned as pale as ashes See the melancholy wretch who uttered it Here the tears began to trickle down just brought forth to undergo the anguish of a mock trial and endure the utmost pains that a studied system of cruelty has been able to invent D n them all quoth Trim his colour returning into his face as red as blood Behold this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentors his body so wasted with sorrow and confinement Oh tis my brother cried poor Trim in a most passionate exclamation dropping the sermon upon the ground and clapping his hands together I fear tis poor Tom My father s and my uncle Toby s heart yearned with sympathy for the poor fellow s distress even Slop himself acknowledged pity for him Why Trim said my father this is not a history tis a sermon thou art reading prithee begin the sentence again Behold this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentors his body so wasted with sorrow and confinement you will see every nerve and muscle as it suffers Observe the last movement of that horrid engine I would rather face a cannon quoth Trim stamping See what convulsions it has thrown him into Consider the nature of the posture in which he how lies stretched what exquisite tortures he endures by it I hope tis not in Portugal Tis all nature can bear Good God see how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips I would not read another line of it quoth Trim for all this world I fear an please your Honours all this is in Portugal where my poor brother Tom is I tell thee Trim again quoth my father tis not an historical account tis a description Tis only a description honest man quoth Slop there s not a word of truth in it That s another story replied my father However as Trim reads it with so much concern tis cruelty to force him to go on with it Give me hold of the sermon Trim I ll finish it for thee and thou may saint go I must stay and hear it too replied Trim if your Honour will allow me tho I would not read it myself for a Colonel s pay Poor Trim quoth my uncle Toby My father went on Consider the nature of the posture in which he now lies stretched what exquisite torture he endures by it Tis all nature can bear Good God See how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips willing to take its leave but not suffered to depart Behold the unhappy wretch led back to his cell Then thank God however quoth Trim they have not killed him See him dragged out of it again to meet the flames and the insults in his last agonies which this principle this principle that there can be religion without mercy has prepared for him Then thank God he is dead quoth Trim he is out of his pain and they have done their worst at him O Sirs Hold your peace Trim said my father going on with the sermon lest Trim should incense doctor Slop we shall never have done at this rate The surest way to try the merit of any disputed notion is to trace down the consequences such a notion has produced and compare them with the spirit of Christianity tis the short and decisive rule which our Saviour hath left us for these and such like cases and it is worth a thousand arguments By their fruits ye shall know them I will add no farther to the length of this sermon than by two or three short and independent rules deducible from it First Whenever a man talks loudly against religion always suspect that it is not his reason but his passions which have got the better of his Creed A bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and troublesome neighbours and where they separate depend upon it tis for no other cause but quietness sake Secondly When a man thus represented tells you in any particular instance That such a thing goes against his conscience always believe he means exactly the same thing as when he tells you such a thing goes against his stomach a present want of appetite being generally the true cause of both In a word trust that man in nothing who has not a Conscience in every thing And in your own case remember this plain distinction a mistake in which has ruined thousands that your conscience is not a law No God and reason made the law and have placed conscience within you to determine not like an Asiatic Cadi according to the ebbs and flows of his own passions but like a British judge in this land of liberty and good sense who makes no new law but faithfully declares that law which he knows already written Finis Thou hast read the sermon extremely well Trim quoth my father If he had spared his comments replied doctor Slop he would have read it much better I should have read it ten times better Sir answered Trim but that my heart was so full That was the very reason Trim replied my father which has made thee read the sermon as well as thou hast done and if the clergy of our church continued my father addressing himself to doctor Slop would take part in what they deliver as deeply as this poor fellow has done as their compositions are fine I deny it quoth doctor Slop I maintain it that the eloquence of our pulpits with such subjects to enflame it would be a model for the whole world But alas continued my father and I own it Sir with sorrow that like French politicians in this respect what they gain in the cabinet they lose in the field Twere a pity quoth my uncle that this should be lost I like the sermon well replied my father tis dramatick and there is something in that way of writing when skilfully managed which catches the attention We preach much in that way with us said doctor Slop I know that very well said my father but in a tone and manner which disgusted doctor Slop full as much as his assent simply could have pleased him But in this added doctor Slop a little piqued our sermons have greatly the advantage that we never introduce any character into them below a patriarch or a patriarch s wife or a martyr or a saint There are some very bad characters in this however said my father and I do not think the sermon a jot the worse for em But pray quoth my uncle Toby who s can this be How could it get into my Stevinus A man must be as great a conjurer as Stevinus said my father to resolve the second question The first I think is not so difficult for unless my judgment greatly deceives me I know the author for tis wrote certainly by the parson of the parish The similitude of the stile and manner of it with those my father constantly had heard preached in his parish church was the ground of his conjecture proving it as strongly as an argument a priori could prove such a thing to a philosophic mind That it was Yorick s and no one s else It was proved to be so a posteriori the day after when Yorick sent a servant to my uncle Toby s house to enquire after it It seems that Yorick who was inquisitive after all kinds of knowledge had borrowed Stevinus of my uncle Toby and had carelesly popped his sermon as soon as he had made it into the middle of Stevinus and by an act of forgetfulness to which he was ever subject he had sent Stevinus home and his sermon to keep him company Ill fated sermon Thou wast lost after this recovery of thee a second time dropped thru an unsuspected fissure in thy master s pocket down into a treacherous and a tattered lining trod deep into the dirt by the left hind foot of his Rosinante inhumanly stepping upon thee as thou falledst buried ten days in the mire raised up out of it by a beggar sold for a halfpenny to a parish clerk transferred to his parson lost for ever to thy own the remainder of his days nor restored to his restless Manes till this very moment that I tell the world the story Can the reader believe that this sermon of Yorick s was preached at an assize in the cathedral of York before a thousand witnesses ready to give oath of it by a certain prebendary of that church and actually printed by him when he had done and within so short a space as two years and three months after Yorick s death Yorick indeed was never better served in his life but it was a little hard to maltreat him after and plunder him after he was laid in his grave However as the gentleman who did it was in perfect charity with Yorick and in conscious justice printed but a few copies to give away and that I am told he could moreover have made as good a one himself had he thought fit I declare I would not have published this anecdote to the world nor do I publish it with an intent to hurt his character and advancement in the church I leave that to others but I find myself impelled by two reasons which I cannot withstand The first is That in doing justice I may give rest to Yorick s ghost which as the country people and some others believe still walks The second reason is That by laying open this story to the world I gain an opportunity of informing it That in case the character of parson Yorick and this sample of his sermons is liked there are now in the possession of the Shandy family as many as will make a handsome volume at the world s service and much good may they do it Chapter one XLIII Obadiah gained the two crowns without dispute for he came in jingling with all the instruments in the green baize bag we spoke of flung across his body just as Corporal Trim went out of the room It is now proper I think quoth doctor Slop clearing up his looks as we are in a condition to be of some service to missus Shandy to send up stairs to know how she goes on I have ordered answered my father the old midwife to come down to us upon the least difficulty for you must know doctor Slop continued my father with a perplexed kind of a smile upon his countenance that by express treaty solemnly ratified between me and my wife you are no more than an auxiliary in this affair and not so much as that unless the lean old mother of a midwife above stairs cannot do without you Women have their particular fancies and in points of this nature continued my father where they bear the whole burden and suffer so much acute pain for the advantage of our families and the good of the species they claim a right of deciding en Souveraines in whose hands and in what fashion they choose to undergo it They are in the right of it quoth my uncle Toby But Sir replied doctor Slop not taking notice of my uncle Toby s opinion but turning to my father they had better govern in other points and a father of a family who wishes its perpetuity in my opinion had better exchange this prerogative with them and give up some other rights in lieu of it I know not quoth my father answering a letter too testily to be quite dispassionate in what he said I know not quoth he what we have left to give up in lieu of who shall bring our children into the world unless that of who shall beget them One would almost give up any thing replied doctor Slop I beg your pardon answered my uncle Toby Sir replied doctor Slop it would astonish you to know what improvements we have made of late years in all branches of obstetrical knowledge but particularly in that one single point of the safe and expeditious extraction of the foetus which has received such lights that for my part holding up his hand I declare I wonder how the world has I wish quoth my uncle Toby you had seen what prodigious armies we had in Flanders Chapter one XLIV I have dropped the curtain over this scene for a minute to remind you of one thing and to inform you of another What I have to inform you comes I own a little out of its due course for it should have been told a hundred and fifty pages ago but that I foresaw then twould come in pat hereafter and be of more advantage here than elsewhere Writers had need look before them to keep up the spirit and connection of what they have in hand When these two things are done the curtain shall be drawn up again and my uncle Toby my father and doctor Slop shall go on with their discourse without any more interruption First then the matter which I have to remind you of is this that from the specimens of singularity in my father s notions in the point of Christian names and that other previous point thereto you was led I think into an opinion and I am sure I said as much that my father was a gentleman altogether as odd and whimsical in fifty other opinions In truth there was not a stage in the life of man from the very first act of his begetting down to the lean and slippered pantaloon in his second childishness but he had some favourite notion to himself springing out of it as sceptical and as far out of the high way of thinking as these two which have been explained mister Shandy my father Sir would see nothing in the light in which others placed it he placed things in his own light he would weigh nothing in common scales no he was too refined a researcher to lie open to so gross an imposition To come at the exact weight of things in the scientific steel yard the fulcrum he would say should be almost invisible to avoid all friction from popular tenets without this the minutiae of philosophy which would always turn the balance will have no weight at all Knowledge like matter he would affirm was divisible in infinitum that the grains and scruples were as much a part of it as the gravitation of the whole world In a word he would say error was error no matter where it fell whether in a fraction or a pound twas alike fatal to truth and she was kept down at the bottom of her well as inevitably by a mistake in the dust of a butterfly s wing as in the disk of the sun the moon and all the stars of heaven put together He would often lament that it was for want of considering this properly and of applying it skilfully to civil matters as well as to speculative truths that so many things in this world were out of joint that the political arch was giving way and that the very foundations of our excellent constitution in church and state were so sapped as estimators had reported You cry out he would say we are a ruined undone people Why he would ask making use of the sorites or syllogism of Zeno and Chrysippus without knowing it belonged to them Why why are we a ruined people Because we are corrupted Whence is it dear Sir that we are corrupted Because we are needy our poverty and not our wills consent And wherefore he would add are we needy From the neglect he would answer of our pence and our halfpence Our bank notes Sir our guineas nay our shillings take care of themselves Tis the same he would say throughout the whole circle of the sciences the great the established points of them are not to be broke in upon The laws of nature will defend themselves but error he would add looking earnestly at my mother error Sir creeps in thro the minute holes and small crevices which human nature leaves unguarded This turn of thinking in my father is what I had to remind you of The point you are to be informed of and which I have reserved for this place is as follows Amongst the many and excellent reasons with which my father had urged my mother to accept of doctor Slop s assistance preferably to that of the old woman there was one of a very singular nature which when he had done arguing the matter with her as a Christian and came to argue it over again with her as a philosopher he had put his whole strength to depending indeed upon it as his sheet anchor It failed him tho from no defect in the argument itself but that do what he could he was not able for his soul to make her comprehend the drift of it Cursed luck said he to himself one afternoon as he walked out of the room after he had been stating it for an hour and a half to her to no manner of purpose cursed luck said he biting his lip as he shut the door for a man to be master of one of the finest chains of reasoning in nature and have a wife at the same time with such a head piece that he cannot hang up a single inference within side of it to save his soul from destruction This argument though it was entirely lost upon my mother had more weight with him than all his other arguments joined together I will therefore endeavour to do it justice and set it forth with all the perspicuity I am master of My father set out upon the strength of these two following axioms First That an ounce of a man s own wit was worth a ton of other people s and Secondly Which by the bye was the ground work of the first axiom tho it comes last That every man s wit must come from every man s own soul and no other body s Now as it was plain to my father that all souls were by nature equal and that the great difference between the most acute and the most obtuse understanding was from no original sharpness or bluntness of one thinking substance above or below another but arose merely from the lucky or unlucky organization of the body in that part where the soul principally took up her residence he had made it the subject of his enquiry to find out the identical place Now from the best accounts he had been able to get of this matter he was satisfied it could not be where Des Cartes had fixed it upon the top of the pineal gland of the brain which as he philosophized formed a cushion for her about the size of a marrow pea tho to speak the truth as so many nerves did terminate all in that one place twas no bad conjecture and my father had certainly fallen with that great philosopher plumb into the centre of the mistake had it not been for my uncle Toby who rescued him out of it by a story he told him of a Walloon officer at the battle of Landen who had one part of his brain shot away by a musket ball and another part of it taken out after by a French surgeon and after all recovered and did his duty very well without it If death said my father reasoning with himself is nothing but the separation of the soul from the body and if it is true that people can walk about and do their business without brains then certes the soul does not inhabit there Q E D As for that certain very thin subtle and very fragrant juice which Coglionissimo Borri the great Milaneze physician affirms in a letter to Bartholine to have discovered in the cellulae of the occipital parts of the cerebellum and which he likewise affirms to be the principal seat of the reasonable soul for you must know in these latter and more enlightened ages there are two souls in every man living the one according to the great Metheglingius being called the Animus the other the Anima as for the opinion I say of Borri my father could never subscribe to it by any means the very idea of so noble so refined so immaterial and so exalted a being as the Anima or even the Animus taking up her residence and sitting dabbling like a tad pole all day long both summer and winter in a puddle or in a liquid of any kind how thick or thin soever he would say shocked his imagination he would scarce give the doctrine a hearing What therefore seemed the least liable to objections of any was that the chief sensorium or head quarters of the soul and to which place all intelligences were referred and from whence all her mandates were issued was in or near the cerebellum or rather somewhere about the medulla oblongata wherein it was generally agreed by Dutch anatomists that all the minute nerves from all the organs of the seven senses concentered like streets and winding alleys into a square So far there was nothing singular in my father s opinion he had the best of philosophers of all ages and climates to go along with him But here he took a road of his own setting up another Shandean hypothesis upon these corner stones they had laid for him and which said hypothesis equally stood its ground whether the subtilty and fineness of the soul depended upon the temperature and clearness of the said liquor or of the finer net work and texture in the cerebellum itself which opinion he favoured He maintained that next to the due care to be taken in the act of propagation of each individual which required all the thought in the world as it laid the foundation of this incomprehensible contexture in which wit memory fancy eloquence and what is usually meant by the name of good natural parts do consist that next to this and his Christian name which were the two original and most efficacious causes of all that the third cause or rather what logicians call the Causa sina qua non and without which all that was done was of no manner of significance was the preservation of this delicate and fine spun web from the havock which was generally made in it by the violent compression and crush which the head was made to undergo by the nonsensical method of bringing us into the world by that foremost This requires explanation My father who dipped into all kinds of books upon looking into Lithopaedus Senonesis de Portu difficili The author is here twice mistaken for Lithopaedus should be wrote thus Lithopaedii Senonensis Icon The second mistake is that this Lithopaedus is not an author but a drawing of a petrified child The account of this published by Athosius fifteen eighty may be seen at the end of Cordaeus s works in Spachius mister Tristram Shandy has been led into this error either from seeing Lithopaedus s name of late in a catalogue of learned writers in doctor or by mistaking Lithopaedus for Trinecavellius from the too great similitude of the names published by Adrianus Smelvgot had found out that the lax and pliable state of a child s head in parturition the bones of the cranium having no sutures at that time was such that by force of the woman s efforts which in strong labour pains was equal upon an average to the weight of four hundred seventy pounds avoirdupois acting perpendicularly upon it it so happened that in forty nine instances out of fifty the said head was compressed and moulded into the shape of an oblong conical piece of dough such as a pastry cook generally rolls up in order to make a pye of Good God cried my father what havock and destruction must this make in the infinitely fine and tender texture of the cerebellum Or if there is such a juice as Borri pretends is it not enough to make the clearest liquid in the world both seculent and mothery But how great was his apprehension when he farther understood that this force acting upon the very vertex of the head not only injured the brain itself or cerebrum but that it necessarily squeezed and propelled the cerebrum towards the cerebellum which was the immediate seat of the understanding Angels and ministers of grace defend us cried my father can any soul withstand this shock No wonder the intellectual web is so rent and tattered as we see it and that so many of our best heads are no better than a puzzled skein of silk all perplexity all confusion within side But when my father read on and was let into the secret that when a child was turned topsy turvy which was easy for an operator to do and was extracted by the feet that instead of the cerebrum being propelled towards the cerebellum the cerebellum on the contrary was propelled simply towards the cerebrum where it could do no manner of hurt By heavens cried he the world is in conspiracy to drive out what little wit God has given us and the professors of the obstetric art are listed into the same conspiracy What is it to me which end of my son comes foremost into the world provided all goes right after and his cerebellum escapes uncrushed It is the nature of an hypothesis when once a man has conceived it that it assimilates every thing to itself as proper nourishment and from the first moment of your begetting it it generally grows the stronger by every thing you see hear read or understand This is of great use When my father was gone with this about a month there was scarce a phaenomenon of stupidity or of genius which he could not readily solve by it it accounted for the eldest son being the greatest blockhead in the family Poor devil he would say he made way for the capacity of his younger brothers It unriddled the observations of drivellers and monstrous heads shewing a priori it could not be otherwise unless I don t know what It wonderfully explained and accounted for the acumen of the Asiatic genius and that sprightlier turn and a more penetrating intuition of minds in warmer climates not from the loose and common place solution of a clearer sky and a more perpetual sunshine c which for aught he knew might as well rarefy and dilute the faculties of the soul into nothing by one extreme as they are condensed in colder climates by the other but he traced the affair up to its spring head shewed that in warmer climates nature had laid a lighter tax upon the fairest parts of the creation their pleasures more the necessity of their pains less insomuch that the pressure and resistance upon the vertex was so slight that the whole organization of the cerebellum was preserved nay he did not believe in natural births that so much as a single thread of the net work was broke or displaced so that the soul might just act as she liked When my father had got so far what a blaze of light did the accounts of the Caesarian section and of the towering geniuses who had come safe into the world by it cast upon this hypothesis Here you see he would say there was no injury done to the sensorium no pressure of the head against the pelvis no propulsion of the cerebrum towards the cerebellum either by the os pubis on this side or os coxygis on that and pray what were the happy consequences Why Sir your Julius Caesar who gave the operation a name and your Hermes Trismegistus who was born so before ever the operation had a name your Scipio Africanus your Manlius Torquatus our Edward the Sixth who had he lived would have done the same honour to the hypothesis These and many more who figured high in the annals of fame all came side way Sir into the world The incision of the abdomen and uterus ran for six weeks together in my father s head he had read and was satisfied that wounds in the epigastrium and those in the matrix were not mortal so that the belly of the mother might be opened extremely well to give a passage to the child He mentioned the thing one afternoon to my mother merely as a matter of fact but seeing her turn as pale as ashes at the very mention of it as much as the operation flattered his hopes he thought it as well to say no more of it contenting himself with admiring what he thought was to no purpose to propose This was my father mister Shandy s hypothesis concerning which I have only to add that my brother Bobby did as great honour to it whatever he did to the family as any one of the great heroes we spoke of For happening not only to be christened as I told you but to be born too when my father was at Epsom being moreover my mother s first child coming into the world with his head foremost and turning out afterwards a lad of wonderful slow parts my father spelt all these together into his opinion and as he had failed at one end he was determined to try the other This was not to be expected from one of the sisterhood who are not easily to be put out of their way and was therefore one of my father s great reasons in favour of a man of science whom he could better deal with Of all men in the world doctor Slop was the fittest for my father s purpose for though this new invented forceps was the armour he had proved and what he maintained to be the safest instrument of deliverance yet it seems he had scattered a word or two in his book in favour of the very thing which ran in my father s fancy tho not with a view to the soul s good in extracting by the feet as was my father s system but for reasons merely obstetrical This will account for the coalition betwixt my father and doctor Slop in the ensuing discourse which went a little hard against my uncle Toby In what manner a plain man with nothing but common sense could bear up against two such allies in science is hard to conceive You may conjecture upon it if you please and whilst your imagination is in motion you may encourage it to go on and discover by what causes and effects in nature it could come to pass that my uncle Toby got his modesty by the wound he received upon his groin You may raise a system to account for the loss of my nose by marriage articles and shew the world how it could happen that I should have the misfortune to be called Tristram in opposition to my father s hypothesis and the wish of the whole family Godfathers and Godmothers not excepted These with fifty other points left yet unravelled you may endeavour to solve if you have time but I tell you beforehand it will be in vain for not the sage Alquise the magician in Don Belianis of Greece nor the no less famous Urganda the sorceress his wife were they alive could pretend to come within a league of the truth The reader will be content to wait for a full explanation of these matters till the next year when a series of things will be laid open which he little expects Chapter one XLV I wish doctor Slop quoth my uncle Toby repeating his wish for doctor Slop a second time and with a degree of more zeal and earnestness in his manner of wishing than he had wished at first Vide I wish doctor Slop quoth my uncle Toby you had seen what prodigious armies we had in Flanders My uncle Toby s wish did doctor Slop a disservice which his heart never intended any man Sir it confounded him and thereby putting his ideas first into confusion and then to flight he could not rally them again for the soul of him In all disputes male or female whether for honour for profit or for love it makes no difference in the case nothing is more dangerous Madam than a wish coming sideways in this unexpected manner upon a man the safest way in general to take off the force of the wish is for the party wish d at instantly to get upon his legs and wish the wisher something in return of pretty near the same value so balancing the account upon the spot you stand as you were nay sometimes gain the advantage of the attack by it This will be fully illustrated to the world in my chapter of wishes doctor Slop did not understand the nature of this defence he was puzzled with it and it put an entire stop to the dispute for four minutes and a half five had been fatal to it my father saw the danger the dispute was one of the most interesting disputes in the world Whether the child of his prayers and endeavours should be born without a head or with one he waited to the last moment to allow doctor Slop in whose behalf the wish was made his right of returning it but perceiving I say that he was confounded and continued looking with that perplexed vacuity of eye which puzzled souls generally stare with first in my uncle Toby s face then in his then up then down then east east and by east and so on coasting it along by the plinth of the wainscot till he had got to the opposite point of the compass and that he had actually begun to count the brass nails upon the arm of his chair my father thought there was no time to be lost with my uncle Toby so took up the discourse as follows Chapter one XLVI What prodigious armies you had in Flanders Brother Toby replied my father taking his wig from off his head with his right hand and with his left pulling out a striped India handkerchief from his right coat pocket in order to rub his head as he argued the point with my uncle Toby Now in this I think my father was much to blame and I will give you my reasons for it Matters of no more seeming consequence in themselves than Whether my father should have taken off his wig with his right hand or with his left have divided the greatest kingdoms and made the crowns of the monarchs who governed them to totter upon their heads But need I tell you Sir that the circumstances with which every thing in this world is begirt give every thing in this world its size and shape and by tightening it or relaxing it this way or that make the thing to be what it is great little good bad indifferent or not indifferent just as the case happens As my father s India handkerchief was in his right coat pocket he should by no means have suffered his right hand to have got engaged on the contrary instead of taking off his wig with it as he did he ought to have committed that entirely to the left and then when the natural exigency my father was under of rubbing his head called out for his handkerchief he would have had nothing in the world to have done but to have put his right hand into his right coat pocket and taken it out which he might have done without any violence or the least ungraceful twist in any one tendon or muscle of his whole body In this case unless indeed my father had been resolved to make a fool of himself by holding the wig stiff in his left hand or by making some nonsensical angle or other at his elbow joint or armpit his whole attitude had been easy natural unforced Reynolds himself as great and gracefully as he paints might have painted him as he sat Now as my father managed this matter consider what a devil of a figure my father made of himself In the latter end of Queen Anne s reign and in the beginning of the reign of King George the first Coat pockets were cut very low down in the skirt I need say no more the father of mischief had he been hammering at it a month could not have contrived a worse fashion for one in my father s situation Chapter one XLVII It was not an easy matter in any king s reign unless you were as lean a subject as myself to have forced your hand diagonally quite across your whole body so as to gain the bottom of your opposite coat pocket In the year one thousand seven hundred and eighteen when this happened it was extremely difficult so that when my uncle Toby discovered the transverse zig zaggery of my father s approaches towards it it instantly brought into his mind those he had done duty in before the gate of saint Nicolas the idea of which drew off his attention so intirely from the subject in debate that he had got his right hand to the bell to ring up Trim to go and fetch his map of Namur and his compasses and sector along with it to measure the returning angles of the traverses of that attack but particularly of that one where he received his wound upon his groin My father knit his brows and as he knit them all the blood in his body seemed to rush up into his face my uncle Toby dismounted immediately I did not apprehend your uncle Toby was o horseback Chapter one XLVIII A man s body and his mind with the utmost reverence to both I speak it are exactly like a jerkin and a jerkin s lining rumple the one you rumple the other There is one certain exception however in this case and that is when you are so fortunate a fellow as to have had your jerkin made of gum taffeta and the body lining to it of a sarcenet or thin persian Zeno Cleanthes Diogenes Babylonius Dionysius Heracleotes Antipater Panaetius and Possidonius amongst the Greeks Cato and Varro and Seneca amongst the Romans Pantenus and Clemens Alexandrinus and Montaigne amongst the Christians and a score and a half of good honest unthinking Shandean people as ever lived whose names I can t recollect all pretended that their jerkins were made after this fashion you might have rumpled and crumpled and doubled and creased and fretted and fridged the outside of them all to pieces in short you might have played the very devil with them and at the same time not one of the insides of them would have been one button the worse for all you had done to them I believe in my conscience that mine is made up somewhat after this sort for never poor jerkin has been tickled off at such a rate as it has been these last nine months together and yet I declare the lining to it as far as I am a judge of the matter is not a three penny piece the worse pell mell helter skelter ding dong cut and thrust back stroke and fore stroke side way and long way have they been trimming it for me had there been the least gumminess in my lining by heaven it had all of it long ago been frayed and fretted to a thread You Messrs the Monthly Reviewers how could you cut and slash my jerkin as you did how did you know but you would cut my lining too Heartily and from my soul to the protection of that Being who will injure none of us do I recommend you and your affairs so God bless you only next month if any one of you should gnash his teeth and storm and rage at me as some of you did last May in which I remember the weather was very hot don t be exasperated if I pass it by again with good temper being determined as long as I live or write which in my case means the same thing never to give the honest gentleman a worse word or a worse wish than my uncle Toby gave the fly which buzz d about his nose all dinner time Go go poor devil quoth he get thee gone why should I hurt thee This world is surely wide enough to hold both thee and me Chapter one XLIX Any man Madam reasoning upwards and observing the prodigious suffusion of blood in my father s countenance by means of which as all the blood in his body seemed to rush into his face as I told you he must have reddened pictorically and scientifically speaking six whole tints and a half if not a full octave above his natural colour any man Madam but my uncle Toby who had observed this together with the violent knitting of my father s brows and the extravagant contortion of his body during the whole affair would have concluded my father in a rage and taking that for granted had he been a lover of such kind of concord as arises from two such instruments being put in exact tune he would instantly have skrew d up his to the same pitch and then the devil and all had broke loose the whole piece Madam must have been played off like the sixth of Avison Scarlatti con furia like mad Grant me patience What has con furia con strepito or any other hurly burly whatever to do with harmony Any man I say Madam but my uncle Toby the benignity of whose heart interpreted every motion of the body in the kindest sense the motion would admit of would have concluded my father angry and blamed him too My uncle Toby blamed nothing but the taylor who cut the pocket hole so sitting still till my father had got his handkerchief out of it and looking all the time up in his face with inexpressible good will my father at length went on as follows Chapter one L What prodigious armies you had in Flanders Brother Toby quoth my father I do believe thee to be as honest a man and with as good and as upright a heart as ever God created nor is it thy fault if all the children which have been may can shall will or ought to be begotten come with their heads foremost into the world but believe me dear Toby the accidents which unavoidably way lay them not only in the article of our begetting em though these in my opinion are well worth considering but the dangers and difficulties our children are beset with after they are got forth into the world are enow little need is there to expose them to unnecessary ones in their passage to it Are these dangers quoth my uncle Toby laying his hand upon my father s knee and looking up seriously in his face for an answer are these dangers greater now o days brother than in times past Brother Toby answered my father if a child was but fairly begot and born alive and healthy and the mother did well after it our forefathers never looked farther My uncle Toby instantly withdrew his hand from off my father s knee reclined his body gently back in his chair raised his head till he could just see the cornice of the room and then directing the buccinatory muscles along his cheeks and the orbicular muscles around his lips to do their duty he whistled Lillabullero Chapter one LI Whilst my uncle Toby was whistling Lillabullero to my father doctor Slop was stamping and cursing and damning at Obadiah at a most dreadful rate it would have done your heart good and cured you Sir for ever of the vile sin of swearing to have heard him I am determined therefore to relate the whole affair to you When doctor Slop s maid delivered the green baize bag with her master s instruments in it to Obadiah she very sensibly exhorted him to put his head and one arm through the strings and ride with it slung across his body so undoing the bow knot to lengthen the strings for him without any more ado she helped him on with it However as this in some measure unguarded the mouth of the bag lest any thing should bolt out in galloping back at the speed Obadiah threatened they consulted to take it off again and in the great care and caution of their hearts they had taken the two strings and tied them close pursing up the mouth of the bag first with half a dozen hard knots each of which Obadiah to make all safe had twitched and drawn together with all the strength of his body This answered all that Obadiah and the maid intended but was no remedy against some evils which neither he or she foresaw The instruments it seems as tight as the bag was tied above had so much room to play in it towards the bottom the shape of the bag being conical that Obadiah could not make a trot of it but with such a terrible jingle what with the tire tete forceps and squirt as would have been enough had Hymen been taking a jaunt that way to have frightened him out of the country but when Obadiah accelerated his motion and from a plain trot assayed to prick his coach horse into a full gallop by Heaven Sir the jingle was incredible As Obadiah had a wife and three children the turpitude of fornication and the many other political ill consequences of this jingling never once entered his brain he had however his objection which came home to himself and weighed with him as it has oft times done with the greatest patriots The poor fellow Sir was not able to hear himself whistle Chapter one LII As Obadiah loved wind music preferably to all the instrumental music he carried with him he very considerately set his imagination to work to contrive and to invent by what means he should put himself in a condition of enjoying it In all distresses except musical where small cords are wanted nothing is so apt to enter a man s head as his hat band the philosophy of this is so near the surface I scorn to enter into it As Obadiah s was a mixed case mark Sirs I say a mixed case for it was obstetrical scrip tical squirtical papistical and as far as the coach horse was concerned in it caballistical and only partly musical Obadiah made no scruple of availing himself of the first expedient which offered so taking hold of the bag and instruments and griping them hard together with one hand and with the finger and thumb of the other putting the end of the hat band betwixt his teeth and then slipping his hand down to the middle of it he tied and cross tied them all fast together from one end to the other as you would cord a trunk with such a multiplicity of round abouts and intricate cross turns with a hard knot at every intersection or point where the strings met that doctor Slop must have had three fifths of Job s patience at least to have unloosed them I think in my conscience that had Nature been in one of her nimble moods and in humour for such a contest and she and doctor Slop both fairly started together there is no man living which had seen the bag with all that Obadiah had done to it and known likewise the great speed the Goddess can make when she thinks proper who would have had the least doubt remaining in his mind which of the two would have carried off the prize My mother Madam had been delivered sooner than the green bag infallibly at least by twenty knots Sport of small accidents Tristram Shandy that thou art and ever will be had that trial been for thee and it was fifty to one but it had thy affairs had not been so depress d at least by the depression of thy nose as they have been nor had the fortunes of thy house and the occasions of making them which have so often presented themselves in the course of thy life to thee been so often so vexatiously so tamely so irrecoverably abandoned as thou hast been forced to leave them but tis over all but the account of em which cannot be given to the curious till I am got out into the world End of the first volume THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY GENT VOLUME THE SECOND Multitudinis imperitae non formido judicia meis tamen rogo parcant opusculis in quibus fuit propositi semper a jocis ad seria in seriis vicissim ad jocos transire Joan Saresberiensis Episcopus Lugdun Chapter two I Great wits jump for the moment doctor Slop cast his eyes upon his bag which he had not done till the dispute with my uncle Toby about mid wifery put him in mind of it the very same thought occurred Tis God s mercy quoth he to himself that missus Shandy has had so bad a time of it else she might have been brought to bed seven times told before one half of these knots could have got untied But here you must distinguish the thought floated only in doctor Slop s mind without sail or ballast to it as a simple proposition millions of which as your worship knows are every day swimming quietly in the middle of the thin juice of a man s understanding without being carried backwards or forwards till some little gusts of passion or interest drive them to one side A sudden trampling in the room above near my mother s bed did the proposition the very service I am speaking of By all that s unfortunate quoth doctor Slop unless I make haste the thing will actually befall me as it is Chapter two II In the case of knots by which in the first place I would not be understood to mean slip knots because in the course of my life and opinions my opinions concerning them will come in more properly when I mention the catastrophe of my great uncle mister Hammond Shandy a little man but of high fancy he rushed into the duke of Monmouth s affair nor secondly in this place do I mean that particular species of knots called bow knots there is so little address or skill or patience required in the unloosing them that they are below my giving any opinion at all about them But by the knots I am speaking of may it please your reverences to believe that I mean good honest devilish tight hard knots made bona fide as Obadiah made his in which there is no quibbling provision made by the duplication and return of the two ends of the strings thro the annulus or noose made by the second implication of them to get them slipp d and undone by I hope you apprehend me In the case of these knots then and of the several obstructions which may it please your reverences such knots cast in our way in getting through life every hasty man can whip out his pen knife and cut through them Tis wrong Believe me Sirs the most virtuous way and which both reason and conscience dictate is to take our teeth or our fingers to them doctor Slop had lost his teeth his favourite instrument by extracting in a wrong direction or by some misapplication of it unfortunately slipping he had formerly in a hard labour knock d out three of the best of them with the handle of it he tried his fingers alas the nails of his fingers and thumbs were cut close The duce take it I can make nothing of it either way cried doctor Slop The trampling over head near my mother s bed side increased Pox take the fellow I shall never get the knots untied as long as I live My mother gave a groan Lend me your penknife I must e en cut the knots at last pugh psha Lord I have cut my thumb quite across to the very bone curse the fellow if there was not another man midwife within fifty miles I am undone for this bout I wish the scoundrel hang d I wish he was shot I wish all the devils in hell had him for a blockhead My father had a great respect for Obadiah and could not bear to hear him disposed of in such a manner he had moreover some little respect for himself and could as ill bear with the indignity offered to himself in it Had doctor Slop cut any part about him but his thumb my father had pass d it by his prudence had triumphed as it was he was determined to have his revenge Small curses doctor Slop upon great occasions quoth my father condoling with him first upon the accident are but so much waste of our strength and soul s health to no manner of purpose I own it replied doctor Slop They are like sparrow shot quoth my uncle Toby suspending his whistling fired against a bastion They serve continued my father to stir the humours but carry off none of their acrimony for my own part I seldom swear or curse at all I hold it bad but if I fall into it by surprize I generally retain so much presence of mind right quoth my uncle Toby as to make it answer my purpose that is I swear on till I find myself easy A wife and a just man however would always endeavour to proportion the vent given to these humours not only to the degree of them stirring within himself but to the size and ill intent of the offence upon which they are to fall Injuries come only from the heart quoth my uncle Toby For this reason continued my father with the most Cervantick gravity I have the greatest veneration in the world for that gentleman who in distrust of his own discretion in this point sat down and composed that is at his leisure fit forms of swearing suitable to all cases from the lowest to the highest provocation which could possibly happen to him which forms being well considered by him and such moreover as he could stand to he kept them ever by him on the chimney piece within his reach ready for use I never apprehended replied doctor Slop that such a thing was ever thought of much less executed I beg your pardon answered my father I was reading though not using one of them to my brother Toby this morning whilst he pour d out the tea tis here upon the shelf over my head but if I remember right tis too violent for a cut of the thumb Not at all quoth doctor Slop the devil take the fellow Then answered my father Tis much at your service doctor Slop on condition you will read it aloud so rising up and reaching down a form of excommunication of the church of Rome a copy of which my father who was curious in his collections had procured out of the leger book of the church of Rochester writ by Ernulphus the bishop with a most affected seriousness of look and voice which might have cajoled Ernulphus himself he put it into doctor Slop s hands doctor Slop wrapt his thumb up in the corner of his handkerchief and with a wry face though without any suspicion read aloud as follows my uncle Toby whistling Lillabullero as loud as he could all the time As the geniuneness of the consultation of the Sorbonne upon the question of baptism was doubted by some and denied by others twas thought proper to print the original of this excommunication for the copy of which mister Shandy returns thanks to the chapter clerk of the dean and chapter of Rochester Chapter two III Textus de Ecclesia Roffensi per Ernulfum Episcopum Excommunicatio Ex auctoritate Dei omnipotentis Patris et Filij et Spiritus Sancti et sanctorum

Ghost and of the holy canons and of the undefiled Virgin Mary mother and patroness of our Saviour I think there is no necessity quoth doctor Slop dropping the paper down to his knee and addressing himself to my father as you have read it over Sir so lately to read it aloud and as Captain Shandy seems to have no great inclination to hear it I may as well read it to myself That s contrary to treaty replied my father besides there is something so whimsical especially in the latter part of it I should grieve to lose the pleasure of a second reading doctor Slop did not altogether like it but my uncle Toby offering at that instant to give over whistling and read it himself to them doctor Slop thought he might as well read it under the cover of my uncle Toby s whistling as suffer my uncle Toby to read it alone so raising up the paper to his face and holding it quite parallel to it in order to hide his chagrin he read it aloud as follows my uncle Toby whistling Lillabullero though not quite so loud as before By the authority of God Almighty the Father Son and Holy Ghost and of the undefiled Virgin Mary mother and patroness of our Saviour and of all the celestial virtues angels archangels thrones dominions powers cherubins and seraphins and of all the holy patriarchs prophets and of all the apostles and evangelists and of the holy innocents who in the sight of the Holy Lamb are found worthy to sing the new song of the holy martyrs and holy confessors and of the holy virgins and of all the saints together with the holy and elect of God May he Obadiah be damn d for tying these knots We excommunicate and anathematize him and from the thresholds of the holy church of God Almighty we sequester him that he may be tormented disposed and delivered over with Dathan and Abiram and with those who say unto the Lord God Depart from us we desire none of thy ways And as fire is quenched with water so let the light of him be put out for evermore unless it shall repent him Obadiah of the knots which he has tied and make satisfaction for them Amen May the Father who created man curse him May the Son who suffered for us curse him May the Holy Ghost who was given to us in baptism curse him Obadiah May the holy cross which Christ for our salvation triumphing over his enemies ascended curse him May the holy and eternal Virgin Mary mother of God curse him May saint Michael the advocate of holy souls curse him May all the angels and archangels principalities and powers and all the heavenly armies curse him Our armies swore terribly in Flanders cried my uncle Toby but nothing to this For my own part I could not have a heart to curse my dog so May saint John the Praecursor and saint John the Baptist and saint Peter and saint Paul and saint Andrew and all other Christ s apostles together curse him And may the rest of his disciples and four evangelists who by their preaching converted the universal world and may the holy and wonderful company of martyrs and confessors who by their holy works are found pleasing to God Almighty curse him Obadiah May the holy choir of the holy virgins who for the honour of Christ have despised the things of the world damn him May all the saints who from the beginning of the world to everlasting ages are found to be beloved of God damn him May the heavens and earth and all the holy things remaining therein damn him Obadiah or her or whoever else had a hand in tying these knots May he Obadiah be damn d wherever he be whether in the house or the stables the garden or the field or the highway or in the path or in the wood or in the water or in the church May he be cursed in living in dying Here my uncle Toby taking the advantage of a minim in the second bar of his tune kept whistling one continued note to the end of the sentence doctor Slop with his division of curses moving under him like a running bass all the way May he be cursed in eating and drinking in being hungry in being thirsty in fasting in sleeping in slumbering in walking in standing in sitting in lying in working in resting in pissing in shitting and in blood letting May he Obadiah be cursed in all the faculties of his body May he be cursed inwardly and outwardly May he be cursed in the hair of his head May he be cursed in his brains and in his vertex that is a sad curse quoth my father in his temples in his forehead in his ears in his eye brows in his cheeks in his jaw bones in his nostrils in his fore teeth and grinders in his lips in his throat in his shoulders in his wrists in his arms in his hands in his fingers May he be damn d in his mouth in his breast in his heart and purtenance down to the very stomach May he be cursed in his reins and in his groin God in heaven forbid quoth my uncle Toby in his thighs in his genitals my father shook his head and in his hips and in his knees his legs and feet and toe nails May he be cursed in all the joints and articulations of the members from the top of his head to the sole of his foot May there be no soundness in him May the son of the living God with all the glory of his Majesty Here my uncle Toby throwing back his head gave a monstrous long loud Whew w w something betwixt the interjectional whistle of Hay day and the word itself By the golden beard of Jupiter and of Juno if her majesty wore one and by the beards of the rest of your heathen worships which by the bye was no small number since what with the beards of your celestial gods and gods aerial and aquatick to say nothing of the beards of town gods and country gods or of the celestial goddesses your wives or of the infernal goddesses your whores and concubines that is in case they wore them all which beards as Varro tells me upon his word and honour when mustered up together made no less than thirty thousand effective beards upon the Pagan establishment every beard of which claimed the rights and privileges of being stroken and sworn by by all these beards together then I vow and protest that of the two bad cassocks I am worth in the world I would have given the better of them as freely as ever Cid Hamet offered his to have stood by and heard my uncle Toby s accompanyment curse him continued doctor Slop and may heaven with all the powers which move therein rise up against him curse and damn him Obadiah unless he repent and make satisfaction Amen So be it so be it Amen I declare quoth my uncle Toby my heart would not let me curse the devil himself with so much bitterness He is the father of curses replied doctor Slop So am not I replied my uncle But he is cursed and damn d already to all eternity replied doctor Slop I am sorry for it quoth my uncle Toby doctor Slop drew up his mouth and was just beginning to return my uncle Toby the compliment of his Whu u u or interjectional whistle when the door hastily opening in the next chapter but one put an end to the affair Chapter two V Now don t let us give ourselves a parcel of airs and pretend that the oaths we make free with in this land of liberty of ours are our own and because we have the spirit to swear them imagine that we have had the wit to invent them too I ll undertake this moment to prove it to any man in the world except to a connoisseur though I declare I object only to a connoisseur in swearing as I would do to a connoisseur in painting c c the whole set of em are so hung round and befetish d with the bobs and trinkets of criticism or to drop my metaphor which by the bye is a pity for I have fetch d it as far as from the coast of Guiney their heads Sir are stuck so full of rules and compasses and have that eternal propensity to apply them upon all occasions that a work of genius had better go to the devil at once than stand to be prick d and tortured to death by em And how did Garrick speak the soliloquy last night Oh against all rule my lord most ungrammatically betwixt the substantive and the adjective which should agree together in number case and gender he made a breach thus stopping as if the point wanted settling and betwixt the nominative case which your lordship knows should govern the verb he suspended his voice in the epilogue a dozen times three seconds and three fifths by a stop watch my lord each time Admirable grammarian But in suspending his voice was the sense suspended likewise Did no expression of attitude or countenance fill up the chasm Was the eye silent Did you narrowly look I look d only at the stop watch my lord Excellent observer And what of this new book the whole world makes such a rout about Oh tis out of all plumb my lord quite an irregular thing not one of the angles at the four corners was a right angle I had my rule and compasses c my lord in my pocket Excellent critick And for the epick poem your lordship bid me look at upon taking the length breadth height and depth of it and trying them at home upon an exact scale of Bossu s tis out my lord in every one of its dimensions Admirable connoisseur And did you step in to take a look at the grand picture in your way back Tis a melancholy daub my lord not one principle of the pyramid in any one group and what a price for there is nothing of the colouring of Titian the expression of Rubens the grace of Raphael the purity of Dominichino the corregiescity of Corregio the learning of Poussin the airs of Guido the taste of the Carrachis or the grand contour of Angelo Grant me patience just Heaven Of all the cants which are canted in this canting world though the cant of hypocrites may be the worst the cant of criticism is the most tormenting I would go fifty miles on foot for I have not a horse worth riding on to kiss the hand of that man whose generous heart will give up the reins of his imagination into his author s hands be pleased he knows not why and cares not wherefore Great Apollo if thou art in a giving humour give me I ask no more but one stroke of native humour with a single spark of thy own fire along with it and send Mercury with the rules and compasses if he can be spared with my compliments to no matter Now to any one else I will undertake to prove that all the oaths and imprecations which we have been puffing off upon the world for these two hundred and fifty years last past as originals except saint Paul s thumb God s flesh and God s fish which were oaths monarchical and considering who made them not much amiss and as kings oaths tis not much matter whether they were fish or flesh else I say there is not an oath or at least a curse amongst them which has not been copied over and over again out of Ernulphus a thousand times but like all other copies how infinitely short of the force and spirit of the original it is thought to be no bad oath and by itself passes very well G d damn you Set it beside Ernulphus s God almighty the Father damn you God the Son damn you God the Holy Ghost damn you you see tis nothing There is an orientality in his we cannot rise up to besides he is more copious in his invention possess d more of the excellencies of a swearer had such a thorough knowledge of the human frame its membranes nerves ligaments knittings of the joints and articulations that when Ernulphus cursed no part escaped him Tis true there is something of a hardness in his manner and as in Michael Angelo a want of grace but then there is such a greatness of gusto My father who generally look d upon every thing in a light very different from all mankind would after all never allow this to be an original He considered rather Ernulphus s anathema as an institute of swearing in which as he suspected upon the decline of swearing in some milder pontificate Ernulphus by order of the succeeding pope had with great learning and diligence collected together all the laws of it for the same reason that Justinian in the decline of the empire had ordered his chancellor Tribonian to collect the Roman or civil laws all together into one code or digest lest through the rust of time and the fatality of all things committed to oral tradition they should be lost to the world for ever For this reason my father would oft times affirm there was not an oath from the great and tremendous oath of William the conqueror By the splendour of God down to the lowest oath of a scavenger Damn your eyes which was not to be found in Ernulphus In short he would add I defy a man to swear out of it The hypothesis is like most of my father s singular and ingenious too nor have I any objection to it but that it overturns my own Chapter two VI Bless my soul my poor mistress is ready to faint and her pains are gone and the drops are done and the bottle of julap is broke and the nurse has cut her arm and I my thumb cried doctor Slop and the child is where it was continued Susannah and the midwife has fallen backwards upon the edge of the fender and bruised her hip as black as your hat I ll look at it quoth doctor Slop There is no need of that replied Susannah you had better look at my mistress but the midwife would gladly first give you an account how things are so desires you would go up stairs and speak to her this moment Human nature is the same in all professions The midwife had just before been put over doctor Slop s head He had not digested it No replied doctor Slop twould be full as proper if the midwife came down to me I like subordination quoth my uncle Toby and but for it after the reduction of Lisle I know not what might have become of the garrison of Ghent in the mutiny for bread in the year Ten Nor replied doctor Slop parodying my uncle Toby s hobby horsical reflection though full as hobby horsical himself do I know Captain Shandy what might have become of the garrison above stairs in the mutiny and confusion I find all things are in at present but for the subordination of fingers and thumbs to the application of which Sir under this accident of mine comes in so a propos that without it the cut upon my thumb might have been felt by the Shandy family as long as the Shandy family had a name Chapter two VII Let us go back to the in the last chapter It is a singular stroke of eloquence at least it was so when eloquence flourished at Athens and Rome and would be so now did orators wear mantles not to mention the name of a thing when you had the thing about you in petto ready to produce pop in the place you want it A scar an axe a sword a pink d doublet a rusty helmet a pound and a half of pot ashes in an urn or a three halfpenny pickle pot but above all a tender infant royally accoutred Tho if it was too young and the oration as long as Tully s second Philippick it must certainly have beshit the orator s mantle And then again if too old it must have been unwieldly and incommodious to his action so as to make him lose by his child almost as much as he could gain by it Otherwise when a state orator has hit the precise age to a minute hid his Bambino in his mantle so cunningly that no mortal could smell it and produced it so critically that no soul could say it came in by head and shoulders Oh Sirs it has done wonders It has open d the sluices and turn d the brains and shook the principles and unhinged the politicks of half a nation These feats however are not to be done except in those states and times I say where orators wore mantles and pretty large ones too my brethren with some twenty or five and twenty yards of good purple superfine marketable cloth in them with large flowing folds and doubles and in a great style of design All which plainly shews may it please your worships that the decay of eloquence and the little good service it does at present both within and without doors is owing to nothing else in the world but short coats and the disuse of trunk hose We can conceal nothing under ours Madam worth shewing Chapter two VIII doctor Slop was within an ace of being an exception to all this argumentation for happening to have his green baize bag upon his knees when he began to parody my uncle Toby twas as good as the best mantle in the world to him for which purpose when he foresaw the sentence would end in his new invented forceps he thrust his hand into the bag in order to have them ready to clap in when your reverences took so much notice of the which had he managed my uncle Toby had certainly been overthrown the sentence and the argument in that case jumping closely in one point so like the two lines which form the salient angle of a ravelin doctor Slop would never have given them up and my uncle Toby would as soon have thought of flying as taking them by force but doctor Slop fumbled so vilely in pulling them out it took off the whole effect and what was a ten times worse evil for they seldom come alone in this life in pulling out his forceps his forceps unfortunately drew out the squirt along with it When a proposition can be taken in two senses tis a law in disputation That the respondent may reply to which of the two he pleases or finds most convenient for him This threw the advantage of the argument quite on my uncle Toby s side Good God cried my uncle Toby are children brought into the world with a squirt Chapter two IX Upon my honour Sir you have tore every bit of skin quite off the back of both my hands with your forceps cried my uncle Toby and you have crush d all my knuckles into the bargain with them to a jelly Tis your own fault said doctor Slop you should have clinch d your two fists together into the form of a child s head as I told you and sat firm I did so answered my uncle Toby Then the points of my forceps have not been sufficiently arm d or the rivet wants closing or else the cut on my thumb has made me a little aukward or possibly Tis well quoth my father interrupting the detail of possibilities that the experiment was not first made upon my child s head piece It would not have been a cherry stone the worse answered doctor Slop I maintain it said my uncle Toby it would have broke the cerebellum unless indeed the skull had been as hard as a granado and turn d it all into a perfect posset Pshaw replied doctor Slop a child s head is naturally as soft as the pap of an apple the sutures give way and besides I could have extracted by the feet after Not you said she I rather wish you would begin that way quoth my father Pray do added my uncle Toby Chapter two X And pray good woman after all will you take upon you to say it may not be the child s hip as well as the child s head Tis most certainly the head replied the midwife Because continued doctor Slop turning to my father as positive as these old ladies generally are tis a point very difficult to know and yet of the greatest consequence to be known because Sir if the hip is mistaken for the head there is a possibility if it is a boy that the forceps What the possibility was doctor Slop whispered very low to my father and then to my uncle Toby There is no such danger continued he with the head No in truth quoth my father but when your possibility has taken place at the hip you may as well take off the head too It is morally impossible the reader should understand this tis enough doctor Slop understood it so taking the green baize bag in his hand with the help of Obadiah s pumps he tripp d pretty nimbly for a man of his size across the room to the door and from the door was shewn the way by the good old midwife to my mother s apartments Chapter two XI It is two hours and ten minutes and no more cried my father looking at his watch since doctor Slop and Obadiah arrived and I know not how it happens Brother Toby but to my imagination it seems almost an age Here pray Sir take hold of my cap nay take the bell along with it and my pantoufles too Now Sir they are all at your service and I freely make you a present of em on condition you give me all your attention to this chapter Though my father said he knew not how it happen d yet he knew very well how it happen d and at the instant he spoke it was pre determined in his mind to give my uncle Toby a clear account of the matter by a metaphysical dissertation upon the subject of duration and its simple modes in order to shew my uncle Toby by what mechanism and mensurations in the brain it came to pass that the rapid succession of their ideas and the eternal scampering of the discourse from one thing to another since doctor Slop had come into the room had lengthened out so short a period to so inconceivable an extent I know not how it happens cried my father but it seems an age Tis owing entirely quoth my uncle Toby to the succession of our ideas My father who had an itch in common with all philosophers of reasoning upon every thing which happened and accounting for it too proposed infinite pleasure to himself in this of the succession of ideas and had not the least apprehension of having it snatch d out of his hands by my uncle Toby who honest man generally took every thing as it happened and who of all things in the world troubled his brain the least with abstruse thinking the ideas of time and space or how we came by those ideas or of what stuff they were made or whether they were born with us or we picked them up afterwards as we went along or whether we did it in frocks or not till we had got into breeches with a thousand other inquiries and disputes about Infinity Prescience Liberty Necessity and so forth upon whose desperate and unconquerable theories so many fine heads have been turned and cracked never did my uncle Toby s the least injury at all my father knew it and was no less surprized than he was disappointed with my uncle s fortuitous solution Do you understand the theory of that affair replied my father Not I quoth my uncle But you have some ideas said my father of what you talk about No more than my horse replied my uncle Toby Gracious heaven cried my father looking upwards and clasping his two hands together there is a worth in thy honest ignorance brother Toby twere almost a pity to exchange it for a knowledge But I ll tell thee To understand what time is aright without which we never can comprehend infinity insomuch as one is a portion of the other we ought seriously to sit down and consider what idea it is we have of duration so as to give a satisfactory account how we came by it What is that to any body quoth my uncle Toby Vide Locke For if you will turn your eyes inwards upon your mind continued my father and observe attentively you will perceive brother that whilst you and I are talking together and thinking and smoking our pipes or whilst we receive successively ideas in our minds we know that we do exist and so we estimate the existence or the continuation of the existence of ourselves or any thing else commensurate to the succession of any ideas in our minds the duration of ourselves or any such other thing company existing with our thinking and so according to that preconceived You puzzle me to death cried my uncle Toby Tis owing to this replied my father that in our computations of time we are so used to minutes hours weeks and months and of clocks I wish there was not a clock in the kingdom to measure out their several portions to us and to those who belong to us that twill be well if in time to come the succession of our ideas be of any use or service to us at all Now whether we observe it or no continued my father in every sound man s head there is a regular succession of ideas of one sort or other which follow each other in train just like A train of artillery said my uncle Toby A train of a fiddle stick quoth my father which follow and succeed one another in our minds at certain distances just like the images in the inside of a lanthorn turned round by the heat of a candle I declare quoth my uncle Toby mine are more like a smoke jack Then brother Toby I have nothing more to say to you upon that subject said my father Chapter two XII What a conjuncture was here lost My father in one of his best explanatory moods in eager pursuit of a metaphysical point into the very regions where clouds and thick darkness would soon have encompassed it about my uncle Toby in one of the finest dispositions for it in the world his head like a smoke jack the funnel unswept and the ideas whirling round and round about in it all obfuscated and darkened over with fuliginous matter By the tomb stone of Lucian if it is in being if not why then by his ashes by the ashes of my dear Rabelais and dearer Cervantes my father and my uncle Toby s discourse upon Time and Eternity was a discourse devoutly to be wished for and the petulancy of my father s humour in putting a stop to it as he did was a robbery of the Ontologic Treasury of such a jewel as no coalition of great occasions and great men are ever likely to restore to it again Chapter two XIII Tho my father persisted in not going on with the discourse yet he could not get my uncle Toby s smoke jack out of his head piqued as he was at first with it there was something in the comparison at the bottom which hit his fancy for which purpose resting his elbow upon the table and reclining the right side of his head upon the palm of his hand but looking first stedfastly in the fire he began to commune with himself and philosophize about it but his spirits being wore out with the fatigues of investigating new tracts and the constant exertion of his faculties upon that variety of subjects which had taken their turn in the discourse the idea of the smoke jack soon turned all his ideas upside down so that he fell asleep almost before he knew what he was about As for my uncle Toby his smoke jack had not made a dozen revolutions before he fell asleep also Peace be with them both doctor Slop is engaged with the midwife and my mother above stairs Trim is busy in turning an old pair of jack boots into a couple of mortars to be employed in the siege of Messina next summer and is this instant boring the touch holes with the point of a hot poker All my heroes are off my hands tis the first time I have had a moment to spare and I ll make use of it and write my preface The Author s Preface No I ll not say a word about it here it is in publishing it I have appealed to the world and to the world I leave it it must speak for itself All I know of the matter is when I sat down my intent was to write a good book and as far as the tenuity of my understanding would hold out a wise aye and a discreet taking care only as I went along to put into it all the wit and the judgment be it more or less which the great Author and Bestower of them had thought fit originally to give me so that as your worships see tis just as God pleases Now Agalastes speaking dispraisingly sayeth That there may be some wit in it for aught he knows but no judgment at all And Triptolemus and Phutatorius agreeing thereto ask How is it possible there should for that wit and judgment in this world never go together inasmuch as they are two operations differing from each other as wide as east from west So says Locke so are farting and hickuping say I But in answer to this Didius the great church lawyer in his code de fartendi et illustrandi fallaciis doth maintain and make fully appear That an illustration is no argument nor do I maintain the wiping of a looking glass clean to be a syllogism but you all may it please your worships see the better for it so that the main good these things do is only to clarify the understanding previous to the application of the argument itself in order to free it from any little motes or specks of opacular matter which if left swimming therein might hinder a conception and spoil all Now my dear anti Shandeans and thrice able criticks and fellow labourers for to you I write this Preface and to you most subtle statesmen and discreet doctors do pull off your beards renowned for gravity and wisdom Monopolus my politician Didius my counsel Kysarcius my friend Phutatorius my guide Gastripheres the preserver of my life Somnolentius the balm and repose of it not forgetting all others as well sleeping as waking ecclesiastical as civil whom for brevity but out of no resentment to you I lump all together Believe me right worthy My most zealous wish and fervent prayer in your behalf and in my own too in case the thing is not done already for us is that the great gifts and endowments both of wit and judgment with every thing which usually goes along with them such as memory fancy genius eloquence quick parts and what not may this precious moment without stint or measure let or hindrance be poured down warm as each of us could bear it scum and sediment and all for I would not have a drop lost into the several receptacles cells cellules domiciles dormitories refectories and spare places of our brains in such sort that they might continue to be injected and tunn d into according to the true intent and meaning of my wish until every vessel of them both great and small be so replenish d saturated and filled up therewith that no more would it save a man s life could possibly be got either in or out Bless us what noble work we should make how should I tickle it off and what spirits should I find myself in to be writing away for such readers and you just heaven with what raptures would you sit and read but oh tis too much I am sick I faint away deliciously at the thoughts of it tis more than nature can bear lay hold of me I am giddy I am stone blind I m dying I am gone Help Help Help But hold I grow something better again for I am beginning to foresee when this is over that as we shall all of us continue to be great wits we should never agree amongst ourselves one day to an end there would be so much satire and sarcasm scoffing and flouting with raillying and reparteeing of it thrusting and parrying in one corner or another there would be nothing but mischief among us Chaste stars what biting and scratching and what a racket and a clatter we should make what with breaking of heads rapping of knuckles and hitting of sore places there would be no such thing as living for us But then again as we should all of us be men of great judgment we should make up matters as fast as ever they went wrong and though we should abominate each other ten times worse than so many devils or devilesses we should nevertheless my dear creatures be all courtesy and kindness milk and honey twould be a second land of promise a paradise upon earth if there was such a thing to be had so that upon the whole we should have done well enough All I fret and fume at and what most distresses my invention at present is how to bring the point itself to bear for as your worships well know that of these heavenly emanations of wit and judgment which I have so bountifully wished both for your worships and myself there is but a certain quantum stored up for us all for the use and behoof of the whole race of mankind and such small modicums of em are only sent forth into this wide world circulating here and there in one bye corner or another and in such narrow streams and at such prodigious intervals from each other that one would wonder how it holds out or could be sufficient for the wants and emergencies of so many great estates and populous empires Indeed there is one thing to be considered that in Nova Zembla North Lapland and in all those cold and dreary tracks of the globe which lie more directly under the arctick and antartick circles where the whole province of a man s concernments lies for near nine months together within the narrow compass of his cave where the spirits are compressed almost to nothing and where the passions of a man with every thing which belongs to them are as frigid as the zone itself there the least quantity of judgment imaginable does the business and of wit there is a total and an absolute saving for as not one spark is wanted so not one spark is given Angels and ministers of grace defend us what a dismal thing would it have been to have governed a kingdom to have fought a battle or made a treaty or run a match or wrote a book or got a child or held a provincial chapter there with so plentiful a lack of wit and judgment about us For mercy s sake let us think no more about it but travel on as fast as we can southwards into Norway crossing over Swedeland if you please through the small triangular province of Angermania to the lake of Bothmia coasting along it through east and west Bothnia down to Carelia and so on through all those states and provinces which border upon the far side of the Gulf of Finland and the north east of the Baltick up to Petersbourg and just stepping into Ingria then stretching over directly from thence through the north parts of the Russian empire leaving Siberia a little upon the left hand till we got into the very heart of Russian and Asiatick Tartary Now through this long tour which I have led you you observe the good people are better off by far than in the polar countries which we have just left for if you hold your hand over your eyes and look very attentively you may perceive some small glimmerings as it were of wit with a comfortable provision of good plain houshold judgment which taking the quality and quantity of it together they make a very good shift with and had they more of either the one or the other it would destroy the proper balance betwixt them and I am satisfied moreover they would want occasions to put them to use Now Sir if I conduct you home again into this warmer and more luxuriant island where you perceive the spring tide of our blood and humours runs high where we have more ambition and pride and envy and lechery and other whoreson passions upon our hands to govern and subject to reason the height of our wit and the depth of our judgment you see are exactly proportioned to the length and breadth of our necessities and accordingly we have them sent down amongst us in such a flowing kind of decent and creditable plenty that no one thinks he has any cause to complain It must however be confessed on this head that as our air blows hot and cold wet and dry ten times in a day we have them in no regular and settled way so that sometimes for near half a century together there shall be very little wit or judgment either to be seen or heard of amongst us the small channels of them shall seem quite dried up then all of a sudden the sluices shall break out and take a fit of running again like fury you would think they would never stop and then it is that in writing and fighting and twenty other gallant things we drive all the world before us It is by these observations and a wary reasoning by analogy in that kind of argumentative process which Suidas calls dialectick induction that I draw and set up this position as most true and veritable That of these two luminaries so much of their irradiations are suffered from time to time to shine down upon us as he whose infinite wisdom which dispenses every thing in exact weight and measure knows will just serve to light us on our way in this night of our obscurity so that your reverences and worships now find out nor is it a moment longer in my power to conceal it from you That the fervent wish in your behalf with which I set out was no more than the first insinuating How d ye of a caressing prefacer stifling his reader as a lover sometimes does a coy mistress into silence For alas could this effusion of light have been as easily procured as the exordium wished it I tremble to think how many thousands for it of benighted travellers in the learned sciences at least must have groped and blundered on in the dark all the nights of their lives running their heads against posts and knocking out their brains without ever getting to their journies end some falling with their noses perpendicularly into sinks others horizontally with their tails into kennels Here one half of a learned profession tilting full but against the other half of it and then tumbling and rolling one over the other in the dirt like hogs Here the brethren of another profession who should have run in opposition to each other flying on the contrary like a flock of wild geese all in a row the same way What confusion what mistakes fiddlers and painters judging by their eyes and ears admirable trusting to the passions excited in an air sung or a story painted to the heart instead of measuring them by a quadrant In the fore ground of this picture a statesman turning the political wheel like a brute the wrong way round against the stream of corruption by Heaven instead of with it In this corner a son of the divine Esculapius writing a book against predestination perhaps worse feeling his patient s pulse instead of his apothecary s a brother of the Faculty in the back ground upon his knees in tears drawing the curtains of a mangled victim to beg his forgiveness offering a fee instead of taking one In that spacious Hall a coalition of the gown from all the bars of it driving a damn d dirty vexatious cause before them with all their might and main the wrong way kicking it out of the great doors instead of in and with such fury in their looks and such a degree of inveteracy in their manner of kicking it as if the laws had been originally made for the peace and preservation of mankind perhaps a more enormous mistake committed by them still a litigated point fairly hung up for instance Whether John o Nokes his nose could stand in Tom o Stiles his face without a trespass or not rashly determined by them in five and twenty minutes which with the cautious pros and cons required in so intricate a proceeding might have taken up as many months and if carried on upon a military plan as your honours know an Action should be with all the stratagems practicable therein such as feints forced marches surprizes ambuscades mask batteries and a thousand other strokes of generalship which consist in catching at all advantages on both sides might reasonably have lasted them as many years finding food and raiment all that term for a centumvirate of the profession As for the Clergy No if I say a word against them I ll be shot I have no desire and besides if I had I durst not for my soul touch upon the subject with such weak nerves and spirits and in the condition I am in at present twould be as much as my life was worth to deject and contrist myself with so bad and melancholy an account and therefore tis safer to draw a curtain across and hasten from it as fast as I can to the main and principal point I have undertaken to clear up and that is How it comes to pass that your men of least wit are reported to be men of most judgment But mark I say reported to be for it is no more my dear Sirs than a report and which like twenty others taken up every day upon trust I maintain to be a vile and a malicious report into the bargain This by the help of the observation already premised and I hope already weighed and perpended by your reverences and worships I shall forthwith make appear I hate set dissertations and above all things in the world tis one of the silliest things in one of them to darken your hypothesis by placing a number of tall opake words one before another in a right line betwixt your own and your reader s conception when in all likelihood if you had looked about you might have seen something standing or hanging up which would have cleared the point at once for what hindrance hurt or harm doth the laudable desire of knowledge bring to any man if even from a sot a pot a fool a stool a winter mittain a truckle for a pully the lid of a goldsmith s crucible an oil bottle an old slipper or a cane chair I am this moment sitting upon one Will you give me leave to illustrate this affair of wit and judgment by the two knobs on the top of the back of it they are fastened on you see with two pegs stuck slightly into two gimlet holes and will place what I have to say in so clear a light as to let you see through the drift and meaning of my whole preface as plainly as if every point and particle of it was made up of sun beams I enter now directly upon the point Here stands wit and there stands judgment close beside it just like the two knobs I m speaking of upon the back of this self same chair on which I am sitting You see they are the highest and most ornamental parts of its frame as wit and judgment are of ours and like them too indubitably both made and fitted to go together in order as we say in all such cases of duplicated embellishments to answer one another Now for the sake of an experiment and for the clearer illustrating this matter let us for a moment take off one of these two curious ornaments I care not which from the point or pinnacle of the chair it now stands on nay don t laugh at it but did you ever see in the whole course of your lives such a ridiculous business as this has made of it Why tis as miserable a sight as a sow with one ear and there is just as much sense and symmetry in the one as in the other do pray get off your seats only to take a view of it Now would any man who valued his character a straw have turned a piece of work out of his hand in such a condition nay lay your hands upon your hearts and answer this plain question Whether this one single knob which now stands here like a blockhead by itself can serve any purpose upon earth but to put one in mind of the want of the other and let me farther ask in case the chair was your own if you would not in your consciences think rather than be as it is that it would be ten times better without any knob at all Now these two knobs or top ornaments of the mind of man which crown the whole entablature being as I said wit and judgment which of all others as I have proved it are the most needful the most priz d the most calamitous to be without and consequently the hardest to come at for all these reasons put together there is not a mortal among us so destitute of a love of good fame or feeding or so ignorant of what will do him good therein who does not wish and stedfastly resolve in his own mind to be or to be thought at least master of the one or the other and indeed of both of them if the thing seems any way feasible or likely to be brought to pass Now your graver gentry having little or no kind of chance in aiming at the one unless they laid hold of the other pray what do you think would become of them Why Sirs in spite of all their gravities they must e en have been contented to have gone with their insides naked this was not to be borne but by an effort of philosophy not to be supposed in the case we are upon so that no one could well have been angry with them had they been satisfied with what little they could have snatched up and secreted under their cloaks and great perriwigs had they not raised a hue and cry at the same time against the lawful owners I need not tell your worships that this was done with so much cunning and artifice that the great Locke who was seldom outwitted by false sounds was nevertheless bubbled here The cry it seems was so deep and solemn a one and what with the help of great wigs grave faces and other implements of deceit was rendered so general a one against the poor wits in this matter that the philosopher himself was deceived by it it was his glory to free the world from the lumber of a thousand vulgar errors but this was not of the number so that instead of sitting down coolly as such a philosopher should have done to have examined the matter of fact before he philosophised upon it on the contrary he took the fact for granted and so joined in with the cry and halloo d it as boisterously as the rest This has been made the Magna Charta of stupidity ever since but your reverences plainly see it has been obtained in such a manner that the title to it is not worth a groat which by the bye is one of the many and vile impositions which gravity and grave folks have to answer for hereafter As for great wigs upon which I may be thought to have spoken my mind too freely I beg leave to qualify whatever has been unguardedly said to their dispraise or prejudice by one general declaration That I have no abhorrence whatever nor do I detest and abjure either great wigs or long beards any farther than when I see they are bespoke and let grow on purpose to carry on this self same imposture for any purpose peace be with them mark only I write not for them Chapter two XIV Every day for at least ten years together did my father resolve to have it mended tis not mended yet no family but ours would have borne with it an hour and what is most astonishing there was not a subject in the world upon which my father was so eloquent as upon that of door hinges And yet at the same time he was certainly one of the greatest bubbles to them I think that history can produce his rhetorick and conduct were at perpetual handy cuffs Never did the parlour door open but his philosophy or his principles fell a victim to it three drops of oil with a feather and a smart stroke of a hammer had saved his honour for ever Inconsistent soul that man is languishing under wounds which he has the power to heal his whole life a contradiction to his knowledge his reason that precious gift of God to him instead of pouring in oil serving but to sharpen his sensibilities to multiply his pains and render him more melancholy and uneasy under them Poor unhappy creature that he should do so Are not the necessary causes of misery in this life enow but he must add voluntary ones to his stock of sorrow struggle against evils which cannot be avoided and submit to others which a tenth part of the trouble they create him would remove from his heart for ever By all that is good and virtuous if there are three drops of oil to be got and a hammer to be found within ten miles of Shandy Hall the parlour door hinge shall be mended this reign Chapter two XV When Corporal Trim had brought his two mortars to bear he was delighted with his handy work above measure and knowing what a pleasure it would be to his master to see them he was not able to resist the desire he had of carrying them directly into his parlour Now next to the moral lesson I had in view in mentioning the affair of hinges I had a speculative consideration arising out of it and it is this Had the parlour door opened and turn d upon its hinges as a door should do Or for example as cleverly as our government has been turning upon its hinges that is in case things have all along gone well with your worship otherwise I give up my simile in this case I say there had been no danger either to master or man in corporal Trim s peeping in the moment he had beheld my father and my uncle Toby fast asleep the respectfulness of his carriage was such he would have retired as silent as death and left them both in their arm chairs dreaming as happy as he had found them but the thing was morally speaking so very impracticable that for the many years in which this hinge was suffered to be out of order and amongst the hourly grievances my father submitted to upon its account this was one that he never folded his arms to take his nap after dinner but the thoughts of being unavoidably awakened by the first person who should open the door was always uppermost in his imagination and so incessantly stepp d in betwixt him and the first balmy presage of his repose as to rob him as he often declared of the whole sweets of it When things move upon bad hinges an please your lordships how can it be otherwise Pray what s the matter Who is there cried my father waking the moment the door began to creak I wish the smith would give a peep at that confounded hinge Tis nothing an please your honour said Trim but two mortars I am bringing in They shan t make a clatter with them here cried my father hastily If doctor Slop has any drugs to pound let him do it in the kitchen May it please your honour cried Trim they are two mortar pieces for a siege next summer which I have been making out of a pair of jack boots which Obadiah told me your honour had left off wearing By Heaven cried my father springing out of his chair as he swore I have not one appointment belonging to me which I set so much store by as I do by these jack boots they were our great grandfather s brother Toby they were hereditary Then I fear quoth my uncle Toby Trim has cut off the entail I have only cut off the tops an please your honour cried Trim I hate perpetuities as much as any man alive cried my father but these jack boots continued he smiling though very angry at the same time have been in the family brother ever since the civil wars Sir Roger Shandy wore them at the battle of Marston Moor I declare I would not have taken ten pounds for them I ll pay you the money brother Shandy quoth my uncle Toby looking at the two mortars with infinite pleasure and putting his hand into his breeches pocket as he viewed them I ll pay you the ten pounds this moment with all my heart and soul Brother Toby replied my father altering his tone you care not what money you dissipate and throw away provided continued he tis but upon a Siege Have I not one hundred and twenty pounds a year besides my half pay cried my uncle Toby What is that replied my father hastily to ten pounds for a pair of jack boots twelve guineas for your pontoons half as much for your Dutch draw bridge to say nothing of the train of little brass artillery you bespoke last week with twenty other preparations for the siege of Messina believe me dear brother Toby continued my father taking him kindly by the hand these military operations of yours are above your strength you mean well brother but they carry you into greater expences than you were first aware of and take my word dear Toby they will in the end quite ruin your fortune and make a beggar of you What signifies it if they do brother replied my uncle Toby so long as we know tis for the good of the nation My father could not help smiling for his soul his anger at the worst was never more than a spark and the zeal and simplicity of Trim and the generous though hobby horsical gallantry of my uncle Toby brought him into perfect good humour with them in an instant Generous souls God prosper you both and your mortar pieces too quoth my father to himself Chapter two XVI All is quiet and hush cried my father at least above stairs I hear not one foot stirring Prithee Trim who s in the kitchen There is no one soul in the kitchen answered Trim making a low bow as he spoke except doctor Slop Confusion cried my father getting upon his legs a second time not one single thing has gone right this day had I faith in astrology brother which by the bye my father had I would have sworn some retrograde planet was hanging over this unfortunate house of mine and turning every individual thing in it out of its place Why I thought doctor Slop had been above stairs with my wife and so said you What can the fellow be puzzling about in the kitchen He is busy an please your honour replied Trim in making a bridge Tis very obliging in him quoth my uncle Toby pray give my humble service to doctor Slop Trim and tell him I thank him heartily You must know my uncle Toby mistook the bridge as widely as my father mistook the mortars but to understand how my uncle Toby could mistake the bridge I fear I must give you an exact account of the road which led to it or to drop my metaphor for there is nothing more dishonest in an historian than the use of one in order to conceive the probability of this error in my uncle Toby aright I must give you some account of an adventure of Trim s though much against my will I say much against my will only because the story in one sense is certainly out of its place here for by right it should come in either amongst the anecdotes of my uncle Toby s amours with widow Wadman in which corporal Trim was no mean actor or else in the middle of his and my uncle Toby s campaigns on the bowling green for it will do very well in either place but then if I reserve it for either of those parts of my story I ruin the story I m upon and if I tell it here I anticipate matters and ruin it there What would your worship have me to do in this case Tell it mister Shandy by all means You are a fool Tristram if you do O ye powers for powers ye are and great ones too which enable mortal man to tell a story worth the hearing that kindly shew him where he is to begin it and where he is to end it what he is to put into it and what he is to leave out how much of it he is to cast into a shade and whereabouts he is to throw his light Ye who preside over this vast empire of biographical freebooters and see how many scrapes and plunges your subjects hourly fall into will you do one thing I beg and beseech you in case you will do nothing better for us that wherever in any part of your dominions it so falls out that three several roads meet in one point as they have done just here that at least you set up a guide post in the centre of them in mere charity to direct an uncertain devil which of the three he is to take Chapter two XVII Tho the shock my uncle Toby received the year after the demolition of Dunkirk in his affair with widow Wadman had fixed him in a resolution never more to think of the sex or of aught which belonged to it yet corporal Trim had made no such bargain with himself Indeed in my uncle Toby s case there was a strange and unaccountable concurrence of circumstances which insensibly drew him in to lay siege to that fair and strong citadel In Trim s case there was a concurrence of nothing in the world but of him and Bridget in the kitchen though in truth the love and veneration he bore his master was such and so fond was he of imitating him in all he did that had my uncle Toby employed his time and genius in tagging of points I am persuaded the honest corporal would have laid down his arms and followed his example with pleasure When therefore my uncle Toby sat down before the mistress corporal Trim incontinently took ground before the maid Now my dear friend Garrick whom I have so much cause to esteem and honour why or wherefore tis no matter can it escape your penetration I defy it that so many play wrights and opificers of chit chat have ever since been working upon Trim s and my uncle Toby s pattern I care not what Aristotle or Pacuvius or Bossu or Ricaboni say though I never read one of them there is not a greater difference between a single horse chair and madam Pompadour s vis a vis than betwixt a single amour and an amour thus nobly doubled and going upon all four prancing throughout a grand drama Sir a simple single silly affair of that kind is quite lost in five acts but that is neither here nor there After a series of attacks and repulses in a course of nine months on my uncle Toby s quarter a most minute account of every particular of which shall be given in its proper place my uncle Toby honest man found it necessary to draw off his forces and raise the siege somewhat indignantly Corporal Trim as I said had made no such bargain either with himself or with any one else the fidelity however of his heart not suffering him to go into a house which his master had forsaken with disgust he contented himself with turning his part of the siege into a blockade that is he kept others off for though he never after went to the house yet he never met Bridget in the village but he would either nod or wink or smile or look kindly at her or as circumstances directed he would shake her by the hand or ask her lovingly how she did or would give her a ribbon and now and then though never but when it could be done with decorum would give Bridget a Precisely in this situation did these things stand for five years that is from the demolition of Dunkirk in the year thirteen to the latter end of my uncle Toby s campaign in the year eighteen which was about six or seven weeks before the time I m speaking of When Trim as his custom was after he had put my uncle Toby to bed going down one moon shiny night to see that every thing was right at his fortifications in the lane separated from the bowling green with flowering shrubs and holly he espied his Bridget As the corporal thought there was nothing in the world so well worth shewing as the glorious works which he and my uncle Toby had made Trim courteously and gallantly took her by the hand and led her in this was not done so privately but that the foul mouth d trumpet of Fame carried it from ear to ear till at length it reach d my father s with this untoward circumstance along with it that my uncle Toby s curious draw bridge constructed and painted after the Dutch fashion and which went quite across the ditch was broke down and somehow or other crushed all to pieces that very night My father as you have observed had no great esteem for my uncle Toby s hobby horse he thought it the most ridiculous horse that ever gentleman mounted and indeed unless my uncle Toby vexed him about it could never think of it once without smiling at it so that it could never get lame or happen any mischance but it tickled my father s imagination beyond measure but this being an accident much more to his humour than any one which had yet befall n it it proved an inexhaustible fund of entertainment to him Well but dear Toby my father would say do tell me seriously how this affair of the bridge happened How can you teaze me so much about it my uncle Toby would reply I have told it you twenty times word for word as Trim told it me Prithee how was it then corporal my father would cry turning to Trim It was a mere misfortune an please your honour I was shewing missus Bridget our fortifications and in going too near the edge of the fosse I unfortunately slipp d in Very well Trim my father would cry smiling mysteriously and giving a nod but without interrupting him and being link d fast an please your honour arm in arm with missus Bridget I dragg d her after me by means of which she fell backwards soss against the bridge and Trim s foot my uncle Toby would cry taking the story out of his mouth getting into the cuvette he tumbled full against the bridge too It was a thousand to one my uncle Toby would add that the poor fellow did not break his leg Ay truly my father would say a limb is soon broke brother Toby in such encounters And so an please your honour the bridge which your honour knows was a very slight one was broke down betwixt us and splintered all to pieces At other times but especially when my uncle Toby was so unfortunate as to say a syllable about cannons bombs or petards my father would exhaust all the stores of his eloquence which indeed were very great in a panegyric upon the Battering Rams of the ancients the Vinea which Alexander made use of at the siege of Troy He would tell my uncle Toby of the Catapultae of the Syrians which threw such monstrous stones so many hundred feet and shook the strongest bulwarks from their very foundation he would go on and describe the wonderful mechanism of the Ballista which Marcellinus makes so much rout about the terrible effects of the Pyraboli which cast fire the danger of the Terebra and Scorpio which cast javelins But what are these would he say to the destructive machinery of corporal Trim Believe me brother Toby no bridge or bastion or sally port that ever was constructed in this world can hold out against such artillery My uncle Toby would never attempt any defence against the force of this ridicule but that of redoubling the vehemence of smoaking his pipe in doing which he raised so dense a vapour one night after supper that it set my father who was a little phthisical into a suffocating fit of violent coughing my uncle Toby leap d up without feeling the pain upon his groin and with infinite pity stood beside his brother s chair tapping his back with one hand and holding his head with the other and from time to time wiping his eyes with a clean cambrick handkerchief which he pulled out of his pocket The affectionate and endearing manner in which my uncle Toby did these little offices cut my father thro his reins for the pain he had just been giving him May my brains be knock d out with a battering ram or a catapulta I care not which quoth my father to himself if ever I insult this worthy soul more Chapter two XVIII The draw bridge being held irreparable Trim was ordered directly to set about another but not upon the same model for cardinal Alberoni s intrigues at that time being discovered and my uncle Toby rightly foreseeing that a flame would inevitably break out betwixt Spain and the Empire and that the operations of the ensuing campaign must in all likelihood be either in Naples or Sicily he determined upon an Italian bridge my uncle Toby by the bye was not far out of his conjectures but my father who was infinitely the better politician and took the lead as far of my uncle Toby in the cabinet as my uncle Toby took it of him in the field convinced him that if the king of Spain and the Emperor went together by the ears England and France and Holland must by force of their pre engagements all enter the lists too and if so he would say the combatants brother Toby as sure as we are alive will fall to it again pell mell upon the old prize fighting stage of Flanders then what will you do with your Italian bridge We will go on with it then upon the old model cried my uncle Toby When corporal Trim had about half finished it in that style my uncle Toby found out a capital defect in it which he had never thoroughly considered before It turned it seems upon hinges at both ends of it opening in the middle one half of which turning to one side of the fosse and the other to the other the advantage of which was this that by dividing the weight of the bridge into two equal portions it impowered my uncle Toby to raise it up or let it down with the end of his crutch and with one hand which as his garrison was weak was as much as he could well spare but the disadvantages of such a construction were insurmountable for by this means he would say I leave one half of my bridge in my enemy s possession and pray of what use is the other The natural remedy for this was no doubt to have his bridge fast only at one end with hinges so that the whole might be lifted up together and stand bolt upright but that was rejected for the reason given above For a whole week after he was determined in his mind to have one of that particular construction which is made to draw back horizontally to hinder a passage and to thrust forwards again to gain a passage of which sorts your worship might have seen three famous ones at Spires before its destruction and one now at Brisac if I mistake not but my father advising my uncle Toby with great earnestness to have nothing more to do with thrusting bridges and my uncle foreseeing moreover that it would but perpetuate the memory of the Corporal s misfortune he changed his mind for that of the marquis d Hopital s invention which the younger Bernouilli has so well and learnedly described as your worships may see Act Erud Lips an sixteen ninety five to these a lead weight is an eternal balance and keeps watch as well as a couple of centinels inasmuch as the construction of them was a curve line approximating to a cycloid if not a cycloid itself My uncle Toby understood the nature of a parabola as well as any man in England but was not quite such a master of the cycloid he talked however about it every day the bridge went not forwards We ll ask somebody about it cried my uncle Toby to Trim Chapter two XIX When Trim came in and told my father that doctor Slop was in the kitchen and busy in making a bridge my uncle Toby the affair of the jack boots having just then raised a train of military ideas in his brain took it instantly for granted that doctor Slop was making a model of the marquis d Hopital s bridge tis very obliging in him quoth my uncle Toby pray give my humble service to doctor Slop Trim and tell him I thank him heartily Had my uncle Toby s head been a Savoyard s box and my father peeping in all the time at one end of it it could not have given him a more distinct conception of the operations of my uncle Toby s imagination than what he had so notwithstanding the catapulta and battering ram and his bitter imprecation about them he was just beginning to triumph When Trim s answer in an instant tore the laurel from his brows and twisted it to pieces Chapter two XX This unfortunate draw bridge of yours quoth my father God bless your honour cried Trim tis a bridge for master s nose In bringing him into the world with his vile instruments he has crushed his nose Susannah says as flat as a pancake to his face and he is making a false bridge with a piece of cotton and a thin piece of whalebone out of Susannah s stays to raise it up Lead me brother Toby cried my father to my room this instant Chapter two XXI From the first moment I sat down to write my life for the amusement of the world and my opinions for its instruction has a cloud insensibly been gathering over my father A tide of little evils and distresses has been setting in against him Not one thing as he observed himself has gone right and now is the storm thicken d and going to break and pour down full upon his head I enter upon this part of my story in the most pensive and melancholy frame of mind that ever sympathetic breast was touched with My nerves relax as I tell it Every line I write I feel an abatement of the quickness of my pulse and of that careless alacrity with it which every day of my life prompts me to say and write a thousand things I should not And this moment that I last dipp d my pen into my ink I could not help taking notice what a cautious air of sad composure and solemnity there appear d in my manner of doing it Lord how different from the rash jerks and hair brain d squirts thou art wont Tristram to transact it with in other humours dropping thy pen spurting thy ink about thy table and thy books as if thy pen and thy ink thy books and furniture cost thee nothing Chapter two XXII I won t go about to argue the point with you tis so and I am persuaded of it madam as much as can be That both man and woman bear pain or sorrow and for aught I know pleasure too best in a horizontal position The moment my father got up into his chamber he threw himself prostrate across his bed in the wildest disorder imaginable but at the same time in the most lamentable attitude of a man borne down with sorrows that ever the eye of pity dropp d a tear for The palm of his right hand as he fell upon the bed receiving his forehead and covering the greatest part of both his eyes gently sunk down with his head his elbow giving way backwards till his nose touch d the quilt his left arm hung insensible over the side of the bed his knuckles reclining upon the handle of the chamber pot which peep d out beyond the valance his right leg his left being drawn up towards his body hung half over the side of the bed the edge of it pressing upon his shin bone He felt it not A fix d inflexible sorrow took possession of every line of his face He sigh d once heaved his breast often but uttered not a word An old set stitch d chair valanced and fringed around with party coloured worsted bobs stood at the bed s head opposite to the side where my father s head reclined My uncle Toby sat him down in it Before an affliction is digested consolation ever comes too soon and after it is digested it comes too late so that you see madam there is but a mark between these two as fine almost as a hair for a comforter to take aim at my uncle Toby was always either on this side or on that of it and would often say he believed in his heart he could as soon hit the longitude for this reason when he sat down in the chair he drew the curtain a little forwards and having a tear at every one s service he pull d out a cambrick handkerchief gave a low sigh but held his peace Chapter two XXIII All is not gain that is got into the purse So that notwithstanding my father had the happiness of reading the oddest books in the universe and had moreover in himself the oddest way of thinking that ever man in it was bless d with yet it had this drawback upon him after all that it laid him open to some of the oddest and most whimsical distresses of which this particular one which he sunk under at present is as strong an example as can be given No doubt the breaking down of the bridge of a child s nose by the edge of a pair of forceps however scientifically applied would vex any man in the world who was at so much pains in begetting a child as my father was yet it will not account for the extravagance of his affliction nor will it justify the un christian manner he abandoned and surrendered himself up to To explain this I must leave him upon the bed for half an hour and my uncle Toby in his old fringed chair sitting beside him Chapter two XXIV I think it a very unreasonable demand cried my great grandfather twisting up the paper and throwing it upon the table By this account madam you have but two thousand pounds fortune and not a shilling more and you insist upon having three hundred pounds a year jointure for it Because replied my great grandmother you have little or no nose Sir Now before I venture to make use of the word Nose a second time to avoid all confusion in what will be said upon it in this interesting part of my story it may not be amiss to explain my own meaning and define with all possible exactness and precision what I would willingly be understood to mean by the term being of opinion that tis owing to the negligence and perverseness of writers in despising this precaution and to nothing else that all the polemical writings in divinity are not as clear and demonstrative as those upon a Will o the Wisp or any other sound part of philosophy and natural pursuit in order to which what have you to do before you set out unless you intend to go puzzling on to the day of judgment but to give the world a good definition and stand to it of the main word you have most occasion for changing it Sir as you would a guinea into small coin which done let the father of confusion puzzle you if he can or put a different idea either into your head or your reader s head if he knows how In books of strict morality and close reasoning such as I am engaged in the neglect is inexcusable and Heaven is witness how the world has revenged itself upon me for leaving so many openings to equivocal strictures and for depending so much as I have done all along upon the cleanliness of my readers imaginations Here are two senses cried Eugenius as we walk d along pointing with the fore finger of his right hand to the word Crevice in the one hundred and seventy eighth page of the first volume of this book of books here are two senses quoth he And here are two roads replied I turning short upon him a dirty and a clean one which shall we take The clean by all means replied Eugenius Eugenius said I stepping before him and laying my hand upon his breast to define is to distrust Thus I triumph d over Eugenius but I triumph d over him as I always do like a fool Tis my comfort however I am not an obstinate one therefore I define a nose as follows intreating only beforehand and beseeching my readers both male and female of what age complexion and condition soever for the love of God and their own souls to guard against the temptations and suggestions of the devil and suffer him by no art or wile to put any other ideas into their minds than what I put into my definition For by the word Nose throughout all this long chapter of noses and in every other part of my work where the word Nose occurs I declare by that word I mean a nose and nothing more or less Chapter two XXV Because quoth my great grandmother repeating the words again you have little or no nose Sir S death cried my great grandfather clapping his hand upon his nose tis not so small as that comes to tis a full inch longer than my father s Now my great grandfather s nose was for all the world like unto the noses of all the men women and children whom Pantagruel found dwelling upon the island of Ennasin By the way if you would know the strange way of getting a kin amongst so flat nosed a people you must read the book find it out yourself you never can

3699_175950_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 My great grandfather was convinced He untwisted the paper and signed the article

3699_175950_000008_000000	train-clean-100	My father replied my grandfather had no more nose my dear saving the mark than there is upon the back of my hand 
3699_175950_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 Now you must know that my great grandmother outlived my grandfather twelve years so that my father had the jointure to pay a hundred and fifty pounds half yearly on Michaelmas and Lady day during all that time 
none	none	No man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than my father And as far as a hundred pounds went he would fling it upon the table guinea by guinea with that spirited jerk of an honest welcome which generous souls and generous souls only are able to fling down money but as soon as ever he enter d upon the odd fifty he generally gave a loud Hem rubb d the side of his nose leisurely with the flat part of his fore finger inserted his hand cautiously betwixt his head and the cawl of his wig look d at both sides of every guinea as he parted with it and seldom could get to the end of the fifty pounds without pulling out his handkerchief and wiping his temples 
3699_175950_000011_000000	train-clean-100	Defend me gracious Heaven from those persecuting spirits who make no allowances for these workings within us Never O never may I lay down in their tents who cannot relax the engine and feel pity for the force of education and the prevalence of opinions long derived from ancestors 
none	none	For three generations at least this tenet in favour of long noses had gradually been taking root in our family Tradition was all along on its side and Interest was every half year stepping in to strengthen it so that the whimsicality of my father s brain was far from having the whole honour of this as it had of almost all his other strange notions For in a great measure he might be said to have suck d this in with his mother s milk 
3699_175950_000012_000001	train-clean-100	He did his part however If education planted the mistake in case it was one my father watered it and ripened it to perfection 
none	none	He would often declare in speaking his thoughts upon the subject that he did not conceive how the greatest family in England could stand it out against an uninterrupted succession of six or seven short noses And for the contrary reason he would generally add That it must be one of the greatest problems in civil life where the same number of long and jolly noses following one another in a direct line did not raise and hoist it up into the best vacancies in the kingdom He would often boast that the Shandy family rank d very high in king Harry the VIIIth s time but owed its rise to no state engine he would say but to that only but that like other families he would add it had felt the turn of the wheel and had never recovered the blow of my great grandfather s nose It was an ace of clubs indeed he would cry shaking his head and as vile a one for an unfortunate family as ever turn d up trumps Fair and softly gentle reader where is thy fancy carrying thee If there is truth in man by my great grandfather s nose I mean the external organ of smelling or that part of man which stands prominent in his face and which painters say in good jolly noses and well proportioned faces should comprehend a full third that is measured downwards from the setting on of the hair What a life of it has an author at this pass Chapter two XXVII It is a singular blessing that nature has form d the mind of man with the same happy backwardness and renitency against conviction which is observed in old dogs of not learning new tricks What a shuttlecock of a fellow would the greatest philosopher that ever existed be whisk d into at once did he read such books and observe such facts and think such thoughts as would eternally be making him change sides 
3699_175950_000019_000000	train-clean-100	Now my father as I told you last year detested all this He pick d up an opinion Sir as a man in a state of nature picks up an apple It becomes his own and if he is a man of spirit he would lose his life rather than give it up

none	none	Chapter two XXVIII My father s collection was not great but to make amends it was curious and consequently he was some time in making it he had the great good fortune hewever to set off well in getting Bruscambille s prologue upon long noses almost for nothing for he gave no more for Bruscambille than three half crowns owing indeed to the strong fancy which the stall man saw my father had for the book the moment he laid his hands upon it There are not three Bruscambilles in Christendom said the stall man except what are chain d up in the libraries of the curious My father flung down the money as quick as lightning took Bruscambille into his bosom hied home from Piccadilly to Coleman street with it as he would have hied home with a treasure without taking his hand once off from Bruscambille all the way To those who do not yet know of which gender Bruscambille is inasmuch as a prologue upon long noses might easily be done by either twill be no objection against the simile to say That when my father got home he solaced himself with Bruscambille after the manner in which tis ten to one your worship solaced yourself with your first mistress that is from morning even unto night which by the bye how delightful soever it may prove to the inamorato is of little or no entertainment at all to by standers Take notice I go no farther with the simile my father s eye was greater than his appetite his zeal greater than his knowledge he cool d his affections became divided he got hold of Prignitz purchased Scroderus Andrea Paraeus Bouchet s Evening Conferences and above all the great and learned Hafen Slawkenbergius of which as I shall have much to say by and bye I will say nothing now Chapter two XXIX Of all the tracts my father was at the pains to procure and study in support of his hypothesis there was not any one wherein he felt a more cruel disappointment at first than in the celebrated dialogue between Pamphagus and Cocles written by the chaste pen of the great and venerable Erasmus upon the various uses and seasonable applications of long noses Now don t let Satan my dear girl in this chapter take advantage of any one spot of rising ground to get astride of your imagination if you can any ways help it or if he is so nimble as to slip on let me beg of you like an unback d filly to frisk it to squirt it to jump it to rear it to bound it and to kick it with long kicks and short kicks till like Tickletoby s mare you break a strap or a crupper and throw his worship into the dirt You need not kill him And pray who was Tickletoby s mare tis just as discreditable and unscholar like a question Sir as to have asked what year ab urb con the second Punic war broke out Who was Tickletoby s mare Read read read read my unlearned reader read or by the knowledge of the great saint Paraleipomenon I tell you before hand you had better throw down the book at once for without much reading by which your reverence knows I mean much knowledge you will no more be able to penetrate the moral of the next marbled page motley emblem of my work than the world with all its sagacity has been able to unravel the many opinions transactions and truths which still lie mystically hid under the dark veil of the black one two marble plates Chapter two XXX Nihil me paenitet hujus nasi quoth Pamphagus that is My nose has been the making of me Nec est cur poeniteat replies Cocles that is How the duce should such a nose fail The doctrine you see was laid down by Erasmus as my father wished it with the utmost plainness but my father s disappointment was in finding nothing more from so able a pen but the bare fact itself without any of that speculative subtilty or ambidexterity of argumentation upon it which Heaven had bestow d upon man on purpose to investigate truth and fight for her on all sides My father pish d and pugh d at first most terribly tis worth something to have a good name As the dialogue was of Erasmus my father soon came to himself and read it over and over again with great application studying every word and every syllable of it thro and thro in its most strict and literal interpretation he could still make nothing of it that way Mayhap there is more meant than is said in it quoth my father Learned men brother Toby don t write dialogues upon long noses for nothing I ll study the mystick and the allegorick sense here is some room to turn a man s self in brother My father read on Now I find it needful to inform your reverences and worships that besides the many nautical uses of long noses enumerated by Erasmus the dialogist affirmeth that a long nose is not without its domestic conveniences also for that in a case of distress and for want of a pair of bellows it will do excellently well ad ixcitandum focum to stir up the fire Nature had been prodigal in her gifts to my father beyond measure and had sown the seeds of verbal criticism as deep within him as she had done the seeds of all other knowledge so that he had got out his penknife and was trying experiments upon the sentence to see if he could not scratch some better sense into it I ve got within a single letter brother Toby cried my father of Erasmus his mystic meaning You are near enough brother replied my uncle in all conscience Pshaw cried my father scratching on I might as well be seven miles off I ve done it said my father snapping his fingers See my dear brother Toby how I have mended the sense But you have marr d a word replied my uncle Toby My father put on his spectacles bit his lip and tore out the leaf in a passion Chapter two XXXI O Slawkenbergius thou faithful analyzer of my Disgrazias thou sad foreteller of so many of the whips and short turns which on one stage or other of my life have come slap upon me from the shortness of my nose and no other cause that I am conscious of Tell me Slawkenbergius what secret impulse was it what intonation of voice whence came it how did it sound in thy ears art thou sure thou heard saint it which first cried out to thee go go Slawkenbergius dedicate the labours of thy life neglect thy pastimes call forth all the powers and faculties of thy nature macerate thyself in the service of mankind and write a grand Folio for them upon the subject of their noses How the communication was conveyed into Slawkenbergius s sensorium so that Slawkenbergius should know whose finger touch d the key and whose hand it was that blew the bellows as Hafen Slawkenbergius has been dead and laid in his grave above fourscore and ten years we can only raise conjectures Slawkenbergius was play d upon for aught I know like one of Whitefield s disciples that is with such a distinct intelligence Sir of which of the two masters it was that had been practising upon his instrument as to make all reasoning upon it needless For in the account which Hafen Slawkenbergius gives the world of his motives and occasions for writing and spending so many years of his life upon this one work towards the end of his prolegomena which by the bye should have come first but the bookbinder has most injudiciously placed it betwixt the analytical contents of the book and the book itself he informs his reader that ever since he had arrived at the age of discernment and was able to sit down cooly and consider within himself the true state and condition of man and distinguish the main end and design of his being or to shorten my translation for Slawkenbergius s book is in Latin and not a little prolix in this passage ever since I understood quoth Slawkenbergius any thing or rather what was what and could perceive that the point of long noses had been too loosely handled by all who had gone before have I Slawkenbergius felt a strong impulse with a mighty and unresistible call within me to gird up myself to this undertaking And to do justice to Slawkenbergius he has entered the list with a stronger lance and taken a much larger career in it than any one man who had ever entered it before him and indeed in many respects deserves to be en nich d as a prototype for all writers of voluminous works at least to model their books by for he has taken in Sir the whole subject examined every part of it dialectically then brought it into full day dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision of his own natural parts could strike or the profoundest knowledge of the sciences had impowered him to cast upon it collating collecting and compiling begging borrowing and stealing as he went along all that had been wrote or wrangled thereupon in the schools and porticos of the learned so that Slawkenbergius his book may properly be considered not only as a model but as a thorough stitched Digest and regular institute of noses comprehending in it all that is or can be needful to be known about them For this cause it is that I forbear to speak of so many otherwise valuable books and treatises of my father s collecting wrote either plump upon noses or collaterally touching them such for instance as Prignitz now lying upon the table before me who with infinite learning and from the most candid and scholar like examination of above four thousand different skulls in upwards of twenty charnel houses in Silesia which he had rummaged has informed us that the mensuration and configuration of the osseous or bony parts of human noses in any given tract of country except Crim Tartary where they are all crush d down by the thumb so that no judgment can be formed upon them are much nearer alike than the world imagines the difference amongst them being he says a mere trifle not worth taking notice of but that the size and jollity of every individual nose and by which one nose ranks above another and bears a higher price is owing to the cartilaginous and muscular parts of it into whose ducts and sinuses the blood and animal spirits being impell d and driven by the warmth and force of the imagination which is but a step from it bating the case of idiots whom Prignitz who had lived many years in Turky supposes under the more immediate tutelage of Heaven it so happens and ever must says Prignitz that the excellency of the nose is in a direct arithmetical proportion to the excellency of the wearer s fancy It is for the same reason that is because tis all comprehended in Slawkenbergius that I say nothing likewise of Scroderus Andrea who all the world knows set himself to oppugn Prignitz with great violence proving it in his own way first logically and then by a series of stubborn facts That so far was Prignitz from the truth in affirming that the fancy begat the nose that on the contrary the nose begat the fancy The learned suspected Scroderus of an indecent sophism in this and Prignitz cried out aloud in the dispute that Scroderus had shifted the idea upon him but Scroderus went on maintaining his thesis My father was just balancing within himself which of the two sides he should take in this affair when Ambrose Paraeus decided it in a moment and by overthrowing the systems both of Prignitz and Scroderus drove my father out of both sides of the controversy at once Be witness I don t acquaint the learned reader in saying it I mention it only to shew the learned I know the fact myself That this Ambrose Paraeus was chief surgeon and nose mender to Francis the ninth of France and in high credit with him and the two preceding or succeeding kings I know not which and that except in the slip he made in his story of Taliacotius s noses and his manner of setting them on he was esteemed by the whole college of physicians at that time as more knowing in matters of noses than any one who had ever taken them in hand Now Ambrose Paraeus convinced my father that the true and efficient cause of what had engaged so much the attention of the world and upon which Prignitz and Scroderus had wasted so much learning and fine parts was neither this nor that but that the length and goodness of the nose was owing simply to the softness and flaccidity in the nurse s breast as the flatness and shortness of puisne noses was to the firmness and elastic repulsion of the same organ of nutrition in the hale and lively which tho happy for the woman was the undoing of the child inasmuch as his nose was so snubb d so rebuff d so rebated and so refrigerated thereby as never to arrive ad mensuram suam legitimam but that in case of the flaccidity and softness of the nurse or mother s breast by sinking into it quoth Paraeus as into so much butter the nose was comforted nourish d plump d up refresh d refocillated and set a growing for ever I have but two things to observe of Paraeus first That he proves and explains all this with the utmost chastity and decorum of expression for which may his soul for ever rest in peace And secondly that besides the systems of Prignitz and Scroderus which Ambrose Paraeus his hypothesis effectually overthrew it overthrew at the same time the system of peace and harmony of our family and for three days together not only embroiled matters between my father and my mother but turn d likewise the whole house and every thing in it except my uncle Toby quite upside down Such a ridiculous tale of a dispute between a man and his wife never surely in any age or country got vent through the key hole of a street door My mother you must know but I have fifty things more necessary to let you know first I have a hundred difficulties which I have promised to clear up and a thousand distresses and domestick misadventures crowding in upon me thick and threefold one upon the neck of another A cow broke in tomorrow morning to my uncle Toby s fortifications and eat up two rations and a half of dried grass tearing up the sods with it which faced his horn work and covered way Trim insists upon being tried by a court martial the cow to be shot Slop to be crucifix d myself to be tristram d and at my very baptism made a martyr of poor unhappy devils that we all are I want swaddling but there is no time to be lost in exclamations I have left my father lying across his bed and my uncle Toby in his old fringed chair sitting beside him and promised I would go back to them in half an hour and five and thirty minutes are laps d already Of all the perplexities a mortal author was ever seen in this certainly is the greatest for I have Hafen Slawkenbergius s folio Sir to finish a dialogue between my father and my uncle Toby upon the solution of Prignitz Scroderus Ambrose Paraeus Panocrates and Grangousier to relate a tale out of Slawkenbergius to translate and all this in five minutes less than no time at all such a head would to Heaven my enemies only saw the inside of it Chapter two XXXII There was not any one scene more entertaining in our family and to do it justice in this point and I here put off my cap and lay it upon the table close beside my ink horn on purpose to make my declaration to the world concerning this one article the more solemn that I believe in my soul unless my love and partiality to my understanding blinds me the hand of the supreme Maker and first Designer of all things never made or put a family together in that period at least of it which I have sat down to write the story of where the characters of it were cast or contrasted with so dramatick a felicity as ours was for this end or in which the capacities of affording such exquisite scenes and the powers of shifting them perpetually from morning to night were lodged and intrusted with so unlimited a confidence as in the Shandy Family Not any one of these was more diverting I say in this whimsical theatre of ours than what frequently arose out of this self same chapter of long noses especially when my father s imagination was heated with the enquiry and nothing would serve him but to heat my uncle Toby s too My uncle Toby would give my father all possible fair play in this attempt and with infinite patience would sit smoking his pipe for whole hours together whilst my father was practising upon his head and trying every accessible avenue to drive Prignitz and Scroderus s solutions into it Whether they were above my uncle Toby s reason or contrary to it or that his brain was like damp timber and no spark could possibly take hold or that it was so full of saps mines blinds curtins and such military disqualifications to his seeing clearly into Prignitz and Scroderus s doctrines I say not let schoolmen scullions anatomists and engineers fight for it among themselves Twas some misfortune I make no doubt in this affair that my father had every word of it to translate for the benefit of my uncle Toby and render out of Slawkenbergius s Latin of which as he was no great master his translation was not always of the purest and generally least so where twas most wanted This naturally open d a door to a second misfortune that in the warmer paroxysms of his zeal to open my uncle Toby s eyes my father s ideas ran on as much faster than the translation as the translation outmoved my uncle Toby s neither the one or the other added much to the perspicuity of my father s lecture Chapter two XXXIII The gift of ratiocination and making syllogisms I mean in man for in superior classes of being such as angels and spirits tis all done may it please your worships as they tell me by Intuition and beings inferior as your worships all know syllogize by their noses though there is an island swimming in the sea though not altogether at its ease whose inhabitants if my intelligence deceives me not are so wonderfully gifted as to syllogize after the same fashion and oft times to make very well out too but that s neither here nor there The gift of doing it as it should be amongst us or the great and principal act of ratiocination in man as logicians tell us is the finding out the agreement or disagreement of two ideas one with another by the intervention of a third called the medius terminus just as a man as Locke well observes by a yard finds two mens nine pin alleys to be of the same length which could not be brought together to measure their equality by juxta position Had the same great reasoner looked on as my father illustrated his systems of noses and observed my uncle Toby s deportment what great attention he gave to every word and as oft as he took his pipe from his mouth with what wonderful seriousness he contemplated the length of it surveying it transversely as he held it betwixt his finger and his thumb then fore right then this way and then that in all its possible directions and fore shortenings he would have concluded my uncle Toby had got hold of the medius terminus and was syllogizing and measuring with it the truth of each hypothesis of long noses in order as my father laid them before him This by the bye was more than my father wanted his aim in all the pains he was at in these philosophick lectures was to enable my uncle Toby not to discuss but comprehend to hold the grains and scruples of learning not to weigh them My uncle Toby as you will read in the next chapter did neither the one or the other Chapter two XXXIV Tis a pity cried my father one winter s night after a three hours painful translation of Slawkenbergius tis a pity cried my father putting my mother s threadpaper into the book for a mark as he spoke that truth brother Toby should shut herself up in such impregnable fastnesses and be so obstinate as not to surrender herself sometimes up upon the closest siege Now it happened then as indeed it had often done before that my uncle Toby s fancy during the time of my father s explanation of Prignitz to him having nothing to stay it there had taken a short flight to the bowling green his body might as well have taken a turn there too so that with all the semblance of a deep school man intent upon the medius terminus my uncle Toby was in fact as ignorant of the whole lecture and all its pros and cons as if my father had been translating Hafen Slawkenbergius from the Latin tongue into the Cherokee But the word siege like a talismanic power in my father s metaphor wafting back my uncle Toby s fancy quick as a note could follow the touch he open d his ears and my father observing that he took his pipe out of his mouth and shuffled his chair nearer the table as with a desire to profit my father with great pleasure began his sentence again changing only the plan and dropping the metaphor of the siege of it to keep clear of some dangers my father apprehended from it Tis a pity said my father that truth can only be on one side brother Toby considering what ingenuity these learned men have all shewn in their solutions of noses Can noses be dissolved replied my uncle Toby My father thrust back his chair rose up put on his hat took four long strides to the door jerked it open thrust his head half way out shut the door again took no notice of the bad hinge returned to the table pluck d my mother s thread paper out of Slawkenbergius s book went hastily to his bureau walked slowly back twisted my mother s thread paper about his thumb unbutton d his waistcoat threw my mother s thread paper into the fire bit her sattin pin cushion in two fill d his mouth with bran confounded it but mark the oath of confusion was levell d at my uncle Toby s brain which was e en confused enough already the curse came charged only with the bran the bran may it please your honours was no more than powder to the ball Twas well my father s passions lasted not long for so long as they did last they led him a busy life on t and it is one of the most unaccountable problems that ever I met with in my observations of human nature that nothing should prove my father s mettle so much or make his passions go off so like gun powder as the unexpected strokes his science met with from the quaint simplicity of my uncle Toby s questions Had ten dozen of hornets stung him behind in so many different places all at one time he could not have exerted more mechanical functions in fewer seconds or started half so much as with one single quaere of three words unseasonably popping in full upon him in his hobby horsical career Twas all one to my uncle Toby he smoked his pipe on with unvaried composure his heart never intended offence to his brother and as his head could seldom find out where the sting of it lay he always gave my father the credit of cooling by himself He was five minutes and thirty five seconds about it in the present case By all that s good said my father swearing as he came to himself and taking the oath out of Ernulphus s digest of curses though to do my father justice it was a fault as he told doctor Slop in the affair of Ernulphus which he as seldom committed as any man upon earth By all that s good and great brother Toby said my father if it was not for the aids of philosophy which befriend one so much as they do you would put a man beside all temper Why by the solutions of noses of which I was telling you I meant as you might have known had you favoured me with one grain of attention the various accounts which learned men of different kinds of knowledge have given the world of the causes of short and long noses There is no cause but one replied my uncle Toby why one man s nose is longer than another s but because that God pleases to have it so That is Grangousier s solution said my father Tis he continued my uncle Toby looking up and not regarding my father s interruption who makes us all and frames and puts us together in such forms and proportions and for such ends as is agreeable to his infinite wisdom Tis a pious account cried my father but not philosophical there is more religion in it than sound science Twas no inconsistent part of my uncle Toby s character that he feared God and reverenced religion So the moment my father finished his remark my uncle Toby fell a whistling Lillabullero with more zeal though more out of tune than usual What is become of my wife s thread paper Chapter two XXXV No matter as an appendage to seamstressy the thread paper might be of some consequence to my mother of none to my father as a mark in Slawkenbergius Slawkenbergius in every page of him was a rich treasure of inexhaustible knowledge to my father he could not open him amiss and he would often say in closing the book that if all the arts and sciences in the world with the books which treated of them were lost should the wisdom and policies of governments he would say through disuse ever happen to be forgot and all that statesmen had wrote or caused to be written upon the strong or the weak sides of courts and kingdoms should they be forgot also and Slawkenbergius only left there would be enough in him in all conscience he would say to set the world a going again A treasure therefore was he indeed an institute of all that was necessary to be known of noses and every thing else at matin noon and vespers was Hafen Slawkenbergius his recreation and delight twas for ever in his hands you would have sworn Sir it had been a canon s prayer book so worn so glazed so contrited and attrited was it with fingers and with thumbs in all its parts from one end even unto the other I am not such a bigot to Slawkenbergius as my father there is a fund in him no doubt but in my opinion the best I don t say the most profitable but the most amusing part of Hafen Slawkenbergius is his tales and considering he was a German many of them told not without fancy these take up his second book containing nearly one half of his folio and are comprehended in ten decads each decad containing ten tales Philosophy is not built upon tales and therefore twas certainly wrong in Slawkenbergius to send them into the world by that name there are a few of them in his eighth ninth and tenth decads which I own seem rather playful and sportive than speculative but in general they are to be looked upon by the learned as a detail of so many independent facts all of them turning round somehow or other upon the main hinges of his subject and added to his work as so many illustrations upon the doctrines of noses As we have leisure enough upon our hands if you give me leave madam I ll tell you the ninth tale of his tenth decad Slawkenbergii Fabella As Hafen Slawkenbergius de Nasis is extremely scarce it may not be unacceptable to the learned reader to see the specimen of a few pages of his original I will make no reflection upon it but that his story telling Latin is much more concise than his philosophic and I think has more of Latinity in it Vespera quadam frigidula posteriori in parte mensis Augusti peregrinus mulo fusco colore incidens mantica a tergo paucis indusiis binis calceis braccisque sericis coccineis repleta

cool refreshing evening at the close of a very sultry day in the latter end of the month of August when a stranger mounted upon a dark mule with a small cloak bag behind him containing a few shirts a pair of shoes and a crimson sattin pair of breeches entered the town of Strasburg He told the centinel who questioned him as he entered the gates that he had been at the Promontory of Noses was going on to Frankfort and should be back again at Strasburg that day month in his way to the borders of Crim Tartary The centinel looked up into the stranger s face he never saw such a Nose in his life I have made a very good venture of it quoth the stranger so slipping his wrist out of the loop of a black ribbon to which a short scymetar was hung he put his hand into his pocket and with great courtesy touching the fore part of his cap with his left hand as he extended his right he put a florin into the centinel s hand and passed on It grieves me said the centinel speaking to a little dwarfish bandy legg d drummer that so courteous a soul should have lost his scabbard he cannot travel without one to his scymetar and will not be able to get a scabbard to fit it in all Strasburg I never had one replied the stranger looking back to the centinel and putting his hand up to his cap as he spoke I carry it continued he thus holding up his naked scymetar his mule moving on slowly all the time on purpose to defend my nose It is well worth it gentle stranger replied the centinel Tis not worth a single stiver said the bandy legg d drummer tis a nose of parchment As I am a true catholic except that it is six times as big tis a nose said the centinel like my own I heard it crackle said the drummer By dunder said the centinel I saw it bleed What a pity cried the bandy legg d drummer we did not both touch it At the very time that this dispute was maintaining by the centinel and the drummer was the same point debating betwixt a trumpeter and a trumpeter s wife who were just then coming up and had stopped to see the stranger pass by Benedicity What a nose tis as long said the trumpeter s wife as a trumpet And of the same metal said the trumpeter as you hear by its sneezing Tis as soft as a flute said she Tis brass said the trumpeter Tis a pudding s end said his wife I tell thee again said the trumpeter tis a brazen nose I ll know the bottom of it said the trumpeter s wife for I will touch it with my finger before I sleep The stranger s mule moved on at so slow a rate that he heard every word of the dispute not only betwixt the centinel and the drummer but betwixt the trumpeter and trumpeter s wife No said he dropping his reins upon his mule s neck and laying both his hands upon his breast the one over the other in a saint like position his mule going on easily all the time No said he looking up I am not such a debtor to the world slandered and disappointed as I have been as to give it that conviction no said he my nose shall never be touched whilst Heaven gives me strength To do what said a burgomaster s wife The stranger took no notice of the burgomaster s wife he was making a vow to Saint Nicolas which done having uncrossed his arms with the same solemnity with which he crossed them he took up the reins of his bridle with his left hand and putting his right hand into his bosom with the scymetar hanging loosely to the wrist of it he rode on as slowly as one foot of the mule could follow another thro the principal streets of Strasburg till chance brought him to the great inn in the market place over against the church The moment the stranger alighted he ordered his mule to be led into the stable and his cloak bag to be brought in then opening and taking out of it his crimson sattin breeches with a silver fringed appendage to them which I dare not translate he put his breeches with his fringed cod piece on and forth with with his short scymetar in his hand walked out to the grand parade The stranger had just taken three turns upon the parade when he perceived the trumpeter s wife at the opposite side of it so turning short in pain lest his nose should be attempted he instantly went back to his inn undressed himself packed up his crimson sattin breeches c in his cloak bag and called for his mule I am going forwards said the stranger for Frankfort and shall be back at Strasburg this day month I hope continued the stranger stroking down the face of his mule with his left hand as he was going to mount it that you have been kind to this faithful slave of mine it has carried me and my cloak bag continued he tapping the mule s back above six hundred leagues Tis a long journey Sir replied the master of the inn unless a man has great business Tut tut said the stranger I have been at the promontory of Noses and have got me one of the goodliest thank Heaven that ever fell to a single man s lot Whilst the stranger was giving this odd account of himself the master of the inn and his wife kept both their eyes fixed full upon the stranger s nose By saint Radagunda said the inn keeper s wife to herself there is more of it than in any dozen of the largest noses put together in all Strasburg is it not said she whispering her husband in his ear is it not a noble nose Tis an imposture my dear said the master of the inn tis a false nose Tis a true nose said his wife Tis made of fir tree said he I smell the turpentine There s a pimple on it said she Tis a dead nose replied the inn keeper Tis a live nose and if I am alive myself said the inn keeper s wife I will touch it I have made a vow to saint Nicolas this day said the stranger that my nose shall not be touched till Here the stranger suspending his voice looked up Till when said she hastily It never shall be touched said he clasping his hands and bringing them close to his breast till that hour What hour cried the inn keeper s wife Never never said the stranger never till I am got For Heaven s sake into what place said she The stranger rode away without saying a word The stranger had not got half a league on his way towards Frankfort before all the city of Strasburg was in an uproar about his nose The Compline bells were just ringing to call the Strasburgers to their devotions and shut up the duties of the day in prayer no soul in all Strasburg heard em the city was like a swarm of bees men women and children the Compline bells tinkling all the time flying here and there in at one door out at another this way and that way long ways and cross ways up one street down another street in at this alley out of that did you see it did you see it did you see it O did you see it who saw it who did see it for mercy s sake who saw it Alack o day I was at vespers I was washing I was starching I was scouring I was quilting God help me I never saw it I never touch d it would I had been a centinel a bandy legg d drummer a trumpeter a trumpeter s wife was the general cry and lamentation in every street and corner of Strasburg Whilst all this confusion and disorder triumphed throughout the great city of Strasburg was the courteous stranger going on as gently upon his mule in his way to Frankfort as if he had no concern at all in the affair talking all the way he rode in broken sentences sometimes to his mule sometimes to himself sometimes to his Julia O Julia my lovely Julia nay I cannot stop to let thee bite that thistle that ever the suspected tongue of a rival should have robbed me of enjoyment when I was upon the point of tasting it Pugh tis nothing but a thistle never mind it thou shalt have a better supper at night Banish d from my country my friends from thee Poor devil thou rt sadly tired with thy journey come get on a little faster there s nothing in my cloak bag but two shirts a crimson sattin pair of breeches and a fringed Dear Julia But why to Frankfort is it that there is a hand unfelt which secretly is conducting me through these meanders and unsuspected tracts Stumbling by saint Nicolas every step why at this rate we shall be all night in getting in To happiness or am I to be the sport of fortune and slander destined to be driven forth unconvicted unheard untouch d if so why did I not stay at Strasburg where justice but I had sworn Come thou shalt drink to saint Nicolas O Julia What dost thou prick up thy ears at tis nothing but a man c The stranger rode on communing in this manner with his mule and Julia till he arrived at his inn where as soon as he arrived he alighted saw his mule as he had promised it taken good care of took off his cloak bag with his crimson sattin breeches c in it called for an omelet to his supper went to his bed about twelve o clock and in five minutes fell fast asleep It was about the same hour when the tumult in Strasburg being abated for that night the Strasburgers had all got quietly into their beds but not like the stranger for the rest either of their minds or bodies queen Mab like an elf as she was had taken the stranger s nose and without reduction of its bulk had that night been at the pains of slitting and dividing it into as many noses of different cuts and fashions as there were heads in Strasburg to hold them The abbess of Quedlingberg who with the four great dignitaries of her chapter the prioress the deaness the sub chantress and senior canonness had that week come to Strasburg to consult the university upon a case of conscience relating to their placket holes was ill all the night The courteous stranger s nose had got perched upon the top of the pineal gland of her brain and made such rousing work in the fancies of the four great dignitaries of her chapter they could not get a wink of sleep the whole night thro for it there was no keeping a limb still amongst them in short they got up like so many ghosts The penitentiaries of the third order of saint Francis the nuns of mount Calvary the Praemonstratenses the Clunienses Hafen Slawkenbergius means the Benedictine nuns of Cluny founded in the year nine hundred forty by Odo abbe de Cluny the Carthusians and all the severer orders of nuns who lay that night in blankets or hair cloth were still in a worse condition than the abbess of Quedlingberg by tumbling and tossing and tossing and tumbling from one side of their beds to the other the whole night long the several sisterhoods had scratch d and maul d themselves all to death they got out of their beds almost flay d alive every body thought saint Antony had visited them for probation with his fire they had never once in short shut their eyes the whole night long from vespers to matins The nuns of saint Ursula acted the wisest they never attempted to go to bed at all The dean of Strasburg the prebendaries the capitulars and domiciliars capitularly assembled in the morning to consider the case of butter d buns all wished they had followed the nuns of saint Ursula s example In the hurry and confusion every thing had been in the night before the bakers had all forgot to lay their leaven there were no butter d buns to be had for breakfast in all Strasburg the whole close of the cathedral was in one eternal commotion such a cause of restlessness and disquietude and such a zealous inquiry into that cause of the restlessness had never happened in Strasburg since Martin Luther with his doctrines had turned the city upside down If the stranger s nose took this liberty of thrusting himself thus into the dishes mister Shandy s compliments to orators is very sensible that Slawkenbergius has here changed his metaphor which he is very guilty of that as a translator mister Shandy has all along done what he could to make him stick to it but that here twas impossible of religious orders c what a carnival did his nose make of it in those of the laity tis more than my pen worn to the stump as it is has power to describe tho I acknowledge cries Slawkenbergius with more gaiety of thought than I could have expected from him that there is many a good simile now subsisting in the world which might give my countrymen some idea of it but at the close of such a folio as this wrote for their sakes and in which I have spent the greatest part of my life tho I own to them the simile is in being yet would it not be unreasonable in them to expect I should have either time or inclination to search for it Let it suffice to say that the riot and disorder it occasioned in the Strasburgers fantasies was so general such an overpowering mastership had it got of all the faculties of the Strasburgers minds so many strange things with equal confidence on all sides and with equal eloquence in all places were spoken and sworn to concerning it that turned the whole stream of all discourse and wonder towards it every soul good and bad rich and poor learned and unlearned doctor and student mistress and maid gentle and simple nun s flesh and woman s flesh in Strasburg spent their time in hearing tidings about it every eye in Strasburg languished to see it every finger every thumb in Strasburg burned to touch it Now what might add if any thing may be thought necessary to add to so vehement a desire was this that the centinel the bandy legg d drummer the trumpeter the trumpeter s wife the burgomaster s widow the master of the inn and the master of the inn s wife how widely soever they all differed every one from another in their testimonies and description of the stranger s nose they all agreed together in two points namely that he was gone to Frankfort and would not return to Strasburg till that day month and secondly whether his nose was true or false that the stranger himself was one of the most perfect paragons of beauty the finest made man the most genteel the most generous of his purse the most courteous in his carriage that had ever entered the gates of Strasburg that as he rode with scymetar slung loosely to his wrist thro the streets and walked with his crimson sattin breeches across the parade twas with so sweet an air of careless modesty and so manly withal as would have put the heart in jeopardy had his nose not stood in his way of every virgin who had cast her eyes upon him I call not upon that heart which is a stranger to the throbs and yearnings of curiosity so excited to justify the abbess of Quedlingberg the prioress the deaness and sub chantress for sending at noon day for the trumpeter s wife she went through the streets of Strasburg with her husband s trumpet in her hand the best apparatus the straitness of the time would allow her for the illustration of her theory she staid no longer than three days The centinel and bandy legg d drummer nothing on this side of old Athens could equal them they read their lectures under the city gates to comers and goers with all the pomp of a Chrysippus and a Crantor in their porticos The master of the inn with his ostler on his left hand read his also in the same stile under the portico or gateway of his stable yard his wife hers more privately in a back room all flocked to their lectures not promiscuously but to this or that as is ever the way as faith and credulity marshal d them in a word each Strasburger came crouding for intelligence and every Strasburger had the intelligence he wanted Tis worth remarking for the benefit of all demonstrators in natural philosophy c that as soon as the trumpeter s wife had finished the abbess of Quedlingberg s private lecture and had begun to read in public which she did upon a stool in the middle of the great parade she incommoded the other demonstrators mainly by gaining incontinently the most fashionable part of the city of Strasburg for her auditory But when a demonstrator in philosophy cries Slawkenbergius has a trumpet for an apparatus pray what rival in science can pretend to be heard besides him Whilst the unlearned thro these conduits of intelligence were all busied in getting down to the bottom of the well where Truth keeps her little court were the learned in their way as busy in pumping her up thro the conduits of dialect induction they concerned themselves not with facts they reasoned Not one profession had thrown more light upon this subject than the Faculty had not all their disputes about it run into the affair of Wens and oedematous swellings they could not keep clear of them for their bloods and souls the stranger s nose had nothing to do either with wens or oedematous swellings It was demonstrated however very satisfactorily that such a ponderous mass of heterogenous matter could not be congested and conglomerated to the nose whilst the infant was in Utera without destroying the statical balance of the foetus and throwing it plump upon its head nine months before the time The opponents granted the theory they denied the consequences And if a suitable provision of veins arteries c said they was not laid in for the due nourishment of such a nose in the very first stamina and rudiments of its formation before it came into the world bating the case of Wens it could not regularly grow and be sustained afterwards This was all answered by a dissertation upon nutriment and the effect which nutriment had in extending the vessels and in the increase and prolongation of the muscular parts to the greatest growth and expansion imaginable In the triumph of which theory they went so far as to affirm that there was no cause in nature why a nose might not grow to the size of the man himself The respondents satisfied the world this event could never happen to them so long as a man had but one stomach and one pair of lungs For the stomach said they being the only organ destined for the reception of food and turning it into chyle and the lungs the only engine of sanguification it could possibly work off no more than what the appetite brought it or admitting the possibility of a man s overloading his stomach nature had set bounds however to his lungs the engine was of a determined size and strength and could elaborate but a certain quantity in a given time that is it could produce just as much blood as was sufficient for one single man and no more so that if there was as much nose as man they proved a mortification must necessarily ensue and forasmuch as there could not be a support for both that the nose must either fall off from the man or the man inevitably fall off from his nose Nature accommodates herself to these emergencies cried the opponents else what do you say to the case of a whole stomach a whole pair of lungs and but half a man when both his legs have been unfortunately shot off He dies of a plethora said they or must spit blood and in a fortnight or three weeks go off in a consumption It happens otherwise replied the opponents It ought not said they The more curious and intimate inquirers after nature and her doings though they went hand in hand a good way together yet they all divided about the nose at last almost as much as the Faculty itself They amicably laid it down that there was a just and geometrical arrangement and proportion of the several parts of the human frame to its several destinations offices and functions which could not be transgressed but within certain limits that nature though she sported she sported within a certain circle and they could not agree about the diameter of it The logicians stuck much closer to the point before them than any of the classes of the literati they began and ended with the word Nose and had it not been for a petitio principii which one of the ablest of them ran his head against in the beginning of the combat the whole controversy had been settled at once A nose argued the logician cannot bleed without blood and not only blood but blood circulating in it to supply the phaenomenon with a succession of drops a stream being but a quicker succession of drops that is included said he Now death continued the logician being nothing but the stagnation of the blood I deny the definition Death is the separation of the soul from the body said his antagonist Then we don t agree about our weapons said the logician Then there is an end of the dispute replied the antagonist The civilians were still more concise what they offered being more in the nature of a decree than a dispute Such a monstrous nose said they had it been a true nose could not possibly have been suffered in civil society and if false to impose upon society with such false signs and tokens was a still greater violation of its rights and must have had still less mercy shewn it The only objection to this was that if it proved any thing it proved the stranger s nose was neither true nor false This left room for the controversy to go on It was maintained by the advocates of the ecclesiastic court that there was nothing to inhibit a decree since the stranger ex mero motu had confessed he had been at the Promontory of Noses and had got one of the goodliest c c To this it was answered it was impossible there should be such a place as the Promontory of Noses and the learned be ignorant where it lay The commissary of the bishop of Strasburg undertook the advocates explained this matter in a treatise upon proverbial phrases shewing them that the Promontory of Noses was a mere allegorick expression importing no more than that nature had given him a long nose in proof of which with great learning he cited the underwritten authorities Nonnulli ex nostratibus eadem loquendi formula utun Quinimo Logistae Canonistae Vid Parce Barne Jas in d L Provincial Constitut de conjec vid Vol Lib four Titul I n seven qua

nineteen years before It happened I must say unluckily for Truth because they were giving her a lift another way in so doing that the two universities of Strasburg the Lutheran founded in the year fifteen thirty eight by Jacobus Surmis counsellor of the senate and the Popish founded by Leopold arch duke of Austria were during all this time employing the whole depth of their knowledge except just what the affair of the abbess of Quedlingberg s placket holes required in determining the point of Martin Luther s damnation The Popish doctors had undertaken to demonstrate a priori that from the necessary influence of the planets on the twenty second day of October fourteen eighty three when the moon was in the twelfth house Jupiter Mars and Venus in the third the Sun Saturn and Mercury all got together in the fourth that he must in course and unavoidably be a damn d man and that his doctrines by a direct corollary must be damn d doctrines too By inspection into his horoscope where five planets were in coition all at once with Scorpio Haec mira satisque horrenda Planetarum coitio sub Scorpio Asterismo in nona coeli statione quam Arabes religioni deputabant efficit Martinum Lutherum sacrilegum hereticum Christianae religionis hostem acerrimum atque prophanum ex horoscopi directione ad Martis coitum religiosissimus obiit ejus Anima scelestissima ad infernos navigavit ab Alecto Tisiphone Megara flagellis igneis cruciata perenniter Lucas Gaurieus in Tractatu astrologico de praeteritis multorum hominum accidentibus per genituras examinatis in reading this my father would always shake his head in the ninth house with the Arabians allotted to religion it appeared that Martin Luther did not care one stiver about the matter and that from the horoscope directed to the conjunction of Mars they made it plain likewise he must die cursing and blaspheming with the blast of which his soul being steep d in guilt sailed before the wind in the lake of hell fire The little objection of the Lutheran doctors to this was that it must certainly be the soul of another man born Oct twenty two eighty three which was forced to sail down before the wind in that manner inasmuch as it appeared from the register of Islaben in the county of Mansfelt that Luther was not born in the year fourteen eighty three but in eighty four and not on the twenty twod day of October but on the tenth of November the eve of Martinmas day from whence he had the name of Martin I must break off my translation for a moment for if I did not I know I should no more be able to shut my eyes in bed than the abbess of Quedlingberg It is to tell the reader that my father never read this passage of Slawkenbergius to my uncle Toby but with triumph not over my uncle Toby for he never opposed him in it but over the whole world Now you see brother Toby he would say looking up that christian names are not such indifferent things had Luther here been called by any other name but Martin he would have been damn d to all eternity Not that I look upon Martin he would add as a good name far from it tis something better than a neutral and but a little yet little as it is you see it was of some service to him My father knew the weakness of this prop to his hypothesis as well as the best logician could shew him yet so strange is the weakness of man at the same time as it fell in his way he could not for his life but make use of it and it was certainly for this reason that though there are many stories in Hafen Slawkenbergius s Decades full as entertaining as this I am translating yet there is not one amongst them which my father read over with half the delight it flattered two of his strangest hypotheses together his Names and his Noses I will be bold to say he might have read all the books in the Alexandrian Library had not fate taken other care of them and not have met with a book or passage in one which hit two such nails as these upon the head at one stroke The two universities of Strasburg were hard tugging at this affair of Luther s navigation The Protestant doctors had demonstrated that he had not sailed right before the wind as the Popish doctors had pretended and as every one knew there was no sailing full in the teeth of it they were going to settle in case he had sailed how many points he was off whether Martin had doubled the cape or had fallen upon a lee shore and no doubt as it was an enquiry of much edification at least to those who understood this sort of Navigation they had gone on with it in spite of the size of the stranger s nose had not the size of the stranger s nose drawn off the attention of the world from what they were about it was their business to follow The abbess of Quedlingberg and her four dignitaries was no stop for the enormity of the stranger s nose running full as much in their fancies as their case of conscience the affair of their placket holes kept cold in a word the printers were ordered to distribute their types all controversies dropp d Twas a square cap with a silver tassel upon the crown of it to a nut shell to have guessed on which side of the nose the two universities would split Tis above reason cried the doctors on one side Tis below reason cried the others Tis faith cried one Tis a fiddle stick said the other Tis possible cried the one Tis impossible said the other God s power is infinite cried the Nosarians he can do any thing He can do nothing replied the Anti nosarians which implies contradictions He can make matter think said the Nosarians As certainly as you can make a velvet cap out of a sow s ear replied the Anti nosarians He cannot make two and two five replied the Popish doctors Tis false said their other opponents Infinite power is infinite power said the doctors who maintained the reality of the nose It extends only to all possible things replied the Lutherans By God in heaven cried the Popish doctors he can make a nose if he thinks fit as big as the steeple of Strasburg Now the steeple of Strasburg being the biggest and the tallest church steeple to be seen in the whole world the Anti nosarians denied that a nose of five hundred seventy five geometrical feet in length could be worn at least by a middle siz d man The Popish doctors swore it could The Lutheran doctors said No it could not This at once started a new dispute which they pursued a great way upon the extent and limitation of the moral and natural attributes of God That controversy led them naturally into Thomas Aquinas and Thomas Aquinas to the devil The stranger s nose was no more heard of in the dispute it just served as a frigate to launch them into the gulph of school divinity and then they all sailed before the wind Heat is in proportion to the want of true knowledge The controversy about the attributes c instead of cooling on the contrary had inflamed the Strasburgers imaginations to a most inordinate degree The less they understood of the matter the greater was their wonder about it they were left in all the distresses of desire unsatisfied saw their doctors the Parchmentarians the Brassarians the Turpentarians on one side the Popish doctors on the other like Pantagruel and his companions in quest of the oracle of the bottle all embarked out of sight The poor Strasburgers left upon the beach What was to be done No delay the uproar increased every one in disorder the city gates set open Unfortunate Strasbergers was there in the store house of nature was there in the lumber rooms of learning was there in the great arsenal of chance one single engine left undrawn forth to torture your curiosities and stretch your desires which was not pointed by the hand of Fate to play upon your hearts I dip not my pen into my ink to excuse the surrender of yourselves tis to write your panegyrick Shew me a city so macerated with expectation who neither eat or drank or slept or prayed or hearkened to the calls either of religion or nature for seven and twenty days together who could have held out one day longer On the twenty eighth the courteous stranger had promised to return to Strasburg Seven thousand coaches Slawkenbergius must certainly have made some mistake in his numeral characters seven thousand coaches fifteen thousand single horse chairs twenty thousand waggons crowded as full as they could all hold with senators counsellors syndicks beguines widows wives virgins canons concubines all in their coaches The abbess of Quedlingberg with the prioress the deaness and sub chantress leading the procession in one coach and the dean of Strasburg with the four great dignitaries of his chapter on her left hand the rest following higglety pigglety as they could some on horseback some on foot some led some driven some down the Rhine some this way some that all set out at sun rise to meet the courteous stranger on the road Haste we now towards the catastrophe of my tale I say Catastrophe cries Slawkenbergius inasmuch as a tale with parts rightly disposed not only rejoiceth gaudet in the Catastrophe and Peripeitia of a Drama but rejoiceth moreover in all the essential and integrant parts of it it has its Protasis Epitasis Catastasis its Catastrophe or Peripeitia growing one out of the other in it in the order Aristotle first planted them without which a tale had better never be told at all says Slawkenbergius but be kept to a man s self In all my ten tales in all my ten decades have I Slawkenbergius tied down every tale of them as tightly to this rule as I have done this of the stranger and his nose From his first parley with the centinel to his leaving the city of Strasburg after pulling off his crimson sattin pair of breeches is the Protasis or first entrance where the characters of the Personae Dramatis are just touched in and the subject slightly begun The Epitasis wherein the action is more fully entered upon and heightened till it arrives at its state or height called the Catastasis and which usually takes up the twod and threed act is included within that busy period of my tale betwixt the first night s uproar about the nose to the conclusion of the trumpeter s wife s lectures upon it in the middle of the grand parade and from the first embarking of the learned in the dispute to the doctors finally sailing away and leaving the Strasburgers upon the beach in distress is the Catastasis or the ripening of the incidents and passions for their bursting forth in the fifth act This commences with the setting out of the Strasburgers in the Frankfort road and terminates in unwinding the labyrinth and bringing the hero out of a state of agitation as Aristotle calls it to a state of rest and quietness This says Hafen Slawkenbergius constitutes the Catastrophe or Peripeitia of my tale and that is the part of it I am going to relate We left the stranger behind the curtain asleep he enters now upon the stage What dost thou prick up thy ears at tis nothing but a man upon a horse was the last word the stranger uttered to his mule It was not proper then to tell the reader that the mule took his master s word for it and without any more ifs or ands let the traveller and his horse pass by The traveller was hastening with all diligence to get to Strasburg that night What a fool am I said the traveller to himself when he had rode about a league farther to think of getting into Strasburg this night Strasburg the great Strasburg Strasburg the capital of all Alsatia Strasburg an imperial city Strasburg a sovereign state Strasburg garrisoned with five thousand of the best troops in all the world Alas if I was at the gates of Strasburg this moment I could not gain admittance into it for a ducat nay a ducat and half tis too much better go back to the last inn I have passed than lie I know not where or give I know not what The traveller as he made these reflections in his mind turned his horse s head about and three minutes after the stranger had been conducted into his chamber he arrived at the same inn We have bacon in the house said the host and bread and till eleven o clock this night had three eggs in it but a stranger who arrived an hour ago has had them dressed into an omelet and we have nothing Alas said the traveller harassed as I am I want nothing but a bed I have one as soft as is in Alsatia said the host The stranger continued he should have slept in it for tis my best bed but upon the score of his nose He has got a defluxion said the traveller Not that I know cried the host But tis a camp bed and Jacinta said he looking towards the maid imagined there was not room in it to turn his nose in Why so cried the traveller starting back It is so long a nose replied the host The traveller fixed his eyes upon Jacinta then upon the ground kneeled upon his right knee had just got his hand laid upon his breast Trifle not with my anxiety said he rising up again Tis no trifle said Jacinta tis the most glorious nose The traveller fell upon his knee again laid his hand upon his breast then said he looking up to heaven thou hast conducted me to the end of my pilgrimage Tis Diego The traveller was the brother of the Julia so often invoked that night by the stranger as he rode from Strasburg upon his mule and was come on her part in quest of him He had accompanied his sister from Valadolid across the Pyrenean mountains through France and had many an entangled skein to wind off in pursuit of him through the many meanders and abrupt turnings of a lover s thorny tracks Julia had sunk under it and had not been able to go a step farther than to Lyons where with the many disquietudes of a tender heart which all talk of but few feel she sicken d but had just strength to write a letter to Diego and having conjured her brother never to see her face till he had found him out and put the letter into his hands Julia took to her bed Fernandez for that was her brother s name tho the camp bed was as soft as any one in Alsace yet he could not shut his eyes in it As soon as it was day he rose and hearing Diego was risen too he entered his chamber and discharged his sister s commission The letter was as follows Seig Diego Whether my suspicions of your nose were justly excited or not tis not now to inquire it is enough I have not had firmness to put them to farther tryal How could I know so little of myself when I sent my Duenna to forbid your coming more under my lattice or how could I know so little of you Diego as to imagine you would not have staid one day in Valadolid to have given ease to my doubts Was I to be abandoned Diego because I was deceived or was it kind to take me at my word whether my suspicions were just or no and leave me as you did a prey to much uncertainty and sorrow In what manner Julia has resented this my brother when he puts this letter into your hands will tell you He will tell you in how few moments she repented of the rash message she had sent you in what frantic haste she flew to her lattice and how many days and nights together she leaned immoveably upon her elbow looking through it towards the way which Diego was wont to come He will tell you when she heard of your departure how her spirits deserted her how her heart sicken d how piteously she mourned how low she hung her head O Diego how many weary steps has my brother s pity led me by the hand languishing to trace out yours how far has desire carried me beyond strength and how oft have I fainted by the way and sunk into his arms with only power to cry out O my Diego If the gentleness of your carriage has not belied your heart you will fly to me almost as fast as you fled from me haste as you will you will arrive but to see me expire Tis a bitter draught Diego but oh tis embittered still more by dying un She could proceed no farther Slawkenbergius supposes the word intended was unconvinced but her strength would not enable her to finish her letter The heart of the courteous Diego over flowed as he read the letter he ordered his mule forthwith and Fernandez s horse to be saddled and as no vent in prose is equal to that of poetry in such conflicts chance which as often directs us to remedies as to diseases having thrown a piece of charcoal into the window Diego availed himself of it and whilst the hostler was getting ready his mule he eased his mind against the wall as follows Ode Harsh and untuneful are the notes of love Unless my Julia strikes the key Her hand alone can touch the part Whose dulcet movement charms the heart And governs all the man with sympathetick sway twod O Julia The lines were very natural for they were nothing at all to the purpose says Slawkenbergius and tis a pity there were no more of them but whether it was that Seig Diego was slow in composing verses or the hostler quick in saddling mules is not averred certain it was that Diego s mule and Fernandez s horse were ready at the door of the inn before Diego was ready for his second stanza so without staying to finish his ode they both mounted sallied forth passed the Rhine traversed Alsace shaped their course towards Lyons and before the Strasburgers and the abbess of Quedlingberg had set out on their cavalcade had Fernandez Diego and his Julia crossed the Pyrenean mountains and got safe to Valadolid Tis needless to inform the geographical reader that when Diego was in Spain it was not possible to meet the courteous stranger in the Frankfort road it is enough to say that of all restless desires curiosity being the strongest the Strasburgers felt the full force of it and that for three days and nights they were tossed to and fro in the Frankfort road with the tempestuous fury of this passion before they could submit to return home When alas an event was prepared for them of all other the most grievous that could befal a free people As this revolution of the Strasburgers affairs is often spoken of and little understood I will in ten words says Slawkenbergius give the world an explanation of it and with it put an end to my tale Every body knows of the grand system of Universal Monarchy wrote by order of Mons Colbert and put in manuscript into the hands of Lewis the fourteenth in the year sixteen sixty four Tis as well known that one branch out of many of that system was the getting possession of Strasburg to favour an entrance at all times into Suabia in order to disturb the quiet of Germany and that in consequence of this plan Strasburg unhappily fell at length into their hands It is the lot of a few to trace out the true springs of this and such like revolutions The vulgar look too high for them Statesmen look too low Truth for once lies in the middle What a fatal thing is the popular pride of a free city cries one historian The Strasburgers deemed it a diminution of their freedom to receive an imperial garrison so fell a prey to a French one The fate says another of the Strasburgers may be a warning to all free people to save their money They anticipated their revenues brought themselves under taxes exhausted their strength and in the end became so weak a people they had not strength to keep their gates shut and so the French pushed them open Alas alas cries Slawkenbergius twas not the French twas Curiosity pushed them open The French indeed who are ever upon the catch when they saw the Strasburgers men women and children all marched out to follow the stranger s nose each man followed his own and marched in Trade and manufactures have decayed and gradually grown down ever since but not from any cause which commercial heads have assigned for it is owing to this only that Noses have ever so run in their heads that the Strasburgers could not follow their business Alas alas cries Slawkenbergius making an exclamation it is not the first and I fear will not be the last fortress that has been either won or lost by Noses The End of Slawkenbergius s Tale Chapter two XXXVI With all this learning upon Noses running perpetually in my father s fancy with so many family prejudices and ten decades of such tales running on for ever along with them how was it possible with such exquisite was it a true nose That a man with such exquisite feelings as my father had could bear the shock at all below stairs or indeed above stairs in any other posture but the very posture I have described Throw yourself down upon the bed a dozen times taking care only to place a looking glass first in a chair on one side of it before you do it But was the stranger s nose a true nose or was it a false one To tell that before hand madam would be to do injury to one of the best tales in the Christian world and that is the tenth of the tenth decade which immediately follows this This tale cried Slawkenbergius somewhat exultingly has been reserved by me for the concluding tale of my whole work knowing right well that when I shall have told it and my reader shall have read it thro twould be even high time for both of us to shut up the book inasmuch continues Slawkenbergius as I know of no tale which could possibly ever go down after it Tis a tale indeed This sets out with the first interview in the inn at Lyons when Fernandez left the courteous stranger and his sister Julia alone in her chamber and is over written The Intricacies of Diego and Julia Heavens thou art a strange creature Slawkenbergius what a whimsical view of the involutions of the heart of woman hast thou opened how this can ever be translated and yet if this specimen of Slawkenbergius s tales and the exquisitiveness of his moral should please the world translated shall a couple of volumes be Else how this can ever be translated into good English I have no sort of conception There seems in some passages to want a sixth sense to do it rightly What can he mean by the lambent pupilability of slow low dry chat five notes below the natural tone which you know madam is little more than a whisper The moment I pronounced the words I could perceive an attempt towards a vibration in the strings about the region of the heart The brain made no acknowledgment There s often no good understanding betwixt em I felt as if I understood it I had no ideas The movement could not be without cause I m lost I can make nothing of it unless may it please your worships the voice in that case being little more than a whisper unavoidably forces the eyes to approach not only within six inches of each other but to look into the pupils is not that dangerous But it can t be avoided for to look up to the cieling in that case the two chins unavoidably meet and to look down into each other s lap the foreheads come to immediate contact which at once puts an end to the conference I mean to the sentimental part of it What is left madam is not worth stooping for Chapter two XXXVII My father lay stretched across the bed as still as if the hand of death had pushed him down for a full hour and a half before he began to play upon the floor with the toe of that foot which hung over the bed side my uncle Toby s heart was a pound lighter for it In a few moments his left hand the knuckles of which had all the time reclined upon the handle of the chamber pot came to its feeling he thrust it a little more within the valance drew up his hand when he had done into his bosom gave a hem My good uncle Toby with infinite pleasure answered it and full gladly would have ingrafted a sentence of consolation upon the opening it afforded but having no talents as I said that way and fearing moreover that he might set out with something which might make a bad matter worse he contented himself with resting his chin placidly upon the cross of his crutch Now whether the compression shortened my uncle Toby s face into a more pleasurable oval or that the philanthropy of his heart in seeing his brother beginning to emerge out of the sea of his afflictions had braced up his muscles so that the compression upon his chin only doubled the benignity which was there before is not hard to decide My father in turning his eyes was struck with such a gleam of sun shine in his face as melted down the sullenness of his grief in a moment He broke silence as follows Chapter two XXXVIII Did ever man brother Toby cried my father raising himself upon his elbow and turning himself round to the opposite side of the bed where my uncle Toby was sitting in his old fringed chair with his chin resting upon his crutch did ever a poor unfortunate man brother Toby cried my father receive so many lashes The most I ever saw given quoth my uncle Toby ringing the bell at the bed s head for Trim was to a grenadier I think in Mackay s regiment Had my uncle Toby shot a bullet through my father s heart he could not have fallen down with his nose upon the quilt more suddenly Bless me said my uncle Toby Chapter two XXXIX Was it Mackay s regiment quoth my uncle Toby where the poor grenadier was so unmercifully whipp d at Bruges about the ducats O Christ he was innocent cried Trim with a deep sigh And he was whipp d may it please your honour almost to death s door They had better have shot him outright as he begg d and he had gone directly to heaven for he was as innocent as your honour I thank thee Trim quoth my uncle Toby I never think of his continued Trim and my poor brother Tom s misfortunes for we were all three school fellows but I cry like a coward Tears are no proof of cowardice Trim I drop them oft times myself cried my uncle Toby I know your honour does replied Trim and so am not ashamed of it myself But to think may it please your honour continued Trim a tear stealing into the corner of his eye as he spoke to think of two virtuous lads with hearts as warm in their bodies and as honest as God could make them the children of honest people going forth with gallant spirits to seek their fortunes in the world and fall into such evils poor Tom to be tortured upon a rack for nothing but marrying a Jew s widow who sold sausages honest Dick Johnson s soul to be scourged out of his body for the ducats another man put into his knapsack O these are misfortunes cried Trim pulling out his handkerchief these are misfortunes may it please your honour worth lying down and crying over My father could not help blushing Twould be a pity Trim quoth my uncle Toby thou shouldst ever feel sorrow of thy own thou feelest it so tenderly for others Alack o day replied the corporal brightening up his face your honour knows I have neither wife or child I can have no sorrows in this world My father could not help smiling As few as any man Trim replied my uncle Toby nor can I see how a fellow of thy light heart can suffer but from the distress of poverty in thy old age when thou art passed all services Trim and hast outlived thy friends An please your honour never fear replied Trim chearily But I would have thee never fear Trim replied my uncle Toby and therefore continued my uncle Toby throwing down his crutch and getting up upon his legs as he uttered the word therefore in recompence Trim of thy long fidelity to me and that goodness of thy heart I have had such proofs of whilst thy master is worth a shilling thou shalt never ask elsewhere Trim for a penny Trim attempted to thank my uncle Toby but had not power tears trickled down his cheeks faster than he could wipe them off He laid his hands upon his breast made a bow to the ground and shut the door I have left Trim my bowling green cried my uncle Toby My father smiled I have left him moreover a pension continued my uncle Toby My father looked grave Chapter two XL Is this a fit time said my father to himself to talk of Pensions and Grenadiers Chapter two XLI When my uncle Toby first mentioned the grenadier my father I said fell down with his nose flat to the quilt and as suddenly as if my uncle Toby had shot him but it was not added that every other limb and member of my father instantly relapsed with his nose into the same precise attitude in which he lay first described so that when corporal Trim left the room and my father found himself disposed to rise off the bed he had all the little preparatory movements to run over again before he could do it Attitudes are nothing madam tis the transition from one attitude to another like the preparation and resolution of the discord into harmony which is all in all For which reason my father played the same jig over again with his toe upon the floor pushed the chamber pot still a little farther within the valance gave a hem raised himself up upon his elbow and was just beginning to address himself to my uncle Toby when recollecting the unsuccessfulness of his first effort in that attitude he got upon his legs and in making the third turn across the room he stopped short before my uncle Toby and laying the three first fingers of his right hand in the palm of his left and stooping a little he addressed himself to my uncle Toby as follows Chapter two XLII When I reflect brother Toby upon Man and take a view of that dark side of him which represents his life as open to so many causes of trouble when I consider brother Toby how oft we eat the bread of affliction and that we are born to it as to the portion of our inheritance I was born to nothing quoth my uncle Toby interrupting my father but my commission Zooks said my father did not my uncle leave you a hundred and twenty pounds a year What could I have done without it replied my uncle Toby That s another concern said my father testily But I say Toby when one runs over the catalogue of all the cross reckonings and sorrowful Items with which the heart of man is overcharged tis wonderful by what hidden resources the mind is enabled to stand out and bear itself up as it does against the impositions laid upon our nature Tis by the assistance of Almighty God cried my uncle Toby looking up and pressing the palms of his hands close together tis not from our own strength brother Shandy a centinel in a wooden centry box might as well pretend to stand it out against a detachment of fifty men We are upheld by the grace and the assistance of the best of Beings That is cutting the knot said my father instead of untying it But give me leave to lead you brother Toby a little deeper into the mystery With all my heart replied my uncle Toby My father instantly exchanged the attitude he was in for that in which Socrates is so finely painted by Raffael in his school of Athens which your connoisseurship knows is so exquisitely imagined that even the particular manner of the reasoning of Socrates is expressed by it for he holds the fore finger of his left hand between the fore finger and the thumb of his right and seems as if he was saying to the libertine he is reclaiming You grant me this and this and this and this I don t ask of you they follow of themselves in course So stood my father holding fast his fore finger betwixt his finger and his thumb and reasoning with my uncle Toby as he sat in his old fringed chair valanced around with party coloured worsted bobs O Garrick what a rich scene of this would thy exquisite powers make and how gladly would I write such another to avail myself of thy immortality and secure my own behind it Chapter two XLIII Though man is of all others the most curious vehicle said my father yet at the same time tis of so slight a frame and so totteringly put together that the sudden jerks and hard jostlings it unavoidably meets with in this rugged journey would overset and tear it to pieces a dozen times a day was it not brother Toby that there is a secret spring within us Which spring said my uncle Toby I take to be Religion Will that set my child s nose on cried my father letting go his finger and striking one hand against the other It makes every thing straight for us answered my uncle Toby Figuratively speaking dear Toby it may for aught I know said my father but the spring I am speaking of is that great and elastic power within us of counterbalancing evil which like a secret spring in a well ordered machine though it can t prevent the shock at least it imposes upon our sense of it Now my dear brother said my father replacing his fore finger as he was coming closer to the point had my child arrived safe into the world unmartyr d in that precious part of him fanciful and extravagant as I may appear to the world in my opinion of christian names and of that magic bias which good or bad names irresistibly impress upon our characters and conducts Heaven is witness that in the warmest transports of my wishes for the prosperity of my child I never once wished to crown his head with more glory and honour than what George or Edward would have spread around it But alas continued my father as the greatest evil has befallen him I must counteract and undo it with the greatest good He shall be christened Trismegistus brother I wish it may answer replied my uncle Toby rising up Chapter two XLIV What a chapter of chances said my father turning himself about upon the first landing as he and my uncle Toby were going down stairs what a long chapter of chances do the events of this world lay open to us Take pen and ink in hand brother Toby and calculate it fairly I know no more of calculation than this balluster said my uncle Toby striking short of it with his crutch and hitting my father a desperate blow souse upon his shin bone Twas a hundred to one cried my uncle Toby I thought quoth my father rubbing his shin you had known nothing of calculations brother Toby A mere chance said my uncle Toby Then it adds one to the chapter replied my father The double success of my father s repartees tickled off the pain of his shin at once it was well it so fell out chance again or the world to this day had never known the subject of my father s calculation to guess it there was no chance What a lucky chapter of chances has this turned out for it has saved me the trouble of writing one express and in truth I have enough already upon my hands without it Have not I promised the world a chapter of knots two chapters upon the right and the wrong end of a woman a chapter upon whiskers a chapter upon wishes a chapter of noses No I have done that a chapter upon my uncle Toby s modesty to say nothing of a chapter upon chapters which I will finish before I sleep by my great grandfather s whiskers I shall never get half of em through this year Take pen and ink in hand and calculate it fairly brother Toby said my father and it will turn out a million to one that of all the parts of the body the edge of the forceps should have the ill luck just to fall upon and break down that one part which should break down the fortunes of our house with it It might have been worse replied my uncle Toby I don t comprehend said my father Suppose the hip had presented replied my uncle Toby as doctor Slop foreboded My father reflected half a minute looked down touched the middle of his forehead slightly with his finger True said he Chapter two XLV Is it not a shame to make two chapters of what passed in going down one pair of stairs for we are got no farther yet than to the first landing and there are fifteen more steps down to the bottom and for aught I know as my father and my uncle Toby are in a talking humour there may be as many chapters as steps let that be as it will Sir I can no more help it than my destiny A sudden impulse comes across me drop the curtain Shandy I drop it Strike a line here across the paper Tristram I strike it and hey for a new chapter The deuce of any other rule have I to govern myself by in this affair and if I had one as I do all things out of all rule I would twist it and tear it to pieces and throw it into the fire when I had done Am I warm I am and the cause demands it a pretty story is a man to follow rules or rules to follow him Now this you must know being my chapter upon chapters which I promised to write before I went to sleep I thought it meet to ease my conscience entirely before I laid down by telling the world all I knew about the matter at once Is not this ten times better than to set out dogmatically with a sententious parade of wisdom and telling the world a story of a roasted horse that chapters relieve the mind that they assist or impose upon the imagination and that in a work of this dramatic cast they are as necessary as the shifting of scenes with fifty other cold conceits enough to extinguish the fire which roasted him O but to understand this which is a puff at the fire of Diana s temple you must read Longinus read away if you are not a jot the wiser by reading him the first time over never fear read him again Avicenna and Licetus read Aristotle s metaphysicks forty times through a piece and never understood a single word But mark the consequence Avicenna turned out a desperate writer at all kinds of writing for he wrote books de omni scribili and for Licetus Fortunio though all the world knows he was born a foetus Ce Foetus n etoit pas plus grand que la paume de la main mais son pere l ayant examine en qualite de Medecin ayant trouve que c etoit quelque chose de plus qu un Embryon le fit transporter tout vivant a Rapallo ou il le fit voir a Jerome Bardi a d autres Medecins du lieu On trouva qu il ne lui manquoit rien d essentiel a la vie son pere pour faire voir un essai de son experience entreprit d achever l ouvrage de la Nature de travailler a la formation de l Enfant avec le meme artifice que celui dont on se sert pour faire ecclorre les Poulets en Egypte Il instruisit une Nourisse de tout ce qu elle avoit a faire ayant fait mettre son fils dans un pour proprement accommode il reussit a l elever a lui faire prendre ses accroissemens necessaires par l uniformite d une chaleur etrangere mesuree exactement sur les degres d un Thermometre ou d un autre instrument equivalent Vide Mich Giustinian ne gli Scritt Liguri a two hundred twenty three four hundred eighty eight On auroit toujours ete tres satisfait de l industrie d un pere si experimente dans l Art de la Generation quand il n auroit pu prolonger la vie a son fils que pour Puelques mois ou pour peu d annees Mais quand on se represente que l Enfant a vecu pres de quatre vingts ans qu il a compose quatre vingts Ouvrages differents tous fruits d une longue lecture il faut convenir que tout ce qui est incroyable n est pas toujours faux que la Vraisemblance n est pas toujours du cote la Verite Il n avoit que dix neuf ans lorsqu il composa Gonopsychanthropologia de Origine Animae humanae Les Enfans celebres revus corriges par M de la Monnoye de l Academie Francoise of no more than five inches and a half in length yet he grew to that astonishing height in literature as to write a book with a title as long as himself the learned know I mean his Gonopsychanthropologia upon the origin of the human soul So much for my chapter upon chapters which I hold to be the best chapter in my whole work and take my word whoever reads it is full as well employed as in picking straws Chapter two XLVI We shall bring all things to rights said my father setting his foot upon the first step from the landing This Trismegistus continued my father drawing his leg back and turning to my uncle Toby was the greatest Toby of all earthly beings he was the greatest king the greatest lawgiver the greatest philosopher and the greatest priest and engineer said my uncle Toby In course said my father Chapter two XLVII And how does your mistress cried my father taking the same step over again from the landing and calling to Susannah whom he saw passing by the foot of the stairs with a huge pin cushion in her hand how does your mistress As well said Susannah tripping by but without looking up as can be expected What a fool am I said my father drawing his leg back again let things be as they will brother Toby tis ever the precise answer And how is the child pray No answer And where is doctor Slop added my father raising his voice aloud and looking over the ballusters Susannah was out of hearing Of all the riddles of a married life said my father crossing the landing in order to set his back against the wall whilst he propounded it to my uncle Toby of all the puzzling riddles said he in a marriage state of which you may trust me brother Toby there are more asses loads than all Job s stock of asses could have carried there is not one that has more intricacies in it than this that from the very moment the mistress of the house is brought to bed every female in it from my lady s gentlewoman down to the cinder wench becomes an inch taller for it and give themselves more airs upon that single inch than all their other inches put together I think rather replied my uncle Toby that tis we who sink an inch lower If I meet but a woman with child I do it Tis a heavy tax upon that half of our fellow creatures brother Shandy said my uncle Toby Tis a piteous burden upon em continued he shaking his head Yes yes tis a painful thing said my father shaking his head too but certainly since shaking of heads came into fashion never did two heads shake together in concert from two such different springs God bless Deuce take em all said my uncle Toby and my father each to himself Chapter two XVLIII Holla you chairman here s sixpence do step into that bookseller s shop and call me a day tall critick I am very willing to give any one of em a crown to help me with his tackling to get my father and my uncle Toby off the stairs and to put them to bed Tis even high time for except a short nap which they both got whilst Trim was boring the jack boots and which by the bye did my father no sort of good upon the score of the bad hinge they have not else shut their eyes since nine hours before the time that doctor Slop was led into the back parlour in that dirty pickle by Obadiah Was every day of my life to be as busy a day as this and to take up Truce I will not finish that sentence till I have made an observation upon the strange state of affairs between the reader and myself just as things stand at present an observation never applicable before to any one biographical writer since the creation of the world but to myself and I believe will never hold good to any other until its final destruction and therefore for the very novelty of it alone it must be worth your worships attending to I am this month one whole year older than I was this time twelve month and having got as you perceive almost into the middle of my third volume According to the preceding Editions and no farther than to my first day s life tis demonstrative that I have three hundred and sixty four days more life to write just now than when I first set out so that instead of advancing as a common writer in my work with what I have been doing at it on the contrary I am just thrown so many volumes back was every day of my life to be as busy a day as this And why not and the transactions and opinions of it to take up as much description And for what reason should they be cut short as at this rate I should just live three hundred sixty four times faster than I should write It must follow an please your worships that the more I write the more I shall have to write and consequently the more your worships read the more your worships will have to read Will this be good for your worships eyes It will do well for mine and was it not that my Opinions will be the death of me I perceive I shall lead a fine life of it out of this self same life of mine or in other words shall lead a couple of fine lives together As for the proposal of twelve volumes a year or a volume a month it no way alters my prospect write as I will and rush as I may into the middle of things as Horace advises I shall never overtake myself whipp d and driven to the last pinch at the worst I shall have one day the start of my pen and one day is enough for two volumes and two volumes will be enough for one year Heaven prosper the manufacturers of paper under this propitious reign which is now opened to us as I trust its providence will prosper every thing else in it that is taken in hand As for the propagation of Geese I give myself no concern Nature is all bountiful I shall never want tools to work with So then friend you have got my father and my uncle Toby off the stairs and seen them to bed And how did you manage it You dropp d a curtain at the stair foot I thought you had no other way for it Here s a crown for your trouble Chapter two XLIX Then reach me my breeches off the chair said my father to Susannah There is not a moment s time to dress you Sir cried Susannah the child is as black in the face as my As your what said my father for like all orators he was a dear searcher into comparisons Bless me Sir said Susannah the child s in a fit And where s mister Yorick Never where he should be said Susannah but his curate s in the dressing room with the child upon his arm waiting for the name and my mistress bid me run as fast as I could to know as captain Shandy is the godfather whether it should not be called after him Were one sure said my father to himself scratching his eye brow that the child was expiring one might as well compliment my brother Toby as not and it would be a pity in such a case to throw away so great a name as Trismegistus upon him but he may recover No no said my father to Susannah I ll get up There is no time cried Susannah the child s as black as my shoe Trismegistus said my father But stay thou art a leaky vessel Susannah added my father canst thou carry Trismegistus in thy head the length of the gallery without scattering Can I cried Susannah shutting the door in a huff If she can I ll be shot said my father bouncing out of bed in the dark and groping for his breeches Susannah ran with all speed along the gallery My father made all possible speed to find his breeches Susannah got the start and kept it Tis Tris something cried Susannah There is no christian name in the world said the curate beginning with Tris but Tristram Then tis Tristram gistus quoth Susannah There is no gistus to it noodle tis my own name replied the curate dipping his hand as he spoke into the bason Tristram said he c c c c so Tristram was I called and Tristram shall I be to the day of my death My father followed Susannah with his night gown across his arm with nothing more than his breeches on fastened through haste with but a single button and that button through haste thrust only half into the button hole She has not forgot the name cried my father half opening the door No no said the curate with a tone of intelligence And the child is better cried Susannah And how does your mistress As well said Susannah as can be expected Pish said my father the button of his breeches slipping out of the button hole So that whether the interjection was levelled at Susannah or the button hole whether Pish was an interjection of contempt or an interjection of modesty is a doubt and must be a doubt till I shall have time to write the three following favourite chapters that is my chapter of chamber maids my chapter of pishes and my chapter of button holes All the light I am able to give the reader at present is this that the moment my father cried Pish he whisk d himself about and with his breeches held up by one hand and his night gown thrown across the arm of the other he turned along the gallery to bed something slower than he came Chapter two L I wish I could write a chapter upon sleep A fitter occasion could never have presented itself than what this moment offers when all the curtains of the family are drawn the candles put out and no creature s eyes are open but a single one for the other has been shut these twenty years of my mother s nurse It is a fine subject And yet as fine as it is I would undertake to write a dozen chapters upon button holes both quicker and with more fame than a single chapter upon this Button holes there is something lively in the very idea of em and trust me when I get amongst em You gentry with great beards look as grave as you will I ll make merry work with my button holes I shall have em all to myself tis a maiden subject I shall run foul of no man s wisdom or fine sayings in it But for sleep I know I shall make nothing of it before I begin I am no dab at your fine sayings in the first place and in the next I cannot for my soul set a grave face upon a bad matter and tell the world tis the refuge of the unfortunate the enfranchisement of the prisoner the downy lap of the hopeless the weary and the broken hearted nor could I set out with a lye in my mouth by affirming that of all the soft and delicious functions of our nature by which the great Author of it in his bounty has been pleased to recompence the sufferings wherewith his justice and his good pleasure has wearied us that this is the chiefest I know pleasures worth ten of it or what a happiness it is to man when the anxieties and passions of the day are over and he lies down upon his back that his soul shall be so seated within him that whichever way she turns her eyes the heavens shall look calm and sweet above her no desire or fear or doubt that troubles the air nor any difficulty past present or to come that the imagination may not pass over without offence in that sweet secession God s blessing said Sancho Panca be upon the man who first invented this self same thing called sleep it covers a man all over like a cloak Now there is more to me in this and it speaks warmer to my heart and affections than all the dissertations squeez d out of the heads of the learned together upon the subject Not that I altogether disapprove of what Montaigne advances upon it tis admirable in its way I quote by memory The world enjoys other pleasures says he as they do that of sleep without tasting or feeling it as it slips and passes by We should study and ruminate upon it in order to render proper thanks to him who grants it to us For this end I cause myself to be disturbed in my sleep that I may the better and more sensibly relish it And yet I see few says he again who live with less sleep when need requires my body is capable of a firm but not of a violent and sudden agitation I evade of late all violent exercises I am never weary with walking but from my youth I never looked to ride upon pavements I love to lie hard and alone and even without my wife This last word may stagger the faith of the world but remember La Vraisemblance as Bayle says in the affair of Liceti n est pas toujours du Cote de la Verite And so much for sleep Chapter two LI If my wife will but venture him brother Toby Trismegistus shall be dress d and brought down to us whilst you and I are getting our breakfasts together Go tell Susannah Obadiah to step here She is run up stairs answered Obadiah this very instant sobbing and crying and wringing her hands as if her heart would break We shall have a rare month of it said my father turning his head from Obadiah and looking wistfully in my uncle Toby s face for some time we shall have a devilish month of it brother Toby said my father setting his arms a kimbo and shaking his head fire water women wind brother Toby Tis some misfortune quoth my uncle Toby That it is cried my father to have so many jarring elements breaking loose and riding triumph in every corner of a gentleman s house Little boots it to the peace of a family brother Toby that you and I possess ourselves and sit here silent and unmoved whilst such a storm is whistling over our heads And what s the matter Susannah They have called the child Tristram and my mistress is just got out of an hysterick fit about it No tis not my fault said Susannah I told him it was Tristram gistus Make tea for yourself brother Toby said my father taking down his hat but how different from the sallies and agitations of voice and members which a common reader would imagine For he spake in the sweetest modulation and took down his hat with the genteelest movement of limbs that ever affliction harmonized and attuned together Go to the bowling green for corporal Trim said my uncle Toby speaking to Obadiah as soon as my father left the room Chapter two LII When the misfortune of my Nose fell so heavily upon my father s head the reader remembers that he walked instantly up stairs and cast himself down upon his bed and from hence unless he has a great insight into human nature he will be apt to expect a rotation of the same ascending and descending movements from him upon this misfortune of my Name no The different weight dear Sir nay even the different package of two vexations of the same weight makes a very wide difference in our manner of bearing and getting through with them It is not half an hour ago when in the great hurry and precipitation of a poor devil s writing for daily bread I threw a fair sheet which I had just finished and carefully wrote out slap into the fire instead of the foul one Instantly I snatch d off my wig and threw it perpendicularly with all imaginable violence up to the top of the room indeed I caught it as it fell but there was an end of the matter nor do I think any think else in Nature would have given such immediate ease She dear Goddess by an instantaneous impulse in all provoking cases determines us to a sally of this or that member or else she thrusts us into this or that place or posture of body we know not why But mark madam we live amongst riddles and mysteries the most obvious things which come in our way have dark sides which the quickest sight cannot penetrate into and even the clearest and most exalted understandings amongst us find ourselves puzzled and at a loss in almost every cranny of nature s works so that this like a thousand other things falls out for us in a way which tho we cannot reason upon it yet we find the good of it may it please your reverences and your worships and that s enough for us Now my father could not lie down with this affliction for his life nor could he carry it up stairs like the other he walked composedly out with it to the fish pond Had my father leaned his head upon his hand and reasoned an hour which way to have gone reason with all her force could not have directed him to any think like it there is something Sir in fish ponds but what it is I leave to system builders and fish pond diggers betwixt em to find out but there is something under the first disorderly transport of the humours so unaccountably becalming in an orderly and a sober walk towards one of them that I have often wondered that neither Pythagoras nor Plato nor Solon nor Lycurgus nor Mahomet nor any one of your noted lawgivers ever gave order about them Chapter two LIII Your honour said Trim shutting the parlour door before he began to speak has heard I imagine of this unlucky accident O yes Trim said my uncle Toby and it gives me great concern I am heartily concerned too but I hope your honour replied Trim will do me the justice to believe that it was not in the least owing to me To thee Trim cried my uncle Toby looking kindly in his face twas Susannah s and the curate s folly betwixt them What business could they have together an please your honour in the garden In the gallery thou meanest replied my uncle Toby Trim found he was upon a wrong scent and stopped short with a low bow Two misfortunes quoth the corporal to himself are twice as many at least as are needful to be talked over at one time the mischief the cow has done in breaking into the fortifications may be told his honour hereafter Trim s casuistry and address under the cover of his low bow prevented all suspicion in my uncle Toby so he went on with what he had to say to Trim as follows For my own part Trim though I can see little or no difference betwixt my nephew s being called Tristram or Trismegistus yet as the thing sits so near my brother s heart Trim I would freely have given a hundred pounds rather than it should have happened A hundred pounds an please your honour replied Trim I would not give a cherry stone to boot Nor would I Trim upon my own account quoth my uncle Toby but my brother whom there is no arguing with in this case maintains that a great deal more depends Trim upon christian names than what ignorant people imagine for he says there never was a great or heroic action performed since the world began by one called Tristram nay he will have it Trim that a man can neither be learned or wise or brave Tis all fancy an please your honour I fought just as well replied the corporal when the regiment called me Trim as when they called me James Butler And for my own part said my uncle Toby though I should blush to boast of myself Trim yet had my name been Alexander I could have done no more at Namur than my duty Bless your honour cried Trim advancing three steps as he spoke does a man think of his christian name when he goes upon the attack Or when he stands in the trench Trim cried my uncle Toby looking firm Or when he enters a breach said Trim pushing in between two chairs Or forces the lines cried my uncle rising up and pushing his crutch like a pike Or facing a platoon cried Trim presenting his stick like a firelock Or when he marches up the glacis cried my uncle Toby looking warm and setting his foot upon his stool Chapter two LIV My father was returned from his walk to the fish pond and opened the parlour door in the very height of the attack just as my uncle Toby was marching up the glacis Trim recovered his arms never was my uncle Toby caught in riding at such a desperate rate in his life Alas my uncle Toby had not a weightier matter called forth all the ready eloquence of my father how hadst thou then and thy poor Hobby Horse too been insulted My father hung up his hat with the same air he took it down and after giving a slight look at the disorder of the room he took hold of one of the chairs which had formed the corporal s breach and placing it over against my uncle Toby he sat down in it and as soon as the tea things were taken away and the door shut he broke out in a lamentation as follows My Father s Lamentation It is in vain longer said my father addressing himself as much to Ernulphus s curse which was laid upon the corner of the chimney piece as to my uncle Toby who sat under it it is in vain longer said my father in the most querulous monotony imaginable to struggle as I have done against this most uncomfortable of human persuasions I see it plainly that either for my own sins brother Toby or the sins and follies of the Shandy family Heaven has thought fit to draw forth the heaviest of its artillery against me and that the prosperity of my child is the point upon which the whole force of it is directed to play Such a thing would batter the whole universe about our ears brother Shandy said my uncle Toby if it was so Unhappy Tristram child of wrath child of decrepitude interruption mistake and discontent What one misfortune or disaster in the book of embryotic evils that could unmechanize thy frame or entangle thy filaments which has not fallen upon thy head or ever thou camest into the world what evils in thy passage into it what evils since produced into being in the decline of thy father s days when the powers of his imagination and of his body were waxing feeble when radical heat and radical moisture the elements which should have temper d thine were drying up and nothing left to found thy stamina in but negations tis pitiful brother Toby at the best and called out for all the little helps that care and attention on both sides could give it But how were we defeated You know the event brother Toby tis too melancholy a one to be repeated now when the few animal spirits I was worth in the world and with which memory fancy and quick parts should have been convey d were all dispersed confused confounded scattered and sent to the devil Here then was the time to have put a stop to this persecution against him and tried an experiment at least whether calmness and serenity of mind in your sister with a due attention brother Toby to her evacuations and repletions and the rest of her non naturals might not in a course of nine months gestation have set all things to rights My child was bereft of these What a teazing life did she lead herself and consequently her foetus too with that nonsensical anxiety of hers about lying in in town I thought my sister submitted with the greatest patience replied my uncle Toby I never heard her utter one fretful word about it She fumed inwardly cried my father and that let me tell you brother was ten times worse for the child and then what battles did she fight with me and what perpetual storms about the midwife There she gave vent said my uncle Toby Vent cried my father looking up But what was all this my dear Toby to the injuries done us by my child s coming head foremost into the world when all I wished in this general wreck of his frame was to have saved this little casket unbroke unrifled With all my precautions how was my system turned topside turvy in the womb with my child his head exposed to the hand of violence and a pressure of four hundred seventy pounds avoirdupois weight acting so perpendicularly upon its apex that at this hour tis ninety per Cent insurance that the fine net work of the intellectual web be not rent and torn to a thousand tatters Still we could have done Fool coxcomb puppy give him but a Nose Cripple Dwarf Driveller Goosecap shape him as you will the door of fortune stands open O Licetus Licetus had I been blest with a foetus five inches long and a half like thee Fate might have done her worst Still brother Toby there was one cast of the dye left for our child after all O Tristram Tristram Tristram We will send for mister Yorick said my uncle Toby You may send for whom you will replied my father Chapter two LV What a rate have I gone on at curvetting and striking it away two up and two down for three volumes According to the preceding Editions together without looking once behind or even on one side of me to see whom I trod upon I ll tread upon no one quoth I to myself when I mounted I ll take a good rattling gallop but I ll not hurt the poorest jack ass upon the road So off I set up one lane down another through this turnpike over that as if the arch jockey of jockeys had got behind me Now ride at this rate with what good intention and resolution you may tis a million to one you ll do some one a mischief if not yourself He s flung he s off he s lost his hat he s down he ll break his neck see if he has not galloped full among the scaffolding of the undertaking criticks he ll knock his brains out against some of their posts he s bounced out look he s now riding like a mad cap full tilt through a whole crowd of painters fiddlers poets biographers physicians lawyers logicians players school men churchmen statesmen soldiers casuists connoisseurs prelates popes and engineers Don t fear said I I ll not hurt the poorest jack ass upon the king s highway But your horse throws dirt see you ve splash d a bishop I hope in God twas only Ernulphus said I But you have squirted full in the faces of Mess Le Moyne De Romigny and De Marcilly doctors of the Sorbonne That was last year replied I But you have trod this moment upon a king Kings have bad times on t said I to be trod upon by such people as me You have done it replied my accuser I deny it quoth I and so have got off and here am I standing with my bridle in one hand and with my cap in the other to tell my story And what in it You shall hear in the next chapter Chapter two LVI As Francis the first of France was one winterly night warming himself over the embers of a wood fire and talking with his first minister of sundry things for the good of the state Vide Menagiana Vol I It would not be amiss said the king stirring up the embers with his cane if this good understanding betwixt ourselves and Switzerland was a little strengthened There is no end Sire replied the minister in giving money to these people they would swallow up the treasury of France Poo poo answered the king there are more ways Mons le Premier of bribing states besides that of giving money I ll pay Switzerland the honour of standing godfather for my next child Your majesty said the minister in so doing would have all the grammarians in Europe upon your back Switzerland as a republic being a female can in no construction be godfather She may be godmother replied Francis hastily so announce my intentions by a courier to morrow morning

slips and giving them about him to light their pipes Tis abominable answered Didius it should not go unnoticed said doctor Kysarcius he was of the Kysarcii of the Low Countries Methinks said Didius half rising from his chair in order to remove a bottle and a tall decanter which stood in a direct line betwixt him and Yorick you might have spared this sarcastic stroke and have hit upon a more proper place mister Yorick or at least upon a more proper occasion to have shewn your contempt of what we have been about If the sermon is of no better worth than to light pipes with twas certainly Sir not good enough to be preached before so learned a body and if twas good enough to be preached before so learned a body twas certainly Sir too good to light their pipes with afterwards I have got him fast hung up quoth Didius to himself upon one of the two horns of my dilemma let him get off as he can I have undergone such unspeakable torments in bringing forth this sermon quoth Yorick upon this occasion that I declare Didius I would suffer martyrdom and if it was possible my horse with me a thousand times over before I would sit down and make such another I was delivered of it at the wrong end of me it came from my head instead of my heart and it is for the pain it gave me both in the writing and preaching of it that I revenge myself of it in this manner To preach to shew the extent of our reading or the subtleties of our wit to parade in the eyes of the vulgar with the beggarly accounts of a little learning tinsel d over with a few words which glitter but convey little light and less warmth is a dishonest use of the poor single half hour in a week which is put into our hands Tis not preaching the gospel but ourselves For my own part continued Yorick I had rather direct five words point blank to the heart As Yorick pronounced the word point blank my uncle Toby rose up to say something upon projectiles when a single word and no more uttered from the opposite side of the table drew every one s ears towards it a word of all others in the dictionary the last in that place to be expected a word I am ashamed to write yet must be written must be read illegal uncanonical guess ten thousand guesses multiplied into themselves rack torture your invention for ever you re where you was In short I ll tell it in the next chapter Chapter two LXII Zounds Z ds cried Phutatorius partly to himself and yet high enough to be heard and what seemed odd twas uttered in a construction of look and in a tone of voice somewhat between that of a man in amazement and one in bodily pain One or two who had very nice ears and could distinguish the expression and mixture of the two tones as plainly as a third or a fifth or any other chord in musick were the most puzzled and perplexed with it the concord was good in itself but then twas quite out of the key and no way applicable to the subject started so that with all their knowledge they could not tell what in the world to make of it Others who knew nothing of musical expression and merely lent their ears to the plain import of the word imagined that Phutatorius who was somewhat of a cholerick spirit was just going to snatch the cudgels out of Didius s hands in order to bemaul Yorick to some purpose and that the desperate monosyllable Z ds was the exordium to an oration which as they judged from the sample presaged but a rough kind of handling of him so that my uncle Toby s good nature felt a pang for what Yorick was about to undergo But seeing Phutatorius stop short without any attempt or desire to go on a third party began to suppose that it was no more than an involuntary respiration casually forming itself into the shape of a twelve penny oath without the sin or substance of one Others and especially one or two who sat next him looked upon it on the contrary as a real and substantial oath propensly formed against Yorick to whom he was known to bear no good liking which said oath as my father philosophized upon it actually lay fretting and fuming at that very time in the upper regions of Phutatorius s purtenance and so was naturally and according to the due course of things first squeezed out by the sudden influx of blood which was driven into the right ventricle of Phutatorius s heart by the stroke of surprize which so strange a theory of preaching had excited How finely we argue upon mistaken facts There was not a soul busied in all these various reasonings upon the monosyllable which Phutatorius uttered who did not take this for granted proceeding upon it as from an axiom namely that Phutatorius s mind was intent upon the subject of debate which was arising between Didius and Yorick and indeed as he looked first towards the one and then towards the other with the air of a man listening to what was going forwards who would not have thought the same But the truth was that Phutatorius knew not one word or one syllable of what was passing but his whole thoughts and attention were taken up with a transaction which was going forwards at that very instant within the precincts of his own Galligaskins and in a part of them where of all others he stood most interested to watch accidents So that notwithstanding he looked with all the attention in the world and had gradually skrewed up every nerve and muscle in his face to the utmost pitch the instrument would bear in order as it was thought to give a sharp reply to Yorick who sat over against him yet I say was Yorick never once in any one domicile of Phutatorius s brain but the true cause of his exclamation lay at least a yard below This I will endeavour to explain to you with all imaginable decency You must be informed then that Gastripheres who had taken a turn into the kitchen a little before dinner to see how things went on observing a wicker basket of fine chesnuts standing upon the dresser had ordered that a hundred or two of them might be roasted and sent in as soon as dinner was over Gastripheres inforcing his orders about them that Didius but Phutatorius especially were particularly fond of em About two minutes before the time that my uncle Toby interrupted Yorick s harangue Gastripheres s chesnuts were brought in and as Phutatorius s fondness for em was uppermost in the waiter s head he laid them directly before Phutatorius wrapt up hot in a clean damask napkin Now whether it was physically impossible with half a dozen hands all thrust into the napkin at a time but that some one chesnut of more life and rotundity than the rest must be put in motion it so fell out however that one was actually sent rolling off the table and as Phutatorius sat straddling under it fell perpendicularly into that particular aperture of Phutatorius s breeches for which to the shame and indelicacy of our language be it spoke there is no chaste word throughout all Johnson s dictionary let it suffice to say it was that particular aperture which in all good societies the laws of decorum do strictly require like the temple of Janus in peace at least to be universally shut up The neglect of this punctilio in Phutatorius which by the bye should be a warning to all mankind had opened a door to this accident Accident I call it in compliance to a received mode of speaking but in no opposition to the opinion either of Acrites or Mythogeras in this matter I know they were both prepossessed and fully persuaded of it and are so to this hour That there was nothing of accident in the whole event but that the chesnut s taking that particular course and in a manner of its own accord and then falling with all its heat directly into that one particular place and no other was a real judgment upon Phutatorius for that filthy and obscene treatise de Concubinis retinendis which Phutatorius had published about twenty years ago and was that identical week going to give the world a second edition of It is not my business to dip my pen in this controversy much undoubtedly may be wrote on both sides of the question all that concerns me as an historian is to represent the matter of fact and render it credible to the reader that the hiatus in Phutatorius s breeches was sufficiently wide to receive the chesnut and that the chesnut somehow or other did fall perpendicularly and piping hot into it without Phutatorius s perceiving it or any one else at that time The genial warmth which the chesnut imparted was not undelectable for the first twenty or five and twenty seconds and did no more than gently solicit Phutatorius s attention towards the part But the heat gradually increasing and in a few seconds more getting beyond the point of all sober pleasure and then advancing with all speed into the regions of pain the soul of Phutatorius together with all his ideas his thoughts his attention his imagination judgment resolution deliberation ratiocination memory fancy with ten battalions of animal spirits all tumultuously crowded down through different defiles and circuits to the place of danger leaving all his upper regions as you may imagine as empty as my purse With the best intelligence which all these messengers could bring him back Phutatorius was not able to dive into the secret of what was going forwards below nor could he make any kind of conjecture what the devil was the matter with it However as he knew not what the true cause might turn out he deemed it most prudent in the situation he was in at present to bear it if possible like a Stoick which with the help of some wry faces and compursions of the mouth he had certainly accomplished had his imagination continued neuter but the sallies of the imagination are ungovernable in things of this kind a thought instantly darted into his mind that tho the anguish had the sensation of glowing heat it might notwithstanding that be a bite as well as a burn and if so that possibly a Newt or an Asker or some such detested reptile had crept up and was fastening his teeth the horrid idea of which with a fresh glow of pain arising that instant from the chesnut seized Phutatorius with a sudden panick and in the first terrifying disorder of the passion it threw him as it has done the best generals upon earth quite off his guard the effect of which was this that he leapt incontinently up uttering as he rose that interjection of surprise so much descanted upon with the aposiopestic break after it marked thus Z ds which though not strictly canonical was still as little as any man could have said upon the occasion and which by the bye whether canonical or not Phutatorius could no more help than he could the cause of it Though this has taken up some time in the narrative it took up little more time in the transaction than just to allow time for Phutatorius to draw forth the chesnut and throw it down with violence upon the floor and for Yorick to rise from his chair and pick the chesnut up It is curious to observe the triumph of slight incidents over the mind What incredible weight they have in forming and governing our opinions both of men and things that trifles light as air shall waft a belief into the soul and plant it so immoveably within it that Euclid s demonstrations could they be brought to batter it in breach should not all have power to overthrow it Yorick I said picked up the chesnut which Phutatorius s wrath had flung down the action was trifling I am ashamed to account for it he did it for no reason but that he thought the chesnut not a jot worse for the adventure and that he held a good chesnut worth stooping for But this incident trifling as it was wrought differently in Phutatorius s head He considered this act of Yorick s in getting off his chair and picking up the chesnut as a plain acknowledgment in him that the chesnut was originally his and in course that it must have been the owner of the chesnut and no one else who could have played him such a prank with it What greatly confirmed him in this opinion was this that the table being parallelogramical and very narrow it afforded a fair opportunity for Yorick who sat directly over against Phutatorius of slipping the chesnut in and consequently that he did it The look of something more than suspicion which Phutatorius cast full upon Yorick as these thoughts arose too evidently spoke his opinion and as Phutatorius was naturally supposed to know more of the matter than any person besides his opinion at once became the general one and for a reason very different from any which have been yet given in a little time it was put out of all manner of dispute When great or unexpected events fall out upon the stage of this sublunary world the mind of man which is an inquisitive kind of a substance naturally takes a flight behind the scenes to see what is the cause and first spring of them The search was not long in this instance It was well known that Yorick had never a good opinion of the treatise which Phutatorius had wrote de Concubinis retinendis as a thing which he feared had done hurt in the world and twas easily found out that there was a mystical meaning in Yorick s prank and that his chucking the chesnut hot into Phutatorius s was a sarcastical fling at his book the doctrines of which they said had enflamed many an honest man in the same place This conceit awaken d Somnolentus made Agelastes smile and if you can recollect the precise look and air of a man s face intent in finding out a riddle it threw Gastripheres s into that form and in short was thought by many to be a master stroke of arch wit This as the reader has seen from one end to the other was as groundless as the dreams of philosophy Yorick no doubt as Shakespeare said of his ancestor was a man of jest but it was temper d with something which withheld him from that and many other ungracious pranks of which he as undeservedly bore the blame but it was his misfortune all his life long to bear the imputation of saying and doing a thousand things of which unless my esteem blinds me his nature was incapable All I blame him for or rather all I blame and alternately like him for was that singularity of his temper which would never suffer him to take pains to set a story right with the world however in his power In every ill usage of that sort he acted precisely as in the affair of his lean horse he could have explained it to his honour but his spirit was above it and besides he ever looked upon the inventor the propagator and believer of an illiberal report alike so injurious to him he could not stoop to tell his story to them and so trusted to time and truth to do it for him This heroic cast produced him inconveniences in many respects in the present it was followed by the fixed resentment of Phutatorius who as Yorick had just made an end of his chesnut rose up from his chair a second time to let him know it which indeed he did with a smile saying only that he would endeavour not to forget the obligation But you must mark and carefully separate and distinguish these two things in your mind The smile was for the company The threat was for Yorick Chapter two LXIII Can you tell me quoth Phutatorius speaking to Gastripheres who sat next to him for one would not apply to a surgeon in so foolish an affair can you tell me Gastripheres what is best to take out the fire Ask Eugenius said Gastripheres That greatly depends said Eugenius pretending ignorance of the adventure upon the nature of the part If it is a tender part and a part which can conveniently be wrapt up It is both the one and the other replied Phutatorius laying his hand as he spoke with an emphatical nod of his head upon the part in question and lifting up his right leg at the same time to ease and ventilate it If that is the case said Eugenius I would advise you Phutatorius not to tamper with it by any means but if you will send to the next printer and trust your cure to such a simple thing as a soft sheet of paper just come off the press you need do nothing more than twist it round The damp paper quoth Yorick who sat next to his friend Eugenius though I know it has a refreshing coolness in it yet I presume is no more than the vehicle and that the oil and lamp black with which the paper is so strongly impregnated does the business Right said Eugenius and is of any outward application I would venture to recommend the most anodyne and safe Was it my case said Gastripheres as the main thing is the oil and lamp black I should spread them thick upon a rag and clap it on directly That would make a very devil of it replied Yorick And besides added Eugenius it would not answer the intention which is the extreme neatness and elegance of the prescription which the Faculty hold to be half in half for consider if the type is a very small one which it should be the sanative particles which come into contact in this form have the advantage of being spread so infinitely thin and with such a mathematical equality fresh paragraphs and large capitals excepted as no art or management of the spatula can come up to It falls out very luckily replied Phutatorius that the second edition of my treatise de Concubinis retinendis is at this instant in the press You may take any leaf of it said Eugenius no matter which Provided quoth Yorick there is no bawdry in it They are just now replied Phutatorius printing off the ninth chapter which is the last chapter but one in the book Pray what is the title of that chapter said Yorick making a respectful bow to Phutatorius as he spoke I think answered Phutatorius tis that de re concubinaria For Heaven s sake keep out of that chapter quoth Yorick By all means added Eugenius Chapter two LXIV Now quoth Didius rising up and laying his right hand with his fingers spread upon his breast had such a blunder about a christian name happened before the Reformation It happened the day before yesterday quoth my uncle Toby to himself and when baptism was administer d in Latin Twas all in English said my uncle many things might have coincided with it and upon the authority of sundry decreed cases to have pronounced the baptism null with a power of giving the child a new name Had a priest for instance which was no uncommon thing through ignorance of the Latin tongue baptized a child of Tom o Stiles in nomine patriae filia spiritum sanctos the baptism was held null I beg your pardon replied Kysarcius in that case as the mistake was only the terminations the baptism was valid and to have rendered it null the blunder of the priest should have fallen upon the first syllable of each noun and not as in your case upon the last My father delighted in subtleties of this kind and listen d with infinite attention Gastripheres for example continued Kysarcius baptizes a child of John Stradling s in Gomine gatris c c instead of in Nomine patris c Is this a baptism No say the ablest canonists in as much as the radix of each word is hereby torn up and the sense and meaning of them removed and changed quite to another object for Gomine does not signify a name nor gatris a father What do they signify said my uncle Toby Nothing at all quoth Yorick Ergo such a baptism is null said Kysarcius In course answered Yorick in a tone two parts jest and one part earnest But in the case cited continued Kysarcius where patriae is put for patris filia for filii and so on as it is a fault only in the declension and the roots of the words continue untouch d the inflections of their branches either this way or that does not in any sort hinder the baptism inasmuch as the same sense continues in the words as before But then said Didius the intention of the priest s pronouncing them grammatically must have been proved to have gone along with it Right answered Kysarcius and of this brother Didius we have an instance in a decree of the decretals of Pope Leo the IIId But my brother s child cried my uncle Toby has nothing to do with the Pope tis the plain child of a Protestant gentleman christen d Tristram against the wills and wishes both of his father and mother and all who are a kin to it If the wills and wishes said Kysarcius interrupting my uncle Toby of those only who stand related to mister Shandy s child were to have weight in this matter missus Shandy of all people has the least to do in it My uncle Toby lay d down his pipe and my father drew his chair still closer to the table to hear the conclusion of so strange an introduction It has not only been a question Captain Shandy amongst the Vide Swinburn on Testaments Part seven para eight best lawyers and civilians in this land continued Kysarcius Whether the mother be of kin to her child but after much dispassionate enquiry and jactitation of the arguments on all sides it has been adjudged for the negative namely That the mother is not of kin to her child Vide Brook Abridg Tit Administr N forty seven My father instantly clapp d his hand upon my uncle Toby s mouth under colour of whispering in his ear the truth was he was alarmed for Lillabullero and having a great desire to hear more of so curious an argument he begg d my uncle Toby for heaven s sake not to disappoint him in it My uncle Toby gave a nod resumed his pipe and contenting himself with whistling Lillabullero inwardly Kysarcius Didius and Triptolemus went on with the discourse as follows This determination continued Kysarcius how contrary soever it may seem to run to the stream of vulgar ideas yet had reason strongly on its side and has been put out of all manner of dispute from the famous case known commonly by the name of the Duke of Suffolk s case It is cited in Brook said Triptolemus And taken notice of by Lord Coke added Didius And you may find it in Swinburn on Testaments said Kysarcius The case mister Shandy was this In the reign of Edward the Sixth Charles duke of Suffolk having issue a son by one venter and a daughter by another venter made his last will wherein he devised goods to his son and died after whose death the son died also but without will without wife and without child his mother and his sister by the father s side for she was born of the former venter then living The mother took the administration of her son s goods according to the statute of the twenty first of Harry the Eighth whereby it is enacted That in case any person die intestate the administration of his goods shall be committed to the next of kin The administration being thus surreptitiously granted to the mother the sister by the father s side commenced a suit before the Ecclesiastical Judge alledging first That she herself was next of kin and twodly That the mother was not of kin at all to the party deceased and therefore prayed the court that the administration granted to the mother might be revoked and be committed unto her as next of kin to the deceased by force of the said statute Hereupon as it was a great cause and much depending upon its issue and many causes of great property likely to be decided in times to come by the precedent to be then made the most learned as well in the laws of this realm as in the civil law were consulted together whether the mother was of kin to her son or no Whereunto not only the temporal lawyers but the church lawyers the juris consulti the jurisprudentes the civilians the advocates the commissaries the judges of the consistory and prerogative courts of Canterbury and York with the master of the faculties were all unanimously of opinion That the mother was not of Mater non numeratur inter consanguineos Bald in ult C de Verb signific kin to her child And what said the duchess of Suffolk to it said my uncle Toby The unexpectedness of my uncle Toby s question confounded Kysarcius more than the ablest advocate He stopp d a full minute looking in my uncle Toby s face without replying and in that single minute Triptolemus put by him and took the lead as follows Tis a ground and principle in the law said Triptolemus that things do not ascend but descend in it and I make no doubt tis for this cause that however true it is that the child may be of the blood and seed of its parents that the parents nevertheless are not of the blood and seed of it inasmuch as the parents are not begot by the child but the child by the parents For so they write Liberi sunt de sanguine patris matris sed pater mater non sunt de sanguine liberorum But this Triptolemus cried Didius proves too much for from this authority cited it would follow not only what indeed is granted on all sides that the mother is not of kin to her child but the father likewise It is held said Triptolemus the better opinion because the father the mother and the child though they be three persons yet are they but una caro Vide Brook Abridg tit Administr N forty seven one flesh and consequently no degree of kindred or any method of acquiring one in nature There you push the argument again too far cried Didius for there is no prohibition in nature though there is in the Levitical law but that a man may beget a child upon his grandmother in which case supposing the issue a daughter she would stand in relation both of But who ever thought cried Kysarcius of laying with his grandmother The young gentleman replied Yorick whom Selden speaks of who not only thought of it but justified his intention to his father by the argument drawn from the law of retaliation You laid Sir with my mother said the lad why may not I lay with yours Tis the Argumentum commune added Yorick Tis as good replied Eugenius taking down his hat as they deserve The company broke up Chapter two LXV And pray said my uncle Toby leaning upon Yorick as he and my father were helping him leisurely down the stairs don t be terrified madam this stair case conversation is not so long as the last And pray Yorick said my uncle Toby which way is this said affair of Tristram at length settled by these learned men Very satisfactorily replied Yorick no mortal Sir has any concern with it for missus Shandy the mother is nothing at all a kin to him and as the mother s is the surest side mister Shandy in course is still less than nothing In short he is not as much a kin to him Sir as I am That may well be said my father shaking his head Let the learned say what they will there must certainly quoth my uncle Toby have been some sort of consanguinity betwixt the duchess of Suffolk and her son The vulgar are of the same opinion quoth Yorick to this hour Chapter two LXVI Though my father was hugely tickled with the subtleties of these learned discourses twas still but like the anointing of a broken bone The moment he got home the weight of his afflictions returned upon him but so much the heavier as is ever the case when the staff we lean on slips from under us He became pensive walked frequently forth to the fish pond let down one loop of his hat sigh d often forbore to snap and as the hasty sparks of temper which occasion snapping so much assist perspiration and digestion as Hippocrates tells us he had certainly fallen ill with the extinction of them had not his thoughts been critically drawn off and his health rescued by a fresh train of disquietudes left him with a legacy of a thousand pounds by my aunt Dinah My father had scarce read the letter when taking the thing by the right end he instantly began to plague and puzzle his head how to lay it out mostly to the honour of his family A hundred and fifty odd projects took possession of his brains by turns he would do this and that and t other He would go to Rome he would go to law he would buy stock he would buy John Hobson s farm he would new fore front his house and add a new wing to make it even There was a fine water mill on this side and he would build a wind mill on the other side of the river in full view to answer it But above all things in the world he would inclose the great Ox moor and send out my brother Bobby immediately upon his travels But as the sum was finite and consequently could not do every thing and in truth very few of these to any purpose of all the projects which offered themselves upon this occasion the two last seemed to make the deepest impression and he would infallibly have determined upon both at once but for the small inconvenience hinted at above which absolutely put him under a necessity of deciding in favour either of the one or the other This was not altogether so easy to be done for though tis certain my father had long before set his heart upon this necessary part of my brother s education and like a prudent man had actually determined to carry it into execution with the first money that returned from the second creation of actions in the Missisippi scheme in which he was an adventurer yet the Ox moor which was a fine large whinny undrained unimproved common belonging to the Shandy estate had almost as old a claim upon him he had long and affectionately set his heart upon turning it likewise to some account But having never hitherto been pressed with such a conjuncture of things as made it necessary to settle either the priority or justice of their claims like a wise man he had refrained entering into any nice or critical examination about them so that upon the dismission of every other project at this crisis the two old projects the Ox moor and my Brother divided him again and so equal a match were they for each other as to become the occasion of no small contest in the old gentleman s mind which of the two should be set o going first People may laugh as they will but the case was this It had ever been the custom of the family and by length of time was almost become a matter of common right that the eldest son of it should have free ingress egress and regress into foreign parts before marriage not only for the sake of bettering his own private parts by the benefit of exercise and change of so much air but simply for the mere delectation of his fancy by the feather put into his cap of having been abroad tantum valet my father would say quantum sonat Now as this was a reasonable and in course a most christian indulgence to deprive him of it without why or wherefore and thereby make an example of him as the first Shandy unwhirl d about Europe in a post chaise and only because he was a heavy lad would be using him ten times worse than a Turk On the other hand the case of the Ox moor was full as hard Exclusive of the original purchase money which was eight hundred pounds it had cost the family eight hundred pounds more in a law suit about fifteen years before besides the Lord knows what trouble and vexation It had been moreover in possession of the Shandy family ever since the middle of the last century and though it lay full in view before the house bounded on one extremity by the water mill and on the other by the projected wind mill spoken of above and for all these reasons seemed to have the fairest title of any part of the estate to the care and protection of the family yet by an unaccountable fatality common to men as well as the ground they tread on it had all along most shamefully been overlook d and to speak the truth of it had suffered so much by it that it would have made any man s heart have bled Obadiah said who understood the value of the land to have rode over it and only seen the condition it was in However as neither the purchasing this tract of ground nor indeed the placing of it where it lay were either of them properly speaking of my father s doing he had never thought himself any way concerned in the affair till the fifteen years before when the breaking out of that cursed law suit mentioned above and which had arose about its boundaries which being altogether my father s own act and deed it naturally awakened every other argument in its favour and upon summing them all up together he saw not merely in interest but in honour he was bound to do something for it and that now or never was the time I think there must certainly have been a mixture of ill luck in it that the reasons on both sides should happen to be so equally balanced by each other for though my father weigh d them in all humours and conditions spent many an anxious hour in the most profound and abstracted meditation upon what was best to be done reading books of farming one day books of travels another laying aside all passion whatever viewing the arguments on both sides in all their lights and circumstances communing every day with my uncle Toby arguing with Yorick and talking over the whole affair of the Ox moor with Obadiah yet nothing in all that time appeared so strongly in behalf of the one which was not either strictly applicable to the other or at least so far counterbalanced by some consideration of equal weight as to keep the scales even For to be sure with proper helps in the hands of some people tho the Ox moor would undoubtedly have made a different appearance in the world from what it did or ever could do in the condition it lay yet every tittle of this was true with regard to my brother Bobby let Obadiah say what he would In point of interest the contest I own at first sight did not appear so undecisive betwixt them for whenever my father took pen and ink in hand and set about calculating the simple expence of paring and burning and fencing in the Ox moor c c with the certain profit it would bring him in return the latter turned out so prodigiously in his way of working the account that you would have sworn the Ox moor would have carried all before it For it was plain he should reap a hundred lasts of rape at twenty pounds a last the very first year besides an excellent crop of wheat the year following and the year after that to speak within bounds a hundred but in all likelihood a hundred and fifty if not two hundred quarters of pease and beans besides potatoes without end But then to think he was all this while breeding up my brother like a hog to eat them knocked all on the head again and generally left the old gentleman in such a state of suspense that as he often declared to my uncle Toby he knew no more than his heels what to do No body but he who has felt it can conceive what a plaguing thing it is to have a man s mind torn asunder by two projects of equal strength both obstinately pulling in a contrary direction at the same time for to say nothing of the havock which by a certain consequence is unavoidably made by it all over the finer system of the nerves which you know convey the animal spirits and more subtle juices from the heart to the head and so on it is not to be told in what a degree such a wayward kind of friction works upon the more gross and solid parts wasting the fat and impairing the strength of a man every time as it goes backwards and forwards My father had certainly sunk under this evil as certainly as he had done under that of my Christian Name had he not been rescued out of it as he was out of that by a fresh evil the misfortune of my brother Bobby s death What is the life of man Is it not to shift from side to side from sorrow to sorrow to button up one cause of vexation and unbutton another Chapter two LXVII From this moment I am to be considered as heir apparent to the Shandy family and it is from this point properly that the story of my Life and my Opinions sets out With all my hurry and precipitation I have but been clearing the ground to raise the building and such a building do I foresee it will turn out as never was planned and as never was executed since Adam In less than five minutes I shall have thrown my pen into the fire and the little drop of thick ink which is left remaining at the bottom of my ink horn after it I have but half a score things to do in the time I have a thing to name a thing to lament a thing to hope a thing to promise and a thing to threaten I have a thing to suppose a thing to declare a thing to conceal a thing to choose and a thing to pray for This chapter therefore I name the chapter of Things and my next chapter to it that is the first chapter of my next volume if I live shall be my chapter upon Whiskers in order to keep up some sort of connection in my works The thing I lament is that things have crowded in so thick upon me that I have not been able to get into that part of my work towards which I have all the way looked forwards with so much earnest desire and that is the Campaigns but especially the amours of my uncle Toby the events of which are of so singular a nature and so Cervantick a cast that if I can so manage it as to convey but the same impressions to every other brain which the occurrences themselves excite in my own I will answer for it the book shall make its way in the world much better than its master has done before it Oh Tristram Tristram can this but be once brought about the credit which will attend thee as an author shall counterbalance the many evils will have befallen thee as a man thou wilt feast upon the one when thou hast lost all sense and remembrance of the other No wonder I itch so much as I do to get at these amours They are the choicest morsel of my whole story and when I do get at em assure yourselves good folks nor do I value whose squeamish stomach takes offence at it I shall not be at all nice in the choice of my words and that s the thing I have to declare I shall never get all through in five minutes that I fear and the thing I hope is that your worships and reverences are not offended if you are depend upon t I ll give you something my good gentry next year to be offended at that s my dear Jenny s way but who my Jenny is and which is the right and which the wrong end of a woman is the thing to be concealed it shall be told you in the next chapter but one to my chapter of Button holes and not one chapter before And now that you have just got to the end of these According to the preceding Editions three volumes the thing I have to ask is how you feel your heads my own akes dismally as for your healths I know they are much better True Shandeism think what you will against it opens the heart and lungs and like all those affections which partake of its nature it forces the blood and other vital fluids of the body to run freely through its channels makes the wheel of life run long and cheerfully round Was I left like Sancho Panca to choose my kingdom it should not be maritime or a kingdom of blacks to make a penny of no it should be a kingdom of hearty laughing subjects And as the bilious and more saturnine passions by creating disorders in the blood and humours have as bad an influence I see upon the body politick as body natural and as nothing but a habit of virtue can fully govern those passions and subject them to reason I should add to my prayer that God would give my subjects grace to be as Wise as they were Merry and then should I be the happiest monarch and they are the happiest people under heaven And so with this moral for the present may it please your worships and your reverences I take my leave of you till this time twelve month when unless this vile cough kills me in the mean time I ll have another pluck at your beards and lay open a story to the world you little dream of End of the Second Volume THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY GENT VOLUME THE THIRD Dixero si quid forte jocosius hoc mihi juris Cum venia dabis Hor

that madcap of a postillion who drove them from Stilton to Stamford the thought had never entered my head He flew like lightning there was a slope of three miles and a half we scarce touched the ground the motion was most rapid most impetuous twas communicated to my brain my heart partook of it By the great God of day said I looking towards the sun and thrusting my arm out of the fore window of the chaise as I made my vow I will lock up my study door the moment I get home and throw the key of it ninety feet below the surface of the earth into the draw well at the back of my house The London waggon confirmed me in my resolution it hung tottering upon the hill scarce progressive drag d drag d up by eight heavy beasts by main strength quoth I nodding but your betters draw the same way and something of every body s O rare Tell me ye learned shall we for ever be adding so much to the bulk so little to the stock Shall we for ever make new books as apothecaries make new mixtures by pouring only out of one vessel into another Are we for ever to be twisting and untwisting the same rope for ever in the same track for ever at the same pace Shall we be destined to the days of eternity on holy days as well as working days to be shewing the relicks of learning as monks do the relicks of their saints without working one one single miracle with them Who made Man with powers which dart him from earth to heaven in a moment that great that most excellent and most noble creature of the world the miracle of nature as Zoroaster in his book Greek called him the Shekinah of the divine presence as Chrysostom the image of God as Moses the ray of divinity as Plato the marvel of marvels as Aristotle to go sneaking on at this pitiful pimping pettifogging rate I scorn to be as abusive as Horace upon the occasion but if there is no catachresis in the wish and no sin in it I wish from my soul that every imitator in Great Britain France and Ireland had the farcy for his pains and that there was a good farcical house large enough to hold aye and sublimate them shag rag and bob tail male and female all together and this leads me to the affair of Whiskers but by what chain of ideas I leave as a legacy in mort main to Prudes and Tartufs to enjoy and make the most of Upon Whiskers I m sorry I made it twas as inconsiderate a promise as ever entered a man s head A chapter upon whiskers alas the world will not bear it tis a delicate world but I knew not of what mettle it was made nor had I ever seen the under written fragment otherwise as surely as noses are noses and whiskers are whiskers still let the world say what it will to the contrary so surely would I have steered clear of this dangerous chapter The Fragment You are half asleep my good lady said the old gentleman taking hold of the old lady s hand and giving it a gentle squeeze as he pronounced the word Whiskers shall we change the subject By no means replied the old lady I like your account of those matters so throwing a thin gauze handkerchief over her head and leaning it back upon the chair with her face turned towards him and advancing her two feet as she reclined herself I desire continued she you will go on The old gentleman went on as follows Whiskers cried the queen of Navarre dropping her knotting ball as La Fosseuse uttered the word Whiskers madam said La Fosseuse pinning the ball to the queen s apron and making a courtesy as she repeated it La Fosseuse s voice was naturally soft and low yet twas an articulate voice and every letter of the word Whiskers fell distinctly upon the queen of Navarre s ear Whiskers cried the queen laying a greater stress upon the word and as if she had still distrusted her ears Whiskers replied La Fosseuse repeating the word a third time There is not a cavalier madam of his age in Navarre continued the maid of honour pressing the page s interest upon the queen that has so gallant a pair Of what cried Margaret smiling Of whiskers said La Fosseuse with infinite modesty The word Whiskers still stood its ground and continued to be made use of in most of the best companies throughout the little kingdom of Navarre notwithstanding the indiscreet use which La Fosseuse had made of it the truth was La Fosseuse had pronounced the word not only before the queen but upon sundry other occasions at court with an accent which always implied something of a mystery And as the court of Margaret as all the world knows was at that time a mixture of gallantry and devotion and whiskers being as applicable to the one as the other the word naturally stood its ground it gained full as much as it lost that is the clergy were for it the laity were against it and for the women they were divided The excellency of the figure and mien of the young Sieur De Croix was at that time beginning to draw the attention of the maids of honour towards the terrace before the palace gate where the guard was mounted The lady De Baussiere fell deeply in love with him La Battarelle did the same it was the finest weather for it that ever was remembered in Navarre La Guyol La Maronette La Sabatiere fell in love with the Sieur De Croix also La Rebours and La Fosseuse knew better De Croix had failed in an attempt to recommend himself to La Rebours and La Rebours and La Fosseuse were inseparable The queen of Navarre was sitting with her ladies in the painted bow window facing the gate of the second court as De Croix passed through it He is handsome said the Lady Baussiere He has a good mien said La Battarelle He is finely shaped said La Guyol I never saw an officer of the horse guards in my life said La Maronette with two such legs Or who stood so well upon them said La Sabatiere But he has no whiskers cried La Fosseuse Not a pile said La Rebours The queen went directly to her oratory musing all the way as she walked through the gallery upon the subject turning it this way and that way in her fancy Ave Maria what can La Fosseuse mean said she kneeling down upon the cushion La Guyol La Battarelle La Maronette La Sabatiere retired instantly to their chambers Whiskers said all four of them to themselves as they bolted their doors on the inside The Lady Carnavallette was counting her beads with both hands unsuspected under her farthingal from saint Antony down to saint Ursula inclusive not a saint passed through her fingers without whiskers saint Francis saint Dominick saint Bennet saint Basil saint Bridget had all whiskers The Lady Baussiere had got into a wilderness of conceits with moralizing too intricately upon La Fosseuse s text She mounted her palfrey her page followed her the host passed by the Lady Baussiere rode on One denier cried the order of mercy one single denier in behalf of a thousand patient captives whose eyes look towards heaven and you for their redemption The Lady Baussiere rode on Pity the unhappy said a devout venerable hoary headed man meekly holding up a box begirt with iron in his withered hands I beg for the unfortunate good my Lady tis for a prison for an hospital tis for an old man a poor man undone by shipwreck by suretyship by fire I call God and all his angels to witness tis to clothe the naked to feed the hungry tis to comfort the sick and the broken hearted The Lady Baussiere rode on A decayed kinsman bowed himself to the ground The Lady Baussiere rode on He ran begging bare headed on one side of her palfrey conjuring her by the former bonds of friendship alliance consanguinity c Cousin aunt sister mother for virtue s sake for your own for mine for Christ s sake remember me pity me The Lady Baussiere rode on Take hold of my whiskers said the Lady Baussiere The page took hold of her palfrey She dismounted at the end of the terrace There are some trains of certain ideas which leave prints of themselves about our eyes and eye brows and there is a consciousness of it somewhere about the heart which serves but to make these etchings the stronger we see spell and put them together without a dictionary Ha ha he hee cried La Guyol and La Sabatiere looking close at each other s prints Ho ho cried La Battarelle and Maronette doing the same Whist cried one fort fort said a second hush quoth a third poo poo replied a fourth gramercy cried the Lady Carnavallette twas she who bewhisker d saint Bridget La Fosseuse drew her bodkin from the knot of her hair and having traced the outline of a small whisker with the blunt end of it upon one side of her upper lip put in into La Rebours hand La Rebours shook her head The Lady Baussiere coughed thrice into the inside of her muff La Guyol smiled Fy said the Lady Baussiere The queen of Navarre touched her eye with the tip of her fore finger as much as to say I understand you all Twas plain to the whole court the word was ruined La Fosseuse had given it a wound and it was not the better for passing through all these defiles It made a faint stand however for a few months by the expiration of which the Sieur De Croix finding it high time to leave Navarre for want of whiskers the word in course became indecent and after a few efforts absolutely unfit for use The best word in the best language of the best world must have suffered under such combinations The curate of d Estella wrote a book against them setting forth the dangers of accessory ideas and warning the Navarois against them Does not all the world know said the curate d Estella at the conclusion of his work that Noses ran the same fate some centuries ago in most parts of Europe which Whiskers have now done in the kingdom of Navarre The evil indeed spread no farther then but have not beds and bolsters and night caps and chamber pots stood upon the brink of destruction ever since Are not trouse and placket holes and pump handles and spigots and faucets in danger still from the same association Chastity by nature the gentlest of all affections give it but its head tis like a ramping and a roaring lion The drift of the curate d Estella s argument was not understood They ran the scent the wrong way The world bridled his ass at the tail And when the extremes of Delicacy and the beginnings of Concupiscence hold their next provincial chapter together they may decree that bawdy also Chapter three II When my father received the letter which brought him the melancholy account of my brother Bobby s death he was busy calculating the expence of his riding post from Calais to Paris and so on to Lyons Twas a most inauspicious journey my father having had every foot of it to travel over again and his calculation to begin afresh when he had almost got to the end of it by Obadiah s opening the door to acquaint him the family was out of yeast and to ask whether he might not take the great coach horse early in the morning and ride in search of some With all my heart Obadiah said my father pursuing his journey take the coach horse and welcome But he wants a shoe poor creature said Obadiah Poor creature said my uncle Toby vibrating the note back again like a string in unison Then ride the Scotch horse quoth my father hastily He cannot bear a saddle upon his back quoth Obadiah for the whole world The devil s in that horse then take Patriot cried my father and shut the door Patriot is sold said Obadiah Here s for you cried my father making a pause and looking in my uncle Toby s face as if the thing had not been a matter of fact Your worship ordered me to sell him last April said Obadiah Then go on foot for your pains cried my father I had much rather walk than ride said Obadiah shutting the door What plagues cried my father going on with his calculation But the waters are out said Obadiah opening the door again Till that moment my father who had a map of Sanson s and a book of the post roads before him had kept his hand upon the head of his compasses with one foot of them fixed upon Nevers the last stage he had paid for purposing to go on from that point with his journey and calculation as soon as Obadiah quitted the room but this second attack of Obadiah s in opening the door and laying the whole country under water was too much He let go his compasses or rather with a mixed motion between accident and anger he threw them upon the table and then there was nothing for him to do but to return back to Calais like many others as wise as he had set out When the letter was brought into the parlour which contained the news of my brother s death my father had got forwards again upon his journey to within a stride of the compasses of the very same stage of Nevers By your leave Mons Sanson cried my father striking the point of his compasses through Nevers into the table and nodding to my uncle Toby to see what was in the letter twice of one night is too much for an English gentleman and his son Mons Sanson to be turned back from so lousy a town as Nevers What think saint thou Toby added my father in a sprightly tone Unless it be a garrison town said my uncle Toby for then I shall be a fool said my father smiling to himself as long as I live So giving a second nod and keeping his compasses still upon Nevers with one hand and holding his book of the post roads in the other half calculating and half listening he leaned forwards upon the table with both elbows as my uncle Toby hummed over the letter he s gone said my uncle Toby Where Who cried my father My nephew said my uncle Toby What without leave without money without governor cried my father in amazement No he is dead my dear brother quoth my uncle Toby Without being ill cried my father again I dare say not said my uncle Toby in a low voice and fetching a deep sigh from the bottom of his heart he has been ill enough poor lad I ll answer for him for he is dead When Agrippina was told of her son s death Tacitus informs us that not being able to moderate the violence of her passions she abruptly broke off her work My father stuck his compasses into Nevers but so much the faster What contrarieties his indeed was matter of calculation Agrippina s must have been quite a different affair who else could pretend to reason from history How my father went on in my opinion deserves a chapter to itself Chapter three III And a chapter it shall have and a devil of a one too so look to yourselves Tis either Plato or Plutarch or Seneca or Xenophon or Epictetus or Theophrastus or Lucian or some one perhaps of later date either Cardan or Budaeus or Petrarch or Stella or possibly it may be some divine or father of the church saint Austin or saint Cyprian or Barnard who affirms that it is an irresistible and natural passion to weep for the loss of our friends or children and Seneca I m positive tells us somewhere that such griefs evacuate themselves best by that particular channel And accordingly we find that David wept for his son Absalom Adrian for his Antinous Niobe for her children and that Apollodorus and Crito both shed tears for Socrates before his death My father managed his affliction otherwise and indeed differently from most men either ancient or modern for he neither wept it away as the Hebrews and the Romans or slept it off as the Laplanders or hanged it as the English or drowned it as the Germans nor did he curse it or damn it or excommunicate it or rhyme it or lillabullero it He got rid of it however Will your worships give me leave to squeeze in a story between these two pages When Tully was bereft of his dear daughter Tullia at first he laid it to his heart he listened to the voice of nature and modulated his own unto it O my Tullia my daughter my child still still still twas O my Tullia my Tullia Methinks I see my Tullia I hear my Tullia I talk with my Tullia But as soon as he began to look into the stores of philosophy and consider how many excellent things might be said upon the occasion no body upon earth can conceive says the great orator how happy how joyful it made me My father was as proud of his eloquence as Marcus Tullius Cicero could be for his life and for aught I am convinced of to the contrary at present with as much reason it was indeed his strength and his weakness too His strength for he was by nature eloquent and his weakness for he was hourly a dupe to it and provided an occasion in life would but permit him to shew his talents or say either a wise thing a witty or a shrewd one bating the case of a systematic misfortune he had all he wanted A blessing which tied up my father s tongue and a misfortune which let it loose with a good grace were pretty equal sometimes indeed the misfortune was the better of the two for instance where the pleasure of the harangue was as ten and the pain of the misfortune but as five my father gained half in half and consequently was as well again off as if it had never befallen him This clue will unravel what otherwise would seem very inconsistent in my father s domestic character and it is this that in the provocations arising from the neglects and blunders of servants or other mishaps unavoidable in a family his anger or rather the duration of it eternally ran counter to all conjecture My father had a favourite little mare which he had consigned over to a most beautiful Arabian horse in order to have a pad out of her for his own riding he was sanguine in all his projects so talked about his pad every day with as absolute a security as if it had been reared broke and bridled and saddled at his door ready for mounting By some neglect or other in Obadiah it so fell out that my father s expectations were answered with nothing better than a mule and as ugly a beast of the kind as ever was produced My mother and my uncle Toby expected my father would be the death of Obadiah and that there never would be an end of the disaster See here you rascal cried my father pointing to the mule what you have done It was not me said Obadiah How do I know that replied my father Triumph swam in my father s eyes at the repartee the Attic salt brought water into them and so Obadiah heard no more about it Now let us go back to my brother s death Philosophy has a fine saying for every thing For Death it has an entire set the misery was they all at once rushed into my father s head that twas difficult to string them together so as to make any thing of a consistent show out of them He took them as they came Tis an inevitable chance the first statute in Magna Charta it is an everlasting act of parliament my dear brother All must die If my son could not have died it had been matter of wonder not that he is dead Monarchs and princes dance in the same ring with us To die is the great debt and tribute due unto nature tombs and monuments which should perpetuate our memories pay it themselves and the proudest pyramid of them all which wealth and science have erected has lost its apex and stands obtruncated in the traveller s horizon My father found he got great ease and went on Kingdoms and provinces and towns and cities have they not their periods and when those principles and powers which at first cemented and put them together have performed their several evolutions they fall back Brother Shandy said my uncle Toby laying down his pipe at the word evolutions Revolutions I meant quoth my father by heaven I meant revolutions brother Toby evolutions is nonsense Tis not nonsense said my uncle Toby But is it not nonsense to break the thread of such a discourse upon such an occasion cried my father do not dear Toby continued he taking him by the hand do not do not I beseech thee interrupt me at this crisis My uncle Toby put his pipe into his mouth Where is Troy and Mycenae and Thebes and Delos and Persepolis and Agrigentum continued my father taking up his book of post roads which he had laid down What is become brother Toby of Nineveh and Babylon of Cizicum and Mitylenae The fairest towns that ever the sun rose upon are now no more the names only are left and those for many of them are wrong spelt are falling themselves by piece meals to decay and in length of time will be forgotten and involved with every thing in a perpetual night the world itself brother Toby must must come to an end Returning out of Asia when I sailed from Aegina towards Megara when can this have been thought my uncle Toby I began to view the country round about Aegina was behind me Megara was before Pyraeus on the right hand Corinth on the left What flourishing towns now prostrate upon the earth Alas alas said I to myself that man should disturb his soul for the loss of a child when so much as this lies awfully buried in his presence Remember said I to myself again remember thou art a man Now my uncle Toby knew not that this last paragraph was an extract of Servius Sulpicius s consolatory letter to Tully He had as little skill honest man in the fragments as he had in the whole pieces of antiquity And as my father whilst he was concerned in the Turkey trade had been three or four different times in the Levant in one of which he had stayed a whole year and an half at Zant my uncle Toby naturally concluded that in some one of these periods he had taken a trip across the Archipelago into Asia and that all this sailing affair with Aegina behind and Megara before and Pyraeus on the right hand c c was nothing more than the true course of my father s voyage and reflections Twas certainly in his manner and many an undertaking critic would have built two stories higher upon worse foundations And pray brother quoth my uncle Toby laying the end of his pipe upon my father s hand in a kindly way of interruption but waiting till he finished the account what year of our Lord was this Twas no year of our Lord replied my father That s impossible cried my uncle Toby Simpleton said my father twas forty years before Christ was born My uncle Toby had but two things for it either to suppose his brother to be the wandering Jew or that his misfortunes had disordered his brain May the Lord God of heaven and earth protect him and restore him said my uncle Toby praying silently for my father and with tears in his eyes My father placed the tears to a proper account and went on with his harangue with great spirit There is not such great odds brother Toby betwixt good and evil as the world imagines this way of setting off by the bye was not likely to cure my uncle Toby s suspicions Labour sorrow grief sickness want and woe are the sauces of life Much good may do them said my uncle Toby to himself My son is dead so much the better tis a shame in such a tempest to have but one anchor But he is gone for ever from us be it so He is got from under the hands of his barber before he was bald he is but risen from a feast before he was surfeited from a banquet before he had got drunken The Thracians wept when a child was born and we were very near it quoth my uncle Toby and feasted and made merry when a man went out of the world and with reason Death opens the gate of fame and shuts the gate of envy after it it unlooses the chain of the captive and puts the bondsman s task into another man s hands Shew me the man who knows what life is who dreads it and I ll shew thee a prisoner who dreads his liberty Is it not better my dear brother Toby for mark our appetites are but diseases is it not better not to hunger at all than to eat not to thirst than to take physic to cure it Is it not better to be freed from cares and agues from love and melancholy and the other hot and cold fits of life than like a galled traveller who comes weary to his inn to be bound to begin his journey afresh There is no terrour brother Toby in its looks but what it borrows from groans and convulsions and the blowing of noses and the wiping away of tears with the bottoms of curtains in a dying man s room Strip it of these what is it Tis better in battle than in bed said my uncle Toby Take away its hearses its mutes and its mourning its plumes scutcheons and other mechanic aids What is it Better in battle continued my father smiling for he had absolutely forgot my brother Bobby tis terrible no way for consider brother Toby when we are death is not and when death is we are not My uncle Toby laid down his pipe to consider the proposition my father s eloquence was too rapid to stay for any man away it went and hurried my uncle Toby s ideas along with it For this reason continued my father tis worthy to recollect how little alteration in great men the approaches of death have made Vespasian died in a jest upon his close stool Galba with a sentence Septimus Severus in a dispatch Tiberius in dissimulation and Caesar Augustus in a compliment I hope twas a sincere one quoth my uncle Toby Twas to his wife said my father Chapter three IV And lastly for all the choice anecdotes which history can produce of this matter continued my father this like the gilded dome which covers in the fabric crowns all Tis of Cornelius Gallus the praetor which I dare say brother Toby you have read I dare say I have not replied my uncle He died said my father as And if it was with his wife said my uncle Toby there could be no hurt in it That s more than I know replied my father Chapter three V My mother was going very gingerly in the dark along the passage which led to the parlour as my uncle Toby pronounced the word wife Tis a shrill penetrating sound of itself and Obadiah had helped it by leaving the door a little a jar so that my mother heard enough of it to imagine herself the subject of the conversation so laying the edge of her finger across her two lips holding in her breath and bending her head a little downwards with a twist of her neck not towards the door but from it by which means her ear was brought to the chink she listened with all her powers the listening slave with the Goddess of Silence at his back could not have given a finer thought for an intaglio In this attitude I am determined to let her stand for five minutes till I bring up the affairs of the kitchen as Rapin does those of the church to the same period Chapter three VI Though in one sense our family was certainly a simple machine as it consisted of a few wheels yet there was thus much to be said for it that these wheels were set in motion by so many different springs and acted one upon the other from such a variety of strange principles and impulses that though it was a simple machine it had all the honour and advantages of a complex one and a number of as odd movements within it as ever were beheld in the inside of a Dutch silk mill Amongst these there was one I am going to speak of in which perhaps it was not altogether so singular as in many others and it was this that whatever motion debate harangue dialogue project or dissertation was going forwards in the parlour there was generally another at the same time and upon the same subject running parallel along with it in the kitchen Now to bring this about whenever an extraordinary message or letter was delivered in the parlour or a discourse suspended till a servant went out or the lines of discontent were observed to hang upon the brows of my father or mother or in short when any thing was supposed to be upon the tapis worth knowing or listening to twas the rule to leave the door not absolutely shut but somewhat a jar as it stands just now which under covert of the bad hinge and that possibly might be one of the many reasons why it was never mended it was not difficult to manage by which means in all these cases a passage was generally left not indeed as wide as the Dardanelles but wide enough for all that to carry on as much of this windward trade as was sufficient to save my father the trouble of governing his house my mother at this moment stands profiting by it Obadiah did the same thing as soon as he had left the letter upon the table which brought the news of my brother s death so that before my father had well got over his surprise and entered upon his harangue had Trim got upon his legs to speak his sentiments upon the subject A curious observer of nature had he been worth the inventory of all Job s stock though by the bye your curious observers are seldom worth a groat would have given the half of it to have heard Corporal Trim and my father two orators so contrasted by nature and education haranguing over the same bier My father a man of deep reading prompt memory with Cato and Seneca and Epictetus at his fingers ends The corporal with nothing to remember of no deeper reading than his muster roll or greater names at his fingers end than the contents of it The one proceeding from period to period by metaphor and allusion and striking the fancy as he went along as men of wit and fancy do with the entertainment and pleasantry of his pictures and images The other without wit or antithesis or point or turn this way or that but leaving the images on one side and the picture on the other going straight forwards as nature could lead him to the heart O Trim would to heaven thou had saint a better historian would thy historian had a better pair of breeches O ye critics will nothing melt you Chapter three VII My young master in London is dead said Obadiah A green sattin night gown of my mother s which had been twice scoured was the first idea which Obadiah s exclamation brought into Susannah s head Well might Locke write a chapter upon the imperfections of words Then quoth Susannah we must all go into mourning But note a second time the word mourning notwithstanding Susannah made use of it herself failed also of doing its office it excited not one single idea tinged either with grey or black all was green The green sattin night gown hung there still O twill be the death of my poor mistress cried Susannah My mother s whole wardrobe followed What a procession her red damask her orange tawney her white and yellow lutestrings her brown taffata her bone laced caps her bed gowns and comfortable under petticoats Not a rag was left behind No she will never look up again said Susannah We had a fat foolish scullion my father I think kept her for her simplicity she had been all autumn struggling with a dropsy He is dead said Obadiah he is certainly dead So am not I said the foolish scullion Here is sad news Trim cried Susannah wiping her eyes as Trim stepp d into the kitchen master Bobby is dead and buried the funeral was an interpolation of Susannah s we shall have all to go into mourning said Susannah I hope not said Trim You hope not cried Susannah earnestly The mourning ran not in Trim s head whatever it did in Susannah s I hope said Trim explaining himself I hope in God the news is not true I heard the letter read with my own ears answered Obadiah and we shall have a terrible piece of work of it in stubbing the ox moor Oh he s dead said Susannah As sure said the scullion as I m alive I lament for him from my heart and my soul said Trim fetching a sigh Poor creature poor boy poor gentleman He was alive last Whitsontide said the coachman Whitsontide alas cried Trim extending his right arm and falling instantly into the same attitude in which he read the sermon what is Whitsontide Jonathan for that was the coachman s name or Shrovetide or any tide or time past to this Are we not here now continued the corporal striking the end of his stick perpendicularly upon the floor so as to give an idea of health and stability and are we not dropping his hat upon the ground gone in a moment Twas infinitely striking Susannah burst into a flood of tears We are not stocks and stones Jonathan Obadiah the cook maid all melted The foolish fat scullion herself who was scouring a fish kettle upon her knees was rous d with it The whole kitchen crowded about the corporal Now as I perceive plainly that the preservation of our constitution in church and state and possibly the preservation of the whole world or what is the same thing the distribution and balance of its property and power may in time to come depend greatly upon the right understanding of this stroke of the corporal s eloquence I do demand your attention your worships and reverences for any ten pages together take them where you will in any other part of the work shall sleep for it at your ease I said we were not stocks and stones tis very well I should have added nor are we angels I wish we were but men clothed with bodies and governed by our imaginations and what a junketing piece of work of it there is betwixt these and our seven senses especially some of them for my own part I own it I am ashamed to confess Let it suffice to affirm that of all the senses the eye for I absolutely deny the touch though most of your Barbati I know are for it has the quickest commerce with the soul gives a smarter stroke and leaves something more inexpressible upon the fancy than words can either convey or sometimes get rid of I ve gone a little about no matter tis for health let us only carry it back in our mind to the mortality of Trim s hat Are we not here now and gone in a moment There was nothing in the sentence twas one of your self evident truths we have the advantage of hearing every day and if Trim had not trusted more to his hat than his head he made nothing at all of it Are we not here now continued the corporal and are we not dropping his hat plumb upon the ground and pausing before he pronounced the word gone in a moment The descent of the hat was as if a heavy lump of clay had been kneaded into the crown of it Nothing could have expressed the sentiment of mortality of which it was the type and fore runner like it his hand seemed to vanish from under it it fell dead the corporal s eye fixed upon it as upon a corpse and Susannah burst into a flood of tears Now Ten thousand and ten thousand times ten thousand for matter and motion are infinite are the ways by which a hat may be dropped upon the ground without any effect Had he flung it or thrown it or cast it or skimmed it or squirted it or let it slip or fall in any possible direction under heaven or in the best direction that could be given to it had he dropped it like a goose like a puppy like an ass or in doing it or even after he had done had he looked like a fool like a ninny like a nincompoop it had fail d and the effect upon the heart had been lost Ye who govern this mighty world and its mighty concerns with the engines of eloquence who heat it and cool it and melt it and mollify it and then harden it again to your purpose Ye who wind and turn the passions with this great windlass and having done it lead the owners of them whither ye think meet Ye lastly who drive and why not Ye also who are driven like turkeys to market with a stick and a red clout meditate meditate I beseech you upon Trim s hat Chapter three VIII Stay I have a small account to settle with the reader before Trim can go on with his harangue 
4407-13132-0000	train-other-500	It shall be done in two minutes Amongst many other book debts all of which I shall discharge in due time I own myself a debtor to the world for two items a chapter upon chamber maids and button holes
4407-13132-0001	train-other-500	which in the former part of my work I promised and fully intended to pay off this year but some of your worships and reverences telling me that the two subjects especially so connected together might endanger the morals of the world
4407-13132-0002	train-other-500	I pray the chapter upon chamber maids and button holes may be forgiven me and that they will accept of the last chapter in lieu of it which is nothing an t please your reverences but a chapter of chamber maids green gowns and old hats
4407-13132-0003	train-other-500	Trim took his hat off the ground put it upon his head and then went on with his oration upon death in manner and form following
none	none	 Chapter three IX To us Jonathan 
4407-13132-0004	train-other-500	who know not what want or care is
none	none	 who live here in the service of two of the best of masters 
4407-13132-0005	train-other-500	bating in my own case his majesty King William the Third
none	none	 whom I had the honour to serve both in Ireland and Flanders 
4407-13132-0006	train-other-500	I own it that from Whitsontide to within three weeks of Christmas
none	none	 tis not long tis like nothing 
4407-13132-0007	train-other-500	but to those Jonathan who know what death is and what havock and destruction he can make
none	none	 before a man can well wheel about tis like a whole age 
4407-13132-0008	train-other-500	O Jonathan twould make a good natured man s heart bleed to consider continued the corporal standing perpendicularly how low many a brave and upright fellow has been laid since that time And trust me Susy added the corporal turning to Susannah
4407-13132-0009	train-other-500	whose eyes were swimming in water before that time comes round again
none	none	 many a bright eye will be dim Susannah placed it to the right side of the page 
4407-13132-0010	train-other-500	she wept but she court sied too Are we not continued Trim looking still at Susannah are we not like a flower of the field a tear of pride stole in betwixt every two tears of humiliation
4407-13132-0011	train-other-500	else no tongue could have described Susannah s affliction is not all flesh grass Tis clay
none	none	 tis dirt 
4407-13132-0012	train-other-500	They all looked directly at the scullion the scullion had just been scouring a fish kettle It was not fair What is the finest face that ever man looked at I could hear Trim talk so for ever cried Susannah what is it
4407-13132-0013	train-other-500	Susannah laid her hand upon Trim s shoulder but corruption Susannah took it off Now I love you for this and tis this delicious mixture within you which makes you dear creatures what you are and he who hates you for it all I can say of the matter is
none	none	 That he has either a pumpkin for his head or a pippin for his heart 
4407-13132-0014	train-other-500	and whenever he is dissected twill be found so
none	none	 Chapter three X 
4407-13132-0015	train-other-500	Whether Susannah by taking her hand too suddenly from off the corporal s shoulder by the whisking about of her passions broke a little the chain of his reflexions
none	none	 Or whether the corporal began to be suspicious he had got into the doctor s quarters and was talking more like the chaplain than himself 
4407-13132-0016	train-other-500	Or whether Or whether
none	none	 for in all such cases a man of invention and parts may with pleasure fill a couple of pages with suppositions 
4407-13132-0017	train-other-500	which of all these was the cause let the curious physiologist or the curious any body determine
none	none	 tis certain at least the corporal went on thus with his harangue 
4407-13132-0018	train-other-500	For my own part I declare it that out of doors I value not death at all not this added the corporal snapping his fingers but with an air which no one but the corporal could have given to the sentiment In battle I value death not this
none	none	 and let him not take me cowardly 
4407-13132-0019	train-other-500	like poor Joe Gibbins in scouring his gun What is he A pull of a trigger
none	none	 a push of a bayonet an inch this way or that 
4407-13132-0020	train-other-500	makes the difference Look along the line to the right see Jack s down well
none	none	 tis worth a regiment of horse to him No tis Dick 
4407-13132-0021	train-other-500	Then Jack s no worse Never mind which we pass on in hot pursuit the wound itself which brings him is not felt the best way is to stand up to him the man who flies is in ten times more danger than the man who marches up into his jaws
4407-13132-0022	train-other-500	I ve look d him added the corporal an hundred times in the face and know what he is He s nothing Obadiah at all in the field But he s very frightful in a house quoth Obadiah I never mind it myself said Jonathan upon a coach box
4407-13132-0023	train-other-500	It must in my opinion be most natural in bed replied Susannah
none	none	 And could I escape him by creeping into the worst calf s skin that ever was made into a knapsack 
4407-13132-0024	train-other-500	I would do it there said Trim but that is nature Nature is nature said Jonathan And that is the reason cried Susannah I so much pity my mistress She will never get the better of it Now I pity the captain the most of any one in the family answered Trim
4407-13132-0025	train-other-500	Madam will get ease of heart in weeping
none	none	 and the Squire in talking about it but my poor master will keep it all in silence to himself 
4407-13132-0026	train-other-500	I shall hear him sigh in his bed for a whole month together as he did for lieutenant Le Fever An please your honour do not sigh so piteously I would say to him as I laid besides him I cannot help it Trim my master would say
none	none	 tis so melancholy an accident 
4407-13132-0027	train-other-500	I cannot get it off my heart Your honour fears not death yourself I hope Trim I fear nothing he would say but the doing a wrong thing Well he would add
none	none	 whatever betides I will take care of Le Fever s boy And with that like a quieting draught his honour would fall asleep I like to hear Trim s stories about the captain 
4407-13132-0028	train-other-500	said Susannah He is a kindly hearted gentleman said Obadiah as ever lived Aye and as brave a one too said the corporal as ever stept before a platoon There never was a better officer in the king s army or a better man in God s world for he would march up to the mouth of a cannon
none	none	 though he saw the lighted match at the very touch hole 
4407-13132-0029	train-other-500	and yet for all that he has a heart as soft as a child for other people He would not hurt a chicken I would sooner quoth Jonathan drive such a gentleman for seven pounds a year than some for eight Thank thee Jonathan for thy twenty shillings
4407-13132-0030	train-other-500	as much Jonathan said the corporal shaking him by the hand
none	none	 as if thou hadst put the money into my own pocket I would serve him to the day of my death 
4407-13132-0031	train-other-500	out of love He is a friend and a brother to me
none	none	 and could I be sure my poor brother Tom was dead continued the corporal taking out his handkerchief 
4407-13132-0032	train-other-500	was I worth ten thousand pounds I would leave every shilling of it to the captain Trim could not refrain from tears at this testamentary proof he gave of his affection to his master The whole kitchen was affected Do tell us the story of the poor lieutenant said Susannah
4407-13132-0033	train-other-500	With all my heart answered the corporal Susannah the cook Jonathan Obadiah and corporal Trim formed a circle about the fire and as soon as the scullion had shut the kitchen door the corporal begun
none	none	 Chapter three XI 
4407-13132-0034	train-other-500	I am a Turk if I had not as much forgot my mother
none	none	 as if Nature had plaistered me up and set me down naked upon the banks of the river Nile 
4407-13132-0035	train-other-500	without one Your most obedient servant Madam I ve cost you a great deal of trouble I wish it may answer
none	none	 but you have left a crack in my back and here s a great piece fallen off here before 
4407-13132-0036	train-other-500	and what must I do with this foot I shall never reach England with it For my own part I never wonder at any thing
none	none	 and so often has my judgment deceived me in my life that I always suspect it right or wrong at least I am seldom hot upon cold subjects For all this I reverence truth as much as any body and when it has slipped us 
4407-13132-0037	train-other-500	if a man will but take me by the hand
none	none	 and go quietly and search for it as for a thing we have both lost and can neither of us do well without I ll go to the world s end with him But I hate disputes and therefore bating religious points or such as touch society I would almost subscribe to any thing which does not choak me in the first passage rather than be drawn into one But I cannot bear suffocation and bad smells worst of all For which reasons I resolved from the beginning That if ever the army of martyrs was to be augmented or a new one raised I would have no hand in it one way or t other Chapter three XII But to return to my mother My uncle Toby s opinion Madam that there could be no harm in Cornelius Gallus the Roman praetor s lying with his wife or rather the last word of that opinion for it was all my mother heard of it caught hold of her by the weak part of the whole sex You shall not mistake me I mean her curiosity she instantly concluded herself the subject of the conversation and with that prepossession upon her fancy you will readily conceive every word my father said was accommodated either to herself or her family concerns Pray Madam in what street does the lady live who would not have done the same From the strange mode of Cornelius s death my father had made a transition to that of Socrates and was giving my uncle Toby an abstract of his pleading before his judges twas irresistible not the oration of Socrates but my father s temptation to it He had wrote the Life of Socrates This book my father would never consent to publish tis in manuscript with some other tracts of his in the family all or most of which will be printed in due time himself the year before he left off trade which I fear was the means of hastening him out of it so that no one was able to set out with so full a sail and in so swelling a tide of heroic loftiness upon the occasion as my father was Not a period in Socrates s oration which closed with a shorter word than transmigration or annihilation or a worse thought in the middle of it than to be or not to be the entering upon a new and untried state of things or upon a long a profound and peaceful sleep without dreams without disturbance That we and our children were born to die but neither of us born to be slaves No there I mistake that was part of Eleazer s oration as recorded by Josephus de Bell Judaic Eleazer owns he had it from the philosophers of India in all likelihood Alexander the Great in his irruption into India after he had over run Persia amongst the many things he stole stole that sentiment also by which means it was carried if not all the way by himself for we all know he died at Babylon at least by some of his maroders into Greece from Greece it got to Rome from Rome to France and from France to England So things come round By land carriage I can conceive no other way By water the sentiment might easily have come down the Ganges into the Sinus Gangeticus or Bay of Bengal and so into the Indian Sea and following the course of trade the way from India by the Cape of Good Hope being then unknown might be carried with other drugs and spices up the Red Sea to Joddah the port of Mekka or else to Tor or Sues towns at the bottom of the gulf and from thence by karrawans to Coptos but three days journey distant so down the Nile directly to Alexandria where the Sentiment would be landed at the very foot of the great stair case of the Alexandrian library and from that store house it would be fetched Bless me what a trade was driven by the learned in those days Chapter three XIII Now my father had a way a little like that of Job s in case there ever was such a man if not there s an end of the matter Though by the bye because your learned men find some difficulty in fixing the precise aera in which so great a man lived whether for instance before or after the patriarchs c to vote therefore that he never lived at all is a little cruel tis not doing as they would be done by happen that as it may My father I say had a way when things went extremely wrong with him especially upon the first sally of his impatience of wondering why he was begot wishing himself dead sometimes worse And when the provocation ran high and grief touched his lips with more than ordinary powers Sir you scarce could have distinguished him from Socrates himself Every word would breathe the sentiments of a soul disdaining life and careless about all its issues for which reason though my mother was a woman of no deep reading yet the abstract of Socrates s oration which my father was giving my uncle Toby was not altogether new to her She listened to it with composed intelligence and would have done so to the end of the chapter had not my father plunged which he had no occasion to have done into that part of the pleading where the great philosopher reckons up his connections his alliances and children but renounces a security to be so won by working upon the passions of his judges I have friends I have relations I have three desolate children says Socrates Then cried my mother opening the door you have one more mister Shandy than I know of By heaven I have one less said my father getting up and walking out of the room Chapter three XIV They are Socrates s children said my uncle Toby He has been dead a hundred years ago replied my mother My uncle Toby was no chronologer so not caring to advance one step but upon safe ground he laid down his pipe deliberately upon the table and rising up and taking my mother most kindly by the hand without saying another word either good or bad to her he led her out after my father that he might finish the ecclaircissement himself Chapter three XV Had this volume been a farce which unless every one s life and opinions are to be looked upon as a farce as well as mine I see no reason to suppose the last chapter Sir had finished the first act of it and then this chapter must have set off thus Ptr r r ing twing twang prut trut tis a cursed bad fiddle Do you know whether my fiddle s in tune or no trut prut They should be fifths Tis wickedly strung tr a e i o u twang The bridge is a mile too high and the sound post absolutely down else trut prut hark tis not so bad a tone Diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle dum There is nothing in playing before good judges but there s a man there no not him with the bundle under his arm the grave man in black Sdeath not the gentleman with the sword on Sir I had rather play a Caprichio to Calliope herself than draw my bow across my fiddle before that very man and yet I ll stake my Cremona to a Jew s trump which is the greatest musical odds that ever were laid that I will this moment stop three hundred and fifty leagues out of tune upon my fiddle without punishing one single nerve that belongs to him Twaddle diddle tweddle diddle twiddle diddle twoddle diddle twuddle diddle prut trut krish krash krush I ve undone you Sir but you see he s no worse and was Apollo to take his fiddle after me he can make him no better Diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle hum dum drum Your worships and your reverences love music and God has made you all with good ears and some of you play delightfully yourselves trut prut prut trut O there is whom I could sit and hear whole days whose talents lie in making what he fiddles to be felt who inspires me with his joys and hopes and puts the most hidden springs of my heart into motion If you would borrow five guineas of me Sir which is generally ten guineas more than I have to spare or you Messrs Apothecary and Taylor want your bills paying that s your time Chapter three XVI The first thing which entered my father s head after affairs were a little settled in the family and Susanna had got possession of my mother s green sattin night gown was to sit down coolly after the example of Xenophon and write a Tristra paedia or system of education for me collecting first for that purpose his own scattered thoughts counsels and notions and binding them together so as to form an Institute for the government of my childhood and adolescence I was my father s last stake he had lost my brother Bobby entirely he had lost by his own computation full three fourths of me that is he had been unfortunate in his three first great casts for me my geniture nose and name there was but this one left and accordingly my father gave himself up to it with as much devotion as ever my uncle Toby had done to his doctrine of projectils The difference between them was that my uncle Toby drew his whole knowledge of projectils from Nicholas Tartaglia My father spun his every thread of it out of his own brain or reeled and cross twisted what all other spinners and spinsters had spun before him that twas pretty near the same torture to him In about three years or something more my father had got advanced almost into the middle of his work Like all other writers he met with disappointments He imagined he should be able to bring whatever he had to say into so small a compass that when it was finished and bound it might be rolled up in my mother s hussive Matter grows under our hands Let no man say Come I ll write a duodecimo My father gave himself up to it however with the most painful diligence proceeding step by step in every line with the same kind of caution and circumspection though I cannot say upon quite so religious a principle as was used by John de la Casse the lord archbishop of Benevento in compassing his Galatea in which his Grace of Benevento spent near forty years of his life and when the thing came out it was not of above half the size or the thickness of a Rider s Almanack How the holy man managed the affair unless he spent the greatest part of his time in combing his whiskers or playing at primero with his chaplain would pose any mortal not let into the true secret and therefore tis worth explaining to the world was it only for the encouragement of those few in it who write not so much to be fed as to be famous I own had John de la Casse the archbishop of Benevento for whose memory notwithstanding his Galatea I retain the highest veneration had he been Sir a slender clerk of dull wit slow parts costive head and so forth he and his Galatea might have jogged on together to the age of Methuselah for me the phaenomenon had not been worth a parenthesis But the reverse of this was the truth John de la Casse was a genius of fine parts and fertile fancy and yet with all these great advantages of nature which should have pricked him forwards with his Galatea he lay under an impuissance at the same time of advancing above a line and a half in the compass of a whole summer s day this disability in his Grace arose from an opinion he was afflicted with which opinion was this viz that whenever a Christian was writing a book not for his private amusement but where his intent and purpose was bona fide to print and publish it to the world his first thoughts were always the temptations of the evil one This was the state of ordinary writers but when a personage of venerable character and high station either in church or state once turned author he maintained that from the very moment he took pen in hand all the devils in hell broke out of their holes to cajole him Twas Term time with them every thought first and last was captious how specious and good soever twas all one in whatever form or colour it presented itself to the imagination twas still a stroke of one or other of em levell d at him and was to be fenced off So that the life of a writer whatever he might fancy to the contrary was not so much a state of composition as a state of warfare and his probation in it precisely that of any other man militant upon earth both depending alike not half so much upon the degrees of his wit as his Resistance My father was hugely pleased with this theory of John de la Casse archbishop of Benevento and had it not cramped him a little in his creed I believe would have given ten of the best acres in the Shandy estate to have been the broacher of it How far my father actually believed in the devil will be seen when I come to speak of my father s religious notions in the progress of this work tis enough to say here as he could not have the honour of it in the literal sense of the doctrine he took up with the allegory of it and would often say especially when his pen was a little retrograde there was as much good meaning truth and knowledge couched under the veil of John de la Casse s parabolical representation as was to be found in any one poetic fiction or mystic record of antiquity Prejudice of education he would say is the devil and the multitudes of them which we suck in with our mother s milk are the devil and all We are haunted with them brother Toby in all our lucubrations and researches and was a man fool enough to submit tamely to what they obtruded upon him what would his book be Nothing he would add throwing his pen away with a vengeance nothing but a farrago of the clack of nurses and of the nonsense of the old women of both sexes throughout the kingdom This is the best account I am determined to give of the slow progress my father made in his Tristra paedia at which as I said he was three years and something more indefatigably at work and at last had scarce completed by this own reckoning one half of his undertaking the misfortune was that I was all that time totally neglected and abandoned to my mother and what was almost as bad by the very delay the first part of the work upon which my father had spent the most of his pains was rendered entirely useless every day a page or two became of no consequence Certainly it was ordained as a scourge upon the pride of human wisdom That the wisest of us all should thus outwit ourselves and eternally forego our purposes in the intemperate act of pursuing them In short my father was so long in all his acts of resistance or in other words he advanced so very slow with his work and I began to live and get forwards at such a rate that if an event had not happened which when we get to it if it can be told with decency shall not be concealed a moment from the reader I verily believe I had put by my father and left him drawing a sundial for no better purpose than to be buried under ground Chapter three XVII Twas nothing I did not lose two drops of blood by it twas not worth calling in a surgeon had he lived next door to us thousands suffer by choice what I did by accident Doctor Slop made ten times more of it than there was occasion some men rise by the art of hanging great weights upon small wires and I am this day August the tenth seventeen sixty one paying part of the price of this man s reputation O twould provoke a stone to see how things are carried on in this world The chamber maid had left no under the bed Cannot you contrive master quoth Susannah lifting up the sash with one hand as she spoke and helping me up into the window seat with the other cannot you manage my dear for a single time to I was five years old Susannah did not consider that nothing was well hung in our family so slap came the sash down like lightning upon us Nothing is left cried Susannah nothing is left for me but to run my country My uncle Toby s house was a much kinder sanctuary and so Susannah fled to it Chapter three XVIII When Susannah told the corporal the misadventure of the sash with all the circumstances which attended the murder of me as she called it the blood forsook his cheeks all accessaries in murder being principals Trim s conscience told him he was as much to blame as Susannah and if the doctrine had been true my uncle Toby had as much of the bloodshed to answer for to heaven as either of em so that neither reason or instinct separate or together could possibly have guided Susannah s steps to so proper an asylum It is in vain to leave this to the Reader s imagination to form any kind of hypothesis that will render these propositions feasible he must cudgel his brains sore and to do it without he must have such brains as no reader ever had before him Why should I put them either to trial or to torture Tis my own affair I ll explain it myself Chapter three XIX Tis a pity Trim said my uncle Toby resting with his hand upon the corporal s shoulder as they both stood surveying their works that we have not a couple of field pieces to mount in the gorge of that new redoubt twould secure the lines all along there and make the attack on that side quite complete get me a couple cast Trim Your honour shall have them replied Trim before tomorrow morning It was the joy of Trim s heart nor was his fertile head ever at a loss for expedients in doing it to supply my uncle Toby in his campaigns with whatever his fancy called for had it been his last crown he would have sate down and hammered it into a paderero to have prevented a single wish in his master The corporal had already what with cutting off the ends of my uncle Toby s spouts hacking and chiseling up the sides of his leaden gutters melting down his pewter shaving bason and going at last like Lewis the Fourteenth on to the top of the church for spare ends c he had that very campaign brought no less than eight new battering cannons besides three demi culverins into the field my uncle Toby s demand for two more pieces for the redoubt had set the corporal at work again and no better resource offering he had taken the two leaden weights from the nursery window and as the sash pullies when the lead was gone were of no kind of use he had taken them away also to make a couple of wheels for one of their carriages He had dismantled every sash window in my uncle Toby s house long before in the very same way though not always in the same order for sometimes the pullies have been wanted and not the lead so then he began with the pullies and the pullies being picked out then the lead became useless and so the lead went to pot too A great Moral might be picked handsomely out of this but I have not time tis enough to say wherever the demolition began twas equally fatal to the sash window Chapter three XX The corporal had not taken his measures so badly in this stroke of artilleryship but that he might have kept the matter entirely to himself and left Susannah to have sustained the whole weight of the attack as she could true courage is not content with coming off so The corporal whether as general or comptroller of the train twas no matter had done that without which as he imagined the misfortune could never have happened at least in Susannah s hands How would your honours have behaved He determined at once not to take shelter behind Susannah but to give it and with this resolution upon his mind he marched upright into the parlour to lay the whole manoeuvre before my uncle Toby My uncle Toby had just then been giving Yorick an account of the Battle of Steenkirk and of the strange conduct of count Solmes in ordering the foot to halt and the horse to march where it could not act which was directly contrary to the king s commands and proved the loss of the day There are incidents in some families so pat to the purpose of what is going to follow they are scarce exceeded by the invention of a dramatic writer I mean of ancient days Trim by the help of his fore finger laid flat upon the table and the edge of his hand striking across it at right angles made a shift to tell his story so that priests and virgins might have listened to it and the story being told the dialogue went on as follows Chapter three XXI I would be picquetted to death cried the corporal as he concluded Susannah s story before I would suffer the woman to come to any harm twas my fault an please your honour not her s Corporal Trim replied my uncle Toby putting on his hat which lay upon the table if any thing can be said to be a fault when the service absolutely requires it should be done tis I certainly who deserve the blame you obeyed your orders Had count Solmes Trim done the same at the battle of Steenkirk said Yorick drolling a little upon the corporal who had been run over by a dragoon in the retreat he had saved thee Saved cried Trim interrupting Yorick and finishing the sentence for him after his own fashion he had saved five battalions an please your reverence every soul of them there was Cutt s continued the corporal clapping the forefinger of his right hand upon the thumb of his left and counting round his hand there was Cutt s Mackay s Angus s Graham s and Leven s all cut to pieces and so had the English life guards too had it not been for some regiments upon the right who marched up boldly to their relief and received the enemy s fire in their faces before any one of their own platoons discharged a musket they ll go to heaven for it added Trim Trim is right said my uncle Toby nodding to Yorick he s perfectly right What signified his marching the horse continued the corporal where the ground was so strait that the French had such a nation of hedges and copses and ditches and fell d trees laid this way and that to cover them as they always have Count Solmes should have sent us we would have fired muzzle to muzzle with them for their lives There was nothing to be done for the horse he had his foot shot off however for his pains continued the corporal the very next campaign at Landen Poor Trim got his wound there quoth my uncle Toby Twas owing an please your honour entirely to count Solmes had he drubbed them soundly at Steenkirk they would not have fought us at Landen Possibly not Trim said my uncle Toby though if they have the advantage of a wood or you give them a moment s time to intrench themselves they are a nation which will pop and pop for ever at you There is no way but to march coolly up to them receive their fire and fall in upon them pell mell Ding dong added Trim Horse and foot said my uncle Toby Helter Skelter said Trim Right and left cried my uncle Toby Blood an ounds shouted the corporal the battle raged Yorick drew his chair a little to one side for safety and after a moment s pause my uncle Toby sinking his voice a note resumed the discourse as follows Chapter three XXII King William said my uncle Toby addressing himself to Yorick was so terribly provoked at count Solmes for disobeying his orders that he would not suffer him to come into his presence for many months after I fear answered Yorick the squire will be as much provoked at the corporal as the King at the count But twould be singularly hard in this case continued be if corporal Trim who has behaved so diametrically opposite to count Solmes should have the fate to be rewarded with the same disgrace too oft in this world do things take that train I would spring a mine cried my uncle Toby rising up and blow up my fortifications and my house with them and we would perish under their ruins ere I would stand by and see it Trim directed a slight but a grateful bow towards his master and so the chapter ends Chapter three XXIII Then Yorick replied my uncle Toby you and I will lead the way abreast and do you corporal follow a few paces behind us And Susannah an please your honour said Trim shall be put in the rear Twas an excellent disposition and in this order without either drums beating or colours flying they marched slowly from my uncle Toby s house to Shandy hall I wish said Trim as they entered the door instead of the sash weights I had cut off the church spout as I once thought to have done You have cut off spouts enow replied Yorick Chapter three XXIV As many pictures as have been given of my father how like him soever in different airs and attitudes not one or all of them can ever help the reader to any kind of preconception of how my father would think speak or act upon any untried occasion or occurrence of life There was that infinitude of oddities in him and of chances along with it by which handle he would take a thing it baffled Sir all calculations The truth was his road lay so very far on one side from that wherein most men travelled that every object before him presented a face and section of itself to his eye altogether different from the plan and elevation of it seen by the rest of mankind In other words twas a different object and in course was differently considered This is the true reason that my dear Jenny and I as well as all the world besides us have such eternal squabbles about nothing She looks at her outside I at her in How is it possible we should agree about her value Chapter three XXV Tis a point settled and I mention it for the comfort of Confucius mister Shandy is supposed to mean esquire member for and not the Chinese Legislator who is apt to get entangled in telling a plain story that provided he keeps along the line of his story he may go backwards and forwards as he will tis still held to be no digression This being premised I take the benefit of the act of going backwards myself Chapter three XXVI Fifty thousand pannier loads of devils not of the Archbishop of Benevento s I mean of Rabelais s devils with their tails chopped off by their rumps could not have made so diabolical a scream of it as I did when the accident befel me it summoned up my mother instantly into the nursery so that Susannah had but just time to make her escape down the back stairs as my mother came up the fore Now though I was old enough to have told the story myself and young enough I hope to have done it without malignity yet Susannah in passing by the kitchen for fear of accidents had left it in short hand with the cook the cook had told it with a commentary to Jonathan and Jonathan to Obadiah so that by the time my father had rung the bell half a dozen times to know what was the matter above was Obadiah enabled to give him a particular account of it just as it had happened I thought as much said my father tucking up his night gown and so walked up stairs One would imagine from this though for my own part I somewhat question it that my father before that time had actually wrote that remarkable character in the Tristra paedia which to me is the most original and entertaining one in the whole book and that is the chapter upon sash windows with a bitter Philippick at the end of it upon the forgetfulness of chamber maids I have but two reasons for thinking otherwise First Had the matter been taken into consideration before the event happened my father certainly would have nailed up the sash window for good an all which considering with what difficulty he composed books he might have done with ten times less trouble than he could have wrote the chapter this argument I foresee holds good against his writing a chapter even after the event but tis obviated under the second reason which I have the honour to offer to the world in support of my opinion that my father did not write the chapter upon sash windows and chamber pots at the time supposed and it is this That in order to render the Tristra paedia complete I wrote the chapter myself Chapter three XXVII My father put on his spectacles looked took them off put them into the case all in less than a statutable minute and without opening his lips turned about and walked precipitately down stairs my mother imagined he had stepped down for lint and basilicon but seeing him return with a couple of folios under his arm and Obadiah following him with a large reading desk she took it for granted twas an herbal and so drew him a chair to the bedside that he might consult upon the case at his ease If it be but right done said my father turning to the Section de sede vel subjecto circumcisionis for he had brought up Spenser de Legibus Hebraeorum Ritualibus and Maimonides in order to confront and examine us altogether If it be but right done quoth he only tell us cried my mother interrupting him what herbs For that replied my father you must send for doctor Slop My mother went down and my father went on reading the section as follows Very well said my father nay if it has that convenience and so without stopping a moment to settle it first in his mind whether the Jews had it from the Egyptians or the Egyptians from the Jews he rose up and rubbing his forehead two or three times across with the palm of his hand in the manner we rub out the footsteps of care when evil has trod lighter upon us than we foreboded he shut the book and walked down stairs Nay said he mentioning the name of a different great nation upon every step as he set his foot upon it if the Egyptians the Syrians the Phoenicians the Arabians the Cappadocians if the Colchi and Troglodytes did it if Solon and Pythagoras submitted what is Tristram Who am I that I should fret or fume one moment about the matter Chapter three XXVIII Dear Yorick said my father smiling for Yorick had broke his rank with my uncle Toby in coming through the narrow entry and so had stept first into the parlour this Tristram of ours I find comes very hardly by all his religious rites Never was the son of Jew Christian Turk or Infidel initiated into them in so oblique and slovenly a manner But he is no worse I trust said Yorick There has been certainly continued my father the deuce and all to do in some part or other of the ecliptic when this offspring of mine was formed That you are a better judge of than I replied Yorick Astrologers quoth my father know better than us both the trine and sextil aspects have jumped awry or the opposite of their ascendents have not hit it as they should or the lords of the genitures as they call them have been at bo peep or something has been wrong above or below with us Tis possible answered Yorick But is the child cried my uncle Toby the worse The Troglodytes say not replied my father And your theologists Yorick tell us Theologically said Yorick or speaking after the manner of apothecaries footnote in Greek Philo statesmen footnote in Greek or washer women footnote in Greek Bochart I m not sure replied my father but they tell us brother Toby he s the better for it Provided said Yorick you travel him into Egypt Of that answered my father he will have the advantage when he sees the Pyramids Now every word of this quoth my uncle Toby is Arabic to me I wish said Yorick twas so to half the world Ilus footnote in Greek Sanchuniatho continued my father circumcised his whole army one morning Not without a court martial cried my uncle Toby Though the learned continued he taking no notice of my uncle Toby s remark but turning to Yorick are greatly divided still who Ilus was some say Saturn some the Supreme Being others no more than a brigadier general under Pharaoh neco Let him be who he will said my uncle Toby I know not by what article of war he could justify it The controvertists answered my father assign two and twenty different reasons for it others indeed who have drawn their pens on the opposite side of the question have shewn the world the futility of the greatest part of them But then again our best polemic divines I wish there was not a polemic divine said Yorick in the kingdom one ounce of practical divinity is worth a painted ship load of all their reverences have imported these fifty years Pray mister Yorick quoth my uncle Toby do tell me what a polemic divine is The best description captain Shandy I have ever read is of a couple of em replied Yorick in the account of the battle fought single hands betwixt Gymnast and captain Tripet which I have in my pocket I beg I may hear it quoth my uncle Toby earnestly You shall said Yorick And as the corporal is waiting for me at the door and I know the description of a battle will do the poor fellow more good than his supper I beg brother you ll give him leave to come in With all my soul said my father Trim came in erect and happy as an emperor and having shut the door Yorick took a book from his right hand coat pocket and read or pretended to read as follows Chapter three XXIX which words being heard by all the soldiers which were there divers of them being inwardly terrified did shrink back and make room for the assailant all this did Gymnast very well remark and consider and therefore making as if he would have alighted from off his horse as he was poising himself on the mounting side he most nimbly with his short sword by this thigh shifting his feet in the stirrup and performing the stirrup leather feat whereby after the inclining of his body downwards he forthwith launched himself aloft into the air and placed both his feet together upon the saddle standing upright with his back turned towards his horse s head Now said he my case goes forward Then suddenly in the same posture wherein he was he fetched a gambol upon one foot and turning to the left hand failed not to carry his body perfectly round just into his former position without missing one jot Ha said Tripet I will not do that at this time and not without cause Well said Gymnast I have failed I will undo this leap then with a marvellous strength and agility turning towards the right hand he fetched another striking gambol as before which done he set his right hand thumb upon the bow of the saddle raised himself up and sprung into the air poising and upholding his whole weight upon the muscle and nerve of the said thumb and so turned and whirled himself about three times at the fourth reversing his body and overturning it upside down and foreside back without touching any thing he brought himself betwixt the horse s two ears and then giving himself a jerking swing he seated himself upon the crupper This can t be fighting said my uncle Toby The corporal shook his head at it Have patience said Yorick Then Tripet pass d his right leg over his saddle and placed himself en croup But said he twere better for me to get into the saddle then putting the thumbs of both hands upon the crupper before him and there upon leaning himself as upon the only supporters of his body he incontinently turned heels over head in the air and strait found himself betwixt the bow of the saddle in a tolerable seat then springing into the air with a summerset he turned him about like a wind mill and made above a hundred frisks turns and demi pommadas Good God cried Trim losing all patience one home thrust of a bayonet is worth it all I think so too replied Yorick I am of a contrary opinion quoth my father Chapter three XXX No I think I have advanced nothing replied my father making answer to a question which Yorick had taken the liberty to put to him I have advanced nothing in the Tristra paedia but what is as clear as any one proposition in Euclid Reach me Trim that book from off the scrutoir it has oft times been in my mind continued my father to have read it over both to you Yorick and to my brother Toby and I think it a little unfriendly in myself in not having done it long ago shall we have a short chapter or two now and a chapter or two hereafter as occasions serve and so on till we get through the whole My uncle Toby and Yorick made the obeisance which was proper and the corporal though he was not included in the compliment laid his hand upon his breast and made his bow at the same time The company smiled Trim quoth my father has paid the full price for staying out the entertainment He did not seem to relish the play replied Yorick Twas a Tom fool battle an please your reverence of captain Tripet s and that other officer making so many summersets as they advanced the French come on capering now and then in that way but not quite so much My uncle Toby never felt the consciousness of his existence with more complacency than what the corporal s and his own reflections made him do at that moment he lighted his pipe Yorick drew his chair closer to the table Trim snuff d the candle my father stirr d up the fire took up the book cough d twice and begun Chapter three XXXI The first thirty pages said my father turning over the leaves are a little dry and as they are not closely connected with the subject for the present we ll pass them by tis a prefatory introduction continued my father or an introductory preface for I am not determined which name to give it upon political or civil government the foundation of which being laid in the first conjunction betwixt male and female for procreation of the species I was insensibly led into it Twas natural said Yorick The original of society continued my father I m satisfied is what Politian tells us i e merely conjugal and nothing more than the getting together of one man and one woman to which according to Hesiod the philosopher adds a servant but supposing in the first beginning there were no men servants born he lays the foundation of it in a man a woman and a bull I believe tis an ox quoth Yorick quoting the passage Greek A bull must have given more trouble than his head was worth But there is a better reason still said my father dipping his pen into his ink for the ox being the most patient of animals and the most useful withal in tilling the ground for their nourishment was the properest instrument and emblem too for the new joined couple that the creation could have associated with them And there is a stronger reason added my uncle Toby than them all for the ox My father had not power to take his pen out of his ink horn till he had heard my uncle Toby s reason For when the ground was tilled said my uncle Toby and made worth inclosing then they began to secure it by walls and ditches which was the origin of fortification True true dear Toby cried my father striking out the bull and putting the ox in his place My father gave Trim a nod to snuff the candle and resumed his discourse I enter upon this speculation said my father carelessly and half shutting the book as he went on merely to shew the foundation of the natural relation between a father and his child the right and jurisdiction over whom he acquires these several ways first by marriage twod by adoption threed by legitimation And fourth by procreation all which I consider in their order I lay a slight stress upon one of them replied Yorick the act especially where it ends there in my opinion lays as little obligation upon the child as it conveys power to the father You are wrong said my father argutely and for this plain reason I own added my father that the offspring upon this account is not so under the power and jurisdiction of the mother But the reason replied Yorick equally holds good for her She is under authority herself said my father and besides continued my father nodding his head and laying his finger upon the side of his nose as he assigned his reason she is not the principal agent Yorick In what quoth my uncle Toby stopping his pipe Though by all means added my father not attending to my uncle Toby The son ought to pay her respect as you may read Yorick at large in the first book of the Institutes of Justinian at the eleventh title and the tenth section I can read it as well replied Yorick in the Catechism Chapter three XXXII Trim can repeat every word of it by heart quoth my uncle Toby Pugh said my father not caring to be interrupted with Trim s saying his Catechism He can upon my honour replied my uncle Toby Ask him mister Yorick any question you please The fifth Commandment Trim said Yorick speaking mildly and with a gentle nod as to a modest Catechumen The corporal stood silent You don t ask him right said my uncle Toby raising his voice and giving it rapidly like the word of command The fifth cried my uncle Toby I must begin with the first an please your honour said the corporal Yorick could not forbear smiling Your reverence does not consider said the corporal shouldering his stick like a musket and marching into the middle of the room to illustrate his position that tis exactly the same thing as doing one s exercise in the field Join your right hand to your firelock cried the corporal giving the word of command and performing the motion Poise your firelock cried the corporal doing the duty still both of adjutant and private man Rest your firelock one motion an please your reverence you see leads into another If his honour will begin but with the first The First cried my uncle Toby setting his hand upon his side The Second cried my uncle Toby waving his tobacco pipe as he would have done his sword at the head of a regiment The corporal went through his manual with exactness and having honoured his father and mother made a low bow and fell back to the side of the room Every thing in this world said my father is big with jest and has wit in it and instruction too if we can but find it out Here is the scaffold work of Instruction its true point of folly without the Building behind it Here is the glass for pedagogues preceptors tutors governors gerund grinders and bear leaders to view themselves in in their true dimensions Oh there is a husk and shell Yorick which grows up with learning which their unskilfulness knows not how to fling away Sciences May Be Learned by Rote But Wisdom Not Yorick thought my father inspired I will enter into obligations this moment said my father to lay out all my aunt Dinah s legacy in charitable uses of which by the bye my father had no high opinion if the corporal has any one determinate idea annexed to any one word he has repeated Prithee Trim quoth my father turning round to him What dost thou mean by honouring thy father and mother Allowing them an please your honour three halfpence a day out of my pay when they grow old And didst thou do that Trim said Yorick He did indeed replied my uncle Toby Then Trim said Yorick springing out of his chair and taking the corporal by the hand thou art the best commentator upon that part of the Decalogue and I honour thee more for it corporal Trim than if thou hadst had a hand in the Talmud itself Chapter three XXXIII O blessed health cried my father making an exclamation as he turned over the leaves to the next chapter thou art before all gold and treasure tis thou who enlargest the soul and openest all its powers to receive instruction and to relish virtue He that has thee has little more to wish for and he that is so wretched as to want thee wants every thing with thee I have concentrated all that can be said upon this important head said my father into a very little room therefore we ll read the chapter quite through My father read as follows The whole secret of health depending upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the radical heat and the radical moisture You have proved that matter of fact I suppose above said Yorick Sufficiently replied my father In saying this my father shut the book not as if he resolved to read no more of it for he kept his fore finger in the chapter nor pettishly for he shut the book slowly his thumb resting when he had done it upon the upper side of the cover as his three fingers supported the lower side of it without the least compressive violence I have demonstrated the truth of that point quoth my father nodding to Yorick most sufficiently in the preceding chapter Now could the man in the moon be told that a man in the earth had wrote a chapter sufficiently demonstrating That the secret of all health depended upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the radical heat and the radical moisture and that he had managed the point so well that there was not one single word wet or dry upon radical heat or radical moisture throughout the whole chapter or a single syllable in it pro or con directly or indirectly upon the contention betwixt these two powers in any part of the animal oeconomy O thou eternal Maker of all beings he would cry striking his breast with his right hand in case he had one Thou whose power and goodness can enlarge the faculties of thy creatures to this infinite degree of excellence and perfection What have we Moonites done Chapter three XXXIV With two strokes the one at Hippocrates the other at Lord Verulam did my father achieve it The stroke at the prince of physicians with which he began was no more than a short insult upon his sorrowful complaint of the Ars longa and Vita brevis Life short cried my father and the art of healing tedious And who are we to thank for both the one and the other but the ignorance of quacks themselves and the stage loads of chymical nostrums and peripatetic lumber with which in all ages they have first flatter d the world and at last deceived it O my lord Verulam cried my father turning from Hippocrates and making his second stroke at him as the principal of nostrum mongers and the fittest to be made an example of to the rest What shall I say to thee my great lord Verulam What shall I say to thy internal spirit thy opium thy salt petre thy greasy unctions thy daily purges thy nightly clysters and succedaneums My father was never at a loss what to say to any man upon any subject and had the least occasion for the exordium of any man breathing how he dealt with his lordship s opinion you shall see but when I know not we must first see what his lordship s opinion was Chapter three XXXV The two great causes which conspire with each other to shorten life says lord Verulam are first The internal spirit which like a gentle flame wastes the body down to death And secondly the external air that parches the body up to ashes which two enemies attacking us on both sides of our bodies together at length destroy our organs and render them unfit to carry on the functions of life This being the state of the case the road to longevity was plain nothing more being required says his lordship but to repair the waste committed by the internal spirit by making the substance of it more thick and dense by a regular course of opiates on one side and by refrigerating the heat of it on the other by three grains and a half of salt petre every morning before you got up Still this frame of ours was left exposed to the inimical assaults of the air without but this was fenced off again by a course of greasy unctions which so fully saturated the pores of the skin that no spicula could enter nor could any one get out This put a stop to all perspiration sensible and insensible which being the cause of so many scurvy distempers a course of clysters was requisite to carry off redundant humours and render the system complete What my father had to say to my lord of Verulam s opiates his salt petre and greasy unctions and clysters you shall read but not to day or to morrow time presses upon me my reader is impatient I must get forwards You shall read the chapter at your leisure if you chuse it as soon as ever the Tristra paedia is published Sufficeth it at present to say my father levelled the hypothesis with the ground and in doing that the learned know he built up and established his own Chapter three XXXVI The whole secret of health said my father beginning the sentence again depending evidently upon the due contention betwixt the radical heat and radical moisture within us the least imaginable skill had been sufficient to have maintained it had not the school men confounded the task merely as Van Helmont the famous chymist has proved by all along mistaking the radical moisture for the tallow and fat of animal bodies Now the radical moisture is not the tallow or fat of animals but an oily and balsamous substance for the fat and tallow as also the phlegm or watery parts are cold whereas the oily and balsamous parts are of a lively heat and spirit which accounts for the observation of Aristotle Quod omne animal post coitum est triste Now it is certain that the radical heat lives in the radical moisture but whether vice versa is a doubt however when the one decays the other decays also and then is produced either an unnatural heat which causes an unnatural dryness or an unnatural moisture which causes dropsies So that if a child as he grows up can but be taught to avoid running into fire or water as either of em threaten his destruction twill be all that is needful to be done upon that head Chapter three XXXVII The description of the siege of Jericho itself could not have engaged the attention of my uncle Toby more powerfully than the last chapter his eyes were fixed upon my father throughout it he never mentioned radical heat and radical moisture but my uncle Toby took his pipe out of his mouth and shook his head and as soon as the chapter was finished he beckoned to the corporal to come close to his chair to ask him the following question aside It was at the siege of Limerick an please your honour replied the corporal making a bow The poor fellow and I quoth my uncle Toby addressing himself to my father were scarce able to crawl out of our tents at the time the siege of Limerick was raised upon the very account you mention Now what can have got into that precious noddle of thine my dear brother Toby cried my father mentally By Heaven continued he communing still with himself it would puzzle an Oedipus to bring it in point I believe an please your honour quoth the corporal that if it had not been for the quantity of brandy we set fire to every night and the claret and cinnamon with which I plyed your honour off And the geneva Trim added my uncle Toby which did us more good than all I verily believe continued the corporal we had both an please your honour left our lives in the trenches and been buried in them too The noblest grave corporal cried my uncle Toby his eyes sparkling as he spoke that a soldier could wish to lie down in But a pitiful death for him an please your honour replied the corporal All this was as much Arabick to my father as the rites of the Colchi and Troglodites had been before to my uncle Toby my father could not determine whether he was to frown or to smile My uncle Toby turning to Yorick resumed the case at Limerick more intelligibly than he had begun it and so settled the point for my father at once Chapter three XXXVIII It was undoubtedly said my uncle Toby a great happiness for myself and the corporal that we had all along a burning fever attended with a most raging thirst during the whole five and twenty days the flux was upon us in the camp otherwise what my brother calls the radical moisture must as I conceive it inevitably have got the better My father drew in his lungs top full of air and looking up blew it forth again as slowly as he possibly could It was Heaven s mercy to us continued my uncle Toby which put it into the corporal s head to maintain that due contention betwixt the radical heat and the radical moisture by reinforceing the fever as he did all along with hot wine and spices whereby the corporal kept up as it were a continual firing so that the radical heat stood its ground from the beginning to the end and was a fair match for the moisture terrible as it was Upon my honour added my uncle Toby you might have heard the contention within our bodies brother Shandy twenty toises If there was no firing said Yorick Well said my father with a full aspiration and pausing a while after the word Was I a judge and the laws of the country which made me one permitted it I would condemn some of the worst malefactors provided they had had their clergy Yorick foreseeing the sentence was likely to end with no sort of mercy laid his hand upon my father s breast and begged he would respite it for a few minutes till he asked the corporal a question Prithee Trim said Yorick without staying for my father s leave tell us honestly what is thy opinion concerning this self same radical heat and radical moisture With humble submission to his honour s better judgment quoth the corporal making a bow to my uncle Toby Speak thy opinion freely corporal said my uncle Toby The poor fellow is my servant not my slave added my uncle Toby turning to my father The corporal put his hat under his left arm and with his stick hanging upon the wrist of it by a black thong split into a tassel about the knot he marched up to the ground where he had performed his catechism then touching his under jaw with the thumb and fingers of his right hand before he opened his mouth he delivered his notion thus Chapter three XXXIX Just as the corporal was humming to begin in waddled doctor Slop Tis not two pence matter the corporal shall go on in the next chapter let who will come in Well my good doctor cried my father sportively for the transitions of his passions were unaccountably sudden and what has this whelp of mine to say to the matter Had my father been asking after the amputation of the tail of a puppy dog he could not have done it in a more careless air the system which doctor Slop had laid down to treat the accident by no way allowed of such a mode of enquiry He sat down Pray Sir quoth my uncle Toby in a manner which could not go unanswered in what condition is the boy Twill end in a phimosis replied doctor Slop I am no wiser than I was quoth my uncle Toby returning his pipe into his mouth Then let the corporal go on said my father with his medical lecture The corporal made a bow to his old friend doctor Slop and then delivered his opinion concerning radical heat and radical moisture in the following words Chapter three XL The city of Limerick the siege of which was begun under his majesty king William himself the year after I went into the army lies an please your honours in the middle of a devilish wet swampy country Tis quite surrounded said my uncle Toby with the Shannon and is by its situation one of the strongest fortified places in Ireland I think this is a new fashion quoth doctor Slop of beginning a medical lecture Tis all true answered Trim Then I wish the faculty would follow the cut of it said Yorick Tis all cut through an please your reverence said the corporal with drains and bogs and besides there was such a quantity of rain fell during the siege the whole country was like a puddle twas that and nothing else which brought on the flux and which had like to have killed both his honour and myself now there was no such thing after the first ten days continued the corporal for a soldier to lie dry in his tent without cutting a ditch round it to draw off the water nor was that enough for those who could afford it as his honour could without setting fire every night to a pewter dish full of brandy which took off the damp of the air and made the inside of the tent as warm as a stove And what conclusion dost thou draw corporal Trim cried my father from all these premises I infer an please your worship replied Trim that the radical moisture is nothing in the world but ditch water and that the radical heat of those who can go to the expence of it is burnt brandy the radical heat and moisture of a private man an please your honour is nothing but ditch water and a dram of geneva and give us but enough of it with a pipe of tobacco to give us spirits and drive away the vapours we know not what it is to fear death I am at a loss Captain Shandy quoth Doctor Slop to determine in which branch of learning your servant shines most whether in physiology or divinity Slop had not forgot Trim s comment upon the sermon It is but an hour ago replied Yorick since the corporal was examined in the latter and passed muster with great honour The radical heat and moisture quoth Doctor Slop turning to my father you must know is the basis and foundation of our being as the root of a tree is the source and principle of its vegetation It is inherent in the seeds of all animals and may be preserved sundry ways but principally in my opinion by consubstantials impriments and occludents Now this poor fellow continued doctor Slop pointing to the corporal has had the misfortune to have heard some superficial empiric discourse upon this nice point That he has said my father Very likely said my uncle I m sure of it quoth Yorick Chapter three XLI Doctor Slop being called out to look at a cataplasm he had ordered it gave my father an opportunity of going on with another chapter in the Tristra paedia Come cheer up my lads I ll shew you land for when we have tugged through that chapter the book shall not be opened again this twelve month Huzza Chapter three XLII Five years with a bib under his chin Four years in travelling from Christ cross row to Malachi A year and a half in learning to write his own name Seven long years and more Greek ing it at Greek and Latin Four years at his probations and his negations the fine statue still lying in the middle of the marble block and nothing done but his tools sharpened to hew it out Tis a piteous delay Was not the great Julius Scaliger within an ace of never getting his tools sharpened at all Forty four years old was he before he could manage his Greek and Peter Damianus lord bishop of Ostia as all the world knows could not so much as read when he was of man s estate And Baldus himself as eminent as he turned out after entered upon the law so late in life that every body imagined he intended to be an advocate in the other world no wonder when Eudamidas the son of Archidamas heard Xenocrates at seventy five disputing about wisdom that he asked gravely If the old man be yet disputing and enquiring concerning wisdom what time will he have to make use of it Yorick listened to my father with great attention there was a seasoning of wisdom unaccountably mixed up with his strangest whims and he had sometimes such illuminations in the darkest of his eclipses as almost atoned for them be wary Sir when you imitate him I am convinced Yorick continued my father half reading and half discoursing that there is a North west passage to the intellectual world and that the soul of man has shorter ways of going to work in furnishing itself with knowledge and instruction than we generally take with it But alack all fields have not a river or a spring running besides them every child Yorick has not a parent to point it out The whole entirely depends added my father in a low voice upon the auxiliary verbs mister Yorick Had Yorick trod upon Virgil s snake he could not have looked more surprised I am surprised too cried my father observing it and I reckon it as one of the greatest calamities which ever befel the republic of letters That those who have been entrusted with the education of our children and whose business it was to open their minds and stock them early with ideas in order to set the imagination loose upon them have made so little use of the auxiliary verbs in doing it as they have done So that except Raymond Lullius and the elder Pelegrini the last of which arrived to such perfection in the use of em with his topics that in a few lessons he could teach a young gentleman to discourse with plausibility upon any subject pro and con and to say and write all that could be spoken or written concerning it without blotting a word to the admiration of all who beheld him I should be glad said Yorick interrupting my father to be made to comprehend this matter You shall said my father The highest stretch of improvement a single word is capable of is a high metaphor for which in my opinion the idea is generally the worse and not the better but be that as it may when the mind has done that with it there is an end the mind and the idea are at rest until a second idea enters and so on Now the use of the Auxiliaries is at once to set the soul a going by herself upon the materials as they are brought her and by the versability of this great engine round which they are twisted to open new tracts of enquiry and make every idea engender millions You excite my curiosity greatly said Yorick For my own part quoth my uncle Toby I have given it up The Danes an please your honour quoth the corporal who were on the left at the siege of Limerick were all auxiliaries And very good ones said my uncle Toby But the auxiliaries Trim my brother is talking about I conceive to be different things You do said my father rising up Chapter three XLIII My father took a single turn across the room then sat down and finished the chapter The verbs auxiliary we are concerned in here continued my father are am was have had do did make made suffer shall should will would can could owe ought used or is wont And these varied with tenses present past future and conjugated with the verb see or with these questions added to them Is it Was it Will it be Would it be May it be Might it be And these again put negatively Is it not Was it not Ought it not Or affirmatively It is It was It ought to be Or chronologically Has it been always Lately How long ago Or hypothetically If it was If it was not What would follow If the French should beat the English If the Sun go out of the Zodiac Now by the right use and application of these continued my father in which a child s memory should be exercised there is no one idea can enter his brain how barren soever but a magazine of conceptions and conclusions may be drawn forth from it Didst thou ever see a white bear cried my father turning his head round to Trim who stood at the back of his chair No an please your honour replied the corporal But thou couldst discourse about one Trim said my father in case of need How is it possible brother quoth my uncle Toby if the corporal never saw one Tis the fact I want replied my father and the possibility of it is as follows A White Bear Very well Have I ever seen one Might I ever have seen one Am I ever to see one Ought I ever to have seen one Or can I ever see one Would I had seen a white bear for how can I imagine it If I should see a white bear what should I say If I should never see a white bear what then If I never have can must or shall see a white bear alive have I ever seen the skin of one Did I ever see one painted described Have I never dreamed of one Did my father mother uncle aunt brothers or sisters ever see a white bear What would they give How would they behave How would the white bear have behaved Is he wild Tame Terrible Rough Smooth Is the white bear worth seeing Is there no sin in it Is it better than a Black One Chapter three XLIV We ll not stop two moments my dear Sir only as we have got through these five volumes In the first edition the sixth volume began with this chapter do Sir sit down upon a set they are better than nothing let us just look back upon the country we have pass d through What a wilderness has it been and what a mercy that we have not both of us been lost or devoured by wild beasts in it Did you think the world itself Sir had contained such a number of Jack Asses How they view d and review d us as we passed over the rivulet at the bottom of that little valley and when we climbed over that hill and were just getting out of sight good God what a braying did they all set up together Prithee shepherd who keeps all those Jack Asses Heaven be their comforter What are they never curried Are they never taken in in winter Bray bray bray Bray on the world is deeply your debtor louder still that s nothing in good sooth you are ill used Was I a Jack Asse I solemnly declare I would bray in G sol re ut from morning even unto night Chapter three XLV When my father had danced his white bear backwards and forwards through half a dozen pages he closed the book for good an all and in a kind of triumph redelivered it into Trim s hand with a nod to lay it upon the scrutoire where he found it Tristram said he shall be made to conjugate every word in the dictionary backwards and forwards the same way every word Yorick by this means you see is converted into a thesis or an hypothesis every thesis and hypothesis have an off spring of propositions and each proposition has its own consequences and conclusions every one of which leads the mind on again into fresh tracks of enquiries and doubtings The force of this engine added my father is incredible in opening a child s head Tis enough brother Shandy cried my uncle Toby to burst it into a thousand splinters I presume said Yorick smiling it must be owing to this for let logicians say what they will it is not to be accounted for sufficiently from the bare use of the ten predicaments That the famous Vincent Quirino amongst the many other astonishing feats of his childhood of which the Cardinal Bembo has given the world so exact a story should be able to paste up in the public schools at Rome so early as in the eighth year of his age no less than four thousand five hundred and fifty different theses upon the most abstruse points of the most abstruse theology and to defend and maintain them in such sort as to cramp and dumbfound his opponents What is that cried my father to what is told us of Alphonsus Tostatus who almost in his nurse s arms learned all the sciences and liberal arts without being taught any one of them What shall we say of the great Piereskius That s the very man cried my uncle Toby I once told you of brother Shandy who walked a matter of five hundred miles reckoning from Paris to Shevling and from Shevling back again merely to see Stevinus s flying chariot He was a very great man added my uncle Toby meaning Stevinus He was so brother Toby said my father meaning Piereskius and had multiplied his ideas so fast and increased his knowledge to such a prodigious stock that if we may give credit to an anecdote concerning him which we cannot withhold here without shaking the authority of all anecdotes whatever at seven years of age his father committed entirely to his care the education of his younger brother a boy of five years old with the sole management of all his concerns Was the father as wise as the son quoth my uncle Toby I should think not said Yorick But what are these continued my father breaking out in a kind of enthusiasm what are these to those prodigies of childhood in Grotius Scioppius Heinsius Politian Pascal Joseph Scaliger Ferdinand de Cordoue and others some of which left off their substantial forms at nine years old or sooner and went on reasoning without them others went through their classics at seven wrote tragedies at eight Ferdinand de Cordoue was so wise at nine twas thought the Devil was in him and at Venice gave such proofs of his knowledge and goodness that the monks imagined he was Antichrist or nothing Others were masters of fourteen languages at ten finished the course of their rhetoric poetry logic and ethics at eleven put forth their commentaries upon Servius and Martianus Capella at twelve and at thirteen received their degrees in philosophy laws and divinity but you forget the great Lipsius quoth Yorick who composed a work Nous aurions quelque interet says Baillet de montrer qu il n a rien de ridicule s il etoit veritable au moins dans le sens enigmatique que Nicius Erythraeus a ta he de lui donner Cet auteur dit que pour comprendre comme Lipse il a pu composer un ouvrage le premier jour de sa vie il faut s imaginer que ce premier jour n est pas celui de sa naissance charnelle mais celui au quel il a commence d user de la raison il veut que c ait ete a l age de neuf ans et il nous veut persuader que ce fut en cet age que Lipse fit un poeme Le tour est ingenieux c c the day he was born They should have wiped it up said my uncle Toby and said no more about it Chapter three XLVI When the cataplasm was ready a scruple of decorum had unseasonably rose up in Susannah s conscience about holding the candle whilst Slop tied it on Slop had not treated Susannah s distemper with anodynes and so a quarrel had ensued betwixt them Oh oh said Slop casting a glance of undue freedom in Susannah s face as she declined the office then I think I know you madam You know me Sir cried Susannah fastidiously and with a toss of her head levelled evidently not at his profession but at the doctor himself you know me cried Susannah again Doctor Slop clapped his finger and his thumb instantly upon his nostrils Susannah s spleen was ready to burst at it Tis false said Susannah Come come missus Modesty said Slop not a little elated with the success of his last thrust If you won t hold the candle and look you may hold it and shut your eyes That s one of your popish shifts cried Susannah Tis better said Slop with a nod than no shift at all young woman I defy you Sir cried Susannah pulling her shift sleeve below her elbow It was almost impossible for two persons to assist each other in a surgical case with a more splenetic cordiality Slop snatched up the cataplasm Susannah snatched up the candle A little this way said Slop Susannah looking one way and rowing another instantly set fire to Slop s wig which being somewhat bushy and unctuous withal was burnt out before it was well kindled You impudent whore cried Slop for what is passion but a wild beast you impudent whore cried Slop getting upright with the cataplasm in his hand I never was the destruction of any body s nose said Susannah which is more than you can say Is it cried Slop throwing the cataplasm in her face Yes it is cried Susannah returning the compliment with what was left in the pan Chapter three XLVII Doctor Slop and Susannah filed cross bills against each other in the parlour which done as the cataplasm had failed they retired into the kitchen to prepare a fomentation for me and whilst that was doing my father determined the point as you will read Chapter three XLVIII You see tis high time said my father addressing himself equally to my uncle Toby and Yorick to take this young creature out of these women s hands and put him into those of a private governor Marcus Antoninus provided fourteen governors all at once to superintend his son Commodus s education and in six weeks he cashiered five of them I know very well continued my father that Commodus s mother was in love with a gladiator at the time of her conception which accounts for a great many of Commodus s cruelties when he became emperor but still I am of opinion that those five whom Antoninus dismissed did Commodus s temper in that short time more hurt than the other nine were able to rectify all their lives long Now as I consider the person who is to be about my son as the mirror in which he is to view himself from morning to night by which he is to adjust his looks his carriage and perhaps the inmost sentiments of his heart I would have one Yorick if possible polished at all points fit for my child to look into This is very good sense quoth my uncle Toby to himself There is continued my father a certain mien and motion of the body and all its parts both in acting and speaking which argues a man well within and I am not at all surprised that Gregory of Nazianzum upon observing the hasty and untoward gestures of Julian should foretel he would one day become an apostate or that saint Ambrose should turn his Amanuensis out of doors because of an indecent motion of his head which went backwards and forwards like a flail or that Democritus should conceive Protagoras to be a scholar from seeing him bind up a faggot and thrusting as he did it the small twigs inwards There are a thousand unnoticed openings continued my father which let a penetrating eye at once into a man s soul and I maintain it added he that a man of sense does not lay down his hat in coming into a room or take it up in going out of it but something escapes which discovers him It is for these reasons continued my father that the governor I make choice of shall neither Vid Pellegrina lisp or squint or wink or talk loud or look fierce or foolish or bite his lips or grind his teeth or speak through his nose or pick it or blow it with his fingers He shall neither walk fast or slow or fold his arms for that is laziness or hang them down for that is folly or hide them in his pocket for that is nonsense He shall neither strike or pinch or tickle or bite or cut his nails or hawk or spit or snift or drum with his feet or fingers in company nor according to Erasmus shall he speak to any one in making water nor shall he point to carrion or excrement Now this is all nonsense again quoth my uncle Toby to himself I will have him continued my father cheerful facete jovial at the same time prudent attentive to business vigilant acute argute inventive quick in resolving doubts and speculative questions he shall be wise and judicious and learned And why not humble and moderate and gentle tempered and good said Yorick And why not cried my uncle Toby free and generous and bountiful and brave He shall my dear Toby replied my father getting up and shaking him by his hand Then brother Shandy answered my uncle Toby raising himself off the chair and laying down his pipe to take hold of my father s other hand I humbly beg I may recommend poor Le Fever s son to you a tear of joy of the first water sparkled in my uncle Toby s eye and another the fellow to it in the corporal s as the proposition was made you will see why when you read Le Fever s story fool that I was nor can I recollect nor perhaps you without turning back to the place what it was that hindered me from letting the corporal tell it in his own words but the occasion is lost I must tell it now in my own Chapter three XLIX The Story of Le Fever It was some time in the summer of that year in which Dendermond was taken by the allies which was about seven years before my father came into the country and about as many after the time that my uncle Toby and Trim had privately decamped from my father s house in town in order to lay some of the finest sieges to some of the finest fortified cities in Europe when my uncle Toby was one evening getting his supper with Trim sitting behind him at a small sideboard I say sitting for in consideration of the corporal s lame knee which sometimes gave him exquisite pain when my uncle Toby dined or supped alone he would never suffer the corporal to stand and the poor fellow s veneration for his master was such that with a proper artillery my uncle Toby could have taken Dendermond itself with less trouble than he was able to gain this point over him for many a time when my uncle Toby supposed the corporal s leg was at rest he would look back and detect him standing behind him with the most dutiful respect this bred more little squabbles betwixt them than all other causes for five and twenty years together But this is neither here nor there why do I mention it Ask my pen it governs me I govern not it He was one evening sitting thus at his supper when the landlord of a little inn in the village came into the parlour with an empty phial in his hand to beg a glass or two of sack Tis for a poor gentleman I think of the army said the landlord who has been taken ill at my house four days ago and has never held up his head since or had a desire to taste any thing till just now that he has a fancy for a glass of sack and a thin toast I think says he taking his hand from his forehead it would comfort me If I could neither beg borrow or buy such a thing added the landlord I would almost steal it for the poor gentleman he is so ill I hope in God he will still mend continued he we are all of us concerned for him Thou art a good natured soul I will answer for thee cried my uncle Toby and thou shalt drink the poor gentleman s health in a glass of sack thyself and take a couple of bottles with my service and tell him he is heartily welcome to them and to a dozen more if they will do him good Though I am persuaded said my uncle Toby as the landlord shut the door he is a very compassionate fellow Trim yet I cannot help entertaining a high opinion of his guest too there must be something more than common in him that in so short a time should win so much upon the affections of his host And of his whole family added the corporal for they are all concerned for him Step after him said my uncle Toby do Trim and ask if he knows his name I have quite forgot it truly said the landlord coming back into the parlour with the corporal but I can ask his son again Has he a son with him then said my uncle Toby A boy replied the landlord of about eleven or twelve years of age but the poor creature has tasted almost as little as his father he does nothing but mourn and lament for him night and day He has not stirred from the bed side these two days My uncle Toby laid down his knife and fork and thrust his plate from before him as the landlord gave him the account and Trim without being ordered took away without saying one word and in a few minutes after brought him his pipe and tobacco Stay in the room a little said my uncle Toby Trim said my uncle Toby after he lighted his pipe and smoak d about a dozen whiffs Trim came in front of his master and made his bow my uncle Toby smoak d on and said no more Corporal said my uncle Toby the corporal made his bow My uncle Toby proceeded no farther but finished his pipe Trim said my uncle Toby I have a project in my head as it is a bad night of wrapping myself up warm in my roquelaure and paying a visit to this poor gentleman Your honour s roquelaure replied the corporal has not once been had on since the night before your honour received your wound when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of saint Nicholas and besides it is so cold and rainy a night that what with the roquelaure and what with the weather twill be enough to give your honour your death and bring on your honour s torment in your groin I fear so replied my uncle Toby but I am not at rest in my mind Trim since the account the landlord has given me I wish I had not known so much of this affair added my uncle Toby or that I had known more of it How shall we manage it Leave it an t please your honour to me quoth the corporal I ll take my hat and stick and go to the house and reconnoitre and act accordingly and I will bring your honour a full account in an hour Thou shalt go Trim said my uncle Toby and here s a shilling for thee to drink with his servant I shall get it all out of him said the corporal shutting the door My uncle Toby filled his second pipe and had it not been that he now and then wandered from the point with considering whether it was not full as well to have the curtain of the tennaile a straight line as a crooked one he might be said to have thought of nothing else but poor Le Fever and his boy the whole time he smoaked it Chapter three L The Story of Le Fever Continued It was not till my uncle Toby had knocked the ashes out of his third pipe that corporal Trim returned from the inn and gave him the following account I despaired at first said the corporal of being able to bring back your honour any kind of intelligence concerning the poor sick lieutenant Is he in the army then said my uncle Toby He is said the corporal And in what regiment said my uncle Toby I ll tell your honour replied the corporal every thing straight forwards as I learnt it Then Trim I ll fill another pipe said my uncle Toby and not interrupt thee till thou hast done so sit down at thy ease Trim in the window seat and begin thy story again The corporal made his old bow which generally spoke as plain as a bow could speak it Your honour is good And having done that he sat down as he was ordered and begun the story to my uncle Toby over again in pretty near the same words I despaired at first said the corporal of being able to bring back any intelligence to your honour about the lieutenant and his son for when I asked where his servant was from whom I made myself sure of knowing every thing which was proper to be asked That s a right distinction Trim said my uncle Toby I was answered an please your honour that he had no servant with him that he had come to the inn with hired horses which upon finding himself unable to proceed to join I suppose the regiment he had dismissed the morning after he came If I get better my dear said he as he gave his purse to his son to pay the man we can hire horses from hence But alas the poor gentleman will never get from hence said the landlady to me for I heard the death watch all night long and when he dies the youth his son will certainly die with him for he is broken hearted already I was hearing this account continued the corporal when the youth came into the kitchen to order the thin toast the landlord spoke of but I will do it for my father myself said the youth Pray let my save you the trouble young gentleman said I taking up a fork for the purpose and offering him my chair to sit down upon by the fire whilst I did it I believe Sir said he very modestly I can please him best myself I am sure said I his honour will not like the toast the worse for being toasted by an old soldier The youth took hold of my hand and instantly burst into tears Poor youth said my uncle Toby he has been bred up from an infant in the army and the name of a soldier Trim sounded in his ears like the name of a friend I wish I had him here I never in the longest march said the corporal had so great a mind to my dinner as I had to cry with him for company What could be the matter with me an please your honour Nothing in the world Trim said my uncle Toby blowing his nose but that thou art a good natured fellow When I gave him the toast continued the corporal I thought it was proper to tell him I was captain Shandy s servant and that your honour though a stranger was extremely concerned for his father and that if there was any thing in your house or cellar And thou might saint have added my purse too said my uncle Toby he was heartily welcome to it He made a very low bow which was meant to your honour but no answer for his heart was full so he went up stairs with the toast I warrant you my dear said I as I opened the kitchen door your father will be well again mister Yorick s curate was smoking a pipe by the kitchen fire but said not a word good or bad to comfort the youth I thought it wrong added the corporal I think so too said my uncle Toby When the lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast he felt himself a little revived and sent down into the kitchen to let me know that in about ten minutes he should be glad if I would step up stairs I believe said the landlord he is going to say his prayers for there was a book laid upon the chair by his bed side and as I shut the door I saw his son take up a cushion I thought said the curate that you gentlemen of the army mister Trim never said your prayers at all I heard the poor gentleman say his prayers last night said the landlady very devoutly and with my own ears or I could not have believed it Are you sure of it replied the curate A soldier an please your reverence said I prays as often of his own accord as a parson and when he is fighting for his king and for his own life and for his honour too he has the most reason to pray to God of any one in the whole world Twas well said of thee Trim said my uncle Toby But when a soldier said I an please your reverence has been standing for twelve hours together in the trenches up to his knees in cold water or engaged said I for months together in long and dangerous marches harassed perhaps in his rear to day harassing others to morrow detached here countermanded there resting this night out upon his arms beat up in his shirt the next benumbed in his joints perhaps without straw in his tent to kneel on must say his prayers how and when he can I believe said I for I was piqued quoth the corporal for the reputation of the army I believe an please your reverence said I that when a soldier gets time to pray he prays as heartily as a parson though not with all his fuss and hypocrisy Thou shouldst not have said that Trim said my uncle Toby for God only knows who is a hypocrite and who is not At the great and general review of us all corporal at the day of judgment and not till then it will be seen who has done their duties in this world and who has not and we shall be advanced Trim accordingly I hope we shall said Trim It is in the Scripture said my uncle Toby and I will shew it thee to morrow In the mean time we may depend upon it Trim for our comfort said my uncle Toby that God Almighty is so good and just a governor of the world that if we have but done our duties in it it will never be enquired into whether we have done them in a red coat or a black one I hope not said the corporal But go on Trim said my uncle Toby with thy story When I went up continued the corporal into the lieutenant s room which I did not do till the expiration of the ten minutes he was lying in his bed with his head raised upon his hand with his elbow upon the pillow and a clean white cambrick handkerchief beside it The youth was just stooping down to take up the cushion upon which I supposed he had been kneeling the book was laid upon the bed and as he rose in taking up the cushion with one hand he reached out his other to take it away at the same time Let it remain there my dear said the lieutenant He did not offer to speak to me till I had walked up close to his bed side If you are captain Shandy s servant said he you must present my thanks to your master with my little boy s thanks along with them for his courtesy to me if he was of Levens s said the lieutenant I told him your honour was Then said he I served three campaigns with him in Flanders and remember him but tis most likely as I had not the honour of any acquaintance with him that he knows nothing of me You will tell him however that the person his good nature has laid under obligations to him is one Le Fever a lieutenant in Angus s but he knows me not said he a second time musing possibly he may my story added he pray tell the captain I was the ensign at Breda whose wife was most unfortunately killed with a musket shot as she lay in my arms in my tent I remember the story an t please your honour said I very well Do you so said he wiping his eyes with his handkerchief then well may I In saying this he drew a little ring out of his bosom which seemed tied with a black ribband about his neck and kiss d it twice Here Billy said he the boy flew across the room to the bed side and falling down upon his knee took the ring in his hand and kissed it too then kissed his father and sat down upon the bed and wept I wish said my uncle Toby with a deep sigh I wish Trim I was asleep Your honour replied the corporal is too much concerned shall I pour your honour out a glass of sack to your pipe Do Trim said my uncle Toby I remember said my uncle Toby sighing again the story of the ensign and his wife with a circumstance his modesty omitted and particularly well that he as well as she upon some account or other I forget what was universally pitied by the whole regiment but finish the story thou art upon Tis finished already said the corporal for I could stay no longer so wished his honour a good night young Le Fever rose from off the bed and saw me to the bottom of the stairs and as we went down together told me they had come from Ireland and were on their route to join the regiment in Flanders But alas said the corporal the lieutenant s last day s march is over Then what is to become of his poor boy cried my uncle Toby Chapter three LI The Story of Le Fever Continued It was to my uncle Toby s eternal honour though I tell it only for the sake of those who when coop d in betwixt a natural and a positive law know not for their souls which way in the world to turn themselves That notwithstanding my uncle Toby was warmly engaged at that time in carrying on the siege of Dendermond parallel with the allies who pressed theirs on so vigorously that they scarce allowed him time to get his dinner that nevertheless he gave up Dendermond though he had already made a lodgment upon the counterscarp and bent his whole thoughts towards the private distresses at the inn and except that he ordered the garden gate to be bolted up by which he might be said to have turned the siege of Dendermond into a blockade he left Dendermond to itself to be relieved or not by the French king as the French king thought good and only considered how he himself should relieve the poor lieutenant and his son That kind Being who is a friend to the friendless shall recompence thee for this Thou hast left this matter short said my uncle Toby to the corporal as he was putting him to bed and I will tell thee in what Trim In the first place when thou madest an offer of my services to Le Fever as sickness and travelling are both expensive and thou knowest he was but a poor lieutenant with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his pay that thou didst not make an offer to him of my purse because had he stood in need thou knowest Trim he had been as welcome to it as myself Your honour knows said the corporal I had no orders True quoth my uncle Toby thou didst very right Trim as a soldier but certainly very wrong as a man In the second place for which indeed thou hast the same excuse continued my uncle Toby when thou offeredst him whatever was in my house thou shouldst have offered him my house too A sick brother officer should have the best quarters Trim and if we had him with us we could tend and look to him Thou art an excellent nurse thyself Trim and what with thy care of him and the old woman s and his boy s and mine together we might recruit him again at once and set him upon his legs In a fortnight or three weeks added my uncle Toby smiling he might march He will never march an please your honour in this world said the corporal He will march said my uncle Toby rising up from the side of the bed with one shoe off An please your honour said the corporal he will never march but to his grave He shall march cried my uncle Toby marching the foot which had a shoe on though without advanceing an inch he shall march to his regiment He cannot stand it said the corporal He shall be supported said my uncle Toby He ll drop at last said the corporal and what will become of his boy He shall not drop said my uncle Toby firmly A well o day do what we can for him said Trim maintaining his point the poor soul will die He shall not die by G cried my uncle Toby The Accusing Spirit which flew up to heaven s chancery with the oath blush d as he gave it in and the Recording Angel as he wrote it down dropp d a tear upon the word and blotted it out for ever Chapter three LII My uncle Toby went to his bureau put his purse into his breeches pocket and having ordered the corporal to go early in the morning for a physician he went to bed and fell asleep Chapter three LIII The Story of Le Fever Continued The sun looked bright the morning after to every eye in the village but Le Fever s and his afflicted son s the hand of death pressed heavy upon his eye lids and hardly could the wheel at the cistern turn round its circle when my uncle Toby who had rose up an hour before his wonted time entered the lieutenant s room and without preface or apology sat himself down upon the chair by the bed side and independently of all modes and customs opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and brother officer would have done it and asked him how he did how he had rested in the night what was his complaint where was his pain and what he could do to help him and without giving him time to answer any one of the enquiries went on and told him of the little plan which he had been concerting with the corporal the night before for him You shall go home directly Le Fever said my uncle Toby to my house and we ll send for a doctor to see what s the matter and we ll have an apothecary and the corporal shall be your nurse and I ll be your servant Le Fever There was a frankness in my uncle Toby not the effect of familiarity but the cause of it which let you at once into his soul and shewed you the goodness of his nature to this there was something in his looks and voice and manner superadded which eternally beckoned to the unfortunate to come and take shelter under him so that before my uncle Toby had half finished the kind offers he was making to the father had the son insensibly pressed up close to his knees and had taken hold of the breast of his coat and was pulling it towards him The blood and spirits of Le Fever which were waxing cold and slow within him and were retreating to their last citadel the heart rallied back the film forsook his eyes for a moment he looked up wishfully in my uncle Toby s face then cast a look upon his boy and that ligament fine as it was was never broken Nature instantly ebb d again the film returned to its place the pulse fluttered stopp d went on throbb d stopp d again moved stopp d shall I go on No Chapter three LIV I am so impatient to return to my own story that what remains of young Le Fever s that is from this turn of his fortune to the time my uncle Toby recommended him for my preceptor shall be told in a very few words in the next chapter All that is necessary to be added to this chapter is as follows That my uncle Toby with young Le Fever in his hand attended the poor lieutenant as chief mourners to his grave That the governor of Dendermond paid his obsequies all military honours and that Yorick not to be behind hand paid him all ecclesiastic for he buried him in his chancel And it appears likewise he preached a funeral sermon over him I say it appears for it was Yorick s custom which I suppose a general one with those of his profession on the first leaf of every sermon which he composed to chronicle down the time the place and the occasion of its being preached to this he was ever wont to add some short comment or stricture upon the sermon itself seldom indeed much to its credit For instance This sermon upon the Jewish dispensation I don t like it at all Though I own there is a world of Water Landish knowledge in it but tis all tritical and most tritically put together This is but a flimsy kind of a composition what was in my head when I made it N B The excellency of this text is that it will suit any sermon and of this sermon that it will suit any text For this sermon I shall be hanged for I have stolen the greatest part of it Doctor Paidagunes found me out Set a thief to catch a thief On the back of half a dozen I find written So so and no more and upon a couple Moderato by which as far as one may gather from Altieri s Italian dictionary but mostly from the authority of a piece of green whipcord which seemed to have been the unravelling of Yorick s whip lash with which he has left us the two sermons marked Moderato and the half dozen of So so tied fast together in one bundle by themselves one may safely suppose he meant pretty near the same thing There is but one difficulty in the way of this conjecture which is this that the moderato s are five times better than the so so s show ten times more knowledge of the human heart have seventy times more wit and spirit in them and to rise properly in my climax discovered a thousand times more genius and to crown all are infinitely more entertaining than those tied up with them for which reason whene er Yorick s dramatic sermons are offered to the world though I shall admit but one out of the whole number of the so so s I shall nevertheless adventure to print the two moderato s without any sort of scruple What Yorick could mean by the words lentamente tenute grave and sometimes adagio as applied to theological compositions and with which he has characterised some of these sermons I dare not venture to guess I am more puzzled still upon finding a l octava alta upon one Con strepito upon the back of another Scicilliana upon a third Alla capella upon a fourth Con l arco upon this Senza l arco upon that All I know is that they are musical terms and have a meaning and as he was a musical man I will make no doubt but that by some quaint application of such metaphors to the compositions in hand they impressed very distinct ideas of their several characters upon his fancy whatever they may do upon that of others Amongst these there is that particular sermon which has unaccountably led me into this digression The funeral sermon upon poor Le Fever wrote out very fairly as if from a hasty copy I take notice of it the more because it seems to have been his favourite composition It is upon mortality and is tied length ways and cross ways with a yarn thrum and then rolled up and twisted round with a half sheet of dirty blue paper which seems to have been once the cast cover of a general review which to this day smells horribly of horse drugs Whether these marks of humiliation were designed I something doubt because at the end of the sermon and not at the beginning of it very different from his way of treating the rest he had wrote Bravo Though not very offensively for it is at two inches at least and a half s distance from and below the concluding line of the sermon at the very extremity of the page and in that right hand corner of it which you know is generally covered with your thumb and to do it justice it is wrote besides with a crow s quill so faintly in a small Italian hand as scarce to solicit the eye towards the place whether your thumb is there or not so that from the manner of it it stands half excused and being wrote moreover with very pale ink diluted almost to nothing tis more like a ritratto of the shadow of vanity than of Vanity herself of the two resembling rather a faint thought of transient applause secretly stirring up in the heart of the composer than a gross mark of it coarsely obtruded upon the world With all these extenuations I am aware that in publishing this I do no service to Yorick s character as a modest man but all men have their failings and what lessens this still farther and almost wipes it away is this that the word was struck through sometime afterwards as appears from a different tint of the ink with a line quite across it in this manner BRAVO crossed out as if he had retracted or was ashamed of the opinion he had once entertained of it These short characters of his sermons were always written excepting in this one instance upon the first leaf of his sermon which served as a cover to it and usually upon the inside of it which was turned towards the text but at the end of his discourse where perhaps he had five or six pages and sometimes perhaps a whole score to turn himself in he took a large circuit and indeed a much more mettlesome one as if he had snatched the occasion of unlacing himself with a few more frolicksome strokes at vice than the straitness of the pulpit allowed These though hussar like they skirmish lightly and out of all order are still auxiliaries on the side of virtue tell me then Mynheer Vander Blonederdondergewdenstronke why they should not be printed together Chapter three LV When my uncle Toby had turned every thing into money and settled all accounts betwixt the agent of the regiment and Le Fever and betwixt Le Fever and all mankind there remained nothing more in my uncle Toby s hands than an old regimental coat and a sword so that my uncle Toby found little or no opposition from the world in taking administration The coat my uncle Toby gave the corporal Wear it Trim said my uncle Toby as long as it will hold together for the sake of the poor lieutenant And this said my uncle Toby taking up the sword in his hand and drawing it out of the scabbard as he spoke and this Le Fever I ll save for thee tis all the fortune continued my uncle Toby hanging it up upon a crook and pointing to it tis all the fortune my dear Le Fever which God has left thee but if he has given thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the world and thou doest it like a man of honour tis enough for us As soon as my uncle Toby had laid a foundation and taught him to inscribe a regular polygon in a circle he sent him to a public school where excepting Whitsontide and Christmas at which times the corporal was punctually dispatched for him he remained to the spring of the year seventeen when the stories of the emperor s sending his army into Hungary against the Turks kindling a spark of fire in his bosom he left his Greek and Latin without leave and throwing himself upon his knees before my uncle Toby begged his father s sword and my uncle Toby s leave along with it to go and try his fortune under Eugene Twice did my uncle Toby forget his wound and cry out Le Fever I will go with thee and thou shalt fight beside me And twice he laid his hand upon his groin and hung down his head in sorrow and disconsolation My uncle Toby took down the sword from the crook where it had hung untouched ever since the lieutenant s death and delivered it to the corporal to brighten up and having detained Le Fever a single fortnight to equip him and contract for his passage to Leghorn he put the sword into his hand If thou art brave Le Fever said my uncle Toby this will not fail thee but Fortune said he musing a little Fortune may And if she does added my uncle Toby embracing him come back again to me Le Fever and we will shape thee another course The greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of Le Fever more than my uncle Toby s paternal kindness he parted from my uncle Toby as the best of sons from the best of fathers both dropped tears and as my uncle Toby gave him his last kiss he slipped sixty guineas tied up in an old purse of his father s in which was his mother s ring into his hand and bid God bless him Chapter three LVI Le Fever got up to the Imperial army just time enough to try what metal his sword was made of at the defeat of the Turks before Belgrade but a series of unmerited mischances had pursued him from that moment and trod close upon his heels for four years together after he had withstood these buffetings to the last till sickness overtook him at Marseilles from whence he wrote my uncle Toby word he had lost his time his services his health and in short every thing but his sword and was waiting for the first ship to return back to him As this letter came to hand about six weeks before Susannah s accident Le Fever was hourly expected and was uppermost in my uncle Toby s mind all the time my father was giving him and Yorick a description of what kind of a person he would chuse for a preceptor to me but as my uncle Toby thought my father at first somewhat fanciful in the accomplishments he required he forbore mentioning Le Fever s name till the character by Yorick s inter position ending unexpectedly in one who should be gentle tempered and generous and good it impressed the image of Le Fever and his interest upon my uncle Toby so forcibly he rose instantly off his chair and laying down his pipe in order to take hold of both my father s hands I beg brother Shandy said my uncle Toby I may recommend poor Le Fever s son to you I beseech you do added Yorick He has a good heart said my uncle Toby And a brave one too an please your honour said the corporal The best hearts Trim are ever the bravest replied my uncle Toby And the greatest cowards an please your honour in our regiment were the greatest rascals in it There was serjeant Kumber and ensign We ll talk of them said my father another time Chapter three LVII What a jovial and a merry world would this be may it please your worships but for that inextricable labyrinth of debts cares woes want grief discontent melancholy large jointures impositions and lies Doctor Slop like a son of a w as my father called him for it to exalt himself debased me to death and made ten thousand times more of Susannah s accident than there was any grounds for so that in a week s time or less it was in every body s mouth That poor Master Shandy entirely And Fame who loves to double every thing in three days more had sworn positively she saw it and all the world as usual gave credit to her evidence That the nursery window had not only but that s also Could the world have been sued like a Body Corporate my father had brought an action upon the case and trounced it sufficiently but to fall foul of individuals about it as every soul who had mentioned the affair did it with the greatest pity imaginable twas like flying in the very face of his best friends And yet to acquiesce under the report in silence was to acknowledge it openly at least in the opinion of one half of the world and to make a bustle again in contradicting it was to confirm it as strongly in the opinion of the other half Was ever poor devil of a country gentleman so hampered said my father I would shew him publickly said my uncle Toby at the market cross Twill have no effect said my father Chapter three LVIII I ll put him however into breeches said my father let the world say what it will Chapter three LIX There are a thousand resolutions Sir both in church and state as well as in matters Madam of a more private concern which though they have carried all the appearance in the world of being taken and entered upon in a hasty hare brained and unadvised manner were notwithstanding this and could you or I have got into the cabinet or stood behind the curtain we should have found it was so weighed poized and perpended argued upon canvassed through entered into and examined on all sides with so much coolness that the Goddess of Coolness herself I do not take upon me to prove her existence could neither have wished it or done it better Of the number of these was my father s resolution of putting me into breeches which though determined at once in a kind of huff and a defiance of all mankind had nevertheless been pro d and conn d and judicially talked over betwixt him and my mother about a month before in two several beds of justice which my father had held for that purpose I shall explain the nature of these beds of justice in my next chapter and in the chapter following that you shall step with me Madam behind the curtain only to hear in what kind of manner my father and my mother debated between themselves this affair of the breeches from which you may form an idea how they debated all lesser matters Chapter three LX The ancient Goths of Germany who the learned Cluverius is positive were first seated in the country between the Vistula and the Oder and who afterwards incorporated the Herculi the Bugians and some other Vandallick clans to em had all of them a wise custom of debating every thing of importance to their state twice that is once drunk and once sober Drunk that their councils might not want vigour and sober that they might not want discretion Now my father being entirely a water drinker was a long time gravelled almost to death in turning this as much to his advantage as he did every other thing which the ancients did or said and it was not till the seventh year of his marriage after a thousand fruitless experiments and devices that he hit upon an expedient which answered the purpose and that was when any difficult and momentous point was to be settled in the family which required great sobriety and great spirit too in its determination he fixed and set apart the first Sunday night in the month and the Saturday night which immediately preceded it to argue it over in bed with my mother By which contrivance if you consider Sir with yourself These my father humorously enough called his beds of justice for from the two different counsels taken in these two different humours a middle one was generally found out which touched the point of wisdom as well as if he had got drunk and sober a hundred times I must not be made a secret of to the world that this answers full as well in literary discussions as either in military or conjugal but it is not every author that can try the experiment as the Goths and Vandals did it or if he can may it be always for his body s health and to do it as my father did it am I sure it would be always for his soul s My way is this In all nice and ticklish discussions of which heaven knows there are but too many in my book where I find I cannot take a step without the danger of having either their worships or their reverences upon my back I write one half full and t other fasting or write it all full and correct it fasting or write it fasting and correct it full for they all come to the same thing So that with a less variation from my father s plan than my father s from the Gothick I feel myself upon a par with him in his first bed of justice and no way inferior to him in his second These different and almost irreconcileable effects flow uniformly from the wise and wonderful mechanism of nature of which be her s the honour All that we can do is to turn and work the machine to the improvement and better manufactory of the arts and sciences Now when I write full I write as if I was never to write fasting again as long as I live that is I write free from the cares as well as the terrors of the world I count not the number of my scars nor does my fancy go forth into dark entries and bye corners to ante date my stabs In a word my pen takes its course and I write on as much from the fulness of my heart as my stomach But when an please your honours I indite fasting tis a different history I pay the world all possible attention and respect and have as great a share whilst it lasts of that under strapping virtue of discretion as the best of you So that betwixt both I write a careless kind of a civil nonsensical good humoured Shandean book which will do all your hearts good And all your heads too provided you understand it Chapter three LXI We should begin said my father turning himself half round in bed and shifting his pillow a little towards my mother s as he opened the debate We should begin to think missus Shandy of putting this boy into breeches We should so said my mother We defer it my dear quoth my father shamefully I think we do mister Shandy said my mother Not but the child looks extremely well said my father in his vests and tunicks He does look very well in them replied my mother And for that reason it would be almost a sin added my father to take him out of em It would so said my mother But indeed he is growing a very tall lad rejoined my father He is very tall for his age indeed said my mother I can not making two syllables of it imagine quoth my father who the deuce he takes after I cannot conceive for my life said my mother Humph said my father The dialogue ceased for a moment I am very short myself continued my father gravely You are very short mister Shandy said my mother Humph quoth my father to himself a second time in muttering which he plucked his pillow a little further from my mother s and turning about again there was an end of the debate for three minutes and a half When he gets these breeches made cried my father in a higher tone he ll look like a beast in em He will be very awkward in them at first replied my mother And twill be lucky if that s the worst on t added my father It will be very lucky answered my mother I suppose replied my father making some pause first he ll be exactly like other people s children Exactly said my mother Though I shall be sorry for that added my father and so the debate stopp d again They should be of leather said my father turning him about again They will last him said my mother the longest But he can have no linings to em replied my father He cannot said my mother Twere better to have them of fustian quoth my father Nothing can be better quoth my mother Except dimity replied my father Tis best of all replied my mother One must not give him his death however interrupted my father By no means said my mother and so the dialogue stood still again I am resolved however quoth my father breaking silence the fourth time he shall have no pockets in them There is no occasion for any said my mother I mean in his coat and waistcoat cried my father I mean so too replied my mother Though if he gets a gig or top Poor souls it is a crown and a sceptre to them they should have where to secure it Order it as you please mister Shandy replied my mother But don t you think it right added my father pressing the point home to her Perfectly said my mother if it pleases you mister Shandy There s for you cried my father losing his temper Pleases me You never will distinguish missus Shandy nor shall I ever teach you to do it betwixt a point of pleasure and a point of convenience This was on the Sunday night and further this chapter sayeth not Chapter three LXII After my father had debated the affair of the breeches with my mother he consulted Albertus Rubenius upon it and Albertus Rubenius used my father ten times worse in the consultation if possible than even my father had used my mother For as Rubenius had wrote a quarto express De re Vestiaria Veterum it was Rubenius s business to have given my father some lights On the contrary my father might as well have thought of extracting the seven cardinal virtues out of a long beard as of extracting a single word out of Rubenius upon the subject Upon every other article of ancient dress Rubenius was very communicative to my father gave him a full satisfactory account of The Toga or loose gown The Chlamys The Ephod The Tunica or Jacket The Synthesis The Paenula The Lacema with its Cucullus The Paludamentum The Praetexta The Sagum or soldier s jerkin The Trabea of which according to Suetonius there was three kinds But what are all these to the breeches said my father Rubenius threw him down upon the counter all kinds of shoes which had been in fashion with the Romans There was The open shoe The close shoe The slip shoe The wooden shoe The soc The buskin And The military shoe with hobnails in it which Juvenal takes notice of There were The clogs The pattins The pantoufles The brogues The sandals with latchets to them There was The felt shoe The linen shoe The laced shoe The braided shoe The calceus incisus And The calceus rostratus Rubenius shewed my father how well they all fitted in what manner they laced on with what points straps thongs latchets ribbands jaggs and ends But I want to be informed about the breeches said my father Albertus Rubenius informed my father that the Romans manufactured stuffs of various fabrics some plain some striped others diapered throughout the whole contexture of the wool with silk and gold That linen did not begin to be in common use till towards the declension of the empire when the Egyptians coming to settle amongst them brought it into vogue That persons of quality and fortune distinguished themselves by the fineness and whiteness of their clothes which colour next to purple which was appropriated to the great offices they most affected and wore on their birth days and public rejoicings That it appeared from the best historians of those times that they frequently sent their clothes to the fuller to be clean d and whitened but that the inferior people to avoid that expence generally wore brown clothes and of a something coarser texture till towards the beginning of Augustus s reign when the slave dressed like his master and almost every distinction of habiliment was lost but the Latus Clavus And what was the Latus Clavus said my father Rubenius told him that the point was still litigating amongst the learned That Egnatius Sigonius Bossius Ticinensis Bayfius Budaeus Salmasius Lipsius Lazius Isaac Casaubon and Joseph Scaliger all differed from each other and he from them That some took it to be the button some the coat itself others only the colour of it That the great Bayfuis in his Wardrobe of the Ancients chap twelve honestly said he knew not what it was whether a tibula a stud a button a loop a buckle or clasps and keepers My father lost the horse but not the saddle They are hooks and eyes said my father and with hooks and eyes he ordered my breeches to be made Chapter three LXIII We are now going to enter upon a new scene of events Leave we then the breeches in the taylor s hands with my father standing over him with his cane reading him as he sat at work a lecture upon the latus clavus and pointing to the precise part of the waistband where he was determined to have it sewed on Leave we my mother truest of all the Poco curante s of her sex careless about it as about every thing else in the world which concerned her that is indifferent whether it was done this way or that provided it was but done at all Leave we Slop likewise to the full profits of all my dishonours Leave we poor Le Fever to recover and get home from Marseilles as he can

4407-13145-0001	train-other-500	which lay at the bottom of my uncle Toby s kitchen garden and which was the scene of so many of his delicious hours
none	none	 the fault is not in me 
4407-13145-0002	train-other-500	but in his imagination for I am sure I gave him so minute a description I was almost ashamed of it When Fate was looking forwards one afternoon into the great transactions of future times and recollected for what purposes this little plot

4407-13145-0005	train-other-500	My uncle Toby came down as the reader has been informed with plans along with him of almost every fortified town in Italy and Flanders so let the duke of Marlborough or the allies have set down before what town they pleased my uncle Toby was prepared for them
4407-13145-0006	train-other-500	His way which was the simplest one in the world was this as soon as ever a town was invested but sooner when the design was known to take the plan of it let it be what town it would

4407-13145-0007	train-other-500	he set the corporal to work and sweetly went it on The nature of the soil the nature of the work itself and above all the good nature of my uncle Toby sitting by from morning to night and chatting kindly with the corporal upon past done deeds
4407-13145-0008	train-other-500	left Labour little else but the ceremony of the name When the place was finished in this manner and put into a proper posture of defence it was invested and my uncle Toby and the corporal began to run their first parallel I beg I may not be interrupted in my story by being told
none	none	 That the first parallel should be at least three hundred toises distant from the main body of the place 
4407-13145-0009	train-other-500	and that I have not left a single inch for it for my uncle Toby took the liberty of incroaching upon his kitchen garden for the sake of enlarging his works on the bowling green and for that reason generally ran his first and second parallels betwixt two rows of his cabbages and his cauliflowers
4407-13145-0010	train-other-500	the conveniences and inconveniences of which will be considered at large in the history of my uncle Toby s and the corporal s campaigns of which this I m now writing is but a sketch and will be finished if I conjecture right in three pages but there is no guessing
4407-13145-0011	train-other-500	The campaigns themselves will take up as many books and therefore I apprehend it would be hanging too great a weight of one kind of matter in so flimsy a performance as this to rhapsodize them as I once intended into the body of the work surely they had better be printed apart
4407-13145-0012	train-other-500	we ll consider the affair so take the following sketch of them in the mean time

4407-13145-0013	train-other-500	When the town with its works was finished my uncle Toby and the corporal began to run their first parallel not at random or any how but from the same points and distances the allies had begun to run theirs

4407-13145-0016	train-other-500	in which a practicable breach had been made by the duke of Marlborough
none	none	 in the main body of the place to have stood behind the horn beam hedge 
4407-13145-0017	train-other-500	and observed the spirit with which my uncle Toby with Trim behind him sallied forth the one with the Gazette in his hand the other with a spade on his shoulder to execute the contents What an honest triumph in my uncle Toby s looks as he marched up to the ramparts

4407-13145-0021	train-other-500	did my uncle Toby and Trim move for many years every year of which and sometimes every month
none	none	 from the invention of either the one or the other of them 
4407-13145-0022	train-other-500	adding some new conceit or quirk of improvement to their operations which always opened fresh springs of delight in carrying them on The first year s campaign was carried on from beginning to end in the plain and simple method I ve related
4407-13145-0023	train-other-500	In the second year in which my uncle Toby took Liege and Ruremond he thought he might afford the expence of four handsome draw bridges of two of which I have given an exact description in the former part of my work
4407-13145-0024	train-other-500	At the latter end of the same year he added a couple of gates with port cullises These last were converted afterwards into orgues as the better thing and during the winter of the same year my uncle Toby instead of a new suit of clothes which he always had at Christmas
4407-13145-0025	train-other-500	treated himself with a handsome sentry box to stand at the corner of the bowling green betwixt which point and the foot of the glacis there was left a little kind of an esplanade for him and the corporal to confer and hold councils of war upon The sentry box was in case of rain
4407-13145-0026	train-other-500	All these were painted white three times over the ensuing spring which enabled my uncle Toby to take the field with great splendour My father would often say to Yorick that if any mortal in the whole universe had done such a thing except his brother Toby

none	none	 Chapter three LXVI I must observe 
4407-13145-0028	train-other-500	that although in the first year s campaign the word town is often mentioned yet there was no town at that time within the polygon that addition was not made till the summer following the spring in which the bridges and sentry box were painted which was the third year of my uncle Toby s campaigns
4407-13145-0029	train-other-500	when upon his taking Amberg Bonn and Rhinberg and Huy and Limbourg one after another a thought came into the corporal s head that to talk of taking so many towns without one Town to shew for it was a very nonsensical way of going to work
none	none	 and so proposed to my uncle Toby 
4407-13145-0030	train-other-500	that they should have a little model of a town built for them to be run up together of slit deals
none	none	 and then painted 
4407-13145-0031	train-other-500	and clapped within the interior polygon to serve for all My uncle Toby felt the good of the project instantly and instantly agreed to it but with the addition of two singular improvements
none	none	 of which he was almost as proud as if he had been the original inventor of the project itself The one was to have the town built exactly in the style of those of which it was most likely to be the representative with grated windows and the gable ends of the houses facing the streets c c as those in Ghent and Bruges 
4407-13145-0032	train-other-500	and the rest of the towns in Brabant and Flanders The other was not to have the houses run up together as the corporal proposed but to have every house independent to hook on or off so as to form into the plan of whatever town they pleased
4407-13145-0033	train-other-500	This was put directly into hand and many and many a look of mutual congratulation was exchanged between my uncle Toby and the corporal as the carpenter did the work It answered prodigiously the next summer the town was a perfect Proteus It was Landen and Trerebach
none	none	 and Santvliet 
4407-13145-0034	train-other-500	and Drusen and Hagenau and then it was Ostend and Menin and Aeth and Dendermond Surely never did any Town act so many parts since Sodom and Gomorrah as my uncle Toby s town did In the fourth year
4407-13145-0035	train-other-500	my uncle Toby thinking a town looked foolishly without a church added a very fine one with a steeple Trim was for having bells in it my uncle Toby said the metal had better be cast into cannon This
none	none	 led the way the next campaign for half a dozen brass field pieces to be planted three and three on each side of my uncle Toby s sentry box 
4407-13145-0036	train-other-500	and in a short time these led the way for a train of somewhat larger
none	none	 and so on as must always be the case in hobby horsical affairs 
4407-13145-0037	train-other-500	from pieces of half an inch bore till it came at last to my father s jack boots The next year which was that in which Lisle was besieged and at the close of which both Ghent and Bruges fell into our hands
4407-13145-0038	train-other-500	my uncle Toby was sadly put to it for proper ammunition I say proper ammunition because his great artillery would not bear powder and twas well for the Shandy family they would not For so full were the papers
none	none	 from the beginning to the end of the siege 
4407-13145-0039	train-other-500	of the incessant firings kept up by the besiegers and so heated was my uncle Toby s imagination with the accounts of them that he had infallibly shot away all his estate Something therefore was wanting as a succedaneum
4407-13145-0040	train-other-500	especially in one or two of the more violent paroxysms of the siege to keep up something like a continual firing in the imagination and this something the corporal whose principal strength lay in invention supplied by an entire new system of battering of his own without which
none	none	 this had been objected to by military critics to the end of the world 
4407-13145-0041	train-other-500	as one of the great desiderata of my uncle Toby s apparatus
none	none	 This will not be explained the worse for setting off as I generally do at a little distance from the subject Chapter three LXVII 
4407-13146-0000	train-other-500	With two or three other trinkets small in themselves but of great regard which poor Tom the corporal s unfortunate brother had sent him over with the account of his marriage with the Jew s widow there was A Montero cap and two Turkish tobacco pipes
4407-13146-0001	train-other-500	The Montero cap I shall describe by and bye The Turkish tobacco pipes had nothing particular in them they were fitted up and ornamented as usual with flexible tubes of Morocco leather and gold wire
none	none	 and mounted at their ends the one of them with ivory 
4407-13146-0002	train-other-500	the other with black ebony tipp d with silver My father who saw all things in lights different from the rest of the world would say to the corporal that he ought to look upon these two presents more as tokens of his brother s nicety than his affection Tom did not care Trim
4407-13146-0003	train-other-500	he would say to put on the cap or to smoke in the tobacco pipe of a Jew God bless your honour the corporal would say
none	none	 giving a strong reason to the contrary how can that be The Montero cap 
4407-13146-0004	train-other-500	was scarlet of a superfine Spanish cloth dyed in grain and mounted all round with fur except about four inches in the front which was faced with a light blue slightly embroidered
none	none	 and seemed to have been the property of a Portuguese quarter master 
4407-13146-0005	train-other-500	not of foot but of horse as the word denotes The corporal was not a little proud of it as well for its own sake as the sake of the giver so seldom or never put it on but upon Gala days
4407-13146-0006	train-other-500	and yet never was a Montero cap put to so many uses for in all controverted points whether military or culinary provided the corporal was sure he was in the right it was either his oath his wager or his gift
none	none	 Twas his gift in the present case 
4407-13146-0007	train-other-500	I ll be bound said the corporal speaking to himself to give away my Montero cap to the first beggar who comes to the door if I do not manage this matter to his honour s satisfaction The completion was no further off than the very next morning
4407-13146-0008	train-other-500	which was that of the storm of the counterscarp betwixt the Lower Deule to the right and the gate saint Andrew and on the left between saint Magdalen s and the river
none	none	 As this was the most memorable attack in the whole war the most gallant and obstinate on both sides 
4407-13146-0009	train-other-500	and I must add the most bloody too for it cost the allies themselves that morning above eleven hundred men my uncle Toby prepared himself for it with a more than ordinary solemnity The eve which preceded as my uncle Toby went to bed
none	none	 he ordered his ramallie wig 
4407-13146-0010	train-other-500	which had laid inside out for many years in the corner of an old campaigning trunk which stood by his bedside
none	none	 to be taken out and laid upon the lid of it ready for the morning and the very first thing he did in his shirt when he had stepped out of bed 
4407-13146-0011	train-other-500	my uncle Toby after he had turned the rough side outwards put it on This done he proceeded next to his breeches and having buttoned the waist band he forthwith buckled on his sword belt and had got his sword half way in when he considered he should want shaving
none	none	 and that it would be very inconvenient doing it with his sword on 
4407-13146-0012	train-other-500	so took it off In essaying to put on his regimental coat and waistcoat my uncle Toby found the same objection in his wig so that went off too
none	none	 So that what with one thing and what with another 
4407-13146-0013	train-other-500	as always falls out when a man is in the most haste
none	none	 twas ten o clock 
4407-13146-0014	train-other-500	which was half an hour later than his usual time before my uncle Toby sallied out
none	none	 Chapter three LXVIII 
4407-13146-0015	train-other-500	My uncle Toby had scarce turned the corner of his yew hedge
none	none	 which separated his kitchen garden from his bowling green when he perceived the corporal had begun the attack without him 
4407-13146-0016	train-other-500	Let me stop and give you a picture of the corporal s apparatus and of the corporal himself in the height of his attack just as it struck my uncle Toby as he turned towards the sentry box where the corporal was at work for in nature there is not such another
4407-13146-0017	train-other-500	nor can any combination of all that is grotesque and whimsical in her works produce its equal The corporal Tread lightly on his ashes ye men of genius for he was your kinsman Weed his grave clean ye men of goodness for he was your brother
4407-13146-0018	train-other-500	Oh corporal had I thee but now now that I am able to give thee a dinner and protection how would I cherish thee thou should saint wear thy Montero cap every hour of the day and every day of the week
none	none	 and when it was worn out I would purchase thee a couple like it 
4407-13146-0019	train-other-500	But alas alas alas now that I can do this in spite of their reverences the occasion is lost for thou art gone thy genius fled up to the stars from whence it came and that warm heart of thine with all its generous and open vessels
4407-13146-0020	train-other-500	compressed into a clod of the valley But what
none	none	 what is this to that future and dreaded page where I look towards the velvet pall 
4407-13146-0021	train-other-500	decorated with the military ensigns of thy master the first the foremost of created beings where I shall see thee faithful servant laying his sword and scabbard with a trembling hand across his coffin
4407-13146-0022	train-other-500	and then returning pale as ashes to the door to take his mourning horse by the bridle to follow his hearse as he directed thee where
none	none	 all my father s systems shall be baffled by his sorrows and in spite of his philosophy 
4407-13146-0023	train-other-500	I shall behold him as he inspects the lackered plate
none	none	 twice taking his spectacles from off his nose 
4407-13146-0024	train-other-500	to wipe away the dew which nature has shed upon them When I see him cast in the rosemary with an air of disconsolation which cries through my ears O Toby in what corner of the world shall I seek thy fellow
none	none	 Gracious powers which erst have opened the lips of the dumb in his distress and made the tongue of the stammerer speak plain 
4407-13146-0025	train-other-500	when I shall arrive at this dreaded page deal not with me then with a stinted hand
none	none	 Chapter three LXIX 
4407-13146-0026	train-other-500	The corporal who the night before had resolved in his mind to supply the grand desideratum of keeping up something like an incessant firing upon the enemy during the heat of the attack had no further idea in his fancy at that time
4407-13146-0027	train-other-500	than a contrivance of smoking tobacco against the town out of one of my uncle Toby s six field pieces which were planted on each side of his sentry box the means of effecting which occurring to his fancy at the same time though he had pledged his cap
4407-13146-0028	train-other-500	he thought it in no danger from the miscarriage of his projects Upon turning it this way and that a little in his mind he soon began to find out that by means of his two Turkish tobacco pipes
4407-13146-0029	train-other-500	with the supplement of three smaller tubes of wash leather at each of their lower ends to be tagg d by the same number of tin pipes fitted to the touch holes and sealed with clay next the cannon
4407-13146-0030	train-other-500	and then tied hermetically with waxed silk at their several insertions into the Morocco tube he should be able to fire the six field pieces all together and with the same ease as to fire one
none	none	 Let no man say from what taggs and jaggs hints may not be cut out for the advancement of human knowledge 
4407-13146-0031	train-other-500	Let no man who has read my father s first and second beds of justice ever rise up and say again from collision of what kinds of bodies light may or may not be struck out to carry the arts and sciences up to perfection Heaven thou knowest how I love them
4407-13146-0032	train-other-500	thou knowest the secrets of my heart and that I would this moment give my shirt Thou art a fool Shandy says Eugenius
none	none	 for thou hast but a dozen in the world 
4407-13146-0033	train-other-500	and twill break thy set No matter for that Eugenius
none	none	 I would give the shirt off my back to be burnt into tinder 
4407-13146-0034	train-other-500	were it only to satisfy one feverish enquirer how many sparks at one good stroke a good flint and steel could strike into the tail of it Think ye not that in striking these in he might per adventure strike something out as sure as a gun
4407-13146-0035	train-other-500	But this project by the bye The corporal sat up the best part of the night in bringing his to perfection and having made a sufficient proof of his cannon with charging them to the top with tobacco he went with contentment to bed
none	none	 Chapter three LXX The corporal had slipped out about ten minutes before my uncle Toby 
4407-13146-0036	train-other-500	in order to fix his apparatus and just give the enemy a shot or two before my uncle Toby came He had drawn the six field pieces for this end all close up together in front of my uncle Toby s sentry box
none	none	 leaving only an interval of about a yard and a half betwixt the three on the right and left for the convenience of charging c and the sake possibly of two batteries 
4407-13146-0037	train-other-500	which he might think double the honour of one In the rear and facing this opening with his back to the door of the sentry box for fear of being flanked had the corporal wisely taken his post He held the ivory pipe appertaining to the battery on the right
4407-13146-0038	train-other-500	betwixt the finger and thumb of his right hand and the ebony pipe tipp d with silver which appertained to the battery on the left betwixt the finger and thumb of the other and with his right knee fixed firm upon the ground as if in the front rank of his platoon was the corporal
4407-13146-0039	train-other-500	with his Montero cap upon his head furiously playing off his two cross batteries at the same time against the counter guard which faced the counterscarp
none	none	 where the attack was to be made that morning 
4407-13146-0040	train-other-500	His first intention as I said was no more than giving the enemy a single puff or two but the pleasure of the puffs as well as the puffing had insensibly got hold of the corporal and drawn him on from puff to puff into the very height of the attack by the time my uncle Toby joined him
none	none	 Twas well for my father that my uncle Toby had not his will to make that day Chapter three LXXI My uncle Toby took the ivory pipe out of the corporal s hand looked at it for half a minute and returned it In less than two minutes my uncle Toby took the pipe from the corporal again and raised it half way to his mouth then hastily gave it back a second time The corporal redoubled the attack my uncle Toby smiled then looked grave then smiled for a moment then looked serious for a long time Give me hold of the ivory pipe Trim said my uncle Toby my uncle Toby put it to his lips drew it back directly gave a peep over the horn beam hedge never did my uncle Toby s mouth water so much for a pipe in his life My uncle Toby retired into the sentry box with the pipe in his hand Dear uncle Toby don t go into the sentry box with the pipe there s no trusting a man s self with such a thing in such a corner Chapter three LXXII I beg the reader will assist me here to wheel off my uncle Toby s ordnance behind the scenes to remove his sentry box and clear the theatre if possible of horn works and half moons and get the rest of his military apparatus out of the way that done my dear friend Garrick we ll snuff the candles bright sweep the stage with a new broom draw up the curtain and exhibit my uncle Toby dressed in a new character throughout which the world can have no idea how he will act and yet if pity be a kin to love and bravery no alien to it you have seen enough of my uncle Toby in these to trace these family likenesses betwixt the two passions in case there is one to your heart s content Vain science thou assistest us in no case of this kind and thou puzzlest us in every one There was Madam in my uncle Toby a singleness of heart which misled him so far out of the little serpentine tracks in which things of this nature usually go on you can you can have no conception of it with this there was a plainness and simplicity of thinking with such an unmistrusting ignorance of the plies and foldings of the heart of woman and so naked and defenceless did he stand before you when a siege was out of his head that you might have stood behind any one of your serpentine walks and shot my uncle Toby ten times in a day through his liver if nine times in a day Madam had not served your purpose With all this Madam and what confounded every thing as much on the other hand my uncle Toby had that unparalleled modesty of nature I once told you of and which by the bye stood eternal sentry upon his feelings that you might as soon But where am I going these reflections crowd in upon me ten pages at least too soon and take up that time which I ought to bestow upon facts Chapter three LXXIII Of the few legitimate sons of Adam whose breasts never felt what the sting of love was maintaining first all mysogynists to be bastards the greatest heroes of ancient and modern story have carried off amongst them nine parts in ten of the honour and I wish for their sakes I had the key of my study out of my draw well only for five minutes to tell you their names recollect them I cannot so be content to accept of these for the present in their stead There was the great king Aldrovandus and Bosphorus and Cappadocius and Dardanus and Pontus and Asius to say nothing of the iron hearted Charles the XIIth whom the Countess of K herself could make nothing of There was Babylonicus and Mediterraneus and Polixenes and Persicus and Prusicus not one of whom except Cappadocius and Pontus who were both a little suspected ever once bowed down his breast to the goddess The truth is they had all of them something else to do and so had my uncle Toby till Fate till Fate I say envying his name the glory of being handed down to posterity with Aldrovandus s and the rest she basely patched up the peace of Utrecht Believe me Sirs twas the worst deed she did that year Chapter three LXXIV Amongst the many ill consequences of the treaty of Utrecht it was within a point of giving my uncle Toby a surfeit of sieges and though he recovered his appetite afterwards yet Calais itself left not a deeper scar in Mary s heart than Utrecht upon my uncle Toby s To the end of his life he never could hear Utrecht mentioned upon any account whatever or so much as read an article of news extracted out of the Utrecht Gazette without fetching a sigh as if his heart would break in twain My father who was a great Motive Monger and consequently a very dangerous person for a man to sit by either laughing or crying for he generally knew your motive for doing both much better than you knew it yourself would always console my uncle Toby upon these occasions in a way which shewed plainly he imagined my uncle Toby grieved for nothing in the whole affair so much as the loss of his hobby horse Never mind brother Toby he would say by God s blessing we shall have another war break out again some of these days and when it does the belligerent powers if they would hang themselves cannot keep us out of play I defy em my dear Toby he would add to take countries without taking towns or towns without sieges My uncle Toby never took this back stroke of my father s at his hobby horse kindly He thought the stroke ungenerous and the more so because in striking the horse he hit the rider too and in the most dishonourable part a blow could fall so that upon these occasions he always laid down his pipe upon the table with more fire to defend himself than common I told the reader this time two years that my uncle Toby was not eloquent and in the very same page gave an instance to the contrary I repeat the observation and a fact which contradicts it again He was not eloquent it was not easy to my uncle Toby to make long harangues and he hated florid ones but there were occasions where the stream overflowed the man and ran so counter to its usual course that in some parts my uncle Toby for a time was at least equal to Tertullus but in others in my own opinion infinitely above him My father was so highly pleased with one of these apologetical orations of my uncle Toby s which he had delivered one evening before him and Yorick that he wrote it down before he went to bed I have had the good fortune to meet with it amongst my father s papers with here and there an insertion of his own betwixt two crooks thus and is endorsed My Brother Toby s Justification of His Own Principles and Conduct in Wishing to Continue the War I may safely say I have read over this apologetical oration of my uncle Toby s a hundred times and think it so fine a model of defence and shews so sweet a temperament of gallantry and good principles in him that I give it the world word for word interlineations and all as I find it Chapter three LXXV My Uncle Toby s Apologetical Oration I am not insensible brother Shandy that when a man whose profession is arms wishes as I have done for war it has an ill aspect to the world and that how just and right soever his motives the intentions may be he stands in an uneasy posture in vindicating himself from private views in doing it For this cause if a soldier is a prudent man which he may be without being a jot the less brave he will be sure not to utter his wish in the hearing of an enemy for say what he will an enemy will not believe him He will be cautious of doing it even to a friend lest he may suffer in his esteem But if his heart is overcharged and a secret sigh for arms must have its vent he will reserve it for the ear of a brother who knows his character to the bottom and what his true notions dispositions and principles of honour are What I hope I have been in all these brother Shandy would be unbecoming in me to say much worse I know have I been than I ought and something worse perhaps than I think But such as I am you my dear brother Shandy who have sucked the same breasts with me and with whom I have been brought up from my cradle and from whose knowledge from the first hours of our boyish pastimes down to this I have concealed no one action of my life and scarce a thought in it Such as I am brother you must by this time know me with all my vices and with all my weaknesses too whether of my age my temper my passions or my understanding Tell me then my dear brother Shandy upon which of them it is that when I condemned the peace of Utrecht and grieved the war was not carried on with vigour a little longer you should think your brother did it upon unworthy views or that in wishing for war he should be bad enough to wish more of his fellow creatures slain more slaves made and more families driven from their peaceful habitations merely for his own pleasure Tell me brother Shandy upon what one deed of mine do you ground it The devil a deed do I know of dear Toby but one for a hundred pounds which I lent thee to carry on these cursed sieges If when I was a school boy I could not hear a drum beat but my heart beat with it was it my fault Did I plant the propensity there Did I sound the alarm within or Nature When Guy Earl of Warwick and Parismus and Parismenus and Valentine and Orson and the Seven Champions of England were handed around the school were they not all purchased with my own pocket money Was that selfish brother Shandy When we read over the siege of Troy which lasted ten years and eight months though with such a train of artillery as we had at Namur the town might have been carried in a week was I not as much concerned for the destruction of the Greeks and Trojans as any boy of the whole school Had I not three strokes of a ferula given me two on my right hand and one on my left for calling Helena a bitch for it Did any one of you shed more tears for Hector And when king Priam came to the camp to beg his body and returned weeping back to Troy without it you know brother I could not eat my dinner Did that bespeak me cruel Or because brother Shandy my blood flew out into the camp and my heart panted for war was it a proof it could not ache for the distresses of war too O brother tis one thing for a soldier to gather laurels and tis another to scatter cypress Who told thee my dear Toby that cypress was used by the antients on mournful occasions Tis one thing brother Shandy for a soldier to hazard his own life to leap first down into the trench where he is sure to be cut in pieces Tis one thing from public spirit and a thirst of glory to enter the breach the first man to stand in the foremost rank and march bravely on with drums and trumpets and colours flying about his ears Tis one thing I say brother Shandy to do this and tis another thing to reflect on the miseries of war to view the desolations of whole countries and consider the intolerable fatigues and hardships which the soldier himself the instrument who works them is forced for sixpence a day if he can get it to undergo Need I be told dear Yorick as I was by you in Le Fever s funeral sermon That so soft and gentle a creature born to love to mercy and kindness as man is was not shaped for this But why did you not add Yorick if not by Nature that he is so by Necessity For what is war what is it Yorick when fought as ours has been upon principles of liberty and upon principles of honour what is it but the getting together of quiet and harmless people with their swords in their hands to keep the ambitious and the turbulent within bounds And heaven is my witness brother Shandy that the pleasure I have taken in these things and that infinite delight in particular which has attended my sieges in my bowling green has arose within me and I hope in the corporal too from the consciousness we both had that in carrying them on we were answering the great ends of our creation Chapter three LXXVI I told the Christian reader I say Christian hoping he is one and if he is not I am sorry for it and only beg he will consider the matter with himself and not lay the blame entirely upon this book I told him Sir for in good truth when a man is telling a story in the strange way I do mine he is obliged continually to be going backwards and forwards to keep all tight together in the reader s fancy which for my own part if I did not take heed to do more than at first there is so much unfixed and equivocal matter starting up with so many breaks and gaps in it and so little service do the stars afford which nevertheless I hang up in some of the darkest passages knowing that the world is apt to lose its way with all the lights the sun itself at noon day can give it and now you see I am lost myself But tis my father s fault and whenever my brains come to be dissected you will perceive without spectacles that he has left a large uneven thread as you sometimes see in an unsaleable piece of cambrick running along the whole length of the web and so untowardly you cannot so much as cut out a here I hang up a couple of lights again or a fillet or a thumb stall but it is seen or felt Quanto id diligentias in liberis procreandis cavendum sayeth Cardan All which being considered and that you see tis morally impracticable for me to wind this round to where I set out I begin the chapter over again Chapter three LXXVII I told the Christian reader in the beginning of the chapter which preceded my uncle Toby s apologetical oration though in a different trope from what I should make use of now That the peace of Utrecht was within an ace of creating the same shyness betwixt my uncle Toby and his hobby horse as it did betwixt the queen and the rest of the confederating powers There is an indignant way in which a man sometimes dismounts his horse which as good as says to him I ll go afoot Sir all the days of my life before I would ride a single mile upon your back again Now my uncle Toby could not be said to dismount his horse in this manner for in strictness of language he could not be said to dismount his horse at all his horse rather flung him and somewhat viciously which made my uncle Toby take it ten times more unkindly Let this matter be settled by state jockies as they like It created I say a sort of shyness betwixt my uncle Toby and his hobby horse He had no occasion for him from the month of March to November which was the summer after the articles were signed except it was now and then to take a short ride out just to see that the fortifications and harbour of Dunkirk were demolished according to stipulation The French were so backwards all that summer in setting about that affair and Monsieur Tugghe the deputy from the magistrates of Dunkirk presented so many affecting petitions to the queen beseeching her majesty to cause only her thunderbolts to fall upon the martial works which might have incurred her displeasure but to spare to spare the mole for the mole s sake which in its naked situation could be no more than an object of pity and the queen who was but a woman being of a pitiful disposition and her ministers also they not wishing in their hearts to have the town dismantled for these private reasons so that the whole went heavily on with my uncle Toby insomuch that it was not within three full months after he and the corporal had constructed the town and put it in a condition to be destroyed that the several commandants commissaries deputies negociators and intendants would permit him to set about it Fatal interval of inactivity The corporal was for beginning the demolition by making a breach in the ramparts or main fortifications of the town No that will never do corporal said my uncle Toby for in going that way to work with the town the English garrison will not be safe in it an hour because if the French are treacherous They are as treacherous as devils an please your honour said the corporal It gives me concern always when I hear it Trim said my uncle Toby for they don t want personal bravery and if a breach is made in the ramparts they may enter it and make themselves masters of the place when they please Let them enter it said the corporal lifting up his pioneer s spade in both his hands as if he was going to lay about him with it let them enter an please your honour if they dare In cases like this corporal said my uncle Toby slipping his right hand down to the middle of his cane and holding it afterwards truncheon wise with his fore finger extended tis no part of the consideration of a commandant what the enemy dare or what they dare not do he must act with prudence We will begin with the outworks both towards the sea and the land and particularly with fort Louis the most distant of them all and demolish it first and the rest one by one both on our right and left as we retreat towards the town then we ll demolish the mole next fill up the harbour then retire into the citadel and blow it up into the air and having done that corporal we ll embark for England We are there quoth the corporal recollecting himself Very true said my uncle Toby looking at the church Chapter three LXXVIII A delusive delicious consultation or two of this kind betwixt my uncle Toby and Trim upon the demolition of Dunkirk for a moment rallied back the ideas of those pleasures which were slipping from under him still still all went on heavily the magic left the mind the weaker Stillness with Silence at her back entered the solitary parlour and drew their gauzy mantle over my uncle Toby s head and Listlessness with her lax fibre and undirected eye sat quietly down beside him in his arm chair No longer Amberg and Rhinberg and Limbourg and Huy and Bonn in one year and the prospect of Landen and Trerebach and Drusen and Dendermond the next hurried on the blood No longer did saps and mines and blinds and gabions and palisadoes keep out this fair enemy of man s repose No more could my uncle Toby after passing the French lines as he eat his egg at supper from thence break into the heart of France cross over the Oyes and with all Picardie open behind him march up to the gates of Paris and fall asleep with nothing but ideas of glory No more was he to dream he had fixed the royal standard upon the tower of the Bastile and awake with it streaming in his head Softer visions gentler vibrations stole sweetly in upon his slumbers the trumpet of war fell out of his hands he took up the lute sweet instrument of all others the most delicate the most difficult how wilt thou touch it my dear uncle Toby Chapter three LXXIX Now because I have once or twice said in my inconsiderate way of talking That I was confident the following memoirs of my uncle Toby s courtship of widow Wadman whenever I got time to write them would turn out one of the most complete systems both of the elementary and practical part of love and love making that ever was addressed to the world are you to imagine from thence that I shall set out with a description of what love is whether part God and part Devil as Plotinus will have it Or by a more critical equation and supposing the whole of love to be as ten to determine with Ficinus How many parts of it the one and how many the other or whether it is all of it one great Devil from head to tail as Plato has taken upon him to pronounce concerning which conceit of his I shall not offer my opinion but my opinion of Plato is this that he appears from this instance to have been a man of much the same temper and way of reasoning with doctor Baynyard who being a great enemy to blisters as imagining that half a dozen of em at once would draw a man as surely to his grave as a herse and six rashly concluded that the Devil himself was nothing in the world but one great bouncing Cantharidis I have nothing to say to people who allow themselves this monstrous liberty in arguing but what Nazianzen cried out that is polemically to Philagrius Greek O rare tis fine reasoning Sir indeed Greek and most nobly do you aim at truth when you philosophize about it in your moods and passions Nor is it to be imagined for the same reason I should stop to inquire whether love is a disease or embroil myself with Rhasis and Dioscorides whether the seat of it is in the brain or liver because this would lead me on to an examination of the two very opposite manners in which patients have been treated the one of Aoetius who always begun with a cooling clyster of hempseed and bruised cucumbers and followed on with thin potations of water lilies and purslane to which he added a pinch of snuff of the herb Hanea and where Aoetius durst venture it his topaz ring The other that of Gordonius who in his cap fifteen de Amore directs they should be thrashed ad putorem usque till they stink again These are disquisitions which my father who had laid in a great stock of knowledge of this kind will be very busy with in the progress of my uncle Toby s affairs I must anticipate thus much That from his theories of love with which by the way he contrived to crucify my uncle Toby s mind almost as much as his amours themselves he took a single step into practice and by means of a camphorated cerecloth which he found means to impose upon the taylor for buckram whilst he was making my uncle Toby a new pair of breeches he produced Gordonius s effect upon my uncle Toby without the disgrace What changes this produced will be read in its proper place all that is needful to be added to the anecdote is this That whatever effect it had upon my uncle Toby it had a vile effect upon the house and if my uncle Toby had not smoaked it down as he did it might have had a vile effect upon my father too Chapter three LXXX Twill come out of itself by and bye All I contend for is that I am not obliged to set out with a definition of what love is and so long as I can go on with my story intelligibly with the help of the word itself without any other idea to it than what I have in common with the rest of the world why should I differ from it a moment before the time When I can get on no further and find myself entangled on all sides of this mystic labyrinth my Opinion will then come in in course and lead me out At present I hope I shall be sufficiently understood in telling the reader my uncle Toby fell in love Not that the phrase is at all to my liking for to say a man is fallen in love or that he is deeply in love or up to the ears in love and sometimes even over head and ears in it carries an idiomatical kind of implication that love is a thing below a man this is recurring again to Plato s opinion which with all his divinityship I hold to be damnable and heretical and so much for that Let love therefore be what it will my uncle Toby fell into it And possibly gentle reader with such a temptation so wouldst thou For never did thy eyes behold or thy concupiscence covet any thing in this world more concupiscible than widow Wadman Chapter three LXXXI To conceive this right call for pen and ink here s paper ready to your hand Sit down Sir paint her to your own mind as like your mistress as you can as unlike your wife as your conscience will let you tis all one to me please but your own fancy in it blank page Was ever any thing in Nature so sweet so exquisite Then dear Sir how could my uncle Toby resist it Thrice happy book thou wilt have one page at least within thy covers which Malice will not blacken and which Ignorance cannot misrepresent Chapter three LXXXII As Susannah was informed by an express from missus Bridget of my uncle Toby s falling in love with her mistress fifteen days before it happened the contents of which express Susannah communicated to my mother the next day it has just given me an opportunity of entering upon my uncle Toby s amours a fortnight before their existence I have an article of news to tell you mister Shandy quoth my mother which will surprise you greatly Now my father was then holding one of his second beds of justice and was musing within himself about the hardships of matrimony as my mother broke silence My brother Toby quoth she is going to be married to missus Wadman Then he will never quoth my father be able to lie diagonally in his bed again as long as he lives It was a consuming vexation to my father that my mother never asked the meaning of a thing she did not understand That she is not a woman of science my father would say is her misfortune but she might ask a question My mother never did In short she went out of the world at last without knowing whether it turned round or stood still My father had officiously told her above a thousand times which way it was but she always forgot For these reasons a discourse seldom went on much further betwixt them than a proposition a reply and a rejoinder at the end of which it generally took breath for a few minutes as in the affair of the breeches and then went on again If he marries twill be the worse for us quoth my mother Not a cherry stone said my father he may as well batter away his means upon that as any thing else To be sure said my mother so here ended the proposition the reply and the rejoinder I told you of It will be some amusement to him too said my father A very great one answered my mother if he should have children Lord have mercy upon me said my father to himself Chapter three LXXXIII I am now beginning to get fairly into my work and by the help of a vegetable diet with a few of the cold seeds I make no doubt but I shall be able to go on with my uncle Toby s story and my own in a tolerable straight line Now four very squiggly lines across the page signed Inv T S and Scw T S These were the four lines I moved in through my first second third and fourth volumes Alluding to the first edition In the fifth volume I have been very good the precise line I have described in it being this one very squiggly line across the page with loops marked A B C C C C C D By which it appears that except at the curve marked A where I took a trip to Navarre and the indented curve B which is the short airing when I was there with the Lady Baussiere and her page I have not taken the least frisk of a digression till John de la Casse s devils led me the round you see marked D for as for C C C C C they are nothing but parentheses and the common ins and outs incident to the lives of the greatest ministers of state and when compared with what men have done or with my own transgressions at the letters ABD they vanish into nothing In this last volume I have done better still for from the end of Le Fever s episode to the beginning of my uncle Toby s campaigns I have scarce stepped a yard out of my way If I mend at this rate it is not impossible by the good leave of his grace of Benevento s devils but I may arrive hereafter at the excellency of going on even thus straight line across the page which is a line drawn as straight as I could draw it by a writing master s ruler borrowed for that purpose turning neither to the right hand or to the left This right line the path way for Christians to walk in say divines The emblem of moral rectitude says Cicero The best line say cabbage planters is the shortest line says Archimedes which can be drawn from one given point to another I wish your ladyships would lay this matter to heart in your next birth day suits What a journey Pray can you tell me that is without anger before I write my chapter upon straight lines by what mistake who told them so or how it has come to pass that your men of wit and genius have all along confounded this line with the line of Gravitation Chapter three LXXXIV No I think I said I would write two volumes every year provided the vile cough which then tormented me and which to this hour I dread worse than the devil would but give me leave and in another place but where I can t recollect now speaking of my book as a machine and laying my pen and ruler down cross wise upon the table in order to gain the greater credit to it I swore it should be kept a going at that rate these forty years if it pleased but the fountain of life to bless me so long with health and good spirits Now as for my spirits little have I to lay to their charge nay so very little unless the mounting me upon a long stick and playing the fool with me nineteen hours out of the twenty four be accusations that on the contrary I have much much to thank em for cheerily have ye made me tread the path of life with all the burthens of it except its cares upon my back in no one moment of my existence that I remember have ye once deserted me or tinged the objects which came in my way either with sable or with a sickly green in dangers ye gilded my horizon with hope and when Death himself knocked at my door ye bad him come again and in so gay a tone of careless indifference did ye do it that he doubted of his commission There must certainly be some mistake in this matter quoth he Now there is nothing in this world I abominate worse than to be interrupted in a story and I was that moment telling Eugenius a most tawdry one in my way of a nun who fancied herself a shell fish and of a monk damn d for eating a muscle and was shewing him the grounds and justice of the procedure Did ever so grave a personage get into so vile a scrape quoth Death Thou hast had a narrow escape Tristram said Eugenius taking hold of my hand as I finished my story But there is no living Eugenius replied I at this rate for as this son of a whore has found out my lodgings You call him rightly said Eugenius for by sin we are told he enter d the world I care not which way he enter d quoth I provided he be not in such a hurry to take me out with him for I have forty volumes to write and forty thousand things to say and do which no body in the world will say and do for me except thyself and as thou seest he has got me by the throat for Eugenius could scarce hear me speak across the table and that I am no match for him in the open field had I not better whilst these few scatter d spirits remain and these two spider legs of mine holding one of them up to him are able to support me had I not better Eugenius fly for my life Tis my advice my dear Tristram said Eugenius Then by heaven I will lead him a dance he little thinks of for I will gallop quoth I without looking once behind me to the banks of the Garonne and if I hear him clattering at my heels I ll scamper away to mount Vesuvius from thence to Joppa and from Joppa to the world s end where if he follows me I pray God he may break his neck He runs more risk there said Eugenius than thou Eugenius s wit and affection brought blood into the cheek from whence it had been some months banish d twas a vile moment to bid adieu in he led me to my chaise Allons said I the post boy gave a crack with his whip off I went like a cannon and in half a dozen bounds got into Dover Chapter three LXXXV Now hang it quoth I as I look d towards the French coast a man should know something of his own country too before he goes abroad and I never gave a peep into Rochester church or took notice of the dock of Chatham or visited saint Thomas at Canterbury though they all three laid in my way But mine indeed is a particular case So without arguing the matter further with Thomas o Becket or any one else I skip d into the boat and in five minutes we got under sail and scudded away like the wind Pray captain quoth I as I was going down into the cabin is a man never overtaken by Death in this passage Why there is not time for a man to be sick in it replied he What a cursed lyar for I am sick as a horse quoth I already what a brain upside down hey day the cells are broke loose one into another and the blood and the lymph and the nervous juices with the fix d and volatile salts are all jumbled into one mass good G every thing turns round in it like a thousand whirlpools I d give a shilling to know if I shan t write the clearer for it Sick sick sick sick When shall we get to land captain they have hearts like stones O I am deadly sick reach me that thing boy tis the most discomfiting sickness I wish I was at the bottom Madam how is it with you Undone undone un O undone sir What the first time No tis the second third sixth tenth time sir hey day what a trampling over head hollo cabin boy what s the matter The wind chopp d about s Death then I shall meet him full in the face What luck tis chopp d about again master O the devil chop it Captain quoth she for heaven s sake let us get ashore Chapter three LXXXVI It is a great inconvenience to a man in a haste that there are three distinct roads between Calais and Paris in behalf of which there is so much to be said by the several deputies from the towns which lie along them that half a day is easily lost in settling which you ll take First the road by Lisle and Arras which is the most about but most interesting and instructing The second that by Amiens which you may go if you would see Chantilly And that by Beauvais which you may go if you will For this reason a great many chuse to go by Beauvais Chapter three LXXXVII Now before I quit Calais a travel writer would say it would not be amiss to give some account of it Now I think it very much amiss that a man cannot go quietly through a town and let it alone when it does not meddle with him but that he must be turning about and drawing his pen at every kennel he crosses over merely o my conscience for the sake of drawing it because if we may judge from what has been wrote of these things by all who have wrote and gallop d or who have gallop d and wrote which is a different way still or who for more expedition than the rest have wrote galloping which is the way I do at present from the great Addison who did it with his satchel of school books hanging at his a and galling his beast s crupper at every stroke there is not a gallopper of us all who might not have gone on ambling quietly in his own ground in case he had any and have wrote all he had to write dry shod as well as not For my own part as heaven is my judge and to which I shall ever make my last appeal I know no more of Calais except the little my barber told me of it as he was whetting his razor than I do this moment of Grand Cairo for it was dusky in the evening when I landed and dark as pitch in the morning when I set out and yet by merely knowing what is what and by drawing this from that in one part of the town and by spelling and putting this and that together in another I would lay any travelling odds that I this moment write a chapter upon Calais as long as my arm and with so distinct and satisfactory a detail of every item which is worth a stranger s curiosity in the town that you would take me for the town clerk of Calais itself and where sir would be the wonder was not Democritus who laughed ten times more than I town clerk of Abdera and was not I forget his name who had more discretion than us both town clerk of Ephesus it should be penn d moreover sir with so much knowledge and good sense and truth and precision Nay if you don t believe me you may read the chapter for your pains Chapter three LXXXVIII Calais Calatium Calusium Calesium This town if we may trust its archives the authority of which I see no reason to call in question in this place was once no more than a small village belonging to one of the first Counts de Guignes and as it boasts at present of no less than fourteen thousand inhabitants exclusive of four hundred and twenty distinct families in the basse ville or suburbs it must have grown up by little and little I suppose to its present size Though there are four convents there is but one parochial church in the whole town I had not an opportunity of taking its exact dimensions but it is pretty easy to make a tolerable conjecture of em for as there are fourteen thousand inhabitants in the town if the church holds them all it must be considerably large and if it will not tis a very great pity they have not another it is built in form of a cross and dedicated to the Virgin Mary the steeple which has a spire to it is placed in the middle of the church and stands upon four pillars elegant and light enough but sufficiently strong at the same time it is decorated with eleven altars most of which are rather fine than beautiful The great altar is a master piece in its kind tis of white marble and as I was told near sixty feet high had it been much higher it had been as high as mount Calvary itself therefore I suppose it must be high enough in all conscience There was nothing struck me more than the great Square tho I cannot say tis either well paved or well built but tis in the heart of the town and most of the streets especially those in that quarter all terminate in it could there have been a fountain in all Calais which it seems there cannot as such an object would have been a great ornament it is not to be doubted but that the inhabitants would have had it in the very centre of this square not that it is properly a square because tis forty feet longer from east to west than from north to south so that the French in general have more reason on their side in calling them Places than Squares which strictly speaking to be sure they are not The town house seems to be but a sorry building and not to be kept in the best repair otherwise it had been a second great ornament to this place it answers however its destination and serves very well for the reception of the magistrates who assemble in it from time to time so that tis presumable justice is regularly distributed I have heard much of it but there is nothing at all curious in the Courgain tis a distinct quarter of the town inhabited solely by sailors and fishermen it consists of a number of small streets neatly built and mostly of brick tis extremely populous but as that may be accounted for from the principles of their diet there is nothing curious in that neither A traveller may see it to satisfy himself he must not omit however taking notice of La Tour de Guet upon any account tis so called from its particular destination because in war it serves to discover and give notice of the enemies which approach the place either by sea or land but tis monstrous high and catches the eye so continually you cannot avoid taking notice of it if you would It was a singular disappointment to me that I could not have permission to take an exact survey of the fortifications which are the strongest in the world and which from first to last that is for the time they were set about by Philip of France Count of Bologne to the present war wherein many reparations were made have cost as I learned afterwards from an engineer in Gascony above a hundred millions of livres It is very remarkable that at the Tete de Gravelenes and where the town is naturally the weakest they have expended the most money so that the outworks stretch a great way into the campaign and consequently occupy a large tract of ground However after all that is said and done it must be acknowledged that Calais was never upon any account so considerable from itself as from its situation and that easy entrance which it gave our ancestors upon all occasions into France it was not without its inconveniences also being no less troublesome to the English in those times than Dunkirk has been to us in ours so that it was deservedly looked upon as the key to both kingdoms which no doubt is the reason that there have arisen so many contentions who should keep it of these the siege of Calais or rather the blockade for it was shut up both by land and sea was the most memorable as it with stood the efforts of Edward the Third a whole year and was not terminated at last but by famine and extreme misery the gallantry of Eustace de saint Pierre who first offered himself a victim for his fellow citizens has rank d his name with heroes As it will not take up above fifty pages it would be injustice to the reader not to give him a minute account of that romantic transaction as well as of the siege itself in Rapin s own words Chapter three LXXXIX But courage gentle reader I scorn it tis enough to have thee in my power but to make use of the advantage which the fortune of the pen has now gained over thee would be too much No by that all powerful fire which warms the visionary brain and lights the spirits through unworldly tracts ere I would force a helpless creature upon this hard service and make thee pay poor soul for fifty pages which I have no right to sell thee naked as I am I would browse upon the mountains and smile that the north wind brought me neither my tent or my supper So put on my brave boy and make the best of thy way to Boulogne Chapter three XC Boulogne hah so we are all got together debtors and sinners before heaven a jolly set of us but I can t stay and quaff it off with you I m pursued myself like a hundred devils and shall be overtaken before I can well change horses for heaven s sake make haste Tis for high treason quoth a very little man whispering as low as he could to a very tall man that stood next him Or else for murder quoth the tall man Well thrown Size ace quoth I No quoth a third the gentleman has been committing Ah ma chere fille said I as she tripp d by from her matins you look as rosy as the morning for the sun was rising and it made the compliment the more gracious No it can t be that quoth a fourth she made a curt sy to me I kiss d my hand tis debt continued he Tis certainly for debt quoth a fifth I would not pay that gentleman s debts quoth Ace for a thousand pounds nor would I quoth Size for six times the sum Well thrown Size ace again quoth I but I have no debt but the debt of Nature and I want but patience of her and I will pay her every farthing I owe her How can you be so hard hearted Madam to arrest a poor traveller going along without molestation to any one upon his lawful occasions do stop that death looking long striding scoundrel of a scare sinner who is posting after me he never would have followed me but for you if it be but for a stage or two just to give me start of him I beseech you madam do dear lady Now in troth tis a great pity quoth mine Irish host that all this good courtship should be lost for the young gentlewoman has been after going out of hearing of it all along Simpleton quoth I So you have nothing else in Boulogne worth seeing By Jasus there is the finest Seminary for the Humanities There cannot be a finer quoth I Chapter three XCI When the precipitancy of a man s wishes hurries on his ideas ninety times faster than the vehicle he rides in woe be to truth and woe be to the vehicle and its tackling let em be made of what stuff you will upon which he breathes forth the disappointment of his soul As I never give general characters either of men or things in choler the most haste the worse speed was all the reflection I made upon the affair the first time it happen d the second third fourth and fifth time I confined it respectively to those times and accordingly blamed only the second third fourth and fifth post boy for it without carrying my reflections further but the event continuing to befal me from the fifth to the sixth seventh eighth ninth and tenth time and without one exception I then could not avoid making a national reflection of it which I do in these words That something is always wrong in a French post chaise upon first setting out Or the proposition may stand thus A French postilion has always to alight before he has got three hundred yards out of town What s wrong now Diable a rope s broke a knot has slipt a staple s drawn a bolt s to whittle a tag a rag a jag a strap a buckle or a buckle s tongue want altering Now true as all this is I never think myself impowered to excommunicate thereupon either the post chaise or its driver nor do I take it into my head to swear by the living G I would rather go a foot ten thousand times or that I will be damn d if ever I get into another but I take the matter coolly before me and consider that some tag or rag or jag or bolt or buckle or buckle s tongue will ever be a wanting or want altering travel where I will so I never chaff but take the good and the bad as they fall in my road and get on Do so my lad said I he had lost five minutes already in alighting in order to get at a luncheon of black bread which he had cramm d into the chaise pocket and was remounted and going leisurely on to relish it the better Get on my lad said I briskly but in the most persuasive tone imaginable for I jingled a four and twenty sous piece against the glass taking care to hold the flat side towards him as he look d back the dog grinn d intelligence from his right ear to his left and behind his sooty muzzle discovered such a pearly row of teeth that Sovereignty would have pawn d her jewels for them Just heaven What masticators What bread and so as he finished the last mouthful of it we entered the town of Montreuil Chapter three XCII There is not a town in all France which in my opinion looks better in the map than Montreuil I own it does not look so well in the book of post roads but when you come to see it to be sure it looks most pitifully There is one thing however in it at present very handsome and that is the inn keeper s daughter She has been eighteen months at Amiens and six at Paris in going through her classes so knits and sews and dances and does the little coquetries very well A slut in running them over within these five minutes that I have stood looking at her she has let fall at least a dozen loops in a white thread stocking yes yes I see you cunning gipsy tis long and taper you need not pin it to your knee and that tis your own and fits you exactly That Nature should have told this creature a word about a statue s thumb But as this sample is worth all their thumbs besides I have her thumbs and fingers in at the bargain if they can be any guide to me and as Janatone withal for that is her name stands so well for a drawing may I never draw more or rather may I draw like a draught horse by main strength all the days of my life if I do not draw her in all her proportions and with as determined a pencil as if I had her in the wettest drapery But your worships chuse rather that I give you the length breadth and perpendicular height of the great parish church or drawing of the facade of the abbey of Saint Austreberte which has been transported from Artois hither every thing is just I suppose as the masons and carpenters left them and if the belief in Christ continues so long will be so these fifty years to come so your worships and reverences may all measure them at your leisures but he who measures thee Janatone must do it now thou carriest the principles of change within thy frame and considering the chances of a transitory life I would not answer for thee a moment ere twice twelve months are passed and gone thou mayest grow out like a pumpkin and lose thy shapes or thou mayest go off like a flower and lose thy beauty nay thou mayest go off like a hussy and lose thyself I would not answer for my aunt Dinah was she alive faith scarce for her picture were it but painted by Reynolds But if I go on with my drawing after naming that son of Apollo I ll be shot So you must e en be content with the original which if the evening is fine in passing thro Montreuil you will see at your chaise door as you change horses but unless you have as bad a reason for haste as I have you had better stop She has a little of the devote but that sir is a terce to a nine in your favour L help me I could not count a single point so had been piqued and repiqued and capotted to the devil Chapter three XCIII All which being considered and that Death moreover might be much nearer me than I imagined I wish I was at Abbeville quoth I were it only to see how they card and spin so off we set Vid Book of French post roads page thirty six edition of seventeen sixty two de Montreuil a Nampont poste et demi de Nampont a Bernay poste de Bernay a Nouvion poste de Nouvion a Abbeville poste but the carders and spinners were all gone to bed Chapter three XCIV What a vast advantage is travelling only it heats one but there is a remedy for that which you may pick out of the next chapter Chapter three XCV Was I in a condition to stipulate with Death as I am this moment with my apothecary how and where I will take his clyster I should certainly declare against submitting to it before my friends and therefore I never seriously think upon the mode and manner of this great catastrophe which generally takes up and torments my thoughts as much as the catastrophe itself but I constantly draw the curtain across it with this wish that the Disposer of all things may so order it that it happen not to me in my own house but rather in some decent inn at home I know it the concern of my friends and the last services of wiping my brows and smoothing my pillow which the quivering hand of pale affection shall pay me will so crucify my soul that I shall die of a distemper which my physician is not aware of but in an inn the few cold offices I wanted would be purchased with a few guineas and paid me with an undisturbed but punctual attention but mark This inn should not be the inn at Abbeville if there was not another inn in the universe I would strike that inn out of the capitulation so Let the horses be in the chaise exactly by four in the morning Yes by four Sir or by Genevieve I ll raise a clatter in the house shall wake the dead Chapter three XCVI Make them like unto a wheel is a bitter sarcasm as all the learned know against the grand tour and that restless spirit for making it which David prophetically foresaw would haunt the children of men in the latter days and therefore as thinketh the great bishop Hall tis one of the severest imprecations which David ever utter d against the enemies of the Lord and as if he had said I wish them no worse luck than always to be rolling about So much motion continues he for he was very corpulent is so much unquietness and so much of rest by the same analogy is so much of heaven Now I being very thin think differently and that so much of motion is so much of life and so much of joy and that to stand still or get on but slowly is death and the devil Hollo Ho the whole world s asleep bring out the horses grease the wheels tie on the mail and drive a nail into that moulding I ll not lose a moment Now the wheel we are talking of and whereinto but not whereonto for that would make an Ixion s wheel of it he curseth his enemies according to the bishop s habit of body should certainly be a post chaise wheel whether they were set up in Palestine at that time or not and my wheel for the contrary reasons must as certainly be a cart wheel groaning round its revolution once in an age and of which sort were I to turn commentator I should make no scruple to affirm they had great store in that hilly country I love the Pythagoreans much more than ever I dare tell my dear Jenny for their Greek their getting out of the body in order to think well No man thinks right whilst he is in it blinded as he must be with his congenial humours and drawn differently aside as the bishop and myself have been with too lax or too tense a fibre Reason is half of it Sense and the measure of heaven itself is but the measure of our present appetites and concoctions But which of the two in the present case do you think to be mostly in the wrong You certainly quoth she to disturb a whole family so early Chapter three XCVII But she did not know I was under a vow not to shave my beard till I got to Paris yet I hate to make mysteries of nothing tis the cold cautiousness of one of those little souls from which Lessius lib thirteen de moribus divinis cap twenty four hath made his estimate wherein he setteth forth That one Dutch mile cubically multiplied will allow room enough and to spare for eight hundred thousand millions which he supposes to be as great a number of souls counting from the fall of Adam as can possibly be damn d to the end of the world From what he has made this second estimate unless from the parental goodness of God I don t know I am much more at a loss what could be in Franciscus Ribbera s head who pretends that no less a space than one of two hundred Italian miles multiplied into itself will be sufficient to hold the like number he certainly must have gone upon some of the old Roman souls of which he had read without reflecting how much by a gradual and most tabid decline in the course of eighteen hundred years they must unavoidably have shrunk so as to have come when he wrote almost to nothing In Lessius s time who seems the cooler man they were as little as can be imagined We find them less now And next winter we shall find them less again so that if we go on from little to less and from less to nothing I hesitate not one moment to affirm that in half a century at this rate we shall have no souls at all which being the period beyond which I doubt likewise of the existence of the Christian faith twill be one advantage that both of em will be exactly worn out together Blessed Jupiter and blessed every other heathen god and goddess for now ye will all come into play again and with Priapus at your tails what jovial times but where am I and into what a delicious riot of things am I rushing I I who must be cut short in the midst of my days and taste no more of em than what I borrow from my imagination peace to thee generous fool and let me go on Chapter three XCVIII So hating I say to make mysteries of nothing I intrusted it with the post boy as soon as ever I got off the stones he gave a crack with his whip to balance the compliment and with the thill horse trotting and a sort of an up and a down of the other we danced it along to Ailly au clochers famed in days of yore for the finest chimes in the world but we danced through it without music the chimes being greatly out of order as in truth they were through all France And so making all possible speed from Ailly au clochers I got to Hixcourt from Hixcourt I got to Pequignay and from Pequignay I got to Amiens concerning which town I have nothing to inform you but what I have informed you once before and that was that Janatone went there to school Chapter three XCIX In the whole catalogue of those whiffling vexations which come puffing across a man s canvass there is not one of a more teasing and tormenting nature than this particular one which I am going to describe and for which unless you travel with an avance courier which numbers do in order to prevent it there is no help and it is this That be you in never so kindly a propensity to sleep though you are passing perhaps through the finest country upon the best roads and in the easiest carriage for doing it in the world nay was you sure you could sleep fifty miles straight forwards without once opening your eyes nay what is more was you as demonstratively satisfied as you can be of any truth in Euclid that you should upon all accounts be full as well asleep as awake nay perhaps better Yet the incessant returns of paying for the horses at every stage with the necessity thereupon of putting your hand into your pocket and counting out from thence three livres fifteen sous sous by sous puts an end to so much of the project that you cannot execute above six miles of it or supposing it is a post and a half that is but nine were it to save your soul from destruction I ll be even with em quoth I for I ll put the precise sum into a piece of paper and hold it ready in my hand all the way Now I shall have nothing to do said I composing myself to rest but to drop this gently into the post boy s hat and not say a word Then there wants two sous more to drink or there is a twelve sous piece of Louis XIV which will not pass or a livre and some odd liards to be brought over from the last stage which Monsieur had forgot which altercations as a man cannot dispute very well asleep rouse him still is sweet sleep retrievable and still might the flesh weigh down the spirit and recover itself of these blows but then by heaven you have paid but for a single post whereas tis a post and a half and this obliges you to pull out your book of post roads the print of which is so very small it forces you to open your eyes whether you will or no Then Monsieur le Cure offers you a pinch of snuff or a poor soldier shews you his leg or a shaveling his box or the priestesse of the cistern will water your wheels they do not want it but she swears by her priesthood throwing it back that they do then you have all these points to argue or consider over in your mind in doing of which the rational powers get so thoroughly awakened you may get em to sleep again as you can It was entirely owing to one of these misfortunes or I had pass d clean by the stables of Chantilly But the postillion first affirming and then persisting in it to my face that there was no mark upon the two sous piece I open d my eyes to be convinced and seeing the mark upon it as plain as my nose I leap d out of the chaise in a passion and so saw every thing at Chantilly in spite I tried it but for three posts and a half but believe tis the best principle in the world to travel speedily upon for as few objects look very inviting in that mood you have little or nothing to stop you by which means it was that I passed through saint Dennis without turning my head so much as on one side towards the Abby Richness of their treasury stuff and nonsense bating their jewels which are all false I would not give three sous for any one thing in it but Jaidas s lantern nor for that either only as it grows dark it might be of use Chapter three C Crack crack crack crack crack crack so this is Paris quoth I continuing in the same mood and this is Paris humph Paris cried I repeating the name the third time The first the finest the most brilliant The streets however are nasty But it looks I suppose better than it smells crack crack crack crack what a fuss thou makest as if it concerned the good people to be informed that a man with pale face and clad in black had the honour to be driven into Paris at nine o clock at night by a postillion in a tawny yellow jerkin turned up with red calamanco crack crack crack crack crack crack I wish thy whip But tis the spirit of thy nation so crack crack on Ha and no one gives the wall but in the School of Urbanity herself if the walls are besh t how can you do otherwise And prithee when do they light the lamps What never in the summer months Ho tis the time of sallads O rare sallad and soup soup and sallad sallad and soup encore Tis too much for sinners Now I cannot bear the barbarity of it how can that unconscionable coachman talk so much bawdy to that lean horse don t you see friend the streets are so villanously narrow that there is not room in all Paris to turn a wheelbarrow In the grandest city of the whole world it would not have been amiss if they had been left a thought wider nay were it only so much in every single street as that a man might know was it only for satisfaction on which side of it he was walking One two three four five six seven eight nine ten Ten cooks shops and twice the number of barbers and all within three minutes driving one would think that all the cooks in the world on some great merry meeting with the barbers by joint consent had said Come let us all go live at Paris the French love good eating they are all gourmands we shall rank high if their god is their belly their cooks must be gentlemen and forasmuch as the periwig maketh the man and the periwig maker maketh the periwig ergo would the barbers say we shall rank higher still we shall be above you all we shall be Capitouls Chief Magistrate in Toulouse c c c at least pardi we shall all wear swords And so one would swear that is by candle light but there is no depending upon it they continued to do to this day Chapter three CI The French are certainly misunderstood but whether the fault is theirs in not sufficiently explaining themselves or speaking with that exact limitation and precision which one would expect on a point of such importance and which moreover is so likely to be contested by us or whether the fault may not be altogether on our side in not understanding their language always so critically as to know what they would be at I shall not decide but tis evident to me when they affirm That they who have seen Paris have seen every thing they must mean to speak of those who have seen it by day light As for candle light I give it up I have said before there was no depending upon it and I repeat it again but not because the lights and shades are too sharp or the tints confounded or that there is neither beauty or keeping c for that s not truth but it is an uncertain light in this respect That in all the five hundred grand Hotels which they number up to you in Paris and the five hundred good things at a modest computation for tis only allowing one good thing to a Hotel which by candle light are best to be seen felt heard and understood which by the bye is a quotation from Lilly the devil a one of us out of fifty can get our heads fairly thrust in amongst them This is no part of the French computation tis simply this That by the last survey taken in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixteen since which time there have been considerable augmentations Paris doth contain nine hundred streets viz In the quarter called the City there are fifty three streets In saint James of the Shambles fifty five streets In saint Oportune thirty four streets In the quarter of the Louvre twenty five streets In the Palace Royal or saint Honorius forty nine streets In Mont Martyr forty one streets In saint Eustace twenty nine streets In the Halles twenty seven streets In saint Dennis fifty five streets In saint Martin fifty four streets In saint Paul or the Mortellerie twenty seven streets The Greve thirty eight streets In saint Avoy or the Verrerie nineteen streets In the Marais or the Temple fifty two streets In saint Antony s sixty eight streets In the Place Maubert eighty one streets In saint Bennet sixty streets In saint Andrews de Arcs fifty one streets In the quarter of the Luxembourg sixty two streets And in that of saint Germain fifty five streets into any of which you may walk and that when you have seen them with all that belongs to them fairly by day light their gates their bridges their squares their statues and have crusaded it moreover through all their parish churches by no means omitting saint Roche and Sulpice and to crown all have taken a walk to the four palaces which you may see either with or without the statues and pictures just as you chuse Then you will have seen but tis what no one needeth to tell you for you will read of it yourself upon the portico of the Louvre in these words Earth No Such Folks No Folks E er Such A Town As Paris Is Sing Derry Derry Down Non orbis gentem non urbem gens habet ullam ulla parem The French have a gay way of treating every thing that is Great and that is all can be said upon it Chapter three CII In mentioning the word gay as in the close of the last chapter it puts one i e an author in mind of the word spleen especially if he has any thing to say upon it not that by any analysis or that from any table of interest or genealogy there appears much more ground of alliance betwixt them than betwixt light and darkness or any two of the most unfriendly opposites in nature only tis an undercraft of authors to keep up a good understanding amongst words as politicians do amongst men not knowing how near they may be under a necessity of placing them to each other which point being now gain d and that I may place mine exactly to my mind I write it down here Spleen This upon leaving Chantilly I declared to be the best principle in the world to travel speedily upon but I gave it only as matter of opinion I still continue in the same sentiments only I had not then experience enough of its working to add this that though you do get on at a tearing rate yet you get on but uneasily to yourself at the same time for which reason I here quit it entirely and for ever and tis heartily at any one s service it has spoiled me the digestion of a good supper and brought on a bilious diarrhoea which has brought me back again to my first principle on which I set out and with which I shall now scamper it away to the banks of the Garonne No I cannot stop a moment to give you the character of the people their genius their manners their customs their laws their religion their government their manufactures their commerce their finances with all the resources and hidden springs which sustain them qualified as I may be by spending three days and two nights amongst them and during all that time making these things the entire subject of my enquiries and reflections Still still I must away the roads are paved the posts are short the days are long tis no more than noon I shall be at Fontainebleau before the king Was he going there not that I know End of the Third Volume THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY GENT VOLUME THE FOURTH Non enim excursus hic ejus sed opus ipsum est Plin Lib V Epist six Si quid urbaniuscule lusum a nobis per Musas et Charitas et omnium poetarum Numina Oro te ne me male capias A Dedication to a Great Man Having a priori intended to dedicate The Amours of my Uncle Toby to mister I see more reasons a posteriori for doing it to Lord I should lament from my soul if this exposed me to the jealousy of their Reverences because a posteriori in Court latin signifies the kissing hands for preferment or any thing else in order to get it My opinion of Lord is neither better nor worse than it was of mister Honours like impressions upon coin may give an ideal and local value to a bit of base metal but Gold and Silver will pass all the world over without any other recommendation than their own weight The same good will that made me think of offering up half an hour s amusement to mister when out of place operates more forcibly at present as half an hour s amusement will be more serviceable and refreshing after labour and sorrow than after a philosophical repast Nothing is so perfectly amusement as a total change of ideas no ideas are so totally different as those of Ministers and innocent Lovers for which reason when I come to talk of Statesmen and Patriots and set such marks upon them as will prevent confusion and mistakes concerning them for the future I propose to dedicate that Volume to some gentle Shepherd Whose thoughts proud Science never taught to stray Far as the Statesman s walk or Patriot way Yet simple Nature to his hopes had given Out of a cloud capp d head a humbler heaven Some untam d World in depths of wood embraced Some happier Island in the wat ry waste And where admitted to that equal sky His faithful Dogs should bear him company In a word by thus introducing an entire new set of objects to his Imagination I shall unavoidably give a Diversion to his passionate and love sick Contemplations In the mean time I am The Author Chapter four I Now I hate to hear a person especially if he be a traveller complain that we do not get on so fast in France as we do in England whereas we get on much faster consideratis considerandis thereby always meaning that if you weigh their vehicles with the mountains of baggage which you lay both before and behind upon them and then consider their puny horses with the very little they give them tis a wonder they get on at all their suffering is most unchristian and tis evident thereupon to me that a French post horse would not know what in the world to do was it not for the two words and in which there is as much sustenance as if you give him a peck of corn now as these words cost nothing I long from my soul to tell the reader what they are but here is the question they must be told him plainly and with the most distinct articulation or it will answer no end and yet to do it in that plain way though their reverences may laugh at it in the bed chamber full well I wot they will abuse it in the parlour for which cause I have been volving and revolving in my fancy some time but to no purpose by what clean device or facette contrivance I might so modulate them that whilst I satisfy that ear which the reader chuses to lend me I might not dissatisfy the other which he keeps to himself My ink burns my finger to try and when I have twill have a worse consequence It will burn I fear my paper No I dare not But if you wish to know how the abbess of Andouillets and a novice of her convent got over the difficulty only first wishing myself all imaginable success I ll tell you without the least scruple Chapter four II The abbess of Andouillets which if you look into the large set of provincial maps now publishing at Paris you will find situated amongst the hills which divide Burgundy from Savoy being in danger of an Anchylosis or stiff joint the sinovia of her knee becoming hard by long matins and having tried every remedy first prayers and thanksgiving then invocations to all the saints in heaven promiscuously then particularly to every saint who had ever had a stiff leg before her then touching it with all the reliques of the convent principally with the thigh bone of the man of Lystra who had been impotent from his youth then wrapping it up in her veil when she went to bed then cross wise her rosary then bringing in to her aid the secular arm and anointing it with oils and hot fat of animals then treating it with emollient and resolving fomentations then with poultices of marsh mallows mallows bonus Henricus white lillies and fenugreek then taking the woods I mean the smoak of em holding her scapulary across her lap then decoctions of wild chicory water cresses chervil sweet cecily and cochlearia and nothing all this while answering was prevailed on at last to try the hot baths of Bourbon so having first obtained leave of the visitor general to take care of her existence she ordered all to be got ready for her journey a novice of the convent of about seventeen who had been troubled with a whitloe in her middle finger by sticking it constantly into the abbess s cast poultices c had gained such an interest that overlooking a sciatical old nun who might have been set up for ever by the hot baths of Bourbon Margarita the little novice was elected as the companion of the journey An old calesh belonging to the abbesse lined with green frize was ordered to be drawn out into the sun the gardener of the convent being chosen muleteer led out the two old mules to clip the hair from the rump ends of their tails whilst a couple of lay sisters were busied the one in darning the lining and the other in sewing on the shreds of yellow binding which the teeth of time had unravelled the under gardener dress d the muleteer s hat in hot wine lees and a taylor sat musically at it in a shed over against the convent in assorting four dozen of bells for the harness whistling to each bell as he tied it on with a thong The carpenter and the smith of Andouillets held a council of wheels and by seven the morning after all look d spruce and was ready at the gate of the convent for the hot baths of Bourbon two rows of the unfortunate stood ready there an hour before The abbess of Andouillets supported by Margarita the novice advanced slowly to the calesh both clad in white with their black rosaries hanging at their breasts There was a simple solemnity in the contrast they entered the calesh the nuns in the same uniform sweet emblem of innocence each occupied a window and as the abbess and Margarita look d up each the sciatical poor nun excepted each stream d out the end of her veil in the air then kiss d the lilly hand which let it go the good abbess and Margarita laid their hands saint wise upon their breasts look d up to heaven then to them and look d God bless you dear sisters I declare I am interested in this story and wish I had been there The gardener whom I shall now call the muleteer was a little hearty broad set good natured chattering toping kind of a fellow who troubled his head very little with the hows and whens of life so had mortgaged a month of his conventical wages in a borrachio or leathern cask of wine which he had disposed behind the calesh with a large russet coloured riding coat over it to guard it from the sun and as the weather was hot and he not a niggard of his labours walking ten times more than he rode he found more occasions than those of nature to fall back to the rear of his carriage till by frequent coming and going it had so happen d that all his wine had leak d out at the legal vent of the borrachio before one half of the journey was finish d Man is a creature born to habitudes The day had been sultry the evening was delicious the wine was generous the Burgundian hill on which it grew was steep a little tempting bush over the door of a cool cottage at the foot of it hung vibrating in full harmony with the passions a gentle air rustled distinctly through the leaves Come come thirsty muleteer come in The muleteer was a son of Adam I need not say a word more He gave the mules each of em a sound lash and looking in the abbess s and Margarita s faces as he did it as much as to say here I am he gave a second good crack as much as to say to his mules get on so slinking behind he enter d the little inn at the foot of the hill The muleteer as I told you was a little joyous chirping fellow who thought not of to morrow nor of what had gone before or what was to follow it provided he got but his scantling of Burgundy and a little chit chat along with it so entering into a long conversation as how he was chief gardener to the convent of Andouillets c c and out of friendship for the abbess and Mademoiselle Margarita who was only in her noviciate he had come along with them from the confines of Savoy c c and as how she had got a white swelling by her devotions and what a nation of herbs he had procured to mollify her humours c c and that if the waters of Bourbon did not mend that leg she might as well be lame of both c c c He so contrived his story as absolutely to forget the heroine of it and with her the little novice and what was a more ticklish point to be forgot than both the two mules who being creatures that take advantage of the world inasmuch as their parents took it of them and they not being in a condition to return the obligation downwards as men and women and beasts are they do it side ways and long ways and back ways and up hill and down hill and which way they can Philosophers with all their ethicks have never considered this rightly how should the poor muleteer then in his cups consider it at all he did not in the least tis time we do let us leave him then in the vortex of his element the happiest and most thoughtless of mortal men and for a moment let us look after the mules the abbess and Margarita By virtue of the muleteer s two last strokes the mules had gone quietly on following their own consciences up the hill till they had conquer d about one half of it when the elder of them a shrewd crafty old devil at the turn of an angle giving a side glance and no muleteer behind them By my fig said she swearing I ll go no further And if I do replied the other they shall make a drum of my hide And so with one consent they stopp d thus Chapter four III Get on with you said the abbess Wh ysh ysh cried Margarita Sh a shu u shu u sh aw shaw d the abbess Whu v w whew w w whuv d Margarita pursing up her sweet lips betwixt a hoot and a whistle Thump thump thump obstreperated the abbess of Andouillets with the end of her gold headed cane against the bottom of the calesh The old mule let a f Chapter four IV We are ruin d and undone my child said the abbess to Margarita we shall be here all night we shall be plunder d we shall be ravished We shall be ravish d said Margarita as sure as a gun Sancta Maria cried the abbess forgetting the O why was I govern d by this wicked stiff joint why did I leave the convent of Andouillets and why didst thou not suffer thy servant to go unpolluted to her tomb O my finger my finger cried the novice catching fire at the word servant why was I not content to put it here or there any where rather than be in this strait Strait said the abbess Strait said the novice for terror had struck their understandings the one knew not what she said the other what she answer d O my virginity virginity cried the abbess inity inity said the novice sobbing Chapter four V My dear mother quoth the novice coming a little to herself there are two certain words which I have been told will force any horse or ass or mule to go up a hill whether he will or no be he never so obstinate or ill will d the moment he hears them utter d he obeys They are words magic cried the abbess in the utmost horror No replied Margarita calmly but they are words sinful What are they quoth the abbess interrupting her They are sinful in the first degree answered Margarita they are mortal and if we are ravished and die unabsolved of them we shall both but you may pronounce them to me quoth the abbess of Andouillets They cannot my dear mother said the novice be pronounced at all they will make all the blood in one s body fly up into one s face But you may whisper them in my ear quoth the abbess Heaven hadst thou no guardian angel to delegate to the inn at the bottom of the hill was there no generous and friendly spirit unemployed no agent in nature by some monitory shivering creeping along the artery which led to his heart to rouse the muleteer from his banquet no sweet minstrelsy to bring back the fair idea of the abbess and Margarita with their black rosaries Rouse rouse but tis too late the horrid words are pronounced this moment and how to tell them Ye who can speak of every thing existing with unpolluted lips instruct me guide me Chapter four VI All sins whatever quoth the abbess turning casuist in the distress they were under are held by the confessor of our convent to be either mortal or venial there is no further division Now a venial sin being the slightest and least of all sins being halved by taking either only the half of it and leaving the rest or by taking it all and amicably halving it betwixt yourself and another person in course becomes diluted into no sin at all Now I see no sin in saying bou bou bou bou bou a hundred times together nor is there any turpitude in pronouncing the syllable ger ger ger ger ger were it from our matins to our vespers Therefore my dear daughter continued the abbess of Andouillets I will say bou and thou shalt say ger and then alternately as there is no more sin in fou than in bou Thou shalt say fou and I will come in like fa sol la re mi ut at our complines with ter And accordingly the abbess giving the pitch note set off thus Abbess Bou bou bou Margarita ger ger ger Margarita Fou fou fou Abbess ter ter ter The two mules acknowledged the notes by a mutual lash of their tails but it went no further Twill answer by an by said the novice Abbess Bou bou bou bou bou bou Margarita ger ger ger ger ger ger Quicker still cried Margarita Fou fou fou fou fou fou fou fou fou Quicker still cried Margarita Bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou bou Quicker still God preserve me said the abbess They do not understand us cried Margarita But the Devil does said the abbess of Andouillets Chapter four VII What a tract of country have I run how many degrees nearer to the warm sun am I advanced and how many fair and goodly cities have I seen during the time you have been reading and reflecting Madam upon this story There s Fontainbleau and Sens and Joigny and Auxerre and Dijon the capital of Burgundy and Challon and Macon the capital of the Maconese and a score more upon the road to Lyons and now I have run them over I might as well talk to you of so many market towns in the moon as tell you one word about them it will be this chapter at the least if not both this and the next entirely lost do what I will Why tis a strange story Tristram Alas Madam had it been upon some melancholy lecture of the cross the peace of meekness or the contentment of resignation I had not been incommoded or had I thought of writing it upon the purer abstractions of the soul and that food of wisdom and holiness and contemplation upon which the spirit of man when separated from the body is to subsist for ever You would have come with a better appetite from it I wish I never had wrote it but as I never blot any thing out let us use some honest means to get it out of our heads directly Pray reach me my fool s cap I fear you sit upon it Madam tis under the cushion I ll put it on Bless me you have had it upon your head this half hour There then let it stay with a Fa ra diddle di and a fa ri diddle d and a high dum dye dum fiddle dumb c And now Madam we may venture I hope a little to go on Chapter four VIII All you need say of Fontainbleau in case you are ask d is that it stands about forty miles south something from Paris in the middle of a large forest That there is something great in it That the king goes there once every two or three years with his whole court for the pleasure of the chace and that during that carnival of sporting any English gentleman of fashion you need not forget yourself may be accommodated with a nag or two to partake of the sport taking care only not to out gallop the king Though there are two reasons why you need not talk loud of this to every one First Because twill make the said nags the harder to be got and Secondly Tis not a word of it true Allons As for Sens you may dispatch in a word Tis an archiepiscopal see For Joigny the less I think one says of it the better But for Auxerre I could go on for ever for in my grand tour through Europe in which after all my father not caring to trust me with any one attended me himself with my uncle Toby and Trim and Obadiah and indeed most of the family except my mother who being taken up with a project of knitting my father a pair of large worsted breeches the thing is common sense and she not caring to be put out of her way she staid at home at Shandy Hall to keep things right during the expedition in which I say my father stopping us two days at Auxerre and his researches being ever of such a nature that they would have found fruit even in a desert he has left me enough to say upon Auxerre in short wherever my father went but twas more remarkably so in this journey through France and Italy than in any other stages of his life his road seemed to lie so much on one side of that wherein all other travellers have gone before him he saw kings and courts and silks of all colours in such strange lights and his remarks and reasonings upon the characters the manners and customs of the countries we pass d over were so opposite to those of all other mortal men particularly those of my uncle Toby and Trim to say nothing of myself and to crown all the occurrences and scrapes which we were perpetually meeting and getting into in consequence of his systems and opiniotry they were of so odd so mix d and tragi comical a contexture That the whole put together it appears of so different a shade and tint from any tour of Europe which was ever executed that I will venture to pronounce the fault must be mine and mine only if it be not read by all travellers and travel readers till travelling is no more or which comes to the same point till the world finally takes it into its head to stand still But this rich bale is not to be open d now except a small thread or two of it merely to unravel the mystery of my father s stay at Auxerre As I have mentioned it tis too slight to be kept suspended and when tis wove in there is an end of it We ll go brother Toby said my father whilst dinner is coddling to the abbey of Saint Germain if it be only to see these bodies of which Monsieur Sequier has given such a recommendation I ll go see any body quoth my uncle Toby for he was all compliance through every step of the journey Defend me said my father they are all mummies Then one need not shave quoth my uncle Toby Shave no cried my father twill be more like relations to go with our beards on So out we sallied the corporal lending his master his arm and bringing up the rear to the abbey of Saint Germain Every thing is very fine and very rich and very superb and very magnificent said my father addressing himself to the sacristan who was a younger brother of the order of Benedictines but our curiosity has led us to see the bodies of which Monsieur Sequier has given the world so exact a description The sacristan made a bow and lighting a torch first which he had always in the vestry ready for the purpose he led us into the tomb of saint Heribald This said the sacristan laying his hand upon the tomb was a renowned prince of the house of Bavaria who under the successive reigns of Charlemagne Louis le Debonnair and Charles the Bald bore a great sway in the government and had a principal hand in bringing every thing into order and discipline Then he has been as great said my uncle in the field as in the cabinet I dare say he has been a gallant soldier He was a monk said the sacristan My uncle Toby and Trim sought comfort in each other s faces but found it not my father clapped both his hands upon his cod piece which was a way he had when any thing hugely tickled him for though he hated a monk and the very smell of a monk worse than all the devils in hell yet the shot hitting my uncle Toby and Trim so much harder than him twas a relative triumph and put him into the gayest humour in the world And pray what do you call this gentleman quoth my father rather sportingly This tomb said the young Benedictine looking downwards contains the bones of Saint Maxima who came from Ravenna on purpose to touch the body Of Saint Maximus said my father popping in with his saint before him they were two of the greatest saints in the whole martyrology added my father Excuse me said the sacristan twas to touch the bones of Saint Germain the builder of the abbey And what did she get by it said my uncle Toby What does any woman get by it said my father Martyrdome replied the young Benedictine making a bow down to the ground and uttering the word with so humble but decisive a cadence it disarmed my father for a moment Tis supposed continued the Benedictine that saint Maxima has lain in this tomb four hundred years and two hundred before her canonization Tis but a slow rise brother Toby quoth my father in this self same army of martyrs A desperate slow one an please your honour said Trim unless one could purchase I should rather sell out entirely quoth my uncle Toby I am pretty much of your opinion brother Toby said my father Poor saint Maxima said my uncle Toby low to himself as we turn d from her tomb She was one of the fairest and most beautiful ladies either of Italy or France continued the sacristan But who the duce has got lain down here besides her quoth my father pointing with his cane to a large tomb as we walked on It is Saint Optat Sir answered the sacristan And properly is Saint Optat plac d said my father And what is Saint Optat s story continued he Saint Optat replied the sacristan was a bishop I thought so by heaven cried my father interrupting him Saint Optat how should Saint Optat fail so snatching out his pocket book and the young Benedictine holding him the torch as he wrote he set it down as a new prop to his system of Christian names and I will be bold to say so disinterested was he in the search of truth that had he found a treasure in Saint Optat s tomb it would not have made him half so rich Twas as successful a short visit as ever was paid to the dead and so highly was his fancy pleas d with all that had passed in it that he determined at once to stay another day in Auxerre I ll see the rest of these good gentry to morrow said my father as we cross d over the square And while you are paying that visit brother Shandy quoth my uncle Toby the corporal and I will mount the ramparts Chapter four IX Now this is the most puzzled skein of all for in this last chapter as far at least as it has help d me through Auxerre I have been getting forwards in two different journies together and with the same dash of the pen for I have got entirely out of Auxerre in this journey which I am writing now and I am got half way out of Auxerre in that which I shall write hereafter There is but a certain degree of perfection in every thing and by pushing at something beyond that I have brought myself into such a situation as no traveller ever stood before me for I am this moment walking across the market place of Auxerre with my father and my uncle Toby in our way back to dinner and I am this moment also entering Lyons with my post chaise broke into a thousand pieces and I am moreover this moment in a handsome pavillion built by Pringello The same Don Pringello the celebrated Spanish architect of whom my cousin Antony has made such honourable mention in a scholium to the Tale inscribed to his name Vid p one hundred twenty nine small edit upon the banks of the Garonne which Mons Sligniac has lent me and where I now sit rhapsodising all these affairs Let me collect myself and pursue my journey Chapter four X I am glad of it said I settling the account with myself as I walk d into Lyons my chaise being all laid higgledy piggledy with my baggage in a cart which was moving slowly before me I am heartily glad said I that tis all broke to pieces for now I can go directly by water to Avignon which will carry me on a hundred and twenty miles of my journey and not cost me seven livres and from thence continued I bringing forwards the account I can hire a couple of mules or asses if I like for nobody knows me and cross the plains of Languedoc for almost nothing I shall gain four hundred livres by the misfortune clear into my purse and pleasure worth worth double the money by it With what velocity continued I clapping my two hands together shall I fly down the rapid Rhone with the Vivares on my right hand and Dauphiny on my left scarce seeing the ancient cities of Vienne Valence and Vivieres What a flame will it rekindle in the lamp to snatch a blushing grape from the Hermitage and Cote roti as I shoot by the foot of them and what a fresh spring in the blood to behold upon the banks advancing and retiring the castles of romance whence courteous knights have whilome rescued the distress d and see vertiginous the rocks the mountains the cataracts and all the hurry which Nature is in with all her great works about her As I went on thus methought my chaise the wreck of which look d stately enough at the first insensibly grew less and less in its size the freshness of the painting was no more the gilding lost its lustre and the whole affair appeared so poor in my eyes so sorry so contemptible and in a word so much worse than the abbess of Andouillets itself that I was just opening my mouth to give it to the devil when a pert vamping chaise undertaker stepping nimbly across the street demanded if Monsieur would have his chaise refitted No no said I shaking my head sideways Would Monsieur choose to sell it rejoined the undertaker With all my soul said I the iron work is worth forty livres and the glasses worth forty more and the leather you may take to live on What a mine of wealth quoth I as he counted me the money has this post chaise brought me in And this is my usual method of book keeping at least with the disasters of life making a penny of every one of em as they happen to me Do my dear Jenny tell the world for me how I behaved under one the most oppressive of its kind which could befal me as a man proud as he ought to be of his manhood Tis enough saidst thou coming close up to me as I stood with my garters in my hand reflecting upon what had not pass d Tis enough Tristram and I am satisfied saidst thou whispering these words in my ear any other man would have sunk down to the centre Every thing is good for something quoth I I ll go into Wales for six weeks and drink goat s whey and I ll gain seven years longer life for the accident For which reason I think myself inexcusable for blaming Fortune so often as I have done for pelting me all my life long like an ungracious duchess as I call d her with so many small evils surely if I have any cause to be angry with her tis that she has not sent me great ones a score of good cursed bouncing losses would have been as good as a pension to me One of a hundred a year or so is all I wish I would not be at the plague of paying land tax for a larger Chapter four XI To those who call vexations Vexations as knowing what they are there could not be a greater than to be the best part of a day at Lyons the most opulent and flourishing city in France enriched with the most fragments of antiquity and not be able to see it To be withheld upon any account must be a vexation but to be withheld by a vexation must certainly be what philosophy justly calls Vexation upon Vexation I had got my two dishes of milk coffee which by the bye is excellently good for a consumption but you must boil the milk and coffee together otherwise tis only coffee and milk and as it was no more than eight in the morning and the boat did not go off till noon I had time to see enough of Lyons to tire the patience of all the friends I had in the world with it I will take a walk to the cathedral said I looking at my list and see the wonderful mechanism of this great clock of Lippius of Basil in the first place Now of all things in the world I understand the least of mechanism I have neither genius or taste or fancy and have a brain so entirely unapt for every thing of that kind that I solemnly declare I was never yet able to comprehend the principles of motion of a squirrel cage or a common knife grinder s wheel tho I have many an hour of my life look d up with great devotion at the one and stood by with as much patience as any christian ever could do at the other I ll go see the surprising movements of this great clock said I the very first thing I do and then I will pay a visit to the great library of the Jesuits and procure if possible a sight of the thirty volumes of the general history of China wrote not in the Tartarean but in the Chinese language and in the Chinese character too Now I almost know as little of the Chinese language as I do of the mechanism of Lippius s clock work so why these should have jostled themselves into the two first articles of my list I leave to the curious as a problem of Nature I own it looks like one of her ladyship s obliquities and they who court her are interested in finding out her humour as much as I When these curiosities are seen quoth I half addressing myself to my valet de place who stood behind me twill be no hurt if we go to the church of saint Irenaeus and see the pillar to which Christ was tied and after that the house where Pontius Pilate lived Twas at the next town said the valet de place at Vienne I am glad of it said I rising briskly from my chair and walking across the room with strides twice as long as my usual pace for so much the sooner shall I be at the Tomb of the two lovers What was the cause of this movement and why I took such long strides in uttering this I might leave to the curious too but as no principle of clock work is concerned in it twill be as well for the reader if I explain it myself Chapter four XII O there is a sweet aera in the life of man when the brain being tender and fibrillous and more like pap than any thing else a story read of two fond lovers separated from each other by cruel parents and by still more cruel destiny Amandus He Amanda She each ignorant of the other s course He east She west Amandus taken captive by the Turks and carried to the emperor of Morocco s court where the princess of Morocco falling in love with him keeps him twenty years in prison for the love of his Amanda She Amanda all the time wandering barefoot and with dishevell d hair o er rocks and mountains enquiring for Amandus Amandus Amandus making every hill and valley to echo back his name Amandus Amandus at every town and city sitting down forlorn at the gate Has Amandus has my Amandus enter d till going round and round and round the world chance unexpected bringing them at the same moment of the night though by different ways to the gate of Lyons their native city and each in well known accents calling out aloud Is Amandus Is my Amanda still alive they fly into each other s arms and both drop down dead for joy There is a soft aera in every gentle mortal s life where such a story affords more pabulum to the brain than all the Frusts and Crusts and Rusts of antiquity which travellers can cook up for it Twas all that stuck on the right side of the cullender in my own of what Spon and others in their accounts of Lyons had strained into it and finding moreover in some Itinerary but in what God knows That sacred to the fidelity of Amandus and Amanda a tomb was built without the gates where to this hour lovers called upon them to attest their truths I never could get into a scrape of that kind in my life but this tomb of the lovers would somehow or other come in at the close nay such a kind of empire had it establish d over me that I could seldom think or speak of Lyons and sometimes not so much as see even a Lyons waistcoat but this remnant of antiquity would present itself to my fancy and I have often said in my wild way of running on tho I fear with some irreverence I thought this shrine neglected as it was as valuable as that of Mecca and so little short except in wealth of the Santa Casa itself that some time or other I would go a pilgrimage though I had no other business at Lyons on purpose to pay it a visit In my list therefore of Videnda at Lyons this tho last was not you see least so taking a dozen or two of longer strides than usual cross my room just whilst it passed my brain I walked down calmly into the basse cour in order to sally forth and having called for my bill as it was uncertain whether I should return to my inn I had paid it had moreover given the maid ten sous and was just receiving the dernier compliments of Monsieur Le Blanc for a pleasant voyage down the Rhone when I was stopped at the gate Chapter four XIII Twas by a poor ass who had just turned in with a couple of large panniers upon his back to collect eleemosynary turnip tops and cabbage leaves and stood dubious with his two fore feet on the inside of the threshold and with his two hinder feet towards the street as not knowing very well whether he was to go in or no Now tis an animal be in what hurry I may I cannot bear to strike there is a patient endurance of sufferings wrote so unaffectedly in his looks and carriage which pleads so mightily for him that it always disarms me and to that degree that I do not like to speak unkindly to him on the contrary meet him where I will whether in town or country in cart or under panniers whether in liberty or bondage I have ever something civil to say to him on my part and as one word begets another if he has as little to do as I I generally fall into conversation with him and surely never is my imagination so busy as in framing his responses from the etchings of his countenance and where those carry me not deep enough in flying from my own heart into his and seeing what is natural for an ass to think as well as a man upon the occasion In truth it is the only creature of all the classes of beings below me with whom I can do this for parrots jackdaws c I never exchange a word with them nor with the apes c for pretty near the same reason they act by rote as the others speak by it and equally make me silent nay my dog and my cat though I value them both and for my dog he would speak if he could yet somehow or other they neither of them possess the talents for conversation I can make nothing of a discourse with them beyond the proposition the reply and rejoinder which terminated my father s and my mother s conversations in his beds of justice and those utter d there s an end of the dialogue But with an ass I can commune for ever Come Honesty said I seeing it was impracticable to pass betwixt him and the gate art thou for coming in or going out The ass twisted his head round to look up the street Well replied I we ll wait a minute for thy driver He turned his head thoughtful about and looked wistfully the opposite way I understand thee perfectly answered I If thou takest a wrong step in this affair he will cudgel thee to death Well a minute is but a minute and if it saves a fellow creature a drubbing it shall not be set down as ill spent He was eating the stem of an artichoke as this discourse went on and in the little peevish contentions of nature betwixt hunger and unsavouriness had dropt it out of his mouth half a dozen times and pick d it up again God help thee Jack said I thou hast a bitter breakfast on t and many a bitter day s labour and many a bitter blow I fear for its wages tis all all bitterness to thee whatever life is to others And now thy mouth if one knew the truth of it is as bitter I dare say as soot for he had cast aside the stem and thou hast not a friend perhaps in all this world that will give thee a macaroon In saying this I pull d out a paper of em which I had just purchased and gave him one and at this moment that I am telling it my heart smites me that there was more of pleasantry in the conceit of seeing how an ass would eat a macaroon than of benevolence in giving him one which presided in the act When the ass had eaten his macaroon I press d him to come in the poor beast was heavy loaded his legs seem d to tremble under him he hung rather backwards and as I pull d at his halter it broke short in my hand he look d up pensive in my face Don t thrash me with it but if you will you may If I do said I I ll be d d The word was but one half of it pronounced like the abbess of Andouillet s so there was no sin in it when a person coming in let fall a thundering bastinado upon the poor devil s crupper which put an end to the ceremony Out upon it cried I but the interjection was equivocal and I think wrong placed too for the end of an osier which had started out from the contexture of the ass s panier had caught hold of my breeches pocket as he rush d by me and rent it in the most disastrous direction you can imagine so that the Out upon it in my opinion should have come in here but this I leave to be settled by The Reviewers of My Breeches which I have brought over along with me for that purpose Chapter four XIV When all was set to rights I came down stairs again into the basse cour with my valet de place in order to sally out towards the tomb of the two lovers c and was a second time stopp d at the gate not by the ass but by the person who struck him and who by that time had taken possession as is not uncommon after a defeat of the very spot of ground where the ass stood It was a commissary sent to me from the post office with a rescript in his hand for the payment of some six livres odd sous Upon what account said I Tis upon the part of the king replied the commissary heaving up both his shoulders My good friend quoth I as sure as I am I and you are you And who are you said he Don t puzzle me said I Chapter four XV But it is an indubitable verity continued I addressing myself to the commissary changing only the form of my asseveration that I owe the king of France nothing but my good will for he is a very honest man and I wish him all health and pastime in the world Pardonnez moi replied the commissary you are indebted to him six livres four sous for the next post from hence to saint Fons in your route to Avignon which being a post royal you pay double for the horses and postillion otherwise twould have amounted to no more than three livres two sous But I don t go by land said I You may if you please replied the commissary Your most obedient servant said I making him a low bow The commissary with all the sincerity of grave good breeding made me one as low again I never was more disconcerted with a bow in my life The devil take the serious character of these people quoth I aside they understand no more of Irony than this The comparison was standing close by with his panniers but something seal d up my lips I could not pronounce the name Sir said I collecting myself it is not my intention to take post But you may said he persisting in his first reply you may take post if you chuse And I may take salt to my pickled herring said I if I chuse But I do not chuse But you must pay for it whether you do or no Aye for the salt said I I know And for the post too added he Defend me cried I I travel by water I am going down the Rhone this very afternoon my baggage is in the boat and I have actually paid nine livres for my passage C est tout egal tis all one said he Bon Dieu what pay for the way I go and for the way I do not go C est tout egal replied the commissary The devil it is said I but I will go to ten thousand Bastiles first O England England thou land of liberty and climate of good sense thou tenderest of mothers and gentlest of nurses cried I kneeling upon one knee as I was beginning my apostrophe When the director of Madam Le Blanc s conscience coming in at that instant and seeing a person in black with a face as pale as ashes at his devotions looking still paler by the contrast and distress of his drapery ask d if I stood in want of the aids of the church I go by Water said I and here s another will be for making me pay for going by Oil Chapter four XVI As I perceived the commissary of the post office would have his six livres four sous I had nothing else for it but to say some smart thing upon the occasion worth the money And so I set off thus And pray mister Commissary by what law of courtesy is a defenceless stranger to be used just the reverse from what you use a Frenchman in this matter By no means said he Excuse me said I for you have begun Sir with first tearing off my breeches and now you want my pocket Whereas had you first taken my pocket as you do with your own people and then left me bare a d after I had been a beast to have complain d As it is Tis contrary to the law of nature Tis contrary to reason Tis contrary to the Gospel But not to this said he putting a printed paper into my hand Par le Roy Tis a pithy prolegomenon quoth I and so read on By all which it appears quoth I having read it over a little too rapidly that if a man sets out in a post chaise from Paris he must go on travelling in one all the days of his life or pay for it Excuse me said the commissary the spirit of the ordinance is this That if you set out with an intention of running post from Paris to Avignon c you shall not change that intention or mode of travelling without first satisfying the fermiers for two posts further than the place you repent at and tis founded continued he upon this that the Revenues are not to fall short through your fickleness O by heavens cried I if fickleness is taxable in France we have nothing to do but to make the best peace with you we can And So the Peace Was Made And if it is a bad one as Tristram Shandy laid the corner stone of it nobody but Tristram Shandy ought to be hanged Chapter four XVII Though I was sensible I had said as many clever things to the commissary as came to six livres four sous yet I was determined to note down the imposition amongst my remarks before I retired from the place so putting my hand into my coat pocket for my remarks which by the bye may be a caution to travellers to take a little more care of their remarks for the future my remarks were stolen Never did sorry traveller make such a pother and racket about his remarks as I did about mine upon the occasion Heaven earth sea fire cried I calling in every thing to my aid but what I should My remarks are stolen what shall I do mister Commissary pray did I drop any remarks as I stood besides you You dropp d a good many very singular ones replied he Pugh said I those were but a few not worth above six livres two sous but these are a large parcel He shook his head Monsieur Le Blanc Madam Le Blanc did you see any papers of mine you maid of the house run up stairs Francois run up after her I must have my remarks they were the best remarks cried I that ever were made the wisest the wittiest What shall I do which way shall I turn myself Sancho Panca when he lost his ass s Furniture did not exclaim more bitterly Chapter four XVIII When the first transport was over and the registers of the brain were beginning to get a little out of the confusion into which this jumble of cross accidents had cast them it then presently occurr d to me that I had left my remarks in the pocket of the chaise and that in selling my chaise I had sold my remarks along with it to the chaise vamper I leave this void space that the reader may swear into it any oath that he is most accustomed to For my own part if ever I swore a whole oath into a vacancy in my life I think it was into that said I and so my remarks through France which were as full of wit as an egg is full of meat and as well worth four hundred guineas as the said egg is worth a penny have I been selling here to a chaise vamper for four Louis d Ors and giving him a post chaise by heaven worth six into the bargain had it been to Dodsley or Becket or any creditable bookseller who was either leaving off business and wanted a post chaise or who was beginning it and wanted my remarks and two or three guineas along with them I could have borne it but to a chaise vamper shew me to him this moment Francois said I The valet de place put on his hat and led the way and I pull d off mine as I pass d the commissary and followed him Chapter four XIX When we arrived at the chaise vamper s house both the house and the shop were shut up it was the eighth of September the nativity of the blessed Virgin Mary mother of God Tantarra ra tan tivi the whole world was gone out a May poling frisking here capering there no body cared a button for me or my remarks so I sat me down upon a bench by the door philosophating upon my condition by a better fate than usually attends me I had not waited half an hour when the mistress came in to take the papilliotes from off her hair before she went to the May poles The French women by the bye love May poles a la folie that is as much as their matins give em but a May pole whether in May June July or September they never count the times down it goes tis meat drink washing and lodging to em and had we but the policy an please your worships as wood is a little scarce in France to send them but plenty of May poles The women would set them up and when they had done they would dance round them and the men for company till they were all blind The wife of the chaise vamper stepp d in I told you to take the papilliotes from off her hair the toilet stands still for no man so she jerk d off her cap to begin with them as she open d the door in doing which one of them fell upon the ground I instantly saw it was my own writing O Seigneur cried I you have got all my remarks upon your head Madam J en suis bien mortifiee said she tis well thinks I they have stuck there for could they have gone deeper they would have made such confusion in a French woman s noddle She had better have gone with it unfrizled to the day of eternity Tenez said she so without any idea of the nature of my suffering she took them from her curls and put them gravely one by one into my hat one was twisted this way another twisted that ey by my faith and when they are published quoth I They will be worse twisted still Chapter four XX And now for Lippius s clock said I with the air of a man who had got thro all his difficulties nothing can prevent us seeing that and the Chinese history c except the time said Francois for tis almost eleven then we must speed the faster said I striding it away to the cathedral I cannot say in my heart that it gave me any concern in being told by one of the minor canons as I was entering the west door That Lippius s great clock was all out of joints and had not gone for some years It will give me the more time thought I to peruse the Chinese history and besides I shall be able to give the world a better account of the clock in its decay than I could have done in its flourishing condition And so away I posted to the college of the Jesuits Now it is with the project of getting a peep at the history of China in Chinese characters as with many others I could mention which strike the fancy only at a distance for as I came nearer and nearer to the point my blood cool d the freak gradually went off till at length I would not have given a cherry stone to have it gratified The truth was my time was short and my heart was at the Tomb of the Lovers I wish to God said I as I got the rapper in my hand that the key of the library may be but lost it fell out as well For all the Jesuits had got the cholic and to that degree as never was known in the memory of the oldest practitioner Chapter four XXI As I knew the geography of the Tomb of the Lovers as well as if I had lived twenty years in Lyons namely that it was upon the turning of my right hand just without the gate leading to the Fauxbourg de Vaise I dispatched Francois to the boat that I might pay the homage I so long ow d it without a witness of my weakness I walk d with all imaginable joy towards the place when I saw the gate which intercepted the tomb my heart glowed within me Tender and faithful spirits cried I addressing myself to Amandus and Amanda long long have I tarried to drop this tear upon your tomb I come I come When I came there was no tomb to drop it upon What would I have given for my uncle Toby to have whistled Lillo bullero Chapter four XXII No matter how or in what mood but I flew from the tomb of the lovers or rather I did not fly from it for there was no such thing existing and just got time enough to the boat to save my passage and ere I had sailed a hundred yards the Rhone and the Saon met together and carried me down merrily betwixt them But I have described this voyage down the Rhone before I made it So now I am at Avignon and as there is nothing to see but the old house in which the duke of Ormond resided and nothing to stop me but a short remark upon the place in three minutes you will see me crossing the bridge upon a mule with Francois upon a horse with my portmanteau behind him and the owner of both striding the way before us with a long gun upon his shoulder and a sword under his arm lest peradventure we should run away with his cattle Had you seen my breeches in entering Avignon Though you d have seen them better I think as I mounted you would not have thought the precaution amiss or found in your heart to have taken it in dudgeon for my own part I took it most kindly and determined to make him a present of them when we got to the end of our journey for the trouble they had put him to of arming himself at all points against them Before I go further let me get rid of my remark upon Avignon which is this That I think it wrong merely because a man s hat has been blown off his head by chance the first night he comes to Avignon that he should therefore say Avignon is more subject to high winds than any town in all France for which reason I laid no stress upon the accident till I had enquired of the master of the inn about it who telling me seriously it was so and hearing moreover the windiness of Avignon spoke of in the country about as a proverb I set it down merely to ask the learned what can be the cause the consequence I saw for they are all Dukes Marquisses and Counts there the duce a Baron in all Avignon so that there is scarce any talking to them on a windy day Prithee friend said I take hold of my mule for a moment for I wanted to pull off one of my jack boots which hurt my heel the man was standing quite idle at the door of the inn and as I had taken it into my head he was someway concerned about the house or stable I put the bridle into his hand so begun with the boot when I had finished the affair I turned about to take the mule from the man and thank him But Monsieur le Marquis had walked in Chapter four XXIII I had now the whole south of France from the banks of the Rhone to those of the Garonne to traverse upon my mule at my own leisure at my own leisure for I had left Death the Lord knows and He only how far behind me I have followed many a man thro France quoth he but never at this mettlesome rate Still he followed and still I fled him but I fled him cheerfully still he pursued but like one who pursued his prey without hope as he lagg d every step he lost softened his looks why should I fly him at this rate So notwithstanding all the commissary of the post office had said I changed the mode of my travelling once more and after so precipitate and rattling a course as I had run I flattered my fancy with thinking of my mule and that I should traverse the rich plains of Languedoc upon his back as slowly as foot could fall There is nothing more pleasing to a traveller or more terrible to travel writers than a large rich plain especially if it is without great rivers or bridges and presents nothing to the eye but one unvaried picture of plenty for after they have once told you that tis delicious or delightful as the case happens that the soil was grateful and that nature pours out all her abundance c they have then a large plain upon their hands which they know not what to do with and which is of little or no use to them but to carry them to some town and that town perhaps of little more but a new place to start from to the next plain and so on This is most terrible work judge if I don t manage my plains better Chapter four XXIV I had not gone above two leagues and a half before the man with his gun began to look at his priming I had three several times loiter d terribly behind half a mile at least every time once in deep conference with a drum maker who was making drums for the fairs of Baucaira and Tarascone I did not understand the principles The second time I cannot so properly say I stopp d for meeting a couple of Franciscans straitened more for time than myself and not being able to get to the bottom of what I was about I had turn d back with them The third was an affair of trade with a gossip for a hand basket of Provence figs for four sous this would have been transacted at once but for a case of conscience at the close of it for when the figs were paid for it turn d out that there were two dozen of eggs covered over with vine leaves at the bottom of the basket as I had no intention of buying eggs I made no sort of claim of them as for the space they had occupied what signified it I had figs enow for my money But it was my intention to have the basket it was the gossip s intention to keep it without which she could do nothing with her eggs and unless I had the basket I could do as little with my figs which were too ripe already and most of em burst at the side this brought on a short contention which terminated in sundry proposals what we should both do How we disposed of our eggs and figs I defy you or the Devil himself had he not been there which I am persuaded he was to form the least probable conjecture You will read the whole of it not this year for I am hastening to the story of my uncle Toby s amours but you will read it in the collection of those which have arose out of the journey across this plain and which therefore I call my Plain Stories How far my pen has been fatigued like those of other travellers in this journey of it over so barren a track the world must judge but the traces of it which are now all set o vibrating together this moment tell me tis the most fruitful and busy period of my life for as I had made no convention with my man with the gun as to time by stopping and talking to every soul I met who was not in a full trot joining all parties before me waiting for every soul behind hailing all those who were coming through cross roads arresting all kinds of beggars pilgrims fiddlers friars not passing by a woman in a mulberry tree without commending her legs and tempting her into conversation with a pinch of snuff In short by seizing every handle of what size or shape soever which chance held out to me in this journey I turned my plain into a city I was always in company and with great variety too and as my mule loved society as much as myself and had some proposals always on his part to offer to every beast he met I am confident we could have passed through Pall Mall or saint James s Street for a month together with fewer adventures and seen less of human nature O there is that sprightly frankness which at once unpins every plait of a Languedocian s dress that whatever is beneath it it looks so like the simplicity which poets sing of in better days I will delude my fancy and believe it is so Twas in the road betwixt Nismes and Lunel where there is the best Muscatto wine in all France and which by the bye belongs to the honest canons of Montpellier and foul befal the man who has drunk it at their table who grudges them a drop of it The sun was set they had done their work the nymphs had tied up their hair afresh and the swains were preparing for a carousal my mule made a dead point Tis the fife and tabourin said I I m frighten d to death quoth he They are running at the ring of pleasure said I giving him a prick By saint Boogar and all the saints at the backside of the door of purgatory said he making the same resolution with the abbesse of Andouillets I ll not go a step further Tis very well sir said I I never will argue a point with one of your family as long as I live so leaping off his back and kicking off one boot into this ditch and t other into that I ll take a dance said I so stay you here A sun burnt daughter of Labour rose up from the groupe to meet me as I advanced towards them her hair which was a dark chesnut approaching rather to a black was tied up in a knot all but a single tress We want a cavalier said she holding out both her hands as if to offer them And a cavalier ye shall have said I taking hold of both of them Hadst thou Nannette been array d like a duchesse But that cursed slit in thy petticoat Nannette cared not for it We could not have done without you said she letting go one hand with self taught politeness leading me up with the other A lame youth whom Apollo had recompensed with a pipe and to which he had added a tabourin of his own accord ran sweetly over the prelude as he sat upon the bank Tie me up this tress instantly said Nannette putting a piece of string into my hand It taught me to forget I was a stranger The whole knot fell down We had been seven years acquainted The youth struck the note upon the tabourin his pipe followed and off we bounded the duce take that slit The sister of the youth who had stolen her voice from heaven sung alternately with her brother twas a Gascoigne roundelay Viva la Joia Fidon la Tristessa The nymphs join d in unison and their swains an octave below them I would have given a crown to have it sew d up Nannette would not have given a sous Viva la joia was in her lips Viva la joia was in her eyes A transient spark of amity shot across the space betwixt us She look d amiable Why could I not live and end my days thus Just Disposer of our joys and sorrows cried I why could not a man sit down in the lap of content here and dance and sing and say his prayers and go to heaven with this nut brown maid Capriciously did she bend her head on one side and dance up insidious Then tis time to dance off quoth I so changing only partners and tunes I danced it away from Lunel to Montpellier from thence to Pescnas Beziers I danced it along through Narbonne Carcasson and Castle Naudairy till at last I danced myself into Perdrillo s pavillion where pulling out a paper of black lines that I might go on straight forwards without digression or parenthesis in my uncle Toby s amours I begun thus Chapter four XXV But softly for in these sportive plains and under this genial sun where at this instant all flesh is running out piping fiddling and dancing to the vintage and every step that s taken the judgment is surprised by the imagination I defy notwithstanding all that has been said upon straight lines Vid Vol III in sundry pages of my book I defy the best cabbage planter that ever existed whether he plants backwards or forwards it makes little difference in the account except that he will have more to answer for in the one case than in the other I defy him to go on coolly critically and canonically planting his cabbages one by one in straight lines and stoical distances especially if slits in petticoats are unsew d up without ever and anon straddling out or sidling into some bastardly digression In Freeze land Fog land and some other lands I wot of it may be done But in this clear climate of fantasy and perspiration where every idea sensible and insensible gets vent in this land my dear Eugenius in this fertile land of chivalry and romance where I now sit unskrewing my ink horn to write my uncle Toby s amours and with all the meanders of Julia s track in quest of her Diego in full view of my study window if thou comest not and takest me by the hand What a work it is likely to turn out Let us begin it Chapter four XXVI It is with Love as with Cuckoldom But now I am talking of beginning a book and have long had a thing upon my mind to be imparted to the reader which if not imparted now can never be imparted to him as long as I live whereas the Comparison may be imparted to him any hour in the day I ll just mention it and begin in good earnest The thing is this That of all the several ways of beginning a book which are now in practice throughout the known world I am confident my own way of doing it is the best I m sure it is the most religious for I begin with writing the first sentence and trusting to Almighty God for the second Twould cure an author for ever of the fuss and folly of opening his street door and calling in his neighbours and friends and kinsfolk with the devil and all his imps with their hammers and engines c only to observe how one sentence of mine follows another and how the plan follows the whole I wish you saw me half starting out of my chair with what confidence as I grasp the elbow of it I look up catching the idea even sometimes before it half way reaches me I believe in my conscience I intercept many a thought which heaven intended for another man Pope and his Portrait Vid Pope s Portrait are fools to me no martyr is ever so full of faith or fire I wish I could say of good works too but I have no Zeal or Anger or Anger or Zeal And till gods and men agree together to call it by the same name the errantest Tartuffe in science in politics or in religion shall never kindle a spark within me or have a worse word or a more unkind greeting than what he will read in the next chapter Chapter four XXVII Bon jour good morrow so you have got your cloak on betimes but tis a cold morning and you judge the matter rightly tis better to be well mounted than go o foot and obstructions in the glands are dangerous And how goes it with thy concubine thy wife and thy little ones o both sides and when did you hear from the old gentleman and lady your sister aunt uncle and cousins I hope they have got better of their colds coughs claps tooth aches fevers stranguries sciaticas swellings and sore eyes What a devil of an apothecary to take so much blood give such a vile purge puke poultice plaister night draught clyster blister And why so many grains of calomel santa Maria and such a dose of opium peri clitating pardi the whole family of ye from head to tail By my great aunt Dinah s old black velvet mask I think there is no occasion for it Now this being a little bald about the chin by frequently putting off and on before she was got with child by the coachman not one of our family would wear it after To cover the Mask afresh was more than the mask was worth and to wear a mask which was bald or which could be half seen through was as bad as having no mask at all This is the reason may it please your reverences that in all our numerous family for these four generations we count no more than one archbishop a Welch judge some three or four aldermen and a single mountebank In the sixteenth century we boast of no less than a dozen alchymists Chapter four XXVIII It is with Love as with Cuckoldom the suffering party is at least the third but generally the last in the house who knows any thing about the matter this comes as all the world knows from having half a dozen words for one thing and so long as what in this vessel of the human frame is Love may be Hatred in that Sentiment half a yard higher and Nonsense no Madam not there I mean at the part I am now pointing to with my forefinger how can we help ourselves Of all mortal and immortal men too if you please who ever soliloquized upon this mystic subject my uncle Toby was the worst fitted to have push d his researches thro such a contention of feelings and he had infallibly let them all run on as we do worse matters to see what they would turn out had not Bridget s pre notification of them to Susannah and Susannah s repeated manifestoes thereupon to all the world made it necessary for my uncle Toby to look into the affair Chapter four XXIX Why weavers gardeners and gladiators or a man with a pined leg proceeding from some ailment in the foot should ever have had some tender nymph breaking her heart in secret for them are points well and duly settled and accounted for by ancient and modern physiologists A water drinker provided he is a profess d one and does it without fraud or covin is precisely in the same predicament not that at first sight there is any consequence or show of logic in it That a rill of cold water dribbling through my inward parts should light up a torch in my Jenny s The proposition does not strike one on the contrary it seems to run opposite to the natural workings of causes and effects But it shews the weakness and imbecility of human reason And in perfect good health with it The most perfect Madam that friendship herself could wish me And drink nothing nothing but water Impetuous fluid the moment thou pressest against the flood gates of the brain see how they give way In swims Curiosity beckoning to her damsels to follow they dive into the center of the current Fancy sits musing upon the bank and with her eyes following the stream turns straws and bulrushes into masts and bow sprits And Desire with vest held up to the knee in one hand snatches at them as they swim by her with the other O ye water drinkers is it then by this delusive fountain that ye have so often governed and turn d this world about like a mill wheel grinding the faces of the impotent bepowdering their ribs bepeppering their noses and changing sometimes even the very frame and face of nature If I was you quoth Yorick I would drink more water Eugenius And if I was you Yorick replied Eugenius so would I Which shews they had both read Longinus For my own part I am resolved never to read any book but my own as long as I live Chapter four XXX I wish my uncle Toby had been a water drinker for then the thing had been accounted for That the first moment Widow Wadman saw him she felt something stirring within her in his favour Something something Something perhaps more than friendship less than love something no matter what no matter where I would not give a single hair off my mule s tail and be obliged to pluck it off myself indeed the villain has not many to spare and is not a little vicious into the bargain to be let by your worships into the secret But the truth is my uncle Toby was not a water drinker he drank it neither pure nor mix d or any how or any where except fortuitously upon some advanced posts where better liquor was not to be had or during the time he was under cure when the surgeon telling him it would extend the fibres and bring them sooner into contact my uncle Toby drank it for quietness sake Now as all the world knows that no effect in nature can be produced without a cause and as it is as well known that my uncle Toby was neither a weaver a gardener or a gladiator unless as a captain you will needs have him one but then he was only a captain of foot and besides the whole is an equivocation There is nothing left for us to suppose but that my uncle Toby s leg but that will avail us little in the present hypothesis unless it had proceeded from some ailment in the foot whereas his leg was not emaciated from any disorder in his foot for my uncle Toby s leg was not emaciated at all It was a little stiff and awkward from a total disuse of it for the three years he lay confined at my father s house in town but it was plump and muscular and in all other respects as good and promising a leg as the other I declare I do not recollect any one opinion or passage of my life where my understanding was more at a loss to make ends meet and torture the chapter I had been writing to the service of the chapter following it than in the present case one would think I took a pleasure in running into difficulties of this kind merely to make fresh experiments of getting out of em Inconsiderate soul that thou art What are not the unavoidable distresses with which as an author and a man thou art hemm d in on every side of thee are they Tristram not sufficient but thou must entangle thyself still more Is it not enough that thou art in debt and that thou hast ten cart loads of thy fifth and sixth volumes Alluding to the first edition still still unsold and art almost at thy wit s ends how to get them off thy hands To this hour art thou not tormented with the vile asthma that thou gattest in skating against the wind in Flanders and is it but two months ago that in a fit of laughter on seeing a cardinal make water like a quirister with both hands thou brakest a vessel in thy lungs whereby in two hours thou lost as many quarts of blood and hadst thou lost as much more did not the faculty tell thee it would have amounted to a gallon Chapter four XXXI But for heaven s sake let us not talk of quarts or gallons let us take the story straight before us it is so nice and intricate a one it will scarce bear the transposition of a single tittle and somehow or other you have got me thrust almost into the middle of it I beg we may take more care Chapter four XXXII My uncle Toby and the corporal had posted down with so much heat and precipitation to take possession of the spot of ground we have so often spoke of in order to open their campaign as early as the rest of the allies that they had forgot one of the most necessary articles of the whole affair it was neither a pioneer s spade a pickax or a shovel It was a bed to lie on so that as Shandy Hall was at that time unfurnished and the little inn where poor Le Fever died not yet built my uncle Toby was constrained to accept of a bed at missus Wadman s for a night or two till corporal Trim who to the character of an excellent valet groom cook sempster surgeon and engineer super added that of an excellent upholsterer too with the help of a carpenter and a couple of taylors constructed one in my uncle Toby s house A daughter of Eve for such was widow Wadman and tis all the character I intend to give of her That she was a perfect woman had better be fifty leagues off or in her warm bed or playing with a case knife or any thing you please than make a man the object of her attention when the house and all the furniture is her own There is nothing in it out of doors and in broad day light where a woman has a power physically speaking of viewing a man in more lights than one but here for her soul she can see him in no light without mixing something of her own goods and chattels along with him till by reiterated acts of such combination he gets foisted into her inventory And then good night But this is not matter of System for I have delivered that above nor is it matter of Breviary for I make no man s creed but my own nor matter of Fact at least that I know of but tis matter copulative and introductory to what follows Chapter four XXXIII I do not speak it with regard to the coarseness or cleanness of them or the strength of their gussets but pray do not night shifts differ from day shifts as much in this particular as in any thing else in the world that they so far exceed the others in length that when you are laid down in them they fall almost as much below the feet as the day shifts fall short of them Widow Wadman s night shifts as was the mode I suppose in King William s and Queen Anne s reigns were cut however after this fashion and if the fashion is changed for in Italy they are come to nothing so much the worse for the public they were two Flemish ells and a half in length so that allowing a moderate woman two ells she had half an ell to spare to do what she would with Now from one little indulgence gained after another in the many bleak and decemberley nights of a seven years widow hood things had insensibly come to this pass and for the two last years had got establish d into one of the ordinances of the bed chamber That as soon as missus Wadman was put to bed and had got her legs stretched down to the bottom of it of which she always gave Bridget notice Bridget with all suitable decorum having first open d the bed clothes at the feet took hold of the half ell of cloth we are speaking of and having gently and with both her hands drawn it downwards to its furthest extension and then contracted it again side long by four or five even plaits she took a large corking pin out of her sleeve and with the point directed towards her pinn d the plaits all fast together a little above the hem which done she tuck d all in tight at the feet and wish d her mistress a good night This was constant and without any other variation than this that on shivering and tempestuous nights when Bridget untuck d the feet of the bed c to do this she consulted no thermometer but that of her own passions and so performed it standing kneeling or squatting according to the different degrees of faith hope and charity she was in and bore towards her mistress that night In every other respect the etiquette was sacred and might have vied with the most mechanical one of the most inflexible bed chamber in Christendom The first night as soon as the corporal had conducted my uncle Toby up stairs which was about ten missus Wadman threw herself into her arm chair and crossing her left knee with her right which formed a resting place for her elbow she reclin d her cheek upon the palm of her hand and leaning forwards ruminated till midnight upon both sides of the question The second night she went to her bureau and having ordered Bridget to bring her up a couple of fresh candles and leave them upon the table she took out her marriage settlement and read it over with great devotion and the third night which was the last of my uncle Toby s stay when Bridget had pull d down the night shift and was assaying to stick in the corking pin With a kick of both heels at once but at the same time the most natural kick that could be kick d in her situation for supposing to be the sun in its meridian it was a north east kick she kick d the pin out of her fingers the etiquette which hung upon it down down it fell to the ground and was shiver d into a thousand atoms From all which it was plain that widow Wadman was in love with my uncle Toby Chapter four XXXIV My uncle Toby s head at that time was full of other matters so that it was not till the demolition of Dunkirk when all the other civilities of Europe were settled that he found leisure to return this This made an armistice that is speaking with regard to my uncle Toby but with respect to missus Wadman a vacancy of almost eleven years But in all cases of this nature as it is the second blow happen at what distance of time it will which makes the fray I chuse for that reason to call these the amours of my uncle Toby with missus Wadman rather than the amours of missus Wadman with my uncle Toby This is not a distinction without a difference It is not like the affair of an old hat cock d and a cock d old hat about which your reverences have so often been at odds with one another but there is a difference here in the nature of things And let me tell you gentry a wide one too Chapter four XXXV Now as widow Wadman did love my uncle Toby and my uncle Toby did not love widow Wadman there was nothing for widow Wadman to do but to go on and love my uncle Toby or let it alone Widow Wadman would do neither the one or the other Gracious heaven but I forget I am a little of her temper myself for whenever it so falls out which it sometimes does about the equinoxes that an earthly goddess is so much this and that and t other that I cannot eat my breakfast for her and that she careth not three halfpence whether I eat my breakfast or no Curse on her and so I send her to Tartary and from Tartary to Terra del Fuogo and so on to the devil in short there is not an infernal nitch where I do not take her divinityship and stick it But as the heart is tender and the passions in these tides ebb and flow ten times in a minute I instantly bring her back again and as I do all things in extremes I place her in the very center of the milky way Brightest of stars thou wilt shed thy influence upon some one The duce take her and her influence too for at that word I lose all patience much good may it do him By all that is hirsute and gashly I cry taking off my furr d cap and twisting it round my finger I would not give sixpence for a dozen such But tis an excellent cap too putting it upon my head and pressing it close to my ears and warm and soft especially if you stroke it the right way but alas that will never be my luck so here my philosophy is shipwreck d again No I shall never have a finger in the pye so here I break my metaphor Crust and Crumb Inside and out Top and bottom I detest it I hate it I repudiate it I m sick at the sight of it Tis all pepper garlick staragen salt and devil s dung by the great arch cooks of cooks who does nothing I think from morning to night but sit down by the fire side and invent inflammatory dishes for us I would not touch it for the world O Tristram Tristram cried Jenny O Jenny Jenny replied I and so went on with the thirty sixth chapter Chapter four XXXVI Not touch it for the world did I say Lord how I have heated my imagination with this metaphor Chapter four XXXVII Which shews let your reverences and worships say what you will of it for as for thinking all who do think think pretty much alike both upon it and other matters Love is certainly at least alphabetically speaking one of the most A gitating B ewitching C onfounded D evilish affairs of life the most E xtravagant F utilitous G alligaskinish H andy dandyish I racundulous there is no K to it and L yrical of all human passions at the same time the most M isgiving N innyhammering O bstipating P ragmatical S tridulous R idiculous though by the bye the R should have gone first But in short tis of such a nature as my father once told my uncle Toby upon the close of a long dissertation upon the subject You can scarce said he combine two ideas together upon it brother Toby without an hypallage What s that cried my uncle Toby The cart before the horse replied my father And what is he to do there cried my uncle Toby Nothing quoth my father but to get in or let it alone Now widow Wadman as I told you before would do neither the one or the other She stood however ready harnessed and caparisoned at all points to watch accidents Chapter four XXXVIII The Fates who certainly all fore knew of these amours of widow Wadman and my uncle Toby had from the first creation of matter and motion and with more courtesy than they usually do things of this kind established such a chain of causes and effects hanging so fast to one another that it was scarce possible for my uncle Toby to have dwelt in any other house in the world or to have occupied any other garden in Christendom but the very house and garden which join d and laid parallel to missus Wadman s this with the advantage of a thickset arbour in missus Wadman s garden but planted in the hedge row of my uncle Toby s put all the occasions into her hands which Love militancy wanted she could observe my uncle Toby s motions and was mistress likewise of his councils of war and as his unsuspecting heart had given leave to the corporal through the mediation of Bridget to make her a wicker gate of communication to enlarge her walks it enabled her to carry on her approaches to the very door of the sentry box and sometimes out of gratitude to make an attack and endeavour to blow my uncle Toby up in the very sentry box itself Chapter four XXXIX It is a great pity but tis certain from every day s observation of man that he may be set on fire like a candle at either end provided there is a sufficient wick standing out if there is not there s an end of the affair and if there is by lighting it at the bottom as the flame in that case has the misfortune generally to put out itself there s an end of the affair again For my part could I always have the ordering of it which way I would be burnt myself for I cannot bear the thoughts of being burnt like a beast I would oblige a housewife constantly to light me at the top for then I should burn down decently to the socket that is from my head to my heart from my heart to my liver from my liver to my bowels and so on by the meseraick veins and arteries through all the turns and lateral insertions of the intestines and their tunicles to the blind gut I beseech you doctor Slop quoth my uncle Toby interrupting him as he mentioned the blind gut in a discourse with my father the night my mother was brought to bed of me I beseech you quoth my uncle Toby to tell me which is the blind gut for old as I am I vow I do not know to this day where it lies The blind gut answered doctor Slop lies betwixt the Ilion and Colon In a man said my father Tis precisely the same cried doctor Slop in a woman That s more than I know quoth my father Chapter four XL And so to make sure of both systems missus Wadman predetermined to light my uncle Toby neither at this end or that but like a prodigal s candle to light him if possible at both ends at once Now through all the lumber rooms of military furniture including both of horse and foot from the great arsenal of Venice to the Tower of London exclusive if missus Wadman had been rummaging for seven years together and with Bridget to help her she could not have found any one blind or mantelet so fit for her purpose as that which the expediency of my uncle Toby s affairs had fix d up ready to her hands I believe I have not told you but I don t know possibly I have be it as it will tis one of the number of those many things which a man had better do over again than dispute about it That whatever town or fortress the corporal was at work upon during the course of their campaign my uncle Toby always took care on the inside of his sentry box which was towards his left hand to have a plan of the place fasten d up with two or three pins at the top but loose at the bottom for the conveniency of holding it up to the eye c as occasions required so that when an attack was resolved upon missus Wadman had nothing more to do when she had got advanced to the door of the sentry box but to extend her right hand and edging in her left foot at the same movement to take hold of the map or plan or upright or whatever it was and with out stretched neck meeting it half way to advance it towards her on which my uncle Toby s passions were sure to catch fire for he would instantly take hold of the other corner of the map in his left hand and with the end of his pipe in the other begin an explanation When the attack was advanced to this point the world will naturally enter into the reasons of missus Wadman s next stroke of generalship which was to take my uncle Toby s tobacco pipe out of his hand as soon as she possibly could which under one pretence or other but generally that of pointing more distinctly at some redoubt or breastwork in the map she would effect before my uncle Toby poor soul had well march d above half a dozen toises with it It obliged my uncle Toby to make use of his forefinger The difference it made in the attack was this That in going upon it as in the first case with the end of her fore finger against the end of my uncle Toby s tobacco pipe she might have travelled with it along the lines from Dan to Beersheba had my uncle Toby s lines reach d so far without any effect For as there was no arterial or vital heat in the end of the tobacco pipe it could excite no sentiment it could neither give fire by pulsation or receive it by sympathy twas nothing but smoke Whereas in following my uncle Toby s forefinger with hers close thro all the little turns and indentings of his works pressing sometimes against the side of it then treading upon its nail then tripping it up then touching it here then there and so on it set something at least in motion This tho slight skirmishing and at a distance from the main body yet drew on the rest for here the map usually falling with the back of it close to the side of the sentry box my uncle Toby in the simplicity of his soul would lay his hand flat upon it in order to go on with his explanation and missus Wadman by a manoeuvre as quick as thought would as certainly place her s close beside it this at once opened a communication large enough for any sentiment to pass or re pass which a person skill d in the elementary and practical part of love making has occasion for By bringing up her forefinger parallel as before to my uncle Toby s it unavoidably brought the thumb into action and the forefinger and thumb being once engaged as naturally brought in the whole hand Thine dear uncle Toby was never now in ts right place missus Wadman had it ever to take up or with the gentlest pushings protrusions and equivocal compressions that a hand to be removed is capable of receiving to get it press d a hair breadth of one side out of her way Whilst this was doing how could she forget to make him sensible that it was her leg and no one s else at the bottom of the sentry box which slightly press d against the calf of his So that my uncle Toby being thus attack d and sore push d on both his wings was it a wonder if now and then it put his centre into disorder
5192_19396_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 The duce take it said my uncle Toby 
none	none	Chapter four XLI These attacks of missus Wadman you will readily conceive to be of different kinds varying from each other like the attacks which history is full of and from the same reasons A general looker on would scarce allow them to be attacks at all or if he did would confound them all together but I write not to them it will be time enough to be a little more exact in my descriptions of them as I come up to them which will not be for some chapters having nothing more to add in this but that in a bundle of original papers and drawings which my father took care to roll up by themselves there is a plan of Bouchain in perfect preservation and shall be kept so whilst I have power to preserve any thing upon the lower corner of which on the right hand side there is still remaining the marks of a snuffy finger and thumb which there is all the reason in the world to imagine were missus Wadman s for the opposite side of the margin which I suppose to have been my uncle Toby s is absolutely clean This seems an authenticated record of one of these attacks for there are vestigia of the two punctures partly grown up but still visible on the opposite corner of the map which are unquestionably the very holes through which it has been pricked up in the sentry box 
5192_19396_000029_000000	train-clean-100	By all that is priestly 
none	none	I value this precious relick with its stigmata and pricks more than all the relicks of the Romish church always excepting when I am writing upon these matters the pricks which entered the flesh of saint Radagunda in the desert which in your road from Fesse to Cluny the nuns of that name will shew you for love Chapter four XLII I think an please your honour quoth Trim the fortifications are quite destroyed and the bason is upon a level with the mole I think so too replied my uncle Toby with a sigh half suppress d but step into the parlour Trim for the stipulation it lies upon the table It has lain there these six weeks replied the corporal till this very morning that the old woman kindled the fire with it Then said my uncle Toby there is no further occasion for our services The more an please your honour the pity said the corporal in uttering which he cast his spade into the wheel barrow which was beside him with an air the most expressive of disconsolation that can be imagined and was heavily turning about to look for his pickax his pioneer s shovel his picquets and other little military stores in order to carry them off the field when a heigh ho from the sentry box which being made of thin slit deal reverberated the sound more sorrowfully to his ear forbad him No said the corporal to himself I ll do it before his honour rises to morrow morning so taking his spade out of the wheel barrow again with a little earth in it as if to level something at the foot of the glacis but with a real intent to approach nearer to his master in order to divert him he loosen d a sod or two pared their edges with his spade and having given them a gentle blow or two with the back of it he sat himself down close by my uncle Toby s feet and began as follows Chapter four XLIII It was a thousand pities though I believe an please your honour I am going to say but a foolish kind of a thing for a soldier A soldier cried my uncle Toby interrupting the corporal is no more exempt from saying a foolish thing Trim than a man of letters But not so often an please your honour replied the corporal my uncle Toby gave a nod It was a thousand pities then said the corporal casting his eye upon Dunkirk and the mole as Servius Sulpicius in returning out of Asia when he sailed from Aegina towards Megara did upon Corinth and Pyreus It was a thousand pities an please your honour to destroy these works and a thousand pities to have let them stood Thou art right Trim in both cases said my uncle Toby This continued the corporal is the reason that from the beginning of their demolition to the end I have never once whistled or sung or laugh d or cry d or talk d of past done deeds or told your honour one story good or bad Thou hast many excellencies Trim said my uncle Toby and I hold it not the least of them as thou happenest to be a story teller that of the number thou hast told me either to amuse me in my painful hours or divert me in my grave ones thou hast seldom told me a bad one Because an please your honour except one of a King of Bohemia and his seven castles they are all true for they are about myself I do not like the subject the worse Trim said my uncle Toby on that score But prithee what is this story thou hast excited my curiosity I ll tell it your honour quoth the corporal directly Provided said my uncle Toby looking earnestly towards Dunkirk and the mole again provided it is not a merry one to such Trim a man should ever bring one half of the entertainment along with him and the disposition I am in at present would wrong both thee Trim and thy story It is not a merry one by any means replied the corporal Nor would I have it altogether a grave one added my uncle Toby It is neither the one nor the other replied the corporal but will suit your honour exactly Then I ll thank thee for it with all my heart cried my uncle Toby so prithee begin it Trim The corporal made his reverence and though it is not so easy a matter as the world imagines to pull off a lank Montero cap with grace or a whit less difficult in my conceptions when a man is sitting squat upon the ground to make a bow so teeming with respect as the corporal was wont yet by suffering the palm of his right hand which was towards his master to slip backwards upon the grass a little beyond his body in order to allow it the greater sweep and by an unforced compression at the same time of his cap with the thumb and the two forefingers of his left by which the diameter of the cap became reduced so that it might be said rather to be insensibly squeez d than pull d off with a flatus the corporal acquitted himself of both in a better manner than the posture of his affairs promised and having hemmed twice to find in what key his story would best go and best suit his master s humour he exchanged a single look of kindness with him and set off thus The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles There was a certain king of Bo he As the corporal was entering the confines of Bohemia my uncle Toby obliged him to halt for a single moment he had set out bare headed having since he pull d off his Montero cap in the latter end of the last chapter left it lying beside him on the ground The eye of Goodness espieth all things so that before the corporal had well got through the first five words of his story had my uncle Toby twice touch d his Montero cap with the end of his cane interrogatively as much as to say Why don t you put it on Trim Trim took it up with the most respectful slowness and casting a glance of humiliation as he did it upon the embroidery of the fore part which being dismally tarnish d and fray d moreover in some of the principal leaves and boldest parts of the pattern he lay d it down again between his two feet in order to moralize upon the subject Tis every word of it but too true cried my uncle Toby that thou art about to observe Nothing in this world Trim is made to last for ever But when tokens dear Tom of thy love and remembrance wear out said Trim what shall we say There is no occasion Trim quoth my uncle Toby to say any thing else and was a man to puzzle his brains till Doom s day I believe Trim it would be impossible The corporal perceiving my uncle Toby was in the right and that it would be in vain for the wit of man to think of extracting a purer moral from his cap without further attempting it he put it on and passing his hand across his forehead to rub out a pensive wrinkle which the text and the doctrine between them had engender d he return d with the same look and tone of voice to his story of the king of Bohemia and his seven castles The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles Continued There was a certain king of Bohemia but in whose reign except his own I am not able to inform your honour I do not desire it of thee Trim by any means cried my uncle Toby It was a little before the time an please your honour when giants were beginning to leave off breeding but in what year of our Lord that was I would not give a halfpenny to know said my uncle Toby Only an please your honour it makes a story look the better in the face Tis thy own Trim so ornament it after thy own fashion and take any date continued my uncle Toby looking pleasantly upon him take any date in the whole world thou chusest and put it to thou art heartily welcome The corporal bowed for of every century and of every year of that century from the first creation of the world down to Noah s flood and from Noah s flood to the birth of Abraham through all the pilgrimages of the patriarchs to the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt and throughout all the Dynasties Olympiads Urbeconditas and other memorable epochas of the different nations of the world down to the coming of Christ and from thence to the very moment in which the corporal was telling his story had my uncle Toby subjected this vast empire of time and all its abysses at his feet but as Modesty scarce touches with a finger what Liberality offers her with both hands open the corporal contented himself with the very worst year of the whole bunch which to prevent your honours of the Majority and Minority from tearing the very flesh off your bones in contestation Whether that year is not always the last cast year of the last cast almanack I tell you plainly it was but from a different reason than you wot of It was the year next him which being the year of our Lord seventeen hundred and twelve when the Duke of Ormond was playing the devil in Flanders the corporal took it and set out with it afresh on his expedition to Bohemia The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles Continued In the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twelve there was an please your honour To tell thee truly Trim quoth my uncle Toby any other date would have pleased me much better not only on account of the sad stain upon our history that year in marching off our troops and refusing to cover the siege of Quesnoi though Fagel was carrying on the works with such incredible vigour but likewise on the score Trim of thy own story because if there are and which from what thou hast dropt I partly suspect to be the fact if there are giants in it There is but one an please your honour Tis as bad as twenty replied my uncle Toby thou should saint have carried him back some seven or eight hundred years out of harm s way both of critics and other people and therefore I would advise thee if ever thou tellest it again If I live an please your honour but once to get through it I will never tell it again quoth Trim either to man woman or child Poo poo said my uncle Toby but with accents of such sweet encouragement did he utter it that the corporal went on with his story with more alacrity than ever The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles Continued There was an please your honour said the corporal raising his voice and rubbing the palms of his two hands cheerily together as he begun a certain king of Bohemia Leave out the date entirely Trim quoth my uncle Toby leaning forwards and laying his hand gently upon the corporal s shoulder to temper the interruption leave it out entirely Trim a story passes very well without these niceties unless one is pretty sure of em Sure of em said the corporal shaking his head Right answered my uncle Toby it is not easy Trim for one bred up as thou and I have been to arms who seldom looks further forward than to the end of his musket or backwards beyond his knapsack to know much about this matter God bless your honour said the corporal won by the manner of my uncle Toby s reasoning as much as by the reasoning itself he has something else to do if not on action or a march or upon duty in his garrison he has his firelock an please your honour to furbish his accoutrements to take care of his regimentals to mend himself to shave and keep clean so as to appear always like what he is upon the parade what business added the corporal triumphantly has a soldier an please your honour to know any thing at all of geography Thou would saint have said chronology Trim said my uncle Toby for as for geography tis of absolute use to him he must be acquainted intimately with every country and its boundaries where his profession carries him he should know every town and city and village and hamlet with the canals the roads and hollow ways which lead up to them there is not a river or a rivulet he passes Trim but he should be able at first sight to tell thee what is its name in what mountains it takes its rise what is its course how far it is navigable where fordable where not he should know the fertility of every valley as well as the hind who ploughs it and be able to describe or if it is required to give thee an exact map of all the plains and defiles the forts the acclivities the woods and morasses thro and by which his army is to march he should know their produce their plants their minerals their waters their animals their seasons their climates their heats and cold their inhabitants their customs their language their policy and even their religion Is it else to be conceived corporal continued my uncle Toby rising up in his sentry box as he began to warm in this part of his discourse how Marlborough could have marched his army from the banks of the Maes to Belburg from Belburg to Kerpenord here the corporal could sit no longer from Kerpenord Trim to Kalsaken from Kalsaken to Newdorf from Newdorf to Landenbourg from Landenbourg to Mildenheim from Mildenheim to Elchingen from Elchingen to Gingen from Gingen to Balmerchoffen from Balmerchoffen to Skellenburg where he broke in upon the enemy s works forced his passage over the Danube cross d the Lech push d on his troops into the heart of the empire marching at the head of them through Fribourg Hokenwert and Schonevelt to the plains of Blenheim and Hochstet Great as he was corporal he could not have advanced a step or made one single day s march without the aids of Geography As for Chronology I own Trim continued my uncle Toby sitting down again coolly in his sentry box that of all others it seems a science which the soldier might best spare was it not for the lights which that science must one day give him in determining the invention of powder the furious execution of which renversing every thing like thunder before it has become a new aera to us of military improvements changing so totally the nature of attacks and defences both by sea and land and awakening so much art and skill in doing it that the world cannot be too exact in ascertaining the precise time of its discovery or too inquisitive in knowing what great man was the discoverer and what occasions gave birth to it I am far from controverting continued my uncle Toby what historians agree in that in the year of our Lord thirteen eighty under the reign of Wencelaus son of Charles the Fourth a certain priest whose name was Schwartz shew d the use of powder to the Venetians in their wars against the Genoese but tis certain he was not the first because if we are to believe Don Pedro the bishop of Leon How came priests and bishops an please your honour to trouble their heads so much about gun powder God knows said my uncle Toby his providence brings good out of every thing and he avers in his chronicle of King Alphonsus who reduced Toledo That in the year thirteen forty three which was full thirty seven years before that time the secret of powder was well known and employed with success both by Moors and Christians not only in their sea combats at that period but in many of their most memorable sieges in Spain and Barbary And all the world knows that Friar Bacon had wrote expressly about it and had generously given the world a receipt to make it by above a hundred and fifty years before even Schwartz was born And that the Chinese added my uncle Toby embarrass us and all accounts of it still more by boasting of the invention some hundreds of years even before him They are a pack of liars I believe cried Trim They are somehow or other deceived said my uncle Toby in this matter as is plain to me from the present miserable state of military architecture amongst them which consists of nothing more than a fosse with a brick wall without flanks and for what they gave us as a bastion at each angle of it tis so barbarously constructed that it looks for all the world Like one of my seven castles an please your honour quoth Trim My uncle Toby tho in the utmost distress for a comparison most courteously refused Trim s offer till Trim telling him he had half a dozen more in Bohemia which he knew not how to get off his hands my uncle Toby was so touch d with the pleasantry of heart of the corporal that he discontinued his dissertation upon gun powder and begged the corporal forthwith to go on with his story of the King of Bohemia and his seven castles The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles Continued This unfortunate King of Bohemia said Trim Was he unfortunate then cried my uncle Toby for he had been so wrapt up in his dissertation upon gun powder and other military affairs that tho he had desired the corporal to go on yet the many interruptions he had given dwelt not so strong upon his fancy as to account for the epithet Was he unfortunate then Trim said my uncle Toby pathetically The corporal wishing first the word and all its synonimas at the devil forthwith began to run back in his mind the principal events in the King of Bohemia s story from every one of which it appearing that he was the most fortunate man that ever existed in the world it put the corporal to a stand for not caring to retract his epithet and less to explain it and least of all to twist his tale like men of lore to serve a system he looked up in my uncle Toby s face for assistance but seeing it was the very thing my uncle Toby sat in expectation of himself after a hum and a haw he went on The King of Bohemia an please your honour replied the corporal was unfortunate as thus That taking great pleasure and delight in navigation and all sort of sea affairs and there happening throughout the whole kingdom of Bohemia to be no sea port town whatever How the duce should there Trim cried my uncle Toby for Bohemia being totally inland it could have happen d no otherwise It might said Trim if it had pleased God My uncle Toby never spoke of the being and natural attributes of God but with diffidence and hesitation I believe not replied my uncle Toby after some pause for being inland as I said and having Silesia and Moravia to the east Lusatia and Upper Saxony to the north Franconia to the west and Bavaria to the south Bohemia could not have been propell d to the sea without ceasing to be Bohemia nor could the sea on the other hand have come up to Bohemia without overflowing a great part of Germany and destroying millions of unfortunate inhabitants who could make no defence against it Scandalous cried Trim Which would bespeak added my uncle Toby mildly such a want of compassion in him who is the father of it that I think Trim the thing could have happen d no way The corporal made the bow of unfeign d conviction and went on Now the King of Bohemia with his queen and courtiers happening one fine summer s evening to walk out Aye there the word happening is right Trim cried my uncle Toby for the King of Bohemia and his queen might have walk d out or let it alone twas a matter of contingency which might happen or not just as chance ordered it King William was of an opinion an please your honour quoth Trim that every thing was predestined for us in this world insomuch that he would often say to his soldiers that every ball had its billet He was a great man said my uncle Toby And I believe continued Trim to this day that the shot which disabled me at the battle of Landen was pointed at my knee for no other purpose but to take me out of his service and place me in your honour s where I should be taken so much better care of in my old age It shall never Trim be construed otherwise said my uncle Toby The heart both of the master and the man were alike subject to sudden over flowings a short silence ensued Besides said the corporal resuming the discourse but in a gayer accent if it had not been for that single shot I had never an please your honour been in love So thou wast once in love Trim said my uncle Toby smiling Souse replied the corporal over head and ears an please your honour Prithee when where and how came it to pass I never heard one word of it before quoth my uncle Toby I dare say answered Trim that every drummer and serjeant s son in the regiment knew of it It s high time I should said my uncle Toby Your honour remembers with concern said the corporal the total rout and confusion of our camp and army at the affair of Landen every one was left to shift for himself and if it had not been for the regiments of Wyndham Lumley and Galway which covered the retreat over the bridge Neerspeeken the king himself could scarce have gained it he was press d hard as your honour knows on every side of him Gallant mortal cried my uncle Toby caught up with enthusiasm this moment now that all is lost I see him galloping across me corporal to the left to bring up the remains of the English horse along with him to support the right and tear the laurel from Luxembourg s brows if yet tis possible I see him with the knot of his scarfe just shot off infusing fresh spirits into poor Galway s regiment riding along the line then wheeling about and charging Conti at the head of it Brave brave by heaven cried my uncle Toby he deserves a crown As richly as a thief a halter shouted Trim My uncle Toby knew the corporal s loyalty otherwise the comparison was not at all to his mind it did not altogether strike the corporal s fancy when he had made it but it could not be recall d so he had nothing to do but proceed As the number of wounded was prodigious and no one had time to think of any thing but his own safety Though Talmash said my uncle Toby brought off the foot with great prudence But I was left upon the field said the corporal Thou wast so poor fellow replied my uncle Toby So that it was noon the next day continued the corporal before I was exchanged and put into a cart with thirteen or fourteen more in order to be convey d to our hospital There is no part of the body an please your honour where a wound occasions more intolerable anguish than upon the knee Except the groin said my uncle Toby An please your honour replied the corporal the knee in my opinion must certainly be the most acute there being so many tendons and what d ye call ems all about it It is for that reason quoth my uncle Toby that the groin is infinitely more sensible there being not only as many tendons and what d ye call ems for I know their names as little as thou dost about it but moreover missus Wadman who had been all the time in her arbour instantly stopp d her breath unpinn d her mob at the chin and stood upon one leg The dispute was maintained with amicable and equal force betwixt my uncle Toby and Trim for some time till Trim at length recollecting that he had often cried at his master s sufferings but never shed a tear at his own was for giving up the point which my uncle Toby would not allow Tis a proof of nothing Trim said he but the generosity of thy temper So that whether the pain of a wound in the groin caeteris paribus is greater than the pain of a wound in the knee or Whether the pain of a wound in the knee is not greater than the pain of a wound in the groin are points which to this day remain unsettled Chapter four XLIV The anguish of my knee continued the corporal was excessive in itself and the uneasiness of the cart with the roughness of the roads which were terribly cut up making bad still worse every step was death to me so that with the loss of blood and the want of care taking of me and a fever I felt coming on besides Poor soul said my uncle Toby all together an please your honour was more than I could sustain I was telling my sufferings to a young woman at a peasant s house where our cart which was the last of the line had halted they had help d me in and the young woman had taken a cordial out of her pocket and dropp d it upon some sugar and seeing it had cheer d me she had given it me a second and a third time So I was telling her an please your honour the anguish I was in and was saying it was so intolerable to me that I had much rather lie down upon the bed turning my face towards one which was in the corner of the room and die than go on when upon her attempting to lead me to it I fainted away in her arms She was a good soul as your honour said the corporal wiping his eyes will hear I thought love had been a joyous thing quoth my uncle Toby Tis the most serious thing an please your honour sometimes that is in the world By the persuasion of the young woman continued the corporal the cart with the wounded men set off without me she had assured them I should expire immediately if I was put into the cart So when I came to myself I found myself in a still quiet cottage with no one but the young woman and the peasant and his wife I was laid across the bed in the corner of the room with my wounded leg upon a chair and the young woman beside me holding the corner of her handkerchief dipp d in vinegar to my nose with one hand and rubbing my temples with the other I took her at first for the daughter of the peasant for it was no inn so had offer d her a little purse with eighteen florins which my poor brother Tom here Trim wip d his eyes had sent me as a token by a recruit just before he set out for Lisbon I never told your honour that piteous story yet here Trim wiped his eyes a third time The young woman call d the old man and his wife into the room to shew them the money in order to gain me credit for a bed and what little necessaries I should want till I should be in a condition to be got to the hospital Come then said she tying up the little purse I ll be your banker but as that office alone will not keep me employ d I ll be your nurse too I thought by her manner of speaking this as well as by her dress which I then began to consider more attentively that the young woman could not be the daughter of the peasant She was in black down to her toes with her hair conceal d under a cambric border laid close to her forehead she was one of those kind of nuns an please your honour of which your honour knows there are a good many in Flanders which they let go loose By thy description Trim said my uncle Toby I dare say she was a young Beguine of which there are none to be found any where but in the Spanish Netherlands except at Amsterdam they differ from nuns in this that they can quit their cloister if they choose to marry they visit and take care of the sick by profession I had rather for my own part they did it out of good nature She often told me quoth Trim she did it for the love of Christ I did not like it I believe Trim we are both wrong said my uncle Toby we ll ask mister Yorick about it to night at my brother Shandy s so put me in mind added my uncle Toby The young Beguine continued the corporal had scarce given herself time to tell me she would be my nurse when she hastily turned about to begin the office of one and prepare something for me and in a short time though I thought it a long one she came back with flannels c c and having fomented my knee soundly for a couple of hours c and made me a thin bason of gruel for my supper she wish d me rest and promised to be with me early in the morning She wish d me an please your honour what was not to be had My fever ran very high that night her figure made sad disturbance within me I was every moment cutting the world in two to give her half of it and every moment was I crying That I had nothing but a knapsack and eighteen florins to share with her The whole night long was the fair Beguine like an angel close by my bed side holding back my curtain and offering me cordials and I was only awakened from my dream by her coming there at the hour promised and giving them in reality In truth she was scarce ever from me and so accustomed was I to receive life from her hands that my heart sickened and I lost colour when she left the room and yet continued the corporal making one of the strangest reflections upon it in the world It was not love for during the three weeks she was almost constantly with me fomenting my knee with her hand night and day I can honestly say an please your honour that once That was very odd Trim quoth my uncle Toby I think so too said missus Wadman It never did said the corporal Chapter four XLV But tis no marvel continued the corporal seeing my uncle Toby musing upon it for Love an please your honour is exactly like war in this that a soldier though he has escaped three weeks complete o Saturday night may nevertheless be shot through his heart on Sunday morning It happened so here an please your honour with this difference only that it was on Sunday in the afternoon when I fell in love all at once with a sisserara It burst upon me an please your honour like a bomb scarce giving me time to say God bless me I thought Trim said my uncle Toby a man never fell in love so very suddenly Yes an please your honour if he is in the way of it replied Trim I prithee quoth my uncle Toby inform me how this matter happened With all pleasure said the corporal making a bow Chapter four XLVI I had escaped continued the corporal all that time from falling in love and had gone on to the end of the chapter had it not been predestined otherwise there is no resisting our fate It was on a Sunday in the afternoon as I told your honour The old man and his wife had walked out Every thing was still and hush as midnight about the house There was not so much as a duck or a duckling about the yard When the fair Beguine came in to see me My wound was then in a fair way of doing well the inflammation had been gone off for some time but it was succeeded with an itching both above and below my knee so insufferable that I had not shut my eyes the whole night for it Let me see it said she kneeling down upon the ground parallel to my knee and laying her hand upon the part below it it only wants rubbing a little said the Beguine so covering it with the bed clothes she began with the fore finger of her right hand to rub under my knee guiding her fore finger backwards and forwards by the edge of the flannel which kept on the dressing In five or six minutes I felt slightly the end of her second finger and presently it was laid flat with the other and she continued rubbing in that way round and round for a good while it then came into my head that I should fall in love I blush d when I saw how white a hand she had I shall never an please your honour behold another hand so white whilst I live Not in that place said my uncle Toby Though it was the most serious despair in nature to the corporal he could not forbear smiling The young Beguine continued the corporal perceiving it was of great service to me from rubbing for some time with two fingers proceeded to rub at length with three till by little and little she brought down the fourth and then rubb d with her whole hand I will never say another word an please your honour upon hands again but it was softer than sattin Prithee Trim commend it as much as thou wilt said my uncle Toby I shall hear thy story with the more delight The corporal thank d his master most unfeignedly but having nothing to say upon the Beguine s hand but the same over again he proceeded to the effects of it The fair Beguine said the corporal continued rubbing with her whole hand under my knee till I fear d her zeal would weary her I would do a thousand times more said she for the love of Christ In saying which she pass d her hand across the flannel to the part above my knee which I had equally complain d of and rubb d it also I perceiv d then I was beginning to be in love As she continued rub rub rubbing I felt it spread from under her hand an please your honour to every part of my frame The more she rubb d and the longer strokes she took the more the fire kindled in my veins till at length by two or three strokes longer than the rest my passion rose to the highest pitch I seiz d her hand And then thou clapped saint it to thy lips Trim said my uncle Toby and madest a speech Whether the corporal s amour terminated precisely in the way my uncle Toby described it is not material it is enough that it contained in it the essence of all the love romances which ever have been wrote since the beginning of the world Chapter four XLVII As soon as the corporal had finished the story of his amour or rather my uncle Toby for him missus Wadman silently sallied forth from her arbour replaced the pin in her mob pass d the wicker gate and advanced slowly towards my uncle Toby s sentry box the disposition which Trim had made in my uncle Toby s mind was too favourable a crisis to be let slipp d The attack was determin d upon it was facilitated still more by my uncle Toby s having ordered the corporal to wheel off the pioneer s shovel the spade the pick axe the picquets and other military stores which lay scatter d upon the ground where Dunkirk stood The corporal had march d the field was clear Now consider sir what nonsense it is either in fighting or writing or any thing else whether in rhyme to it or not which a man has occasion to do to act by plan for if ever Plan independent of all circumstances deserved registering in letters of gold I mean in the archives of Gotham it was certainly the Plan of missus Wadman s attack of my uncle Toby in his sentry box By Plan Now the plan hanging up in it at this juncture being the Plan of Dunkirk and the tale of Dunkirk a tale of relaxation it opposed every impression she could make and besides could she have gone upon it the manoeuvre of fingers and hands in the attack of the sentry box was so outdone by that of the fair Beguine s in Trim s story that just then that particular attack however successful before became the most heartless attack that could be made O let woman alone for this missus Wadman had scarce open d the wicker gate when her genius sported with the change of circumstances She formed a new attack in a moment Chapter four XLVIII I am half distracted captain Shandy said missus Wadman holding up her cambrick handkerchief to her left eye as she approach d the door of my uncle Toby s sentry box a mote or sand or something I know not what has got into this eye of mine do look into it it is not in the white In saying which missus Wadman edged herself close in beside my uncle Toby and squeezing herself down upon the corner of his bench she gave him an opportunity of doing it without rising up Do look into it said she Honest soul thou didst look into it with as much innocency of heart as ever child look d into a raree shew box and twere as much a sin to have hurt thee If a man will be peeping of his own accord into things of that nature I ve nothing to say to it My uncle Toby never did and I will answer for him that he would have sat quietly upon a sofa from June to January which you know takes in both the hot and cold months with an eye as fine as the Thracian Rodope s Rodope Thracia tam inevitabili fascino instructa tam exacte oculus intuens attraxit ut si in illam quis incidisset fieri non posset quin caperetur I know not who besides him without being able to tell whether it was a black or blue one The difficulty was to get my uncle Toby to look at one at all Tis surmounted And I see him yonder with his pipe pendulous in his hand and the ashes falling out of it looking and looking then rubbing his eyes and looking again with twice the good nature that ever Galileo look d for a spot in the sun In vain for by all the powers which animate the organ Widow Wadman s left eye shines this moment as lucid as her right there is neither mote or sand or dust or chaff or speck or particle of opake matter floating in it There is nothing my dear paternal uncle but one lambent delicious fire furtively shooting out from every part of it in all directions into thine If thou lookest uncle Toby in search of this mote one moment longer thou art undone Chapter four XLIX An eye is for all the world exactly like a cannon in this respect That it is not so much the eye or the cannon in themselves as it is the carriage of the eye and the carriage of the cannon by which both the one and the other are enabled to do so much execution I don t think the comparison a bad one However as tis made and placed at the head of the chapter as much for use as ornament all I desire in return is that whenever I speak of missus Wadman s eyes except once in the next period that you keep it in your fancy I protest Madam said my uncle Toby I can see nothing whatever in your eye It is not in the white said missus Wadman my uncle Toby look d with might and main into the pupil Now of all the eyes which ever were created from your own Madam up to those of Venus herself which certainly were as venereal a pair of eyes as ever stood in a head there never was an eye of them all so fitted to rob my uncle Toby of his repose as the very eye at which he was looking it was not Madam a rolling eye a romping or a wanton one nor was it an eye sparkling petulant or imperious of high claims and terrifying exactions which would have curdled at once that milk of human nature of which my uncle Toby was made up but twas an eye full of gentle salutations and soft responses speaking not like the trumpet stop of some ill made organ in which many an eye I talk to holds coarse converse but whispering soft like the last low accent of an expiring saint How can you live comfortless captain Shandy and alone without a bosom to lean your head on or trust your cares to It was an eye But I shall be in love with it myself if I say another word about it It did my uncle Toby s business Chapter four L There is nothing shews the character of my father and my uncle Toby in a more entertaining light than their different manner of deportment under the same accident for I call not love a misfortune from a persuasion that a man s heart is ever the better for it Great God what must my uncle Toby s have been when twas all benignity without it My father as appears from many of his papers was very subject to this passion before he married but from a little subacid kind of drollish impatience in his nature whenever it befell him he would never submit to it like a christian but would pish and huff and bounce and kick and play the Devil and write the bitterest Philippicks against the eye that ever man wrote there is one in verse upon somebody s eye or other that for two or three nights together had put him by his rest which in his first transport of resentment against it he begins thus A Devil tis and mischief such doth work As never yet did Pagan Jew or Turk This will be printed with my father s Life of Socrates c c In short during the whole paroxism my father was all abuse and foul language approaching rather towards malediction only he did not do it with as much method as Ernulphus he was too impetuous nor with Ernulphus s policy for tho my father with the most intolerant spirit would curse both this and that and every thing under heaven which was either aiding or abetting to his love yet never concluded his chapter of curses upon it without cursing himself in at the bargain as one of the most egregious fools and cox combs he would say that ever was let loose in the world My uncle Toby on the contrary took it like a lamb sat still and let the poison work in his veins without resistance in the sharpest exacerbations of his wound like that on his groin he never dropt one fretful or discontented word he blamed neither heaven nor earth or thought or spoke an injurious thing of any body or any part of it he sat solitary and pensive with his pipe looking at his lame leg then whiffing out a sentimental heigh ho which mixing with the smoke incommoded no one mortal He took it like a lamb I say In truth he had mistook it at first for having taken a ride with my father that very morning to save if possible a beautiful wood which the dean and chapter were hewing down to give to the poor mister Shandy must mean the poor in spirit inasmuch as they divided the money amongst themselves which said wood being in full view of my uncle Toby s house and of singular service to him in his description of the battle of Wynnendale by trotting on too hastily to save it upon an uneasy saddle worse horse c c it had so happened that the serous part of the blood had got betwixt the two skins in the nethermost part of my uncle Toby the first shootings of which as my uncle Toby had no experience of love he had taken for a part of the passion till the blister breaking in the one case and the other remaining my uncle Toby was presently convinced that his wound was not a skin deep wound but that it had gone to his heart Chapter four LI The world is ashamed of being virtuous my uncle Toby knew little of the world and therefore when he felt he was in love with widow Wadman he had no conception that the thing was any more to be made a mystery of than if missus Wadman had given him a cut with a gap d knife across his finger Had it been otherwise yet as he ever look d upon Trim as a humble friend and saw fresh reasons every day of his life to treat him as such it would have made no variation in the manner in which he informed him of the affair I am in love corporal quoth my uncle Toby Chapter four LII In love said the corporal your honour was very well the day before yesterday when I was telling your honour of the story of the King of Bohemia Bohemia said my uncle Toby musing a long time What became of that story Trim We lost it an please your honour somehow betwixt us but your honour was as free from love then as I am twas just whilst thou went saint off with the wheel barrow with missus Wadman quoth my uncle Toby She has left a ball here added my uncle Toby pointing to his breast She can no more an please your honour stand a siege than she can fly cried the corporal But as we are neighbours Trim the best way I think is to let her know it civilly first quoth my uncle Toby Now if I might presume said the corporal to differ from your honour Why else do I talk to thee Trim said my uncle Toby mildly Then I would begin an please your honour with making a good thundering attack upon her in return and telling her civilly afterwards for if she knows any thing of your honour s being in love before hand L d help her she knows no more at present of it Trim said my uncle Toby than the child unborn Precious souls missus Wadman had told it with all its circumstances to missus Bridget twenty four hours before and was at that very moment sitting in council with her touching some slight misgivings with regard to the issue of the affairs which the Devil who never lies dead in a ditch had put into her head before he would allow half time to get quietly through her Te Deum I am terribly afraid said widow Wadman in case I should marry him Bridget that the poor captain will not enjoy his health with the monstrous wound upon his groin It may not Madam be so very large replied Bridget as you think and I believe besides added she that tis dried up I could like to know merely for his sake said missus Wadman We ll know and long and the broad of it in ten days answered missus Bridget for whilst the captain is paying his addresses to you I m confident mister Trim will be for making love to me and I ll let him as much as he will added Bridget to get it all out of him The measures were taken at once and my uncle Toby and the corporal went on with theirs Now quoth the corporal setting his left hand a kimbo and giving such a flourish with his right as just promised success and no more if your honour will give me leave to lay down the plan of this attack Thou wilt please me by it Trim said my uncle Toby exceedingly and as I foresee thou must act in it as my aid de camp here s a crown corporal to begin with to steep thy commission Then an please your honour said the corporal making a bow first for his commission we will begin with getting your honour s laced clothes out of the great campaign trunk to be well air d and have the blue and gold taken up at the sleeves and I ll put your white ramallie wig fresh into pipes and send for a taylor to have your honour s thin scarlet breeches turn d I had better take the red plush ones quoth my uncle Toby They will be too clumsy said the corporal Chapter four LIII Thou wilt get a brush and a little chalk to my sword Twill be only in your honour s way replied Trim Chapter four LIV But your honour s two razors shall be new set and I will get my Montero cap furbish d up and put on poor lieutenant Le Fever s regimental coat which your honour gave me to wear for his sake and as soon as your honour is clean shaved and has got your clean shirt on with your blue and gold or your fine scarlet sometimes one and sometimes t other and every thing is ready for the attack we ll march up boldly as if twas to the face of a bastion and whilst your honour engages missus Wadman in the parlour to the right I ll attack missus Bridget in the kitchen to the left and having seiz d the pass I ll answer for it said the corporal snapping his fingers over his head that the day is our own I wish I may but manage it right said my uncle Toby but I declare corporal I had rather march up to the very edge of a trench A woman is quite a different thing said the corporal I suppose so quoth my uncle Toby Chapter four LV If any thing in this world which my father said could have provoked my uncle Toby during the time he was in love it was the perverse use my father was always making of an expression of Hilarion the hermit who in speaking of his abstinence his watchings flagellations and other instrumental parts of his religion would say tho with more facetiousness than became an hermit That they were the means he used to make his ass meaning his body leave off kicking It pleased my father well it was not only a laconick way of expressing but of libelling at the same time the desires and appetites of the lower part of us so that for many years of my father s life twas his constant mode of expression he never used the word passions once but ass always instead of them So that he might be said truly to have been upon the bones or the back of his own ass or else of some other man s during all that time I must here observe to you the difference betwixt My father s ass and my hobby horse in order to keep characters as separate as may be in our fancies as we go along For my hobby horse if you recollect a little is no way a vicious beast he has scarce one hair or lineament of the ass about him Tis the sporting little filly folly which carries you out for the present hour a maggot a butterfly a picture a fiddlestick an uncle Toby s siege or an any thing which a man makes a shift to get a stride on to canter it away from the cares and solicitudes of life Tis as useful a beast as is in the whole creation nor do I really see how the world could do without it But for my father s ass oh mount him mount him mount him that s three times is it not mount him not tis a beast concupiscent and foul befal the man who does not hinder him from kicking Chapter four LVI Well dear brother Toby said my father upon his first seeing him after he fell in love and how goes it with your Asse Now my uncle Toby thinking more of the part where he had had the blister than of Hilarion s metaphor and our preconceptions having you know as great a power over the sounds of words as the shapes of things he had imagined that my father who was not very ceremonious in his choice of words had enquired after the part by its proper name so notwithstanding my mother doctor Slop and mister Yorick were sitting in the parlour he thought it rather civil to conform to the term my father had made use of than not When a man is hemm d in by two indecorums and must commit one of em I always observe let him chuse which he will the world will blame him so I should not be astonished if it blames my uncle Toby My A e quoth my uncle Toby is much better brother Shandy My father had formed great expectations from his Asse in this onset and would have brought him on again but doctor Slop setting up an intemperate laugh and my mother crying out L bless us it drove my father s Asse off the field and the laugh then becoming general there was no bringing him back to the charge for some time And so the discourse went on without him Every body said my mother says you are in love brother Toby and we hope it is true I am as much in love sister I believe replied my uncle Toby as any man usually is Humph said my father and when did you know it quoth my mother When the blister broke replied my uncle Toby My uncle Toby s reply put my father into good temper so he charg d o foot Chapter four LVII As the ancients agree brother Toby said my father that there are two different and distinct kinds of love according to the different parts which are affected by it the Brain or Liver I think when a man is in love it behoves him a little to consider which of the two he is fallen into What signifies it brother Shandy replied my uncle Toby which of the two it is provided it will but make a man marry and love his wife and get a few children A few children cried my father rising out of his chair and looking full in my mother s face as he forced his way betwixt her s and doctor Slop s a few children cried my father repeating my uncle Toby s words as he walk d to and fro Not my dear brother Toby cried my father recovering himself all at once and coming close up to the back of my uncle Toby s chair not that I should be sorry hadst thou a score on the contrary I should rejoice and be as kind Toby to every one of them as a father My uncle Toby stole his hand unperceived behind his chair to give my father s a squeeze Nay moreover continued he keeping hold of my uncle Toby s hand so much dost thou possess my dear Toby of the milk of human nature and so little of its asperities tis piteous the world is not peopled by creatures which resemble thee and was I an Asiatic monarch added my father heating himself with his new project I would oblige thee provided it would not impair thy strength or dry up thy radical moisture too fast or weaken thy memory or fancy brother Toby which these gymnics inordinately taken are apt to do else dear Toby I would procure thee the most beautiful woman in my empire and I would oblige thee nolens volens to beget for me one subject every month As my father pronounced the last word of the sentence my mother took a pinch of snuff Now I would not quoth my uncle Toby get a child nolens volens that is whether I would or no to please the greatest prince upon earth And twould be cruel in me brother Toby to compel thee said my father but tis a case put to shew thee that it is not thy begetting a child in case thou should saint be able but the system of Love and Marriage thou goest upon which I would set thee right in There is at least said Yorick a great deal of reason and plain sense in captain Shandy s opinion of love and tis amongst the ill spent hours of my life which I have to answer for that I have read so many flourishing poets and rhetoricians in my time from whom I never could extract so much I wish Yorick said my father you had read Plato for there you would have learnt that there are two Loves I know there were two Religions replied Yorick amongst the ancients one for the vulgar and another for the learned but I think One Love might have served both of them very well I could not replied my father and for the same reasons for of these Loves according to Ficinus s comment upon Velasius the one is rational the other is natural the first ancient without mother where Venus had nothing to do the second begotten of Jupiter and Dione Pray brother quoth my uncle Toby what has a man who believes in God to do with this My father could not stop to answer for fear of breaking the thread of his discourse This latter continued he partakes wholly of the nature of Venus The first which is the golden chain let down from heaven excites to love heroic which comprehends in it and excites to the desire of philosophy and truth the second excites to desire simply I think the procreation of children as beneficial to the world said Yorick as the finding out the longitude To be sure said my mother love keeps peace in the world In the house my dear I own It replenishes the earth said my mother But it keeps heaven empty my dear replied my father Tis Virginity cried Slop triumphantly which fills paradise Well push d nun quoth my father Chapter four LVIII My father had such a skirmishing cutting kind of a slashing way with him in his disputations thrusting and ripping and giving every one a stroke to remember him by in his turn that if there were twenty people in company in less than half an hour he was sure to have every one of em against him What did not a little contribute to leave him thus without an ally was that if there was any one post more untenable than the rest he would be sure to throw himself into it and to do him justice when he was once there he would defend it so gallantly that twould have been a concern either to a brave man or a good natured one to have seen him driven out

none	none	Doctor Slop s Virginity in the close of the last chapter had got him for once on the right side of the rampart and he was beginning to blow up all the convents in Christendom about Slop s ears when corporal Trim came into the parlour to inform my uncle Toby that his thin scarlet breeches in which the attack was to be made upon missus Wadman would not do for that the taylor in ripping them up in order to turn them had found they had been turn d before Then turn them again brother said my father rapidly for there will be many a turning of em yet before all s done in the affair They are as rotten as dirt said the corporal Then by all means said my father bespeak a new pair brother for though I know continued my father turning himself to the company that widow Wadman has been deeply in love with my brother Toby for many years and has used every art and circumvention of woman to outwit him into the same passion yet now that she has caught him her fever will be pass d its height
3699_19401_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 She has gained her point 
none	none	In this case continued my father which Plato I am persuaded never thought of Love you see is not so much a Sentiment as a Situation into which a man enters as my brother Toby would do into a corps no matter whether he loves the service or no being once in it he acts as if he did and takes every step to shew himself a man of prowesse 
3699_19401_000013_000000	train-clean-100	The hypothesis like the rest of my father s was plausible enough and my uncle Toby had but a single word to object to it in which Trim stood ready to second him but my father had not drawn his conclusion 
none	none	For this reason continued my father stating the case over again notwithstanding all the world knows that missus Wadman affects my brother Toby and my brother Toby contrariwise affects missus Wadman and no obstacle in nature to forbid the music striking up this very night yet will I answer for it that this self same tune will not be play d this twelvemonth We have taken our measures badly quoth my uncle Toby looking up interrogatively in Trim s face I would lay my Montero cap said Trim Now Trim s Montero cap as I once told you was his constant wager and having furbish d it up that very night in order to go upon the attack it made the odds look more considerable I would lay an please your honour my Montero cap to a shilling was it proper continued Trim making a bow to offer a wager before your honours There is nothing improper in it said my father tis a mode of expression for in saying thou would saint lay thy Montero cap to a shilling all thou meanest is this that thou believest
3699_19401_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Now What do saint thou believe

none	none	Avoid all kinds of pleasantry and facetiousness in thy discourse with her and do whatever lies in thy power at the same time to keep her from all books and writings which tend thereto there are some devotional tracts which if thou canst entice her to read over it will be well but suffer her not to look into Rabelais or Scarron or Don Quixote
3699_19401_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 They are all books which excite laughter and thou knowest dear Toby that there is no passion so serious as lust

3699_19401_000046_000001	train-clean-100	As the turning of the thin scarlet breeches was laid aside at least for the present there was nothing which should put it off beyond the next morning so accordingly it was resolv d upon for eleven o clock 
none	none	Come my dear said my father to my mother twill be but like a brother and sister if you and I take a walk down to my brother Toby s to countenance him in this attack of his My uncle Toby and the corporal had been accoutred both some time when my father and mother enter d and the clock striking eleven were that moment in motion to sally forth but the account of this is worth more than to be wove into the fag end of the eighth Alluding to the first edition volume of such a work as this My father had no time but to put the letter of instructions into my uncle Toby s coat pocket and join with my mother in wishing his attack prosperous 
3699_19401_000049_000000	train-clean-100	I could like said my mother to look through the key hole out of curiosity Call it by its right name my dear quoth my father 
none	none	And look through the key hole as long as you will Chapter four LX I call all the powers of time and chance which severally check us in our careers in this world to bear me witness that I could never yet get fairly to my uncle Toby s amours till this very moment that my mother s curiosity as she stated the affair or a different impulse in her as my father would have it wished her to take a peep at them through the key hole Call it my dear by its right name quoth my father and look through the key hole as long as you will Nothing but the fermentation of that little subacid humour which I have often spoken of in my father s habit could have vented such an insinuation he was however frank and generous in his nature and at all times open to conviction so that he had scarce got to the last word of this ungracious retort when his conscience smote him My mother was then conjugally swinging with her left arm twisted under his right in such wise that the inside of her hand rested upon the back of his she raised her fingers and let them fall it could scarce be call d a tap or if it was a tap twould have puzzled a casuist to say whether twas a tap of remonstrance or a tap of confession my father who was all sensibilities from head to foot class d it right Conscience redoubled her blow he turn d his face suddenly the other way and my mother supposing his body was about to turn with it in order to move homewards by a cross movement of her right leg keeping her left as its centre brought herself so far in front that as he turned his head he met her eye Confusion again he saw a thousand reasons to wipe out the reproach and as many to reproach himself a thin blue chill pellucid chrystal with all its humours so at rest the least mote or speck of desire might have been seen at the bottom of it had it existed it did not and how I happen to be so lewd myself particularly a little before the vernal and autumnal equinoxes Heaven above knows My mother madam was so at no time either by nature by institution or example 
3699_19402_000007_000000	train-clean-100	A temperate current of blood ran orderly through her veins in all months of the year and in all critical moments both of the day and night alike nor did she superinduce the least heat into her humours from the manual effervescencies of devotional tracts which having little or no meaning in them nature is oft times obliged to find one And as for my father s example 
none	none	twas so far from being either aiding or abetting thereunto that twas the whole business of his life to keep all fancies of that kind out of her head Nature had done her part to have spared him this trouble and what was not a little inconsistent my father knew it And here am I sitting this twelfth day of August seventeen sixty six in a purple jerkin and yellow pair of slippers without either wig or cap on a most tragicomical completion of his prediction That I should neither think nor act like any other man s child upon that very account 
3699_19402_000008_000000	train-clean-100	The mistake in my father was in attacking my mother s motive instead of the act itself for certainly key holes were made for other purposes and considering the act as an act which interfered with a true proposition and denied a key hole to be what it was it became a violation of nature and was so far you see criminal 
3699_19402_000009_000000	train-clean-100	It is for this reason an please your Reverences That key holes are the occasions of more sin and wickedness than all other holes in this world put together 
none	none	which leads me to my uncle Toby s amours Chapter four LXI Though the corporal had been as good as his word in putting my uncle Toby s great ramallie wig into pipes yet the time was too short to produce any great effects from it it had lain many years squeezed up in the corner of his old campaign trunk and as bad forms are not so easy to be got the better of and the use of candle ends not so well understood it was not so pliable a business as one would have wished The corporal with cheary eye and both arms extended had fallen back perpendicular from it a score times to inspire it if possible with a better air had Spleen given a look at it twould have cost her ladyship a smile it curl d every where but where the corporal would have it and where a buckle or two in his opinion would have done it honour he could as soon have raised the dead Such it was or rather such would it have seem d upon any other brow but the sweet look of goodness which sat upon my uncle Toby s assimilated every thing around it so sovereignly to itself and Nature had moreover wrote Gentleman with so fair a hand in every line of his countenance that even his tarnish d gold laced hat and huge cockade of flimsy taffeta became him and though not worth a button in themselves yet the moment my uncle Toby put them on they became serious objects and altogether seem d to have been picked up by the hand of Science to set him off to advantage Nothing in this world could have company operated more powerfully towards this than my uncle Toby s blue and gold had not Quantity in some measure been necessary to Grace in a period of fifteen or sixteen years since they had been made by a total inactivity in my uncle Toby s life for he seldom went further than the bowling green his blue and gold had become so miserably too straight for him that it was with the utmost difficulty the corporal was able to get him into them the taking them up at the sleeves was of no advantage They were laced however down the back and at the seams of the sides c in the mode of King William s reign and to shorten all description they shone so bright against the sun that morning and had so metallick and doughty an air with them that had my uncle Toby thought of attacking in armour nothing could have so well imposed upon his imagination 
3699_19402_000015_000000	train-clean-100	As for the thin scarlet breeches they had been unripp d by the taylor between the legs and left at sixes and sevens 
none	none	Yes Madam but let us govern our fancies 
3699_19402_000016_000001	train-clean-100	It is enough they were held impracticable the night before and as there was no alternative in my uncle Toby s wardrobe he sallied forth in the red plush 
none	none	The corporal had array d himself in poor Le Fever s regimental coat and with his hair tuck d up under his Montero cap which he had furbish d up for the occasion march d three paces distant from his master a whiff of military pride had puff d out his shirt at the wrist and upon that in a black leather thong clipp d into a tassel beyond the knot hung the corporal s stick my uncle Toby carried his cane like a pike

3699_19402_000020_000000	train-clean-100	My uncle Toby turn d his head more than once behind him to see how he was supported by the corporal and the corporal as oft as he did it gave a slight flourish with his stick but not vapouringly and with the sweetest accent of most respectful encouragement bid his honour never fear 
none	none	Now my uncle Toby did fear and grievously too he knew not as my father had reproach d him so much as the right end of a Woman from the wrong and therefore was never altogether at his ease near any one of them unless in sorrow or distress then infinite was his pity nor would the most courteous knight of romance have gone further at least upon one leg to have wiped away a tear from a woman s eye and yet excepting once that he was beguiled into it by missus Wadman he had never looked stedfastly into one and would often tell my father in the simplicity of his heart that it was almost if not about as bad as taking bawdy And suppose it is my father would say Chapter four LXIII 
3699_19402_000024_000000	train-clean-100	She cannot quoth my uncle Toby halting when they had march d up to within twenty paces of missus Wadman s door she cannot corporal take it amiss 
none	none	She will take it an please your honour said the corporal just as the Jew s widow at Lisbon took it of my brother Tom And how was that 
3699_19402_000026_000001	train-clean-100	quoth my uncle Toby facing quite about to the corporal 
none	none	Your honour replied the corporal knows of Tom s misfortunes but this affair has nothing to do with them any further than this That if Tom had not married the widow or had it pleased God after their marriage that they had but put pork into their sausages the honest soul had never been taken out of his warm bed and dragg d to the inquisition Tis a cursed place added the corporal shaking his head when once a poor creature is in he is in an please your honour for ever Tis very true said my uncle Toby looking gravely at missus Wadman s house as he spoke Nothing continued the corporal can be so sad as confinement for life or so sweet an please your honour as liberty Nothing Trim said my uncle Toby musing Whilst a man is free cried the corporal giving a flourish with his stick thus squiggly line diagonally across the page A thousand of my father s most subtle syllogisms could not have said more for celibacy 
3699_19402_000034_000000	train-clean-100	My uncle Toby look d earnestly towards his cottage and his bowling green 
none	none	The corporal had unwarily conjured up the Spirit of calculation with his wand and he had nothing to do but to conjure him down again with his story and in this form of Exorcism most un ecclesiastically did the corporal do it Chapter four LXIV As Tom s place an please your honour was easy and the weather warm it put him upon thinking seriously of settling himself in the world and as it fell out about that time that a Jew who kept a sausage shop in the same street had the ill luck to die of a strangury and leave his widow in possession of a rousing trade Tom thought as every body in Lisbon was doing the best he could devise for himself there could be no harm in offering her his service to carry it on so without any introduction to the widow except that of buying a pound of sausages at her shop Tom set out counting the matter thus within himself as he walk d along that let the worst come of it that could he should at least get a pound of sausages for their worth but if things went well he should be set up inasmuch as he should get not only a pound of sausages but a wife and a sausage shop an please your honour into the bargain Every servant in the family from high to low wish d Tom success and I can fancy an please your honour I see him this moment with his white dimity waist coat and breeches and hat a little o one side passing jollily along the street swinging his stick with a smile and a chearful word for every body he met But alas Tom thou smilest no more cried the corporal looking on one side of him upon the ground as if he apostrophised him in his dungeon Poor fellow said my uncle Toby feelingly He was an honest light hearted lad an please your honour as ever blood warm d Then he resembled thee Trim said my uncle Toby rapidly The corporal blush d down to his fingers ends a tear of sentimental bashfulness another of gratitude to my uncle Toby and a tear of sorrow for his brother s misfortunes started into his eye and ran sweetly down his cheek together my uncle Toby s kindled as one lamp does at another and taking hold of the breast of Trim s coat which had been that of Le Fever s as if to ease his lame leg but in reality to gratify a finer feeling he stood silent for a minute and a half at the end of which he took his hand away and the corporal making a bow went on with his story of his brother and the Jew s widow Chapter four LXV When Tom an please your honour got to the shop there was nobody in it but a poor negro girl with a bunch of white feathers slightly tied to the end of a long cane flapping away flies not killing them Tis a pretty picture said my uncle Toby she had suffered persecution Trim and had learnt mercy She was good an please your honour from nature as well as from hardships and there are circumstances in the story of that poor friendless slut that would melt a heart of stone said Trim and some dismal winter s evening when your honour is in the humour they shall be told you with the rest of Tom s story for it makes a part of it Then do not forget Trim said my uncle Toby A negro has a soul an please your honour said the corporal doubtingly I am not much versed corporal quoth my uncle Toby in things of that kind but I suppose God would not leave him without one any more than thee or me It would be putting one sadly over the head of another quoth the corporal It would so said my uncle Toby Why then an please your honour is a black wench to be used worse than a white one I can give no reason said my uncle Toby Only cried the corporal shaking his head because she has no one to stand up for her Tis that very thing Trim quoth my uncle Toby which recommends her to protection and her brethren with her tis the fortune of war which has put the whip into our hands now where it may be hereafter heaven knows but be it where it will the brave Trim will not use it unkindly God forbid said the corporal Amen responded my uncle Toby laying his hand upon his heart The corporal returned to his story and went on but with an embarrassment in doing it which here and there a reader in this world will not be able to comprehend for by the many sudden transitions all along from one kind and cordial passion to another in getting thus far on his way he had lost the sportable key of his voice which gave sense and spirit to his tale he attempted twice to resume it but could not please himself so giving a stout hem to rally back the retreating spirits and aiding nature at the same time with his left arm a kimbo on one side and with his right a little extended supporting her on the other the corporal got as near the note as he could and in that attitude continued his story Chapter four LXVI As Tom an please your honour had no business at that time with the Moorish girl he passed on into the room beyond to talk to the Jew s widow about love and this pound of sausages and being as I have told your honour an open cheary hearted lad with his character wrote in his looks and carriage he took a chair and without much apology but with great civility at the same time placed it close to her at the table and sat down There is nothing so awkward as courting a woman an please your honour whilst she is making sausages So Tom began a discourse upon them first gravely as how they were made with what meats herbs and spices Then a little gayly as With what skins and if they never burst Whether the largest were not the best and so on taking care only as he went along to season what he had to say upon sausages rather under than over that he might have room to act in It was owing to the neglect of that very precaution said my uncle Toby laying his hand upon Trim s shoulder that Count De la Motte lost the battle of Wynendale he pressed too speedily into the wood which if he had not done Lisle had not fallen into our hands nor Ghent and Bruges which both followed her example it was so late in the year continued my uncle Toby and so terrible a season came on that if things had not fallen out as they did our troops must have perish d in the open field Why therefore may not battles an please your honour as well as marriages be made in heaven my uncle Toby mused Religion inclined him to say one thing and his high idea of military skill tempted him to say another so not being able to frame a reply exactly to his mind my uncle Toby said nothing at all and the corporal finished his story As Tom perceived an please your honour that he gained ground and that all he had said upon the subject of sausages was kindly taken he went on to help her a little in making them First by taking hold of the ring of the sausage whilst she stroked the forced meat down with her hand then by cutting the strings into proper lengths and holding them in his hand whilst she took them out one by one then by putting them across her mouth that she might take them out as she wanted them and so on from little to more till at last he adventured to tie the sausage himself whilst she held the snout Now a widow an please your honour always chuses a second husband as unlike the first as she can so the affair was more than half settled in her mind before Tom mentioned it She made a feint however of defending herself by snatching up a sausage Tom instantly laid hold of another But seeing Tom s had more gristle in it She signed the capitulation and Tom sealed it and there was an end of the matter Chapter four LXVII All womankind continued Trim commenting upon his story from the highest to the lowest an please your honour love jokes the difficulty is to know how they chuse to have them cut and there is no knowing that but by trying as we do with our artillery in the field by raising or letting down their breeches till we hit the mark I like the comparison said my uncle Toby better than the thing itself Because your honour quoth the corporal loves glory more than pleasure I hope Trim answered my uncle Toby I love mankind more than either and as the knowledge of arms tends so apparently to the good and quiet of the world and particularly that branch of it which we have practised together in our bowling green has no object but to shorten the strides of Ambition and intrench the lives and fortunes of the few from the plunderings of the many whenever that drum beats in our ears I trust corporal we shall neither of us want so much humanity and fellow feeling as to face about and march In pronouncing this my uncle Toby faced about and march d firmly as at the head of his company and the faithful corporal shouldering his stick and striking his hand upon his coat skirt as he took his first step march d close behind him down the avenue Now what can their two noddles be about cried my father to my mother by all that s strange they are besieging missus Wadman in form and are marching round her house to mark out the lines of circumvallation I dare say quoth my mother But stop dear Sir for what my mother dared to say upon the occasion and what my father did say upon it with her replies and his rejoinders shall be read perused paraphrased commented and descanted upon or to say it all in a word shall be thumb d over by Posterity in a chapter apart I say by Posterity and care not if I repeat the word again for what has this book done more than the Legation of Moses or the Tale of a Tub that it may not swim down the gutter of Time along with them I will not argue the matter Time wastes too fast every letter I trace tells me with what rapidity Life follows my pen the days and hours of it more precious my dear Jenny than the rubies about thy neck are flying over our heads like light clouds of a windy day never to return more every thing presses on whilst thou art twisting that lock see it grows grey and every time I kiss thy hand to bid adieu and every absence which follows it are preludes to that eternal separation which we are shortly to make Heaven have mercy upon us both Chapter four LXVIII Now for what the world thinks of that ejaculation I would not give a groat Chapter four LXIX My mother had gone with her left arm twisted in my father s right till they had got to the fatal angle of the old garden wall where Doctor Slop was overthrown by Obadiah on the coach horse as this was directly opposite to the front of missus Wadman s house when my father came to it he gave a look across and seeing my uncle Toby and the corporal within ten paces of the door he turn d about Let us just stop a moment quoth my father and see with what ceremonies my brother Toby and his man Trim make their first entry it will not detain us added my father a single minute No matter if it be ten minutes quoth my mother It will not detain us half one said my father The corporal was just then setting in with the story of his brother Tom and the Jew s widow the story went on and on it had episodes in it it came back and went on and on again there was no end of it the reader found it very long G help my father he pish d fifty times at every new attitude and gave the corporal s stick with all its flourishings and danglings to as many devils as chose to accept of them When issues of events like these my father is waiting for are hanging in the scales of fate the mind has the advantage of changing the principle of expectation three times without which it would not have power to see it out Curiosity governs the first moment and the second moment is all oeconomy to justify the expence of the first and for the third fourth fifth and sixth moments and so on to the day of judgment tis a point of Honour I need not be told that the ethic writers have assigned this all to Patience but that Virtue methinks has extent of dominion sufficient of her own and enough to do in it without invading the few dismantled castles which Honour has left him upon the earth My father stood it out as well as he could with these three auxiliaries to the end of Trim s story and from thence to the end of my uncle Toby s panegyrick upon arms in the chapter following it when seeing that instead of marching up to missus Wadman s door they both faced about and march d down the avenue diametrically opposite to his expectation he broke out at once with that little subacid soreness of humour which in certain situations distinguished his character from that of all other men Chapter four LXX Now what can their two noddles be about cried my father c I dare say said my mother they are making fortifications Not on missus Wadman s premises cried my father stepping back I suppose not quoth my mother I wish said my father raising his voice the whole science of fortification at the devil with all its trumpery of saps mines blinds gabions fausse brays and cuvetts They are foolish things said my mother Now she had a way which by the bye I would this moment give away my purple jerkin and my yellow slippers into the bargain if some of your reverences would imitate and that was never to refuse her assent and consent to any proposition my father laid before her merely because she did not understand it or had no ideas of the principal word or term of art upon which the tenet or proposition rolled She contented herself with doing all that her godfathers and godmothers promised for her but no more and so would go on using a hard word twenty years together and replying to it too if it was a verb in all its moods and tenses without giving herself any trouble to enquire about it This was an eternal source of misery to my father and broke the neck at the first setting out of more good dialogues between them than could have done the most petulant contradiction the few which survived were the better for the cuvetts They are foolish things said my mother Particularly the cuvetts replied my father Tis enough he tasted the sweet of triumph and went on Not that they are properly speaking missus Wadman s premises said my father partly correcting himself because she is but tenant for life That makes a great difference said my mother In a fool s head replied my father Unless she should happen to have a child said my mother But she must persuade my brother Toby first to get her one To be sure mister Shandy quoth my mother Though if it comes to persuasion said my father Lord have mercy upon them Amen said my mother piano Amen cried my father fortissime Amen said my mother again but with such a sighing cadence of personal pity at the end of it as discomfited every fibre about my father he instantly took out his almanack but before he could untie it Yorick s congregation coming out of church became a full answer to one half of his business with it and my mother telling him it was a sacrament day left him as little in doubt as to the other part He put his almanack into his pocket The first Lord of the Treasury thinking of ways and means could not have returned home with a more embarrassed look Chapter four LXXI Upon looking back from the end of the last chapter and surveying the texture of what has been wrote it is necessary that upon this page and the three following a good quantity of heterogeneous matter be inserted to keep up that just balance betwixt wisdom and folly without which a book would not hold together a single year nor is it a poor creeping digression which but for the name of a man might continue as well going on in the king s highway which will do the business no if it is to be a digression it must be a good frisky one and upon a frisky subject too where neither the horse or his rider are to be caught but by rebound The only difficulty is raising powers suitable to the nature of the service Fancy is capricious Wit must not be searched for and Pleasantry good natured slut as she is will not come in at a call was an empire to be laid at her feet The best way for a man is to say his prayers Only if it puts him in mind of his infirmities and defects as well ghostly as bodily for that purpose he will find himself rather worse after he has said them than before for other purposes better For my own part there is not a way either moral or mechanical under heaven that I could think of which I have not taken with myself in this case sometimes by addressing myself directly to the soul herself and arguing the point over and over again with her upon the extent of her own faculties I never could make them an inch the wider Then by changing my system and trying what could be made of it upon the body by temperance soberness and chastity These are good quoth I in themselves they are good absolutely they are good relatively they are good for health they are good for happiness in this world they are good for happiness in the next In short they were good for every thing but the thing wanted and there they were good for nothing but to leave the soul just as heaven made it as for the theological virtues of faith and hope they give it courage but then that snivelling virtue of Meekness as my father would always call it takes it quite away again so you are exactly where you started Now in all common and ordinary cases there is nothing which I have found to answer so well as this Certainly if there is any dependence upon Logic and that I am not blinded by self love there must be something of true genius about me merely upon this symptom of it that I do not know what envy is for never do I hit upon any invention or device which tendeth to the furtherance of good writing but I instantly make it public willing that all mankind should write as well as myself Which they certainly will when they think as little Chapter four LXXII Now in ordinary cases that is when I am only stupid and the thoughts rise heavily and pass gummous through my pen Or that I am got I know not how into a cold unmetaphorical vein of infamous writing and cannot take a plumb lift out of it for my soul so must be obliged to go on writing like a Dutch commentator to the end of the chapter unless something be done I never stand conferring with pen and ink one moment for if a pinch of snuff or a stride or two across the room will not do the business for me I take a razor at once and having tried the edge of it upon the palm of my hand without further ceremony except that of first lathering my beard I shave it off taking care only if I do leave a hair that it be not a grey one this done I change my shirt put on a better coat send for my last wig put my topaz ring upon my finger and in a word dress myself from one end to the other of me after my best fashion Now the devil in hell must be in it if this does not do for consider Sir as every man chuses to be present at the shaving of his own beard though there is no rule without an exception and unavoidably sits over against himself the whole time it is doing in case he has a hand in it the Situation like all others has notions of her own to put into the brain I maintain it the conceits of a rough bearded man are seven years more terse and juvenile for one single operation and if they did not run a risk of being quite shaved away might be carried up by continual shavings to the highest pitch of sublimity How Homer could write with so long a beard I don t know and as it makes against my hypothesis I as little care But let us return to the Toilet Ludovicus Sorbonensis makes this entirely an affair of the body Greek as he calls it but he is deceived the soul and body are joint sharers in every thing they get A man cannot dress but his ideas get cloth d at the same time and if he dresses like a gentleman every one of them stands presented to his imagination genteelized along with him so that he has nothing to do but take his pen and write like himself For this cause when your honours and reverences would know whether I writ clean and fit to be read you will be able to judge full as well by looking into my Laundress s bill as my book there is one single month in which I can make it appear that I dirtied one and thirty shirts with clean writing and after all was more abus d cursed criticis d and confounded and had more mystic heads shaken at me for what I had wrote in that one month than in all the other months of that year put together But their honours and reverences had not seen my bills Chapter four LXXIII As I never had any intention of beginning the Digression I am making all this preparation for till I come to the seventy fourth chapter I have this chapter to put to whatever use I think proper I have twenty this moment ready for it I could write my chapter of Button holes in it Or my chapter of Pishes which should follow them Or my chapter of Knots in case their reverences have done with them they might lead me into mischief the safest way is to follow the track of the learned and raise objections against what I have been writing tho I declare before hand I know no more than my heels how to answer them And first it may be said there is a pelting kind of thersitical satire as black as the very ink tis wrote with and by the bye whoever says so is indebted to the muster master general of the Grecian army for suffering the name of so ugly and foul mouth d a man as Thersites to continue upon his roll for it has furnish d him with an epithet in these productions he will urge all the personal washings and scrubbings upon earth do a sinking genius no sort of good but just the contrary inasmuch as the dirtier the fellow is the better generally he succeeds in it To this I have no other answer at least ready but that the Archbishop of Benevento wrote his nasty Romance of the Galatea as all the world knows in a purple coat waistcoat and purple pair of breeches and that the penance set him of writing a commentary upon the book of the Revelations as severe as it was look d upon by one part of the world was far from being deem d so by the other upon the single account of that Investment Another objection to all this remedy is its want of universality forasmuch as the shaving part of it upon which so much stress is laid by an unalterable law of nature excludes one half of the species entirely from its use all I can say is that female writers whether of England or of France must e en go without it As for the Spanish ladies I am in no sort of distress Chapter four LXXIV The seventy fourth chapter is come at last and brings nothing with it but a sad signature of How our pleasures slip from under us in this world For in talking of my digression I declare before heaven I have made it What a strange creature is mortal man said she Tis very true said I but twere better to get all these things out of our heads and return to my uncle Toby Chapter four LXXV When my uncle Toby and the corporal had marched down to the bottom of the avenue they recollected their business lay the other way so they faced about and marched up straight to missus Wadman s door I warrant your honour said the corporal touching his Montero cap with his hand as he passed him in order to give a knock at the door My uncle Toby contrary to his invariable way of treating his faithful servant said nothing good or bad the truth was he had not altogether marshal d his ideas he wish d for another conference and as the corporal was mounting up the three steps before the door he hem d twice a portion of my uncle Toby s most modest spirits fled at each expulsion towards the corporal he stood with the rapper of the door suspended for a full minute in his hand he scarce knew why Bridget stood perdue within with her finger and her thumb upon the latch benumb d with expectation and missus Wadman with an eye ready to be deflowered again sat breathless behind the window curtain of her bed chamber watching their approach Trim said my uncle Toby but as he articulated the word the minute expired and Trim let fall the rapper My uncle Toby perceiving that all hopes of a conference were knock d on the head by it whistled Lillabullero Chapter four LXXVI As missus Bridget s finger and thumb were upon the latch the corporal did not knock as often as perchance your honour s taylor I might have taken my example something nearer home for I owe mine some five and twenty pounds at least and wonder at the man s patience But this is nothing at all to the world only tis a cursed thing to be in debt and there seems to be a fatality in the exchequers of some poor princes particularly those of our house which no Economy can bind down in irons for my own part I m persuaded there is not any one prince prelate pope or potentate great or small upon earth more desirous in his heart of keeping straight with the world than I am or who takes more likely means for it I never give above half a guinea or walk with boots or cheapen tooth picks or lay out a shilling upon a band box the year round and for the six months I m in the country I m upon so small a scale that with all the good temper in the world I outdo Rousseau a bar length for I keep neither man or boy or horse or cow or dog or cat or any thing that can eat or drink except a thin poor piece of a Vestal to keep my fire in and who has generally as bad an appetite as myself but if you think this makes a philosopher of me I would not my good people give a rush for your judgments True philosophy but there is no treating the subject whilst my uncle is whistling Lillabullero Let us go into the house Chapter four LXXVII blank page Chapter four LXXVIII blank page Chapter four LXXIX two blank paragraphs You shall see the very place Madam said my uncle Toby missus Wadman blush d look d towards the door turn d pale blush d slightly again recover d her natural colour blush d worse than ever which for the sake of the unlearned reader I translate thus L d I cannot look at it What would the world say if I look d at it I should drop down if I look d at it I wish I could look at it There can be no sin in looking at it I will look at it Whilst all this was running through missus Wadman s imagination my uncle Toby had risen from the sopha and got to the other side of the parlour door to give Trim an order about it in the passage I believe it is in the garret said my uncle Toby I saw it there an please your honour this morning answered Trim Then prithee step directly for it Trim said my uncle Toby and bring it into the parlour The corporal did not approve of the orders but most cheerfully obeyed them The first was not an act of his will the second was so he put on his Montero cap and went as fast as his lame knee would let him My uncle Toby returned into the parlour and sat himself down again upon the sopha You shall lay your finger upon the place said my uncle Toby I will not touch it however quoth missus Wadman to herself This requires a second translation it shews what little knowledge is got by mere words we must go up to the first springs Now in order to clear up the mist which hangs upon these three pages I must endeavour to be as clear as possible myself Rub your hands thrice across your foreheads blow your noses cleanse your emunctories sneeze my good people God bless you Now give me all the help you can Chapter four LXXX As there are fifty different ends counting all ends in as well civil as religious for which a woman takes a husband the first sets about and carefully weighs then separates and distinguishes in her mind which of all that number of ends is hers then by discourse enquiry argumentation and inference she investigates and finds out whether she has got hold of the right one and if she has then by pulling it gently this way and that way she further forms a judgment whether it will not break in the drawing The imagery under which Slawkenbergius impresses this upon the reader s fancy in the beginning of his third Decad is so ludicrous that the honour I bear the sex will not suffer me to quote it otherwise it is not destitute of humour She first saith Slawkenbergius stops the asse and holding his halter in her left hand lest he should get away she thrusts her right hand into the very bottom of his pannier to search for it For what you ll not know the sooner quoth Slawkenbergius for interrupting me I have nothing good Lady but empty bottles says the asse I m loaded with tripes says the second And thou art little better quoth she to the third for nothing is there in thy panniers but trunk hose and pantofles and so to the fourth and fifth going on one by one through the whole string till coming to the asse which carries it she turns the pannier upside down looks at it considers it samples it measures it stretches it wets it dries it then takes her teeth both to the warp and weft of it Of what for the love of Christ I am determined answered Slawkenbergius that all the powers upon earth shall never wring that secret from my breast Chapter four LXXXI We live in a world beset on all sides with mysteries and riddles and so tis no matter else it seems strange that Nature who makes every thing so well to answer its destination and seldom or never errs unless for pastime in giving such forms and aptitudes to whatever passes through her hands that whether she designs for the plough the caravan the cart or whatever other creature she models be it but an asse s foal you are sure to have the thing you wanted and yet at the same time should so eternally bungle it as she does in making so simple a thing as a married man Whether it is in the choice of the clay or that it is frequently spoiled in the baking by an excess of which a husband may turn out too crusty you know on one hand or not enough so through defect of heat on the other or whether this great Artificer is not so attentive to the little Platonic exigences of that part of the species for whose use she is fabricating this or that her Ladyship sometimes scarce knows what sort of a husband will do I know not we will discourse about it after supper It is enough that neither the observation itself or the reasoning upon it are at all to the purpose but rather against it since with regard to my uncle Toby s fitness for the marriage state nothing was ever better she had formed him of the best and kindliest clay had temper d it with her own milk and breathed into it the sweetest spirit she had made him all gentle generous and humane she had filled his heart with trust and confidence and disposed every passage which led to it for the communication of the tenderest offices she had moreover considered the other causes for which matrimony was ordained And accordingly The Donation was not defeated by my uncle Toby s wound Now this last article was somewhat apocryphal and the Devil who is the great disturber of our faiths in this world had raised scruples in missus Wadman s brain about it and like a true devil as he was had done his own work at the same time by turning my uncle Toby s Virtue thereupon into nothing but empty bottles tripes trunk hose and pantofles Chapter four LXXXII missus Bridget had pawn d all the little stock of honour a poor chamber maid was worth in the world that she would get to the bottom of the affair in ten days and it was built upon one of the most concessible postulata in nature namely that whilst my uncle Toby was making love to her mistress the corporal could find nothing better to do than make love to her And I ll let him as much as he will said Bridget to get it out of him Friendship has two garments an outer and an under one Bridget was serving her mistress s interests in the one and doing the thing which most pleased herself in the other so had as many stakes depending upon my uncle Toby s wound as the Devil himself missus Wadman had but one and as it possibly might be her last without discouraging missus Bridget or discrediting her talents was determined to play her cards herself She wanted not encouragement a child might have look d into his hand there was such a plainness and simplicity in his playing out what trumps he had with such an unmistrusting ignorance of the ten ace and so naked and defenceless did he sit upon the same sopha with widow Wadman that a generous heart would have wept to have won the game of him Let us drop the metaphor Chapter four LXXXIII And the story too if you please for though I have all along been hastening towards this part of it with so much earnest desire as well knowing it to be the choicest morsel of what I had to offer to the world yet now that I am got to it any one is welcome to take my pen and go on with the story for me that will I see the difficulties of the descriptions I m going to give and feel my want of powers It is one comfort at least to me that I lost some fourscore ounces of blood this week in a most uncritical fever which attacked me at the beginning of this chapter so that I have still some hopes remaining it may be more in the serous or globular parts of the blood than in the subtile aura of the brain be it which it will an Invocation can do no hurt and I leave the affair entirely to the invoked to inspire or to inject me according as he sees good The Invocation Gentle Spirit of sweetest humour who erst did sit upon the easy pen of my beloved Cervantes Thou who glidedst daily through his lattice and turned saint the twilight of his prison into noon day brightness by thy presence tinged saint his little urn of water with heaven sent nectar and all the time he wrote of Sancho and his master didst cast thy mystic mantle o er his wither d stump He lost his hand at the battle of Lepanto and wide extended it to all the evils of his life Turn in hither I beseech thee behold these breeches they are all I have in world that piteous rent was given them at Lyons My shirts see what a deadly schism has happen d amongst em for the laps are in Lombardy and the rest of em here I never had but six and a cunning gypsey of a laundress at Milan cut me off the fore laps of five To do her justice she did it with some consideration for I was returning out of Italy And yet notwithstanding all this and a pistol tinder box which was moreover filch d from me at Sienna and twice that I pay d five Pauls for two hard eggs once at Raddicoffini and a second time at Capua I do not think a journey through France and Italy provided a man keeps his temper all the way so bad a thing as some people would make you believe there must be ups and downs or how the duce should we get into vallies where Nature spreads so many tables of entertainment Tis nonsense to imagine they will lend you their voitures to be shaken to pieces for nothing and unless you pay twelve sous for greasing your wheels how should the poor peasant get butter to his bread We really expect too much and for the livre or two above par for your suppers and bed at the most they are but one shilling and ninepence halfpenny who would embroil their philosophy for it for heaven s and for your own sake pay it pay it with both hands open rather than leave Disappointment sitting drooping upon the eye of your fair Hostess and her Damsels in the gate way at your departure and besides my dear Sir you get a sisterly kiss of each of em worth a pound at least I did For my uncle Toby s amours running all the way in my head they had the same effect upon me as if they had been my own I was in the most perfect state of bounty and good will and felt the kindliest harmony vibrating within me with every oscillation of the chaise alike so that whether the roads were rough or smooth it made no difference every thing I saw or had to do with touch d upon some secret spring either of sentiment or rapture They were the sweetest notes I ever heard and I instantly let down the fore glass to hear them more distinctly Tis Maria said the postillion observing I was listening Poor Maria continued he leaning his body on one side to let me see her for he was in a line betwixt us is sitting upon a bank playing her vespers upon her pipe with her little goat beside her The young fellow utter d this with an accent and a look so perfectly in tune to a feeling heart that I instantly made a vow I would give him a four and twenty sous piece when I got to Moulins And who is poor Maria said I The love and piety of all the villages around us said the postillion it is but three years ago that the sun did not shine upon so fair so quick witted and amiable a maid and better fate did Maria deserve than to have her Banns forbid by the intrigues of the curate of the parish who published them He was going on when Maria who had made a short pause put the pipe to her mouth and began the air again they were the same notes yet were ten times sweeter It is the evening service to the Virgin said the young man but who has taught her to play it or how she came by her pipe no one knows we think that heaven has assisted her in both for ever since she has been unsettled in her mind it seems her only consolation she has never once had the pipe out of her hand but plays that service upon it almost night and day The postillion delivered this with so much discretion and natural eloquence that I could not help decyphering something in his face above his condition and should have sifted out his history had not poor Maria taken such full possession of me We had got up by this time almost to the bank where Maria was sitting she was in a thin white jacket with her hair all but two tresses drawn up into a silk net with a few olive leaves twisted a little fantastically on one side she was beautiful and if ever I felt the full force of an honest heart ache it was the moment I saw her God help her poor damsel above a hundred masses said the postillion have been said in the several parish churches and convents around for her but without effect we have still hopes as she is sensible for short intervals that the Virgin at last will restore her to herself but her parents who know her best are hopeless upon that score and think her senses are lost for ever As the postillion spoke this Maria made a cadence so melancholy so tender and querulous that I sprung out of the chaise to help her and found myself sitting betwixt her and her goat before I relapsed from my enthusiasm Maria look d wistfully for some time at me and then at her goat and then at me and then at her goat again and so on alternately Well Maria said I softly What resemblance do you find I do entreat the candid reader to believe me that it was from the humblest conviction of what a Beast man is that I asked the question and that I would not have let fallen an unseasonable pleasantry in the venerable presence of Misery to be entitled to all the wit that ever Rabelais scatter d and yet I own my heart smote me and that I so smarted at the very idea of it that I swore I would set up for Wisdom and utter grave sentences the rest of my days and never never attempt again to commit mirth with man woman or child the longest day I had to live As for writing nonsense to them I believe there was a reserve but that I leave to the world Adieu Maria adieu poor hapless damsel some time but not now I may hear thy sorrows from thy own lips but I was deceived for that moment she took her pipe and told me such a tale of woe with it that I rose up and with broken and irregular steps walk d softly to my chaise What an excellent inn at Moulins Chapter four LXXXIV When we have got to the end of this chapter but not before we must all turn back to the two blank chapters on the account of which my honour has lain bleeding this half hour I stop it by pulling off one of my yellow slippers and throwing it with all my violence to the opposite side of my room with a declaration at the heel of it That whatever resemblance it may bear to half the chapters which are written in the world or for aught I know may be now writing in it that it was as casual as the foam of Zeuxis his horse besides I look upon a chapter which has only nothing in it with respect and considering what worse things there are in the world That it is no way a proper subject for satire Why then was it left so And here without staying for my reply shall I be called as many blockheads numsculs doddypoles dunderheads ninny hammers goosecaps joltheads nincompoops and sh t a beds and other unsavoury appellations as ever the cake bakers of Lerne cast in the teeth of King Garangantan s shepherds And I ll let them do it as Bridget said as much as they please for how was it possible they should foresee the necessity I was under of writing the eighty fourth chapter of my book before the seventy seventh c So I don t take it amiss All I wish is that it may be a lesson to the world to let people tell their stories their own way The Seventy seventh Chapter As missus Bridget opened the door before the corporal had well given the rap the interval betwixt that and my uncle Toby s introduction into the parlour was so short that missus Wadman had but just time to get from behind the curtain lay a Bible upon the table and advance a step or two towards the door to receive him My uncle Toby saluted missus Wadman after the manner in which women were saluted by men in the year of our Lord God one thousand seven hundred and thirteen then facing about he march d up abreast with her to the sopha and in three plain words though not before he was sat down nor after he was sat down but as he was sitting down told her he was in love so that my uncle Toby strained himself more in the declaration than he needed missus Wadman naturally looked down upon a slit she had been darning up in her apron in expectation every moment that my uncle Toby would go on but having no talents for amplification and Love moreover of all others being a subject of which he was the least a master When he had told missus Wadman once that he loved her he let it alone and left the matter to work after its own way My father was always in raptures with this system of my uncle Toby s as he falsely called it and would often say that could his brother Toby to his processe have added but a pipe of tobacco he had wherewithal to have found his way if there was faith in a Spanish proverb towards the hearts of half the women upon the globe My uncle Toby never understood what my father meant nor will I presume to extract more from it than a condemnation of an error which the bulk of the world lie under but the French every one of em to a man who believe in it almost as much as the Real Presence That talking of love is making it I would as soon set about making a black pudding by the same receipt Let us go on missus Wadman sat in expectation my uncle Toby would do so to almost the first pulsation of that minute wherein silence on one side or the other generally becomes indecent so edging herself a little more towards him and raising up her eyes sub blushing as she did it she took up the gauntlet or the discourse if you like it better and communed with my uncle Toby thus The cares and disquietudes of the marriage state quoth missus Wadman are very great I suppose so said my uncle Toby and therefore when a person continued missus Wadman is so much at his ease as you are so happy captain Shandy in yourself your friends and your amusements I wonder what reasons can incline you to the state They are written quoth my uncle Toby in the Common Prayer Book Thus far my uncle Toby went on warily and kept within his depth leaving missus Wadman to sail upon the gulph as she pleased As for children said missus Wadman though a principal end perhaps of the institution and the natural wish I suppose of every parent yet do not we all find they are certain sorrows and very uncertain comforts and what is there dear sir to pay one for the heart achs what compensation for the many tender and disquieting apprehensions of a suffering and defenceless mother who brings them into life I declare said my uncle Toby smit with pity I know of none unless it be the pleasure which it has pleased God A fiddlestick quoth she Chapter four the Seventy eighth Now there are such an infinitude of notes tunes cants chants airs looks and accents with which the word fiddlestick may be pronounced in all such causes as this every one of em impressing a sense and meaning as different from the other as dirt from cleanliness That Casuists for it is an affair of conscience on that score reckon up no less than fourteen thousand in which you may do either right or wrong missus Wadman hit upon the fiddlestick which summoned up all my uncle Toby s modest blood into his cheeks so feeling within himself that he had somehow or other got beyond his depth he stopt short and without entering further either into the pains or pleasures of matrimony he laid his hand upon his heart and made an offer to take them as they were and share them along with her When my uncle Toby had said this he did not care to say it again so casting his eye upon the Bible which missus Wadman had laid upon the table he took it up and popping dear soul upon a passage in it of all others the most interesting to him which was the siege of Jericho he set himself to read it over leaving his proposal of marriage as he had done his declaration of love to work with her after its own way Now it wrought neither as an astringent or a loosener nor like opium or bark or mercury or buckthorn or any one drug which nature had bestowed upon the world in short it work d not at all in her and the cause of that was that there was something working there before Babbler that I am I have anticipated what it was a dozen times but there is fire still in the subject allons Chapter four LXXXV It is natural for a perfect stranger who is going from London to Edinburgh to enquire before he sets out how many miles to York which is about the half way nor does any body wonder if he goes on and asks about the corporation c It was just as natural for missus Wadman whose first husband was all his time afflicted with a Sciatica to wish to know how far from the hip to the groin and how far she was likely to suffer more or less in her feelings in the one case than in the other She had accordingly read Drake s anatomy from one end to the other She had peeped into Wharton upon the brain and borrowed Graaf This must be a mistake in mister Shandy for Graaf wrote upon the pancreatick juice and the parts of generation upon the bones and muscles but could make nothing of it She had reason d likewise from her own powers laid down theorems drawn consequences and come to no conclusion To clear up all she had twice asked Doctor Slop if poor captain Shandy was ever likely to recover of his wound He is recovered Doctor Slop would say What quite Quite madam But what do you mean by a recovery missus Wadman would say Doctor Slop was the worst man alive at definitions and so missus Wadman could get no knowledge in short there was no way to extract it but from my uncle Toby himself There is an accent of humanity in an enquiry of this kind which lulls Suspicion to rest and I am half persuaded the serpent got pretty near it in his discourse with Eve for the propensity in the sex to be deceived could not be so great that she should have boldness to hold chat with the devil without it But there is an accent of humanity how shall I describe it tis an accent which covers the part with a garment and gives the enquirer a right to be as particular with it as your body surgeon Was it without remission Was it more tolerable in bed Could he lie on both sides alike with it Was he able to mount a horse Was motion bad for it et caetera were so tenderly spoke to and so directed towards my uncle Toby s heart that every item of them sunk ten times deeper into it than the evils themselves but when missus Wadman went round about by Namur to get at my uncle Toby s groin and engaged him to attack the point of the advanced counterscarp and pele mele with the Dutch to take the counterguard of saint Roch sword in hand and then with tender notes playing upon his ear led him all bleeding by the hand out of the trench wiping her eye as he was carried to his tent Heaven Earth Sea all was lifted up the springs of nature rose above their levels an angel of mercy sat besides him on the sopha his heart glow d with fire and had he been worth a thousand he had lost every heart of them to missus Wadman And whereabouts dear sir quoth missus Wadman a little categorically did you receive this sad blow In asking this question missus Wadman gave a slight glance towards the waistband of my uncle Toby s red plush breeches expecting naturally as the shortest reply to it that my uncle Toby would lay his fore finger upon the place It fell out otherwise for my uncle Toby having got his wound before the gate of saint Nicolas in one of the traverses of the trench opposite to the salient angle of the demibastion of saint Roch he could at any time stick a pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing when the stone struck him this struck instantly upon my uncle Toby s sensorium and with it struck his large map of the town and citadel of Namur and its environs which he had purchased and pasted down upon a board by the corporal s aid during his long illness it had lain with other military lumber in the garret ever since and accordingly the corporal was detached to the garret to fetch it My uncle Toby measured off thirty toises with missus Wadman s scissars from the returning angle before the gate of saint Nicolas and with such a virgin modesty laid her finger upon the place that the goddess of Decency if then in being if not twas her shade shook her head and with a finger wavering across her eyes forbid her to explain the mistake Unhappy missus Wadman For nothing can make this chapter go off with spirit but an apostrophe to thee but my heart tells me that in such a crisis an apostrophe is but an insult in disguise and ere I would offer one to a woman in distress let the chapter go to the devil provided any damn d critic in keeping will be but at the trouble to take it with him Chapter four LXXXVI My uncle Toby s Map is carried down into the kitchen Chapter four LXXXVII And here is the Maes and this is the Sambre said the corporal pointing with his right hand extended a little towards the map and his left upon missus Bridget s shoulder but not the shoulder next him and this said he is the town of Namur and this the citadel and there lay the French and here lay his honour and myself and in this cursed trench missus Bridget quoth the corporal taking her by the hand did he receive the wound which crush d him so miserably here In pronouncing which he slightly press d the back of her hand towards the part he felt for and let it fall We thought mister Trim it had been more in the middle said missus Bridget That would have undone us for ever said the corporal And left my poor mistress undone too said Bridget The corporal made no reply to the repartee but by giving missus Bridget a kiss Come come said Bridget holding the palm of her left hand parallel to the plane of the horizon and sliding the fingers of the other over it in a way which could not have been done had there been the least wart or protruberance Tis every syllable of it false cried the corporal before she had half finished the sentence I know it to be fact said Bridget from credible witnesses Upon my honour said the corporal laying his hand upon his heart and blushing as he spoke with honest resentment tis a story missus Bridget as false as hell Not said Bridget interrupting him that either I or my mistress care a halfpenny about it whether tis so or no only that when one is married one would chuse to have such a thing by one at least It was somewhat unfortunate for missus Bridget that she had begun the attack with her manual exercise for the corporal instantly Chapter four LXXXVIII It was like the momentary contest in the moist eye lids of an April morning Whether Bridget should laugh or cry She snatch d up a rolling pin twas ten to one she had laugh d She laid it down she cried and had one single tear of em but tasted of bitterness full sorrowful would the corporal s heart have been that he had used the argument but the corporal understood the sex a quart major to a terce at least better than my uncle Toby and accordingly he assailed missus Bridget after this manner I know missus Bridget said the corporal giving her a most respectful kiss that thou art good and modest by nature and art withal so generous a girl in thyself that if I know thee rightly thou would saint not wound an insect much less the honour of so gallant and worthy a soul as my master wast thou sure to be made a countess of but thou hast been set on and deluded dear Bridget as is often a woman s case to please others more than themselves Bridget s eyes poured down at the sensations the corporal excited Tell me tell me then my dear Bridget continued the corporal taking hold of her hand which hung down dead by her side and giving a second kiss whose suspicion has misled thee Bridget sobb d a sob or two then open d her eyes the corporal wiped em with the bottom of her apron she then open d her heart and told him all Chapter four LXXXIX My uncle Toby and the corporal had gone on separately with their operations the greatest part of the campaign and as effectually cut off from all communication of what either the one or the other had been doing as if they had been separated from each other by the Maes or the Sambre My uncle Toby on his side had presented himself every afternoon in his red and silver and blue and gold alternately and sustained an infinity of attacks in them without knowing them to be attacks and so had nothing to communicate The corporal on his side in taking Bridget by it had gain d considerable advantages and consequently had much to communicate but what were the advantages as well as what was the manner by which he had seiz d them required so nice an historian that the corporal durst not venture upon it and as sensible as he was of glory would rather have been contented to have gone bareheaded and without laurels for ever than torture his master s modesty for a single moment Best of honest and gallant servants But I have apostrophiz d thee Trim once before and could I apotheosize thee also that is to say with good company I would do it without ceremony in the very next page Chapter four XC Now my uncle Toby had one evening laid down his pipe upon the table and was counting over to himself upon his finger ends beginning at his thumb all missus Wadman s perfections one by one and happening two or three times together either by omitting some or counting others twice over to puzzle himself sadly before he could get beyond his middle finger Prithee Trim said he taking up his pipe again bring me a pen and ink Trim brought paper also Take a full sheet Trim said my uncle Toby making a sign with his pipe at the same time to take a chair and sit down close by him at the table The corporal obeyed placed the paper directly before him took a pen and dipp d it in the ink She has a thousand virtues Trim said my uncle Toby Am I to set them down an please your honour quoth the corporal But they must be taken in their ranks replied my uncle Toby for of them all Trim that which wins me most and which is a security for all the rest is the compassionate turn and singular humanity of her character I protest added my uncle Toby looking up as he protested it towards the top of the ceiling That was I her brother Trim a thousand fold she could not make more constant or more tender enquiries after my sufferings though now no more The corporal made no reply to my uncle Toby s protestation but by a short cough he dipp d the pen a second time into the inkhorn and my uncle Toby pointing with the end of his pipe as close to the top of the sheet at the left hand corner of it as he could get it the corporal wrote down the word HUMANITY thus Prithee corporal said my uncle Toby as soon as Trim had done it how often does missus Bridget enquire after the wound on the cap of thy knee which thou received saint at the battle of Landen She never an please your honour enquires after it at all That corporal said my uncle Toby with all the triumph the goodness of his nature would permit That shews the difference in the character of the mistress and maid had the fortune of war allotted the same mischance to me missus Wadman would have enquired into every circumstance relating to it a hundred times She would have enquired an please your honour ten times as often about your honour s groin The pain Trim is equally excruciating and Compassion has as much to do with the one as the other God bless your honour cried the corporal what has a woman s compassion to do with a wound upon the cap of a man s knee had your honour s been shot into ten thousand splinters at the affair of Landen missus Wadman would have troubled her head as little about it as Bridget because added the corporal lowering his voice and speaking very distinctly as he assigned his reason The knee is such a distance from the main body whereas the groin your honour knows is upon the very curtain of the place My uncle Toby gave a long whistle but in a note which could scarce be heard across the table The corporal had advanced too far to retire in three words he told the rest My uncle Toby laid down his pipe as gently upon the fender as if it had been spun from the unravellings of a spider s web Let us go to my brother Shandy s said he Chapter four XCI There will be just time whilst my uncle Toby and Trim are walking to my father s to inform you that missus Wadman had some moons before this made a confident of my mother and that missus Bridget who had the burden of her own as well as her mistress s secret to carry had got happily delivered of both to Susannah behind the garden wall As for my mother she saw nothing at all in it to make the least bustle about but Susannah was sufficient by herself for all the ends and purposes you could possibly have in exporting a family secret for she instantly imparted it by signs to Jonathan and Jonathan by tokens to the cook as she was basting a loin of mutton the cook sold it with some kitchen fat to the postillion for a groat who truck d it with the dairy maid for something of about the same value and though whisper d in the hay loft Fame caught the notes with her brazen trumpet and sounded them upon the house top In a word not an old woman in the village or five miles round who did not understand the difficulties of my uncle Toby s siege and what were the secret articles which had delayed the surrender My father whose way was to force every event in nature into an hypothesis by which means never man crucified Truth at the rate he did had but just heard of the report as my uncle Toby set out and catching fire suddenly at the trespass done his brother by it was demonstrating to Yorick notwithstanding my mother was sitting by not only That the devil was in women and that the whole of the affair was lust but that every evil and disorder in the world of what kind or nature soever from the first fall of Adam down to my uncle Toby s inclusive was owing one way or other to the same unruly appetite Yorick was just bringing my father s hypothesis to some temper when my uncle Toby entering the room with marks of infinite benevolence and forgiveness in his looks my father s eloquence re kindled against the passion and as he was not very nice in the choice of his words when he was wroth as soon as my uncle Toby was seated by the fire and had filled his pipe my father broke out in this manner Chapter four XCII That provision should be made for continuing the race of so great so exalted and godlike a Being as man I am far from denying but philosophy speaks freely of every thing and therefore I still think and do maintain it to be a pity that it should be done by means of a passion which bends down the faculties and turns all the wisdom contemplations and operations of the soul backwards a passion my dear continued my father addressing himself to my mother which couples and equals wise men with fools and makes us come out of our caverns and hiding places more like satyrs and four footed beasts than men I know it will be said continued my father availing himself of the Prolepsis that in itself and simply taken like hunger or thirst or sleep tis an affair neither good or bad or shameful or otherwise Why then did the delicacy of Diogenes and Plato so recalcitrate against it and wherefore when we go about to make and plant a man do we put out the candle and for what reason is it that all the parts thereof the congredients the preparations the instruments and whatever serves thereto are so held as to be conveyed to a cleanly mind by no language translation or periphrasis whatever The act of killing and destroying a man continued my father raising his voice and turning to my uncle Toby you see is glorious and the weapons by which we do it are honourable We march with them upon our shoulders We strut with them by our sides We gild them We carve them We in lay them We enrich them Nay if it be but a scoundrel cannon we cast an ornament upon the breach of it My uncle Toby laid down his pipe to intercede for a better epithet and Yorick was rising up to batter the whole hypothesis to pieces When Obadiah broke into the middle of the room with a complaint which cried out for an immediate hearing The case was this My father whether by ancient custom of the manor or as impropriator of the great tythes was obliged to keep a Bull for the service of the Parish and Obadiah had led his cow upon a pop visit to him one day or other the preceding summer I say one day or other because as chance would have it it was the day on which he was married to my father s house maid so one was a reckoning to the other Therefore when Obadiah s wife was brought to bed Obadiah thanked God Now said Obadiah I shall have a calf so Obadiah went daily to visit his cow She ll calve on Monday on Tuesday on Wednesday at the farthest The cow did not calve no she ll not calve till next week the cow put it off terribly till at the end of the sixth week Obadiah s suspicions like a good man s fell upon the Bull Now the parish being very large my father s Bull to speak the truth of him was no way equal to the department he had however got himself somehow or other thrust into employment and as he went through the business with a grave face my father had a high opinion of him Most of the townsmen an please your worship quoth Obadiah believe that tis all the Bull s fault But may not a cow be barren replied my father turning to Doctor Slop It never happens said doctor Slop but the man s wife may have come before her time naturally enough Prithee has the child hair upon his head added doctor Slop It is as hairy as I am said Obadiah Obadiah had not been shaved for three weeks Wheu u u cried my father beginning the sentence with an exclamatory whistle and so brother Toby this poor Bull of mine who is as good a Bull as ever p ss d and might have done for Europa herself in purer times had he but two legs less might have been driven into Doctors Commons and lost his character which to a Town Bull brother Toby is the very same thing as his life L d said my mother what is all this story about A Cock and a Bull said Yorick And one of the best of its kind I ever heard End of the Fourth Volume End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy
