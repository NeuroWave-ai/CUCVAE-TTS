BRINKER Produced by Ng E Ching HANS BRINKER OR THE SILVER SKATES By Mary Mapes Dodge To my father James J Mapes this book is dedicated in gratitude and love Preface This little work aims to combine the instructive features of a book of travels with the interest of a domestic tale Throughout its pages the descriptions of Dutch localities customs and general characteristics have been given with scrupulous care Many of its incidents are drawn from life and the story of Raff Brinker is founded strictly upon fact While acknowledging my obligations to many well known writers on Dutch history literature and art I turn with especial gratitude to those kind Holland friends who with generous zeal have taken many a backward glance at their country for my sake seeing it as it looked twenty years ago when the Brinker home stood unnoticed in sunlight and shadow Should this simple narrative serve to give my young readers a just idea of Holland and its resources or present true pictures of its inhabitants and their every day life or free them from certain current prejudices concerning that noble and enterprising people the leading desire in writing it will have been satisfied Should it cause even one heart to feel a deeper trust in God s goodness and love or aid any in weaving a life wherein through knots and entanglements the golden thread shall never be tarnished or broken the prayer with which it was begun and ended will have been answered M M D A LETTER FROM HOLLAND Amsterdam July thirty eighteen seventy three DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS AT HOME If you all could be here with me today what fine times we might have walking through this beautiful Dutch city How we should stare at the crooked houses standing with their gable ends to the street at the little slanting mirrors fastened outside of the windows at the wooden shoes and dogcarts nearby the windmills in the distance at the great warehouses at the canals doing the double duty of streets and rivers and at the singular mingling of trees and masts to be seen in every direction Ah it would be pleasant indeed But here I sit in a great hotel looking out upon all these things knowing quite well that not even the spirit of the Dutch which seems able to accomplish anything can bring you at this moment across the moment There is one comfort however in going through these wonderful Holland towns without you it would be dreadful to have any of the party tumble into the canals and then these lumbering Dutch wagons with their heavy wheels so very far apart what should I do if a few dozen of you were to fall under THEM And perhaps one of the wildest of my boys might harm a stork and then all Holland would be against us No It is better as it is You will be coming one by one as years go on to see the whole thing for yourselves Holland is as wonderful today as it was when more than twenty years ago Hans and Gretel skated on the frozen Y In fact more wonderful for every day increases the marvel of its not being washed away by the sea Its cities have grown and some of its peculiarities have been washed away by contact with other nations but it is Holland still and always will be full of oddity courage and industry the pluckiest little country on earth I shall not tell you in this letter of its customs its cities its palaces churches picture galleries and museums for these are described in the story except to say that they are here still just the same in this good year eighteen seventy three for I have seen them nearly all within a week Today an American boy and I seeing some children enter an old house in the business part of Amsterdam followed them in and what do you think we found An old woman here in the middle of summer selling hot water and fire She makes her living by it All day long she sits tending her great fires of peat and keeping the shining copper tanks above them filled with water The children who come and go carry away in a curious stone pail their kettle of boiling water and their blocks of burning peat For these they give her a Dutch cent which is worth less than half of one of ours In this way persons who cannot afford to keep a fire burning in hot weather may yet have their cup of tea or coffee and bit of boiled fish and potato After leaving the old fire woman who nodded a pleasant good bye to us and willingly put our stivers in her great outside pocket we drove through the streets enjoying the singular sights of a public washing day Yes in certain quarters of the city away from the canals the streets were lively with washerwomen hard at work Hundreds of them in clumsy wooden shoes with their tucked up skirts bare arms and close fitting caps were bending over tall wooden tubs that reached as high as their waists gossiping and rubbing rubbing and gossiping with perfect unconcern in the public thoroughfare and all washing with cold water instead of using hot as we do What a grand thing it would be for our old fire woman if boiling water were suddenly to become the fashion on these public washing days And now goodbye Oh I must tell you one more thing We found today in an Amsterdam bookstore this story of Hans Brinker told in Dutch It is a queer looking volume beautifully printed and with colored pictures but filled with such astounding words that it really made me feel sorry for the little Hollanders who are to read them Good bye again in the touching words of our Dutch translator with whom I m sure you ll heartily agree Toch ben ik er mijn landgenooten dank baar voor die mijn arbeid steeds zoo welwillend outvangen en wier genegenheid ik voortdurend hoop te verdienen Yours affectionately The Author Contents Hans and Gretel Holland The Silver Skates Hans and Gretel Find a Friend Shadows in the Home Sunbeams Hans Has His

Thomas Higgs Broad Sunshine Conclusion Hans and Gretel On a bright December morning long ago two thinly clad children were kneeling upon the bank of a frozen canal in Holland The sun had not yet appeared but the gray sky was parted near the horizon and its edges shone crimson with the coming day Most of the good Hollanders were enjoying a placid morning nap Even Mynheer von Stoppelnoze that worthy old Dutchman was still slumbering in beautiful repose Now and then some peasant woman poising a well filled basket upon her head came skimming over the glassy surface of the canal or a lusty boy skating to his day s work in the town cast a good natured grimace toward the shivering pair as he flew along Meanwhile with many a vigorous puff and pull the brother and sister for such they were seemed to be fastening something to their feet not skates certainly but clumsy pieces of wood narrowed and smoothed at their lower edge and pierced with holes through which were threaded strings of rawhide These queer looking affairs had been made by the boy Hans His mother was a poor peasant woman too poor even to think of such a thing as buying skates for her little ones Rough as these were they had afforded the children many a happy hour upon the ice And now as with cold red fingers our young Hollanders tugged at the strings their solemn faces bending closely over their knees no vision of impossible iron runners came to dull the satisfaction glowing within In a moment the boy arose and with a pompous swing of the arms and a careless Come on Gretel glided easily across the canal Ah Hans called his sister plaintively this foot is not well yet The strings hurt me on last market day and now I cannot bear them tied in the same place Tie them higher up then answered Hans as without looking at her he performed a wonderful cat s cradle step on the ice How can I The string is too short Giving vent to a good natured Dutch whistle the English of which was that girls were troublesome creatures he steered toward her You are foolish to wear such shoes Gretel when you have a stout leather pair Your klompen would be better than these Why Hans Do you forget The father threw my beautiful new shoes in the fire Before I knew what he had done they were all curled up in the midst o the burning peat I can skate with these but not with my wooden ones Be careful now Hans had taken a string from his pocket Humming a tune as he knelt beside her he proceeded to fasten Gretel s skate with all the force of his strong young arm Oh oh she cried in real pain With an impatient jerk Hans unwound the string He would have cast it on the ground in true big brother style had he not just then spied a tear trickling down his sister s cheek I ll fix it never fear he said with sudden tenderness but we must be quick The mother will need us soon Then he glanced inquiringly about him first at the ground next at some bare willow branches above his head and finally at the sky now gorgeous with streaks of blue crimson and gold Finding nothing in any of these localities to meet his need his eye suddenly brightened as with the air of a fellow who knew what he was about he took off his cap and removing the tattered lining adjusted it in a smooth pad over the top of Gretel s worn out shoe Now he cried triumphantly at the same time arranging the strings as briskly as his benumbed fingers would allow can you bear some pulling Gretel drew up her lips as if to say Hurt away but made no further response In another moment they were all laughing together as hand in hand they flew along the canal never thinking whether the ice would bear them or not for in Holland ice is generally an all winter affair It settles itself upon the water in a determined kind of way and so far from growing thin and uncertain every time the sun is a little severe upon it it gathers its forces day by day and flashes defiance to every beam Presently squeak squeak sounded something beneath Hans feet Next his strokes grew shorter ending oftimes with a jerk and finally he lay sprawling upon the ice kicking against the air with many a fantastic flourish Ha ha laughed Gretel That was a fine tumble But a tender heart was beating under her coarse blue jacket and even as she laughed she came with a graceful sweep close to her prostrate brother Are you hurt Hans Oh you are laughing Catch me now And she darted away shivering no longer but with cheeks all aglow and eyes sparkling with fun Hans sprang to his feet and started in brisk pursuit but it was no easy thing to catch Gretel Before she had traveled very far her skates too began to squeak Believing that discretion was the better part of valor she turned suddenly and skated into her pursuer s arms Ha ha I ve caught you cried Hans Ha ha I caught YOU she retorted struggling to free herself Just then a clear quick voice was heard calling Hans Gretel It s the mother said Hans looking solemn in an instant By this time the canal was gilded with sunlight The pure morning air was very delightful and skaters were gradually increasing in numbers It was hard to obey the summons But Gretel and Hans were good children without a thought of yielding to the temptation to linger they pulled off their skates leaving half the knots still tied Hans with his great square shoulders and bushy yellow hair towered high above his blue eyed little sister as they trudged homeward He was fifteen years old and Gretel was only twelve He was a solid hearty looking boy with honest eyes and a brow that seemed to bear a sign GOODNESS WITHIN just as the little Dutch zomerhuis wears a motto over its portal Gretel was lithe and quick her eyes had a dancing light in them and while you looked at her cheek the color paled and deepened just as it does upon a bed of pink and white blossoms when the wind is blowing As soon as the children turned from the canal they could see their parents cottage Their mother s tall form arrayed in jacket and petticoat and close fitting cap stood like a picture in the crooked frame of the doorway Had the cottage been a mile away it would still have seemed near In that flat country every object stands out plainly in the distance the chickens show as distinctly as the windmills Indeed were it not for the dikes and the high banks of the canals one could stand almost anywhere in middle Holland without seeing a mound or a ridge between the eye and the jumping off place None had better cause to know the nature of these same dikes than Dame Brinker and the panting youngsters now running at her call But before stating WHY let me ask you to take a rocking chair trip with me to that far country where you may see perhaps for the first time some curious things that Hans and Gretel saw every day Holland Holland is one of the queerest countries under the sun It should be called Odd land or Contrary land for in nearly everything it is different from the other parts of the world In the first place a large portion of the country is lower than the level of the sea Great dikes or bulwarks have been erected at a heavy cost of money and labor to keep the ocean where it belongs On certain parts of the coast it sometimes leans with all its weight against the land and it is as much as the poor country can do to stand the pressure Sometimes the dikes give way or spring a leak and the most disastrous results ensue They are high and wide and the tops of some of them are covered with buildings and trees They have even fine public roads on them from which horses may look down upon wayside cottages Often the keels of floating ships are higher than the roofs of the dwellings The stork clattering to her young on the house peak may feel that her nest is lifted far out of danger but the croaking frog in neighboring bulrushes is nearer the stars than she Water bugs dart backward and forward above the heads of the chimney swallows and willow trees seem drooping with shame because they cannot reach as high as the reeds nearby Ditches canals ponds rivers and lakes are everywhere to be seen High but not dry they shine in the sunlight catching nearly all the bustle and the business quite scorning the tame fields stretching damply beside them One is tempted to ask Which is Holland the shores or the water The very verdure that should be confined to the land has made a mistake and settled upon the fish ponds In fact the entire country is a kind of saturated sponge or as the English poet Butler called it A land that rides at anchor and is moor d In which they do not live but go aboard Persons are born live and die and even have their gardens on canal boats Farmhouses with roofs like great slouched hats pulled over their eyes stand on wooden legs with a tucked up sort of air as if to say We intend to keep dry if we can Even the horses wear a wide stool on each hoof as if to lift them out of the mire In short the landscape everywhere suggests a paradise for ducks It is a glorious country in summer for barefoot girls and boys Such wading Such mimic ship sailing Such rowing fishing and swimming Only think of a chain of puddles where one can launch chip boats all day long and never make a return trip But enough A full recital would set all young America rushing in a body toward the Zuider Zee Dutch cities seem at first sight to be a bewildering jungle of houses bridges churches and ships sprouting into masts steeples and trees In some cities vessels are hitched like horses to their owners doorposts and receive their freight from the upper windows Mothers scream to Lodewyk and Kassy not to swing on the garden gate for fear they may be drowned Water roads are more frequent there than common roads and railways water fences in the form of lazy green ditches enclose pleasure ground farm and garden Sometimes fine green hedges are seen but wooden fences such as we have in America are rarely met with in Holland As for stone fences a Dutchman would lift his hands with astonishment at the very idea There is no stone there except for those great masses of rock that have been brought from other lands to strengthen and protect the coast All the small stones or pebbles if there ever were any seem to be imprisoned in pavements or quite melted away Boys with strong quick arms may grow from pinafores to full beards without ever finding one to start the water rings or set the rabbits flying The water roads are nothing less than canals intersecting the country in every direction These are of all sizes from the great North Holland Ship Canal which is the wonder of the world to those which a boy can leap Water omnibuses called trekschuiten constantly ply up and down these roads for the conveyance of passengers and water drays called pakschuyten are used for carrying fuel and merchandise Instead of green country lanes green canals stretch from field to barn and from barn to garden and the farms or polders as they are termed are merely great lakes pumped dry Some of the busiest streets are water while many of the country roads are paved with brick The city boats with their rounded sterns gilded prows and gaily painted sides are unlike any others under the sun and a Dutch wagon with its funny little crooked pole is a perfect mystery of mysteries One thing is clear cries Master Brightside the inhabitants need never be thirsty But no Odd land is true to itself still Notwithstanding the sea pushing to get in and the lakes struggling to get out and the overflowing canals rivers and ditches in many districts there is no water fit to swallow our poor Hollanders must go dry or drink wine and beer or send far into the inland to Utrecht and other favored localities for that precious fluid older than Adam yet younger than the morning dew Sometimes indeed the inhabitants can swallow a shower when they are provided with any means of catching it but generally they are like the albatross haunted sailors in Coleridge s famous poem The Ancient Mariner They see Water Water everywhere Nor any drop to drink Great flapping windmills all over the country make it look as if flocks of huge sea birds were just settling upon it Everywhere one sees the funniest trees bobbed into fantastical shapes with their trunks painted a dazzling white yellow or red Horses are often yoked three abreast Men women and children go clattering about in wooden shoes with loose heels peasant girls who cannot get beaux for love hire them for money to escort them to the kermis and husbands and wives lovingly harness themselves side by side on the bank of the canal and drag their pakschuyts to market Another peculiar feature of Holland is the dune or sand hill These are numerous along certain portions of the coast Before they were sown with coarse reed grass and other plants to hold them down they used to send great storms of sand over the inland So to add to the oddities the farmers sometimes dig down under the surface to find their soil and on windy days DRY SHOWERS of sand often fall upon fields that have grown wet under a week of sunshine In short almost the only familiar thing we Yankees can meet with in Holland is a harvest song which is quite popular there though no linguist could translate it Even then we must shut our eyes and listen only to the tune which I leave you to guess Yanker didee dudel down Didee dudel lawnter Yankee viver voover vown Botermelk and Tawnter On the other hand many of the oddities of Holland serve only to prove the thrift and perseverance of the people There is not a richer or more carefully tilled garden spot in the whole world than this leaky springy little country There is not a braver more heroic race than its quite passive looking inhabitants Few nations have equalled it in important discoveries and inventions none has excelled it in commerce navigation learning and science or set as noble examples in the promotion of education and public charities and none in proportion to its extent has expended more money or labor upon public works Holland has its shining annals of noble and illustrious men and women its grand historic records of patience resistance and victory its religious freedom its enlightened enterprise its art music and literature It has truly been called the battlefield of Europe as truly may we consider it the asylum of the world for the oppressed of every nation have there found shelter and encouragement If we Americans who after all are homeopathic preparations of Holland stock can laugh at the Dutch and call them human beavers and hint that their country may float off any day at high tide we can also feel proud and say they have proved themselves heroes and that their country will not float off while there is a Dutchman left to grapple it There are said to be at least ninety nine hundred large windmills in Holland with sails ranging from eighty to one hundred and twenty feet long They are employed in sawing timber beating hemp grinding and many other kinds of work but their principal use is for pumping water from the lowlands into the canals and for guarding against the inland freshets that so often deluge the country Their yearly cost is said to be nearly ten million dollars The large ones are of great power The huge circular tower rising sometimes from the midst of factory buildings is surmounted with a smaller one tapering into a caplike roof This upper tower is encircled at its base with a balcony high above which juts the axis turned by its four prodigious ladder back sails Many of the windmills are primitive affairs seeming sadly in need of Yankee improvements but some of the new ones are admirable They are constructed so that by some ingenious contrivance they present their fans or wings to the wind in precisely the right direction to work with the requisite power In other words the miller may take a nap and feel quite sure that his mill will study the wind and make the most of it until he wakens Should there be but a slight current of air every sail will spread itself to catch the faintest breath but if a heavy blow should come they will shrink at its touch like great mimosa leaves and only give it half a chance to move them One of the old prisons of Amsterdam called the Rasphouse because the thieves and vagrants who were confined there were employed in rasping logwood had a cell for the punishment of lazy prisoners In one corner of this cell was a pump and in another an opening through which a steady stream of water was admitted The prisoner could take his choice either to stand still and be drowned or to work for dear life at the pump and keep the flood down until his jailer chose to relieve him Now it seems to me that throughout Holland nature has introduced this little diversion on a grand scale The Dutch have always been forced to pump for their very existence and probably must continue to do so to the end of time Every year millions of dollars are spent in repairing dikes and regulating water levels If these important duties were neglected the country would be uninhabitable Already dreadful consequences as I have said have followed the bursting of these dikes Hundreds of villages and towns have from time to time been buried beneath the rush of waters and nearly a million persons have been destroyed One of the most fearful inundations ever known occurred in the autumn of the year fifteen seventy Twenty eight terrible floods had before that time overwhelmed portions of Holland but this was the most terrible of all The unhappy country had long been suffering under Spanish tyranny now it seemed the crowning point was given to its troubles When we read Motley s history of the rise of the Dutch republic we learn to revere the brave people who have endured suffered and dared so much mister Motley in his thrilling account of the great inundation tells us how a long continued and violent gale had been sweeping the Atlantic waters into the North Sea piling them against the coasts of the Dutch provinces how the dikes taxed beyond their strength burst in all directions how even the Hand bos a bulwark formed of oaken piles braced with iron moored with heavy anchors and secured by gravel and granite was snapped to pieces like thread how fishing boats and bulky vessels floating up into the country became entangled among the trees or beat in the roofs and walls of dwellings and how at last all Friesland was converted into an angry sea Multitudes of men women children of horses oxen sheep and every domestic animal were struggling in the waves in every direction Every boat and every article which could serve as a boat was eagerly seized upon Every house was inundated even the graveyards gave up their dead The living infant in his cradle and the long buried corpse in his coffin floated side by side The ancient flood seemed about to be renewed Everywhere upon the tops of trees upon the steeples of churches human beings were clustered praying to God for mercy and to their fellow men for assistance As the storm at last was subsiding boats began to ply in every direction saving those who were struggling in the water picking fugitives from roofs and treetops and collecting the bodies of those already drowned No less than one hundred thousand human beings had perished in a few hours Thousands upon thousands of dumb creatures lay dead upon the waters and the damage to property was beyond calculation Robles the Spanish governor was foremost in noble efforts to save life and lessen the horrors of the catastrophe He had previously been hated by the Dutch because of his Spanish or Portuguese blood but by his goodness and activity in their hour of disaster he won all hearts to gratitude He soon introduced an improved method of constructing the dikes and passed a law that they should in future be kept up by the owners of the soil There were fewer heavy floods from this time though within less than three hundred years six fearful inundations swept over the land In the spring there is always great danger of inland freshets especially in times of thaw because the rivers choked with blocks of ice overflow before they can discharge their rapidly rising waters into the ocean Adding to this that the sea chafes and presses against the dikes it is no wonder that Holland is often in a state of alarm The greatest care is taken to prevent accidents Engineers and workmen are stationed all along in threatened places and a close watch is kept up night and day When a general signal of danger is given the inhabitants all rush to the rescue eager to combine against their common foe As everywhere else straw is supposed to be of all things the most helpless in the water of course in Holland it must be rendered the mainstay against a rushing tide Huge straw mats are pressed against the embankments fortified with clay and heavy stone and once adjusted the ocean dashes against them in vain Raff Brinker the father of Gretel and Hans had for years been employed upon the dikes It was at the time of a threatened inundation when in the midst of a terrible storm in darkness and sleet the men were laboring at a weak spot near the Veermyk sluice that he fell from the scaffolding and became insensible From that hour he never worked again though he lived on mind and memory were gone Gretel could not remember him otherwise than as the strange silent man whose eyes followed her vacantly whichever way she turned but Hans had recollections of a hearty cheerful voiced father who was never tired of bearing him upon his shoulder and whose careless song still seemed echoing near when he lay awake at night and listened The Silver Skates Dame Brinker earned a scant support for her family by raising vegetables spinning and knitting Once she had worked on board the barges plying up and down the canal and had occasionally been harnessed with other women to the towing rope of a pakschuyt plying between Broek and Amsterdam But when Hans had grown strong and large he had insisted on doing all such drudgery in her place Besides her husband had become so very helpless of late that he required her constant care Although not having as much intelligence as a little child he was yet strong of arm and very hearty and Dame Brinker had sometimes great trouble in controlling him Ah children he was so good and steady she would sometimes say and as wise as a lawyer Even the burgomaster would stop to ask him a question and now alack he doesn t know his wife and little ones You remember the father Hans when he was himself a great brave man don t you Yes indeed Mother he knew everything and could do anything under the sun and how he would sing Why you used to laugh and say it was enough to set the windmills dancing So I did Bless me how the boy remembers Gretel child take that knitting needle from your father quick he ll get it in his eyes maybe and put the shoe on him His poor feet are like ice half the time but I can t keep em covered all I can do And then half wailing half humming Dame Brinker would sit down and fill the low cottage with the whirr of her spinning wheel Nearly all the outdoor work as well as the household labor was performed by Hans and Gretel At certain seasons of the year the children went out day after day to gather peat which they would stow away in square bricklike pieces for fuel At other times when homework permitted Hans rode the towing horses on the canals earning a few stivers a day and Gretel tended geese for the neighboring farmers Hans was clever at carving in wood and both he and Gretel were good gardeners Gretel could sing and sew and run on great high homemade stilts better than any other girl for miles around She could learn a ballad in five minutes and find in its season any weed or flower you could name but she dreaded books and often the very sight of the figuring board in the old schoolhouse would set her eyes swimming Hans on the contrary was slow and steady The harder the task whether in study or daily labor the better he liked it Boys who sneered at him out of school on account of his patched clothes and scant leather breeches were forced to yield him the post of honor in nearly every class It was not long before he was the only youngster in the school who had not stood at least ONCE in the corner of horrors where hung a dreaded whip and over it this motto Leer leer jou luigaart of dit endje touw zal je leeren It was only in winter that Gretel and Hans could be spared to attend school and for the past month they had been kept at home because their mother needed their services Raff Brinker required constant attention and there was black bread to be made and the house to be kept clean and stockings and other things to be knitted and sold in the marketplace While they were busily assisting their mother on this cold December morning a merry troop of girls and boys came skimming down the canal There were fine skaters among them and as the bright medley of costumes flitted by it looked from a distance as though the ice had suddenly thawed and some gay tulip bed were floating along on the current There was the rich burgomaster s daughter Hilda van Gleck with her costly furs and loose fitting velvet sack and nearby a pretty peasant girl Annie Bouman jauntily attired in a coarse scarlet jacket and a blue skirt just short enough to display the gray homespun hose to advantage Then there was the proud Rychie Korbes whose father Mynheer van Korbes was one of the leading men of Amsterdam and flocking closely around her Carl Schummel Peter and Ludwig van Holp Jacob Poot and a very small boy rejoicing in the tremendous name of Voostenwalbert Schimmelpenninck There were nearly twenty other boys and girls in the party and one and all seemed full of excitement and frolic Up and down the canal within the space of a half mile they skated exerting their racing powers to the utmost Often the swiftest among them was seen to dodge from under the very nose of some pompous lawgiver or doctor who with folded arms was skating leisurely toward the town or a chain of girls would suddenly break at the approach of a fat old burgomaster who with gold headed cane poised in air was puffing his way to Amsterdam Equipped in skates wonderful to behold with their superb strappings and dazzling runners curving over the instep and topped with gilt balls he would open his fat eyes a little if one of the maidens chanced to drop him a curtsy but would not dare to bow in return for fear of losing his balance Not only pleasure seekers and stately men of note were upon the canal There were workpeople with weary eyes hastening to their shops and factories market women with loads upon their heads peddlers bending with their packs bargemen with shaggy hair and bleared faces jostling roughly on their way kind eyed clergymen speeding perhaps to the bedsides of the dying and after a while groups of children with satchels slung over their shoulders whizzing past toward the distant school One and all wore skates except indeed a muffled up farmer whose queer cart bumped along on the margin of the canal Before long our merry boys and girls were almost lost in the confusion of bright colors the ceaseless motion and the gleaming of skates flashing back the sunlight We might have known no more of them had not the whole party suddenly come to a standstill and grouping themselves out of the way of the passersby all talked at once to a pretty little maiden whom they had drawn from the tide of people flowing toward the town Oh Katrinka they cried in one breath have you heard of it The race we want you to join What race asked Katrinka laughing Don t all talk at once please I can t understand Everyone panted and looked at Rychie Korbes who was their acknowledged spokeswoman Why said Rychie we are to have a grand skating match on the twentieth on Mevrouw van Gleck s birthday It s all Hilda s work They are going to give a splendid prize to the best skater Yes chimed in half a dozen voices a beautiful pair of silver skates perfectly magnificent with oh such straps and silver bells and buckles WHO said they had bells put in a small voice of the boy with the big name I say so Master Voost replied Rychie So they have No I m sure they haven t OH how can you say so It s an arrow And Mynheer van Korbes told MY mother they had bells came from the excited group but Mynheer Voostenwalbert Schimmelpenninck essayed to settle the matter with a decisive Well you don t any of you know a single thing about it they haven t a sign of a bell on them they Oh oh and the chorus of conflicting opinions broke forth again The girls pair is to have bells interposed Hilda quietly but there is to be another pair for the boys with an arrow engraved upon the sides THERE I told you so cried nearly all the youngsters in one breath Katrinka looked at them with bewildered eyes Who is to try she asked All of us answered Rychie It will be such fun And you must too Katrinka But it s schooltime now we will talk it all over at noon Oh you will join of course Katrinka without replying made a graceful pirouette and laughing out a coquettish Don t you hear the last bell Catch me darted off toward the schoolhouse standing half a mile away on the canal All started pell mell at this challenge but they tried in vain to catch the bright eyed laughing creature who with golden hair streaming in the sunlight cast back many a sparkling glance of triumph as she floated onward Beautiful Katrinka Flushed with youth and health all life and mirth and motion what wonder thine image ever floating in advance sped through one boy s dreams that night What wonder that it seemed his darkest hour when years afterward thy presence floated away from him forever Hans and Gretel Find a Friend At noon our young friends poured forth from the schoolhouse intent upon having an hour s practice upon the canal They had skated but a few moments when Carl Schummel said mockingly to Hilda There s a pretty pair just coming upon the ice The little ragpickers Their skates must have been a present from the king direct They are patient creatures said Hilda gently It must have been hard to learn to skate upon such queer affairs They are very poor peasants you see The boy has probably made the skates himself Carl was somewhat abashed Patient they may be but as for skating they start off pretty well only to finish with a jerk They could move well to your new staccato piece I think Hilda laughed pleasantly and left him After joining a small detachment of the racers and sailing past every one of them she halted beside Gretel who with eager eyes had been watching the sport What is your name little girl Gretel my lady answered the child somewhat awed by Hilda s rank though they were nearly of the same age and my brother is called Hans Hans is a stout fellow said Hilda cheerily and seems to have a warm stove somewhere within him but YOU look cold You should wear more clothing little one Gretel who had nothing else to wear tried to laugh as she answered I am not so very little I am past twelve years old Oh I beg your pardon You see I am nearly fourteen and so large for my age that other girls seem small to me but that is nothing Perhaps you will shoot up far above me yet but not unless you dress more warmly though Shivering girls never grow Hans flushed as he saw tears rising in Gretel s eyes My sister has not complained of the cold but this is bitter weather they all say And he looked sadly upon Gretel It is nothing said Gretel I am often warm too warm when I am skating You are good jufvrouw to think of it No no answered Hilda quite angry at herself I am careless cruel but I meant no harm I wanted to ask you I mean if And here Hilda coming to the point of her errand faltered before the poorly clad but noble looking children she wished to serve What is it young lady exclaimed Hans eagerly If there is any service I can do any Oh no no laughed Hilda shaking off her embarrassment I only wished to speak to you about the grand race Why do you not join it You both can skate well and the ranks are free Anyone may enter for the prize Gretel looked wistfully at Hans who tugging at his cap answered respectfully Ah jufvrouw even if we could enter we could skate only a few strokes with the rest Our skates are hard wood you see holding up the sole of his foot but they soon become damp and then they stick and trip us Gretel s eyes twinkled with fun as she thought of Hans s mishap in the morning but she blushed as she faltered out timidly Oh no we can t join but may we be there my lady on the great day to look on Certainly answered Hilda looking kindly into the two earnest faces and wishing from her heart that she had not spent so much of her monthly allowance for lace and finery She had but eight kwartjes left and they would buy but one pair of skates at the furthest Looking down with a sigh at the two pairs of feet so very different in size she asked Which of you is the better skater Gretel replied Hans promptly Hans answered Gretel in the same breath Hilda smiled I cannot buy you each a pair of skates or even one good pair but here are eight kwartjes Decide between you which stands the best chance of winning the race and buy the skates accordingly I wish I had enough to buy better ones Good bye And with a nod and a smile Hilda after handing the money to the electrified Hans glided swiftly away to rejoin her companions Jufvrouw Jufvrouw van Gleck called Hans in a loud tone stumbling after her as well as he could for one of his skate strings was untied Hilda turned and with one hand raised to shield her eyes from the sun seemed to him to be floating through the air nearer and nearer We cannot take this money panted Hans though we know your goodness in giving it Why not indeed asked Hilda flushing Because replied Hans bowing like a clown but looking with the eye of a prince at the queenly girl we have not earned it Hilda was quick witted She had noticed a pretty wooden chain upon Gretel s neck Carve me a chain Hans like the one your sister wears That I will lady with all my heart We have whitewood in the house fine as ivory you shall have one tomorrow And Hans hastily tried to return the money No no said Hilda decidedly That sum will be but a poor price for the chain And off she darted outstripping the fleetest among the skaters Hans sent a long bewildered gaze after her it was useless he felt to make any further resistance It is right he muttered half to himself half to his faithful shadow Gretel I must work hard every minute and sit up half the night if the mother will let me burn a candle but the chain shall be finished We may keep the money Gretel What a good little lady cried Gretel clapping her hands with delight Oh Hans was it for nothing the stork settled on our roof last summer Do you remember how the mother said it would bring us luck and how she cried when Janzoon Kolp shot him And she set it would bring him trouble But the luck has come to us at last Now Hans if the mother sends us to town tomorrow you can buy the skates in the marketplace Hans shook his head The young lady would have given us the money to buy skates but if I EARN it Gretel it shall be spent for wool You must have a warm jacket Oh cried Gretel in real dismay not buy the skates Why I am not often cold Mother says the blood runs up and down in poor children s veins humming I must keep em warm I must keep em warm Oh Hans she continued with something like a sob don t say you won t buy the skates It makes me feel just like crying Besides I want to be cold I mean I m real awful warm so now Hans looked up hurriedly He had a true Dutch horror or tears or emotion of any kind and most of all he dreaded to see his sisters blue eyes overflowing Now mind cried Gretel seeing her advantage I ll feel awful if you give up the skates I don t want them I m not so stingy as that but I want YOU to have them and then when I get bigger they ll do for me oh count the pieces Hans Did you ever see so many Hans turned the money thoughtfully in his palm Never in all his life had he longed so intensely for a pair of skates for he had known of the race and had fairly ached for a chance to test his powers with the other children He felt confident that with a good pair of steel runners he could readily outdistance most of the boys on the canal Then too Gretel s argument was plausible On the other hand he knew that she with her strong but lithe little frame needed but a week s practice on good runners to make her a better skater than Rychie Korbes or even Katrinka Flack As soon as this last thought flashed upon him his resolve was made If Gretel would not have the jacket she should have the skates No Gretel he answered at last I can wait Someday I may have money enough saved to buy a fine pair You shall have these Gretel s eyes sparkled but in another instant she insisted rather faintly The young lady gave the money to YOU Hans I d be real bad to take it Hans shook his head resolutely as he trudged on causing his sister to half skip and half walk in her effort to keep beside him By this time they had taken off their wooden rockers and were hastening home to tell their mother the good news Oh I know cried Gretel in a sprightly tone You can do this You can get a pair a little too small for you and too big for me and we can take turns and use them Won t that be fine Gretel clapped her hands again Poor Hans This was a strong temptation but he pushed it away from him brave hearted fellow that he was Nonsense Gretel You could never get on with a big pair You stumbled about with these like a blind chicken before I curved off the ends No you must have a pair to fit exactly and you must practice every chance you can get until the twentieth comes My little Gretel shall win the silver skates Gretel could not help laughing with delight at the very idea Hans Gretel called out a familiar voice Coming Mother They hastened toward the cottage Hans still shaking the pieces of silver in his hand On the following day there was not a prouder nor a happier boy in all Holland than Hans Brinker as he watched his sister with many a dexterous sweep flying in and out among the skaters who at sundown thronged the canal A warm jacket had been given her by the kind hearted Hilda and the burst out shoes had been cobbled into decency by Dame Brinker As the little creature darted backward and forward flushed with enjoyment and quite unconscious of the many wondering glances bent upon her she felt that the shining runners beneath her feet had suddenly turned earth into fairyland while Hans dear good Hans echoed itself over and over again in her grateful heart By den donder exclaimed Peter van Holp to Carl Schummel but that little one in the red jacket and patched petticoat skates well Gunst She has toes on her heels and eyes in the back of her head See her It will be a joke if she gets in the race and beats Katrinka Flack after all Hush not so loud returned Carl rather sneeringly That little lady in rags is the special pet of Hilda van Gleck Those shining skates are her gift if I make no mistake So so exclaimed Peter with a radiant smile for Hilda was his best friend She has been at her good work there too And Mynheer van Holp after cutting a double figure eight on the ice to say nothing of a huge P then a jump and an H glided onward until he found himself beside Hilda Hand in hand they skated together laughingly at first then staidly talking in a low tone Strange to say Peter van Holp soon arrived at a sudden conviction that his little sister needed a wooden chain just like Hilda s Two days afterwards on Saint Nicholas s Eve Hans having burned three candle ends and cut his thumb into the bargain stood in the marketplace at Amsterdam buying another pair of skates Shadows in the Home Good Dame Brinker As soon as the scanty dinner had been cleared away that noon she had arrayed herself in her holiday attire in honor of Saint Nicholas It will brighten the children she thought to herself and she was not mistaken This festival dress had been worn very seldom during the past ten years before that time it had done good service and had flourished at many a dance and kermis when she was known far and wide as the pretty Meitje Klenck The children had sometimes been granted rare glimpses of it as it lay in state in the old oaken chest Faded and threadbare as it was it was gorgeous in their eyes with its white linen tucker now gathered to her plump throat and vanishing beneath the trim bodice of blue homespun and its reddish brown skirt bordered with black The knitted woolen mitts and the dainty cap showing her hair which generally was hidden made her seem almost like a princess to Gretel while Master Hans grew staid and well behaved as he gazed Soon the little maid while braiding her own golden tresses fairly danced around her mother in an ecstasy of admiration Oh Mother Mother Mother how pretty you are Look Hans Isn t it just like a picture Just like a picture assented Hans cheerfully JUST like a picture only I don t like those stocking things on the hands Not like the mitts brother Hans Why they re very important See they cover up all the red Oh Mother how white your arm is where the mitt leaves off whiter than mine oh ever so much whiter I declare Mother the bodice is tight for you You re growing You re surely growing Dame Brinker laughed This was made long ago lovey when I wasn t much thicker about the waist than a churn dasher And how do you like the cap she asked turning her head from side to side Oh EVER so much Mother It s b e a u tiful See the father is looking Was the father looking Alas only with a dull stare His vrouw turned toward him with a start something like a blush rising to her cheeks a questioning sparkle in her eye The bright look died away in an instant No no She sighed He sees nothing Come Hans and the smile crept faintly back again don t stand gaping at me all day and the new skates waiting for you at Amsterdam Ah Mother he answered you need so many things Why should I buy skates Nonsense child The money was given to you on purpose or the work was it s all the same thing Go while the sun is high Yes and hurry back Hans laughed Gretel We ll race on the canal tonight if the mother lets us At the very threshold he turned to say Your spinning wheel wants a new treadle Mother You can make it Hans So I can That will take no money But you need feathers and wool and meal and There there That will do Your silver cannot buy everything Ah Hans if our stolen money would but come back on this bright Saint Nicholas s Eve how glad we would be Only last night I prayed to the good saint Mother interrupted Hans in dismay Why not Hans Shame on you to reproach me for that I m as true a Protestant in sooth as any fine lady that walks into church but it s no wrong to turn sometimes to the good Saint Nicholas Tut It s a likely story if one can t do that without one s children flaring up at it and he the boys and girls own saint Hoot Mayhap the colt is a steadier horse than the mare Hans knew his mother too well to offer a word in opposition when her voice quickened and sharpened as it did now it was often sharp and quick when she spoke of the missing money so he said gently And what did you ask of good Saint Nicholas Mother Why never to give the thieves a wink of sleep till they brought it back to be sure if he has the power to do such things or else to brighten our wits that we might find it ourselves Not a sight have I had of it since the day before the dear father was hurt as you well know Hans That I do Mother he answered sadly though you have almost pulled down the cottage in searching Aye but it was of no use moaned the dame HIDERS make best finders Hans started Do you think the father could tell aught Aye indeed said Dame Brinker nodding her head I think so but that is no sign I never hold the same belief in the matter two days Mayhap the father paid it off for the great silver watch we have been guarding since that day But no I ll never believe it The watch was not worth a quarter of the money Mother No indeed and your father was a shrewd man up to the last moment He was too steady and thrifty for silly doings Where did the watch come from I wonder muttered Hans half to himself Dame Brinker shook her head and looked sadly toward her husband who sat staring blankly at the floor Gretel stood near him knitting That we shall never know Hans I have shown it to the father many a time but he does not know it from a potato When he came in that dreadful night to supper he handed the watch to me and told me to take good care of it until he asked for it again Just as he opened his lips to say more Broom Klatterboost came flying in with word that the dike was in danger Ah The waters were terrible that Pinxter week My man alack caught up his tools and ran out That was the last I ever saw of him in his right mind He was brought in again by midnight nearly dead with his poor head all bruised and cut The fever passed off in time but never the dullness THAT grew worse every day We shall never know Hans had heard all this before More than once he had seen his mother in hours of sore need take the watch from its hiding place half resolved to sell it but she had always conquered the temptation No Hans she would say we must be nearer starvation than this before we turn faithless to the father A memory of some such scene crossed her son s mind now for after giving a heavy sigh and flipping a crumb of wax at Gretel across the table he said Aye Mother you have done bravely to keep it many a one would have tossed it off for gold long ago And more shame for them exclaimed the dame indignantly I would not do it Besides the gentry are so hard on us poor folks that if they saw such a thing in our hands even if we told all they might suspect the father of Hans flushed angrily They would not DARE to say such a thing Mother If they did I d He clenched his fist and seemed to think that the rest of his sentence was too terrible to utter in her presence Dame Brinker smiled proudly through her tears at this interruption Ah Hans thou rt a true brave lad We will never part company with the watch In his dying hour the dear father might wake and ask for it Might WAKE Mother echoed Hans Wake and know us Aye child almost whispered his mother such things have been By this time Hans had nearly forgotten his proposed errand to Amsterdam His mother had seldom spoken so familiarly to him He felt himself now to be not only her son but her friend her adviser You are right Mother We must never give up the watch For the father s sake we will guard it always The money though may come to light when we least expect it Never cried Dame Brinker taking the last stitch from her needle with a jerk and laying the unfinished knitting heavily upon her lap There is no chance One thousand guilders and all gone in a day One thousand guilders Oh what ever DID become of them If they went in an evil way the thief would have confessed it on his dying bed He would not dare to die with such guilt on his soul He may not be dead yet said Hans soothingly Any day we may hear of him Ah child she said in a changed tone what thief would ever have come HERE It was always neat and clean thank God but not fine for the father and I saved and saved that we might have something laid by Little and often soon fills the pouch We found it so in truth Besides the father had a goodly sum already for service done to the Heernocht lands at the time of the great inundation Every week we had a guilder left over sometimes more for the father worked extra hours and could get high pay for his labor Every Saturday night we put something by except the time when you had the fever Hans and when Gretel came At last the pouch grew so full that I mended an old stocking and commenced again Now that I look back it seems that the money was up to the heel in a few sunny weeks There was great pay in those days if a man was quick at engineer work The stocking went on filling with copper and silver aye and gold You may well open your eyes Gretel I used to laugh and tell the father it was not for poverty I wore my old gown And the stocking went on filling so full that sometimes when I woke at night I d get up soft and quiet and go feel it in the moonlight Then on my knees I would thank our Lord that my little ones could in time get good learning and that the father might rest from labor in his old age Sometimes at supper the father and I would talk about a new chimney and a good winter room for the cow but my man had finer plans even than that A big sail says he catches the wind we can do what we will soon and then we would sing together as I washed my dishes Ah a smooth wind makes an easy rudder Not a thing vexed me from morning till night Every week the father would take out the stocking and drop in the money and laugh and kiss me as we tied it up together Up with you Hans There you sit gaping and the day a wasting added Dame Brinker tartly blushing to find that she had been speaking too freely to her boy It s high time you were on your way Hans had seated himself and was looking earnestly into her face He arose and in almost a whisper asked Have you ever tried Mother She understood him Yes child often But the father only laughs or he stares at me so strange that I am glad to ask no more When you and Gretel had the fever last winter and our bread was nearly gone and I could earn nothing for fear you would die while my face was turned oh I tried then I smoothed his hair and whispered to him soft as a kitten about the money where it was who had it Alack He would pick at my sleeve and whisper gibberish till my blood ran cold At last while Gretel lay whiter than snow and you were raving on the bed I screamed to him it seemed as if he MUST hear me Raff where is our money Do you know aught of the money Raff The money in the pouch and the stocking in the big chest But I might as well have talked to a stone I might as The mother s voice sounded so strange and her eye was so bright that Hans with a new anxiety laid his hand upon her shoulder Come Mother he said let us try to forget this money I am big and strong Gretel too is very quick and willing Soon all will be prosperous with us again Why Mother Gretel and I would rather see thee bright and happy than to have all the silver in the world wouldn t we Gretel The mother knows it said Gretel sobbing Sunbeams Dame Brinker was startled at her children s emotion glad too for it proved how loving and true they were Beautiful ladies in princely homes often smile suddenly and sweetly gladdening the very air around them but I doubt if their smile be more welcome in God s sight than that which sprang forth to cheer the roughly clad boy and girl in the humble cottage Dame Brinker felt that she had been selfish Blushing and brightening she hastily wiped her eyes and looked upon them as only a mother can Hoity Toity Pretty talk we re having and Saint Nicholas s Eve almost here What wonder the yarn pricks my fingers Come Gretel take this cent and while Hans is trading for the skates you can buy a waffle in the marketplace Let me stay home with you Mother said Gretel looking up with eyes that sparkled through their tears Hans will buy me the cake As you will child and Hans wait a moment Three turns of this needle will finish this toe and then you may have as good a pair of hose as ever were knitted owning the yarn is a grain too sharp to sell to the hosier on the Harengracht That will give us three quarter guilders if you make good trade and as it s right hungry weather you may buy four waffles We ll keep the Feast of Saint Nicholas after all Gretel clapped her hands That will be fine Annie Bouman told me what grand times they will have in the big houses tonight But we will be merry too Hans will have beautiful new skates and then there ll be the waffles Oh Don t break them brother Hans Wrap them well and button them under your jacket very carefully Certainly replied Hans quite gruff with pleasure and importance Oh Mother cried Gretel in high glee soon you will be busied with the father and now you are only knitting Do tell us all about Saint Nicholas Dame Brinker laughed to see Hans hang up his hat and prepare to listen Nonsense children she said I have told it to you often Tell us again Oh DO tell us again cried Gretel throwing herself upon the wonderful wooden bench that her brother had made on the mother s last birthday Hans not wishing to appear childish and yet quite willing to hear the story stood carelessly swinging his skates against the fireplace Well children you shall hear it but we must never waste the daylight again in this way Pick up your ball Gretel and let your sock grow as I talk Opening your ears needn t shut your fingers Saint Nicholas you must know is a wonderful saint He keeps his eye open for the good of sailors but he cares most of all for boys and girls Well once upon a time when he was living on the earth a merchant of Asia sent his three sons to a great city called Athens to get learning Is Athens in Holland Mother asked Gretel I don t know child Probably it is Oh no Mother said Hans respectfully I had that in my geography lessons long ago Athens is in Greece Well resumed the mother what matter Greece may belong to the king for aught we know Anyhow this rich merchant sent his sons to Athens While they were on their way they stopped one night at a shabby inn meaning to take up their journey in the morning Well they had very fine clothes velvet and silk it may be such as rich folks children all over the world think nothing of wearing and their belts likewise were full of money What did the wicked landlord do but contrive a plan to kill the children and take their money and all their beautiful clothes himself So that night when all the world was asleep he got up and killed the three young gentlemen Gretel clasped her hands and shuddered but Hans tried to look as if killing and murder were everyday matters to him That was not the worst of it continued Dame Brinker knitting slowly and trying to keep count of her stitches as she talked That was not near the worst of it The dreadful landlord went and cut up the young gentlemen s bodies into little pieces and threw them into a great tub of brine intending to sell them for pickled pork Oh cried Gretel horror stricken though she had often heard the story before Hans was still unmoved and seemed to think that pickling was the best that could be done under the circumstances Yes he pickled them and one might think that would have been the last of the young gentlemen But no That night Saint Nicholas had a wonderful vision and in it he saw the landlord cutting up the merchant s children There was no need of his hurrying you know for he was a saint but in the morning he went to the inn and charged the landlord with murder Then the wicked landlord confessed it from beginning to end and fell down on his knees begging forgiveness He felt so sorry for what he had done that he asked the saint to bring the young masters to life And did the saint do it asked Gretel delighted well knowing what the answer would be Of course he did The pickled pieces flew together in an instant and out jumped the young gentlemen from the brine tub They cast themselves at the feet of Saint Nicholas and he gave them his blessing and oh mercy on us Hans it will be dark before you get back if you don t start this minute By this time Dame Brinker was almost out of breath and quite out of commas She could not remember when she had seen the children idle away an hour of daylight in this manner and the thought of such luxury quite appalled her By way of compensation she now flew about the room in extreme haste Tossing a block of peat upon the fire blowing invisible fire from the table and handing the finished hose to Hans all in an instant Comes Hans she said as her boy lingered by the door What keeps thee Hans kissed his mother s plump cheek rosy and fresh yet in spite of all her troubles My mother is the best in the world and I would be right glad to have a pair of skates but and as he buttoned his jacket he looked in a troubled way toward a strange figure crouching by the hearthstone if my money would bring a meester from Amsterdam to see the father something might yet be done A meester would not come Hans for twice that money and it would do no good if he did Ah how many guilders I once spent for that but the dear good father would not waken It is God s will Go Hans and buy the skates Hans started with a heavy heart but since the heart was young and in a boy s bosom it set him whistling in less than five minutes His mother had said thee to him and that was quite enough to make even a dark day sunny Hollanders do not address each other in affectionate intercourse as the French and Germans do But Dame Brinker had embroidered for a Heidelberg family in her girlhood and she had carried its thee and thou into her rude home to be used in moments of extreme love and tenderness Therefore What keeps thee Hans sang an echo song beneath the boy s whistling and made him feel that his errand was blest Hans Has His Way Broek with its quiet spotless streets its frozen rivulets its yellow brick pavements and bright wooden houses was nearby It was a village where neatness and show were in full blossom but the inhabitants seemed to be either asleep or dead Not a footprint marred the sanded paths where pebbles and seashells lay in fanciful designs Every window shutter was tightly closed as though air and sunshine were poison and the massive front doors were never opened except on the occasion of a wedding a christening or a funeral Serene clouds of tobacco smoke were floating through hidden corners and children who otherwise might have awakened the place were studying in out of the way corners or skating upon the neighboring canal A few peacocks and wolves stood in the gardens but they had never enjoyed the luxury of flesh and blood They were made out of boxwood hedges and seemed to be guarding the grounds with a sort of green ferocity Certain lively automata ducks women and sportsmen were stowed away in summer houses waiting for the spring time when they could be wound up and rival their owners in animation and the shining tiled roofs mosaic courtyards and polished house trimmings flashed up a silent homage to the sky where never a speck of dust could dwell Hans glanced toward the village as he shook his silver kwartjes and wondered whether it were really true as he had often heard that some of the people of Broek were so rich that they used kitchen utensils of solid gold He had seen Mevrouw van Stoop s sweet cheeses in market and he knew that the lofty dame earned many a bright silver guilder in selling them But did she set the cream to rise in golden pans Did she use a golden skimmer When her cows were in winter quarters were their tails really tied up with ribbons These thoughts ran through his mind as he turned his face toward Amsterdam not five miles away on the other side of the frozen Y The ice upon the canal was perfect but his wooden runners so soon to be cast aside squeaked a dismal farewell as he scraped and skimmed along When crossing the Y whom should he see skating toward him but the great doctor Boekman the most famous physician and surgeon in Holland Hans had never met him before but he had seen his engraved likeness in many of the shop windows in Amsterdam It was a face that one could never forget Thin and lank though a born Dutchman with stern blue eyes and queer compressed lips that seemed to say No smiling permitted he certainly was not a very jolly or sociable looking personage nor one that a well trained boy would care to accost unbidden But Hans WAS bidden and that too by a voice he seldom disregarded his own conscience Here comes the greatest doctor in the world whispered the voice God has sent him You have no right to buy skates when you might with the same money purchase such aid for your father The wooden runners gave an exultant squeak Hundreds of beautiful skates were gleaming and vanishing in the air above him He felt the money tingle in his fingers The old doctor looked fearfully grim and forbidding Hans s heart was in his throat but he found voice enough to cry out just as he was passing Mynheer Boekman The great man halted and sticking out his thin underlip looked scowling about him Hans was in for it now Mynheer he panted drawing close to the fierce looking doctor I knew you could be none other than the famous Boekman I have to ask a great favor Hump muttered the doctor preparing to skate past the intruder Get out of the way I ve no money never give to beggars I am no beggar mynheer retorted Hans proudly at the same time producing his mite of silver with a grand air I wish to consult you about my father He is a living man but sits like one dead He cannot think His words mean nothing but he is not sick He fell on the dikes Hey What cried the doctor beginning to listen Hans told the whole story in an incoherent way dashing off a tear once or twice as he talked and finally ending with an earnest Oh do see him mynheer His body is well it is only his mind I know that this money is not enough but take it mynheer I will earn more I know I will Oh I will toil for you all my life if you will but cure my father What was the matter with the old doctor A brightness like sunlight beamed from his face His eyes were kind and moist the hand that had lately clutched his cane as if preparing to strike was laid gently upon Hans s shoulder Put up your money boy I do not want it We will see your father It s hopeless I fear How long did you say Ten years mynheer sobbed Hans radiant with sudden hope Ah a bad case but I shall see him Let me think Today I start for Leyden to return in a week then you may expect me Where is it A mile south of Broek mynheer near the canal It is only a poor broken down hut Any of the children thereabout can point it out to your honor added Hans with a heavy sigh They are all half afraid of the place they call it the idiot s cottage That will do said the doctor hurrying on with a bright backward nod at Hans I shall be there A hopeless case he muttered to himself but the boy pleases me His eye is like my poor Laurens s Confound it shall I never forget that young scoundrel And scowling more darkly than ever the doctor pursued his silent way Again Hans was skating toward Amsterdam on the squeaking wooden runners again his fingers tingled against the money in his pocket again the boyish whistle rose unconsciously to his lips Shall I hurry home he was thinking to tell the good news or shall I get the waffles and the new skates first Whew I think I ll go on And so Hans bought the skates Introducing Jacob Poot and His Cousin Hans and Gretel had a fine frolic early on that Saint Nicholas s Eve There was a bright moon and their mother though she believed herself to be without any hope of her husband s improvement had been made so happy at the prospect of the meester s visit that she yielded to the children s entreaties for an hour s skating before bedtime Hans was delighted with his new skates and in his eagerness to show Gretel how perfectly they worked did many things upon the ice that caused the little maid to clasp her hands in solemn admiration They were not alone though they seemed quite unheeded by the various groups assembled upon the canal The two Van Holps and Carl Schummel were there testing their fleetness to the utmost Out of four trials Peter van Holp had won three times Consequently Carl never very amiable was in anything but a good humor He had relieved himself by taunting young Schimmelpenninck who being smaller than the others kept meekly near them without feeling exactly like one of the party but now a new thought seized Carl or rather he seized the new thought and made an onset upon his friends I say boys let s put a stop to those young ragpickers from the idiot s cottage joining the race Hilda must be crazy to think of it Katrinka Flack and Rychie Korbes are furious at the very idea of racing with the girl and for my part I don t blame them As for the boy if we ve a spark of manhood in us we will scorn the very idea of Certainly we will interposed Peter van Holp purposely mistaking Carl s meaning Who doubts it No fellow with a spark of manhood in him would refuse to let in two good skaters just because they were poor Carl wheeled about savagely Not so fast master And I d thank you not to put words in other people s mouths You d best not try it again Ha ha laughed little Voostenwalbert Schimmelpenninck delighted at the prospect of a fight and sure that if it should come to blows his favorite Peter could beat a dozen excitable fellows like Carl Something in Peter s eye made Carl glad to turn to a weaker offender He wheeled furiously upon Voost What are you shrieking about you little weasel You skinny herring you you little monkey with a long name for a tail Half a dozen bystanders and byskaters set up an applauding shout at this brave witticism and Carl feeling that he had fairly vanquished his foes was restored to partial good humor He however prudently resolved to defer plotting against Hans and Gretel until some time when Peter should not be present Just then his friend Jacob Poot was seen approaching They could not distinguish his features at first but as he was the stoutest boy in the neighborhood there could be no mistaking his form Hello Here comes Fatty exclaimed Carl And there s someone with him a slender fellow a stranger Ha ha That s like good bacon cried Ludwig A streak of lean and a streak of fat That s Jacob s English cousin put in Master Voost delighted at being able to give the information That s his English cousin and oh he s got such a funny little name Ben Dobbs He s going to stay with him until after the grand race All this time the boys had been spinning turning rolling and doing other feats upon their skates in a quiet way as they talked but now they stood still bracing themselves against the frosty air as Jacob Poot and his friend drew near This is my cousin boys said Jacob rather out of breath Benjamin Dobbs He s a John Bull and he s going to be in the race All crowded boy fashion about the newcomers Benjamin soon made up his mind that the Hollanders notwithstanding their queer gibberish were a fine set of fellows If the truth must be told Jacob had announced his cousin as Penchamin Dopps and called his a Shon Pull but as I translate every word of the conversation of our young friends it is no more than fair to mend their little attempts at English Master Dobbs felt at first decidedly awkward among his cousin s friends Though most of them had studied English and French they were shy about attempting to speak either and he made very funny blunders when he tried to converse in Dutch He had learned that vrouw meant wife and ja yes and spoorweg railway kanaals canals stoomboot steamboat ophaalbruggen drawbridges buiten plasten country seats mynheer mister tweegevegt duel or two fights koper copper zadel saddle but he could not make a sentence out of these nor use the long list of phrases he had learned in his Dutch dialogues The topics of the latter were fine but were never alluded to by the boys Like the poor fellow who had learned in Ollendorf to ask in faultless German Have you seen my grandmother s red cow and when he reached Germany discovered that he had no occasion to inquire after that interesting animal Ben found that his book Dutch did not avail him as much as he had hoped He acquired a hearty contempt for Jan van Gorp a Hollander who wrote a book in Latin to prove that Adam and Eve spoke Dutch and he smiled a knowing smile when his uncle Poot assured him that Dutch had great likeness mit Zinglish but it vash much petter languish much petter However the fun of skating glides over all barriers of speech Through this Ben soon felt that he knew the boys well and when Jacob with a sprinkling of French and English for Ben s benefit told of a grand project they had planned his cousin could now and then put in a ja or a nod in quite a familiar way The project WAS a grand one and there was to be a fine opportunity for carrying it out for besides the allotted holiday of the Festival of Saint Nicholas four extra days were to be allowed for a general cleaning of the schoolhouse Jacob and Ben had obtained permission to go on a long skating journey no less a one than from Broek to The Hague the capital of Holland a distance of nearly fifty miles And now boys added Jacob when he had told the plan who will go with us I will I will cried the boys eagerly And so will I ventured little Voostenwalbert Ha ha laughed Jacob holding his fat sides and shaking his puffy cheeks YOU go Such a little fellow as you Why youngster you haven t left off your pads yet Now in Holland very young children wear a thin padded cushion around their heads surmounted with a framework of whalebone and ribbon to protect them in case of a fall and it is the dividing line between babyhood and childhood when they leave it off Voost had arrived at this dignity several years before consequently Jacob s insult was rather to great for endurance Look out what you say he squeaked Lucky for you when you can leave off YOUR pads you re padded all over Ha ha roared all the boys except Master Dobbs who could not understand Ha ha and the good natured Jacob laughed more than any It ish my fat yaw he say I bees pad mit fat he explained to Ben So a vote was passed unanimously in favor of allowing the now popular Voost to join the party if his parents would consent Good night sang out the happy youngster skating homeward with all his might Good night We can stop at Haarlem Jacob and show your cousin the big organ said Peter van Holp eagerly and at Leyden too where there s no end to the sights and spend a day and night at the Hague for my married sister who lives there will be delighted to see us and the next morning we can start for home All right responded Jacob who was not much of a talker Ludwig had been regarding his brother with enthusiastic admiration Hurrah for you Pete It takes you to make plans Mother ll be as full of it as we are when we tell her we can take her love direct to sister Van Gend My but it s cold he added Cold enough to take a fellow s head off his shoulders We d better go home What if it is cold old Tender skin cried Carl who was busily practicing a step he called the double edge Great skating we should have by this time if it was as warm as it was last December Don t you know that if it wasn t an extra cold winter and an early one into the bargain we couldn t go I know it s an extra cold night anyhow said Ludwig Whew I m going home Peter van Holp took out a bulgy gold watch and holding it toward the moonlight as well as his benumbed fingers would permit called out Halloo It s nearly eight o clock Saint Nicholas is about by this time and I for one want to see the little ones stare Good night Good night cried one and all and off they started shouting singing and laughing as they flew along Where were Gretel and Hans Ah how suddenly joy sometimes comes to an end They had skated about an hour keeping aloof from the others quite contented with each other and Gretel had exclaimed Ah Hans how beautiful How fine To think that we both have skates I tell you the stork brought us good luck when they heard something It was a scream a very faint scream No one else upon the canal observed it but Hans knew its meaning too well Gretel saw him turn white in the moonlight as he busily tore off his skates The father he cried He has frightened our mother And Gretel ran after him toward the house as rapidly as she could The Festival of Saint Nicholas We all know how before the Christmas tree began to flourish in the home life of our country a certain right jolly old elf with eight tiny reindeer used to drive his sleigh load of toys up to our housetops and then bounded down the chimney to fill the stockings so hopefully hung by the fireplace His friends called his Santa Claus and those who were most intimate ventured to say Old Nick It was said that he originally came from Holland Doubtless he did but if so he certainly like many other foreigners changed his ways very much after landing upon our shores In Holland Saint Nicholas is a veritable saint and often appears in full costume with his embroidered robes glittering with gems and gold his miter his crosier and his jeweled gloves Here Santa Claus comes rollicking along on the twenty fifth of December our holy Christmas morn But in Holland Saint Nicholas visits earth on the fifth a time especially appropriated to him Early on the morning of the sixth he distributes his candies toys and treasures then vanishes for a year Christmas Day is devoted by the Hollanders to church rites and pleasant family visiting It is on Saint Nicholas s Eve that their young people become half wild with joy and expectation To some of them it is a sorry time for the saint is very candid and if any of them have been bad during the past year he is quite sure to tell them so Sometimes he gives a birch rod under his arm and advises the parents to give them scoldings in place of confections and floggings instead of toys It was well that the boys hastened to their abodes on that bright winter evening for in less than an hour afterward the saint made his appearance in half the homes of Holland He visited the king s palace and in the selfsame moment appeared in Annie Bouman s comfortable home Probably one of our silver half dollars would have purchased all that his saintship left at the peasant Bouman s but a half dollar s worth will sometimes do for the poor what hundreds of dollars may fail to do for the rich it makes them happy and grateful fills them with new peace and love Hilda van Gleck s little brothers and sisters were in a high state of excitement that night They had been admitted into the grand parlor they were dressed in their best and had been given two cakes apiece at supper Hilda was as joyous as any Why not Saint Nicholas would never cross a girl of fourteen from his list just because she was tall and looked almost like a woman On the contrary he would probably exert himself to do honor to such an august looking damsel Who could tell So she sported and laughed and danced as gaily as the youngest and was the soul of all their merry games Her father mother and grandmother looked on approvingly so did her grandfather before he spread his large red handkerchief over his face leaving only the top of his skullcap visible This kerchief was his ensign of sleep Earlier in the evening all had joined in the fun In the general hilarity there had seemed to be a difference only in bulk between grandfather and the baby Indeed a shade of solemn expectation now and then flitting across the faces of the younger members had made them seem rather more thoughtful than their elders Now the spirit of fun reigned supreme The very flames danced and capered in the polished grate A pair of prim candles that had been staring at the astral lamp began to wink at other candles far away in the mirrors There was a long bell rope suspended from the ceiling in the corner made of glass beads netted over a cord nearly as thick as your wrist It is generally hung in the shadow and made no sign but tonight it twinkled from end to end Its handle of crimson glass sent reckless dashes of red at the papered wall turning its dainty blue stripes into purple Passersby halted to catch the merry laughter floating through curtain and sash into the street then skipped on their way with a startled consciousness that the village was wide awake At last matters grew so uproarious that the grandsire s red kerchief came down from his face with a jerk What decent old gentleman could sleep in such a racket Mynheer van Gleck regarded his children with astonishment The baby even showed symptoms of hysterics It was high time to attend to business Madame suggested that if they wished to see the good Saint Nicholas they should sing the same loving invitation that had brought him the year before The baby stared and thrust his fist into his mouth as mynheer put him down upon the floor Soon he sat erect and looked with a sweet scowl at the company With his lace and embroideries and his crown of blue ribbon and whalebone for he was not quite past the tumbling age he looked like the king of the babies The other children each holding a pretty willow basket formed a ring at once and moved slowly around the little fellow lifting their eyes for the saint to whom they were about to address themselves was yet in mysterious quarters Madame commenced playing softly upon the piano Soon the voices rose gentle youthful voices rendered all the sweeter for their tremor Welcome friend Saint Nicholas welcome Bring no rod for us tonight While our voices bid thee welcome Every heart with joy is light Tell us every fault and failing We will bear thy keenest railing So we sing so we sing Thou shalt tell us everything Welcome friend Saint Nicholas welcome Welcome to this merry band Happy children greet thee welcome Thou art glad ning all the land Fill each empty hand and basket Tis thy little ones who ask it So we sing so we sing Thou wilt bring us everything During the chorus sundry glances half in eagerness half in dread had been cast toward the polished folding doors Now a loud knocking was heard The circle was broken in an instant Some of the little ones with a strange mixture of fear and delight pressed against their mother s knee Grandfather bent forward with his chin resting upon his hand Grandmother lifted her spectacles Mynheer van Gleck seated by the fireplace slowly drew his meerschaum from his mouth while Hilda and the other children settled themselves beside him in an expectant group The knocking was heard again Come in said madame softly The door slowly opened and Saint Nicholas in full array stood before them You could have heard a pin drop Soon he spoke What a mysterious majesty in his voice What kindliness in his tones Karel van Gleck I am pleased to greet thee and thy honored vrouw Kathrine and thy son and his good vrouw Annie Children I greet ye all Hendrick Hilda Broom Katy Huygens and Lucretia And thy cousins Wolfert Diedrich Mayken Voost and Katrina Good children ye have been in the main since I last accosted ye Diedrich was rude at the Haarlem fair last fall but he has tried to atone for it since Mayken has failed of late in her lessons and too many sweets and trifles have gone to her lips and too few stivers to her charity box Diedrich I trust will be a polite manly boy for the future and Mayken will endeavor to shine as a student Let her remember too that economy and thrift are needed in the foundation of a worthy and generous life Little Katy has been cruel to the cat more than once Saint Nicholas can hear the cat cry when its tail is pulled I will forgive her if she will remember from this hour that the smallest dumb creatures have feelings and must not be abused As Katy burst into a frightened cry the saint graciously remained silent until she was soothed Master Broom he resumed I warn thee that the boys who are in the habit of putting snuff upon the foot stove of the schoolmistress may one day be discovered and receive a flogging Master Broom colored and stared in great astonishment But thou art such an excellent scholar I shall make thee no further reproof Thou Hendrick didst distinguish thyself in the archery match last spring and hit the Doel though the bird was swung before it to unsteady thine eye I give thee credit for excelling in manly sport and exercise though I must not unduly countenance thy boat racing since it leaves thee little time for thy proper studies Lucretia and Hilda shall have a blessed sleep tonight The consciousness of kindness to the poor devotion in their souls and cheerful hearty obedience to household rule will render them happy With one and all I avow myself well content Goodness industry benevolence and thrift have prevailed in your midst Therefore my blessing upon you and may the new year find all treading the paths of obedience wisdom and love Tomorrow you shall find more substantial proofs that I have been in your midst Farewell With these words came a great shower of sugarplums upon a linen sheet spread out in front of the doors A general scramble followed The children fairly tumbled over each other in their eagerness to fill their baskets Madame cautiously held the baby down in their midst till the chubby little fists were filled Then the bravest of the youngsters sprang up and burst open the closed doors In vain they peered into the mysterious apartment Saint Nicholas was nowhere to be seen Soon there was a general rush to another room where stood a table covered with the finest and whitest of linen damask Each child in a flutter of excitement laid a shoe upon it The door was then carefully locked and its key hidden in the mother s bedroom Next followed goodnight kisses a grand family procession to the upper floor merry farewells at bedroom doors and silence at last reigned in the Van Gleck mansion Early the next morning the door was solemnly unlocked and opened in the presence of the assembled household when lo a sight appeared proving Saint Nicholas to be a saint of his word Every shoe was filled to overflowing and beside each stood many a colored pile The table was heavy with its load of presents candies toys trinkets books and other articles Everyone had gifts from the grandfather down to the baby Little Katy clapped her hands with glee and vowed inwardly that the cat should never know another moment s grief Hendrick capered about the room flourishing a superb bow and arrows over his head Hilda laughed with delight as she opened a crimson box and drew forth its glittering contents The rest chuckled and said Oh and Ah over their treasures very much as we did here in America on last Christmas Day With her glittering necklace in her hands and a pile of books in her arms Hilda stole towards her parents and held up her beaming face for a kiss There was such an earnest tender look in her bright eyes that her mother breathed a blessing as she leaned over her I am delighted with this book Thank you Father she said touching the top one with her chin I shall read it all day long Aye sweetheart said mynheer you cannot do better There is no one like Father Cats If my daughter learns his Moral Emblems by heart the mother and I may keep silent The work you have there is the Emblems his best work You will find it enriched with rare engravings from Van de Venne Considering that the back of the book was turned away mynheer certainly showed a surprising familiarity with an unopened volume presented by Saint Nicholas It was strange too that the saint should have found certain things made by the elder children and had actually placed them upon the table labeled with parents and grandparents names But all were too much absorbed in happiness to notice slight inconsistencies Hilda saw on her father s face the rapt expression he always wore when he spoke of Jakob Cats so he put her armful of books upon the table and resigned herself to listen Old Father Cats my child was a great poet not a writer of plays like the Englishman Shakespeare who lived in his time I have read them in the German and very good they are very very good but not like Father Cats Cats sees no daggers in the air he has no white women falling in love with dusky Moors no young fools sighing to be a lady s glove no crazy princes mistaking respectable old gentlemen for rats No no He writes only sense It is great wisdom in little bundles a bundle for every day of your life You can guide a state with Cats s poems and you can put a little baby to sleep with his pretty songs He was one of the greatest men of Holland When I take you to The Hague I will show you the Kloosterkerk where he lies buried THERE was a man for you to study my sons He was good through and through What did he say O Lord let me obtain this from Thee To live with patience and to die with pleasure Did patience mean folding his hands No he was a lawyer statesman ambassador farmer philosopher historian and poet He was keeper of the Great Seal of Holland He was a Bah there is too much noise here I cannot talk And mynheer looking with great astonishment into the bowl of his meerschaum for it had gone out nodded to his vrouw and left the apartment in great haste The fact is his discourse had been accompanied throughout with a subdued chorus of barking dogs squeaking cats and bleating lambs to say nothing of a noisy ivory cricket that the baby was whirling with infinite delight At the last little Huygens taking advantage of the increasing loudness of mynheer s tones had ventured a blast on his new trumpet and Wolfert had hastily attempted an accompaniment on the drum This had brought matters to a crisis and it was good for the little creatures that it had The saint had left no ticket for them to attend a lecture on Jakob Cats It was not an appointed part of the ceremonies Therefore when the youngsters saw that the mother looked neither frightened nor offended they gathered new courage The grand chorus rose triumphant and frolic and joy reigned supreme Good Saint Nicholas For the sake of the young Hollanders I for one am willing to acknowledge him and defend his reality against all unbelievers Carl Schummel was quite busy during that day assuring little children confidentially that not Saint Nicholas but their own fathers and mothers had produced the oracle and loaded the tables But WE know better than that And yet if this were a saint why did he not visit the Brinker cottage that night Why was that one home so dark and sorrowful passed by What the Boys Saw and Did in Amsterdam Are we all here cried Peter in high glee as the party assembled upon the canal early the next morning equipped for their skating journey Let me see As Jacob has made me captain I must call the roll Carl Schummel you here Ya Jacob Poot Ya Benjamin Dobbs Ya a Lambert van Mounen Ya That s lucky Couldn t get on without YOU as you re the only one who can speak English Ludwig van Holp Ya Voostenwalbert Schimmelpenninck No answer Ah the little rogue has been kept at home Now boys it s just eight o clock glorious weather and the Y is as firm as a rock We ll be at Amsterdam in thirty minutes One two three START True enough in less than half an hour they had crossed a dike of solid masonry and were in the very heart of the great metropolis of the Netherlands a walled city of ninety five islands and nearly two hundred bridges Although Ben had been there twice since his arrival in Holland he saw much to excite wonder but his Dutch comrades having lived nearby all their lives considered it the most matter of course place in the world Everything interested Ben the tall houses with their forked chimneys and gable ends facing the street the merchants ware rooms perched high up under the roofs of their dwellings with long armlike cranes hoisting and lowering goods past the household windows the grand public buildings erected upon wooden piles driven deep into the marshy ground the narrow streets the canals crossing the city everywhere the bridges the locks the various costumes and strangest of all shops and dwellings crouching close to the fronts of the churches sending their long disproportionate chimneys far upward along the sacred walls If he looked up he saw tall leaning houses seeming to pierce the sky with their shining roofs If he looked down there was the queer street without crossing or curb nothing to separate the cobblestone pavement from the footpath of brick and if he rested his eyes halfway he saw complicated little mirrors spionnen fastened upon the outside of nearly every window so arranged that the inmates of the houses could observe all that was going on in the street or inspect whoever might be knocking at the door without being seen themselves Sometimes a dogcart heaped with wooden ware passed him then a donkey bearing a pair of panniers filled with crockery or glass then a sled driven over the bare cobblestones the runners kept greased with a dripping oil rag so that it might run easily and then perhaps a showy but clumsy family carriage drawn by the brownest of Flanders horses swinging the whitest of snowy tails The city was in full festival array Every shop was gorgeous in honor of Saint Nicholas Captain Peter was forced more than once to order his men away from the tempting show windows where everything that is has been or can be thought of in the way of toys was displayed Holland is famous for this branch of manufacture Every possible thing is copied in miniature for the benefit of the little ones the intricate mechanical toys that a Dutch youngster tumbles about in stolid unconcern would create a stir in our patent office Ben laughed outright at some of the mimic fishing boats They were so heavy and stumpy so like the queer craft that he had seen about Rotterdam The tiny trekschuiten however only a foot or two long and fitted out complete made his heart ache He so longed to buy one at once for his little brother in England He had no money to spare for with true Dutch prudence the party had agreed to take with them merely the sum required for each boy s expenses and to consign the purse to Peter for safekeeping Consequently Master Ben concluded to devote all his energies to sight seeing and to think as seldom as possible of little Robby He made a hasty call at the Marine school and envied the sailor students their full rigged brig and their sleeping berths swung over their trunks or lockers he peeped into the Jews Quarter of the city where the rich diamond cutters and squalid old clothesmen dwell and wisely resolved to keep away from it he also enjoyed hasty glimpses of the four principal avenues of Amsterdam the Prinsengracht Keizersgracht Herengracht and Singel These are semicircular in form and the first three average more than two miles in length A canal runs through the center of each with a well paved road on either side lined with stately buildings Rows of naked elms bordering the canal cast a network of shadows over its frozen surface and everything was so clean and bright that Ben told Lambert it seemed to him like petrified neatness Fortunately the weather was cold enough to put a stop to the usual street flooding and window washing or our young excursionists might have been drenched more than once Sweeping mopping and scrubbing form a passion with Dutch housewives and to soil their spotless mansions is considered scarcely less than a crime Everywhere a hearty contempt is felt for those who neglect to rub the soles of their shoes to a polish before crossing the doorsill and in certain places visitors are expected to remove their heavy shoes before entering Sir William Temple in his memoirs of What Passed in Christendom from sixteen seventy two to sixteen seventy nine tells a story of a pompous magistrate going to visit a lady of Amsterdam A stout Holland lass opened the door and told him in a breath that the lady was at home and that his shoes were not very clean Without another word she took the astonished man up by both arms threw him across her back carried him through two rooms set him down at the bottom of the stairs seized a pair of slippers that stood there and put them upon his feet Then and not until then she spoke telling him that his mistress was on the floor above and that he might go up While Ben was skating with his friends upon the crowded canals of the city he found it difficult to believe that the sleepy Dutchmen he saw around him smoking their pipes so leisurely and looking as though their hats might be knocked off their heads without their making any resistance were capable of those outbreaks that had taken place in Holland that they were really fellow countrymen of the brave devoted heroes of whom he had read in Dutch history As his party skimmed lightly along he told Van Mounen of a burial riot which in sixteen ninety six had occurred in that very city where the women and children turned out as well as the men and formed mock funeral processions through the town to show the burgomasters that certain new regulations with regard to burying the dead would not be acceded to how at last they grew so unmanageable and threatened so much damage to the city that the burgomasters were glad to recall the offensive law There s the corner said Jacob pointing to some large buildings where about fifteen years ago the great corn houses sank down in the mud They were strong affairs and set up on good piles but they had over seven million pounds of corn in them and that was too much It was a long story for Jacob to tell and he stopped to rest How do you know there were seven million pounds in them asked Carl sharply You were in your swaddling clothes then My father knows all about it was Jacob s suggestive reply Rousing himself with an effort he continued Ben likes pictures Show him some All right said the captain If we had time Benjamin said Lambert van Mounen in English I should like to take you to the City Hall or Stadhuis There are building piles for you It is built on nearly fourteen thousand of them driven seventy feet into the ground But what I wish you to see there is the big picture of Van Speyk blowing up his ship great picture Van WHO asked Ben Van Speyk Don t you remember He was in the height of an engagement with the Belgians and when he found that they had the better of him and would capture his ship he blew it up and himself too rather than yield to the enemy Wasn t that Van Tromp Oh no Van Tromp was another brave fellow They ve a monument to him down at Delftshaven the place where the Pilgrims took ship for America Well what about Van Tromp He was a great Dutch admiral wasn t he Yes he was in more than thirty sea fights He beat the Spanish fleet and an English one and then fastened a broom to his masthead to show that he had swept the English from the sea Takes the Dutch to beat my boy Hold up cried Ben Broom or no broom the English conquered him at last I remember all about it now He was killed somewhere on the Dutch coast in an engagement in which the English fleet was victorious Too bad he added maliciously wasn t it Ahem Where are we exclaimed Lambert changing the subject Halloo The others are way ahead of us all but Jacob Whew How fat he is He ll break down before we re halfway Ben of course enjoyed skating beside Lambert who though a staunch Hollander had been educated near London and could speak English as fluently as Dutch but he was not sorry when Captain van Holp called out Skates off There s the museum It was open and there was no charge on that day for admission In they went shuffling as boys will when they have a chance just to hear the sound of their shoes on the polished floor This museum is in fact a picture gallery where some of the finest works of the Dutch masters are to be seen besides nearly two hundred portfolios of rare engravings Ben noticed at once that some of the pictures were hung on panels fastened to the wall with hinges These could be swung forward like a window shutter thus enabling the subject to be seen in the best light The plan served them well in viewing a small group by Gerard Douw called the Evening School enabling them to observe its exquisite finish and the wonderful way in which the picture seemed to be lit through its own windows Peter pointed out the beauties of another picture by Douw called The Hermit and he also told them some interesting anecdotes of the artist who was born at Leyden in sixteen thirteen Three days painting a broom handle echoed Carl in astonishment while the captain was giving some instances of Douw s extreme slowness of execution Yes sir three days And it is said that he spent five in finishing one hand in a lady s portrait You see how very bright and minute everything is in this picture His unfinished works were kept carefully covered and his painting materials were put away in airtight boxes as soon as he had finished using them for the day According to all accounts the studio itself must have been as close as a bandbox The artist always entered it on tiptoe besides sitting still before he commenced work until the slight dust caused by his entrance had settled I have read somewhere that his paintings are improved by being viewed through a magnifying glass He strained his eyes so badly with the extra finishing that he was forced to wear spectacles before he was thirty At forty he could scarcely see to paint and he couldn t find a pair of glasses anywhere that would help his sight At last a poor old German woman asked him to try hers They suited him exactly and enabled him to go on painting as well as ever Humph exclaimed Ludwig indignantly That was high What did SHE do without them I wonder Oh said Peter laughing likely she had another pair At any rate she insisted upon his taking them He was so grateful that he painted a picture of the spectacles for her case and all and she sold it to a burgomaster for a yearly allowance that made her comfortable for the rest of her days Boys called Lambert in a loud whisper come look at this Bear Hunt It was a fine painting by Paul Potter a Dutch artist of the seventeenth century who produced excellent works before he was sixteen years old The boys admired it because the subject pleased them They passed carelessly by the masterpieces of Rembrandt and Van der Helst and went into raptures over an ugly picture by Van der Venne representing a sea fight between the Dutch and English They also stood spellbound before a painting of two little urchins one of whom was taking soup and the other eating an egg The principal merit in this work was that the young egg eater had kindly slobbered his face with the yolk for their entertainment An excellent representation of the Feast of Saint Nicholas next had the honor of attracting them Look Van Mounen said Ben to Lambert Could anything be better than this youngster s face He looks as if he KNOWS he deserves a whipping but hopes Saint Nicholas may not have found him out That s the kind of painting I like something that tells a story Come boys cried the captain Ten o clock time we were off They hastened to the canal Skates on Are you ready One two halloo Where s Poot Sure enough where WAS Poot A square opening had just been cut in the ice not ten yards off Peter observed it and without a word skated rapidly toward it All the others followed of course Peter looked in They all looked in then stared anxiously at each other Poot screamed Peter peering into the hole again All was still The black water gave no sign it was already glazing on top Van Mounen turned mysteriously to Ben DIDN T HE HAVE A FIT ONCE My goodness yes answered Ben in a great fright Then depend upon it he s been taken with one in the museum The boys caught his meaning Every skate was off in a twinkling Peter had the presence of mind to scoop up a capful of water from the hole and off they scampered to the rescue Alas They did indeed find poor Jacob in a fit but it was a fit of sleepiness There he lay in a recess of the gallery snoring like a trooper The chorus of laughter that followed this discovery brought an angry official to the spot What now None of this racket Here you beer barrel wake up And Master Jacob received a very unceremonious shaking As soon as Peter saw that Jacob s condition was not serious he hastened to the street to empty his unfortunate cap While he was stuffing in his handkerchief to prevent the already frozen crown from touching his head the rest of the boys came down dragging the bewildered and indignant Jacob in their midst The order to start was again given Master Poot was wide awake at last The ice was a little rough and broken just there but every boy was in high spirits Shall we go on by the canal or the river asked Peter Oh the river by all means said Carl It will be such fun they say it is perfect skating all the way but it s much farther Jacob Poot instantly became interested I vote for the canal he cried Well the canal it shall be responded the captain if all are agreed Agreed they echoed in rather a disappointed tone and Captain Peter led the way All right come on We can reach Haarlem in an hour Big Manias and Little Oddities While skating along at full speed they heard the cars from Amsterdam coming close behind them Halloo cried Ludwig glancing toward the rail track who can t beat a locomotive Let s give it a race The whistle screamed at the very idea so did the boys and at it they went For an instant the boys were ahead hurrahing with all their might only for an instant but even THAT was something This excitement over they began to travel more leisurely and indulge in conversation and frolic Sometimes they stopped to exchange a word with the guards who were stationed at certain distances along the canal These men in winter attend to keeping the surface free from obstruction and garbage After a snowstorm they are expected to sweep the feathery covering away before it hardens into a marble pretty to look at but very unwelcome to skaters Now and then the boys so far forgot their dignity as to clamber among the icebound canal boats crowded together in a widened harbor off the canal but the watchful guards would soon spy them out and order them down with a growl Nothing could be straighter than the canal upon which our party were skating and nothing straighter than the long rows of willow trees that stood bare and wispy along the bank On the opposite side lifted high above the surrounding country lay the carriage road on top of the great dike built to keep the Haarlem Lake within bounds stretching out far in the distance until it became lost in a point was the glassy canal with its many skaters its brown winged iceboats its push chairs and its queer little sleds light as cork flying over the ice by means of iron pronged sticks in the hands of the riders Ben was in ecstasy with the scene Ludwig van Holp had been thinking how strange it was that the English boy should know so much of Holland According to Lambert s account he knew more about it than the Dutch did This did not quite please our young Hollander Suddenly he thought of something that he believed would make the Shon Pull open his eyes he drew near Lambert with a triumphant Tell him about the tulips Ben caught the word tulpen Oh yes said he eagerly in English the Tulip Mania are you speaking of that I have often heard it mentioned but know very little about it It reached its height in Amsterdam didn t it Ludwig moaned the words were hard to understand but there was no mistaking the enlightened expression on Ben s face Lambert happily was quite unconscious of his young countryman s distress as he replied Yes here and in Haarlem principally but the excitement ran high all over Holland and in England too for that matter Hardly in England I think said Ben but I am not sure as I was not thereat the time Ha ha that s true unless you are over two hundred years old Well I tell you sir there never was anything like it before nor since Why persons were so crazy after tulip bulbs in those days that they paid their weight in gold for them What the weight of a man cried Ben showing such astonishment in his eyes that Ludwig fairly capered No no the weight of a BULB The first tulip was sent here from Constantinople about the year fifteen sixty It was so much admired that the rich people of Amsterdam sent to Turkey for more From that time they grew to be the rage and it lasted for years Single roots brought from one to four thousand florins and one bulb the Semper Augustus brought fifty five hundred That s more than four hundred guineas of our money interposed Ben Yes and I know I m right for I read it in a translation from Beckman only day before yesterday Well sir it was great Everyone speculated in tulips even bargemen and rag women and chimney sweeps The richest merchants were not ashamed to share the excitement People bought bulbs and sold them again at a tremendous profit without ever seeing them It grew into a kind of gambling Some became rich by it in a few days and some lost everything they had Land houses cattle and even clothing went for tulips when people had no ready money Ladies sold their jewels and finery to enable them to join in the fun Nothing else was thought of At last the States General interfered People began to see what dunces they were making of themselves and down went the price of tulips Old tulip debts couldn t be collected Creditors went to law and the law turned its back upon them debts made in gambling were not binding it said Then there was a time Thousands of rich speculators were reduced to beggary in an hour As old Beckman says The bubble was burst at last Yes and a big bubble it was said Ben who had listened with great interest By the way did you know that the name tulip came from a Turkish word signifying turban I had forgotten that answered Lambert but it s a capital idea Just fancy a party of Turks in full headgear squatted upon a lawn perfect tulip bed Ha ha Capital idea There groaned Ludwig to himself he s been telling Lambert something wonderful about tulips I knew it The fact is continued Lambert you can conjure up quite a human picture of a tulip bed in bloom especially when it is nodding and bobbing in the wind Did you ever notice it Not I It strikes me Van Mounen that you Hollanders are prodigiously fond of the flower to this day Certainly You can t have a garden without them prettiest flower that grows I think My uncle has a magnificent bed of the finest varieties at his summer house on the other side of Amsterdam I thought your uncle lived in the city So he does but his summer house or pavilion is a few miles off He has another one built out over the river We passed near it when we entered the city Everybody in Amsterdam has a pavilion somewhere if he can Do they ever live there asked Ben Bless you no They are small affairs suitable only to spend a few hours in on summer afternoons There are some beautiful ones on the southern end of the Haarlem Lake now that they ve commenced to drain it into polders it will spoil THAT fun By the way we ve passed some red roofed ones since we left home You noticed them I suppose with their little bridges and ponds and gardens and their mottoes over the doorway Ben nodded They make but little show now continued Lambert but in warm weather they are delightful After the willows sprout uncle goes to his summer house every afternoon He dozes and smokes aunt knits with her feet perched upon a foot stove never mind how hot the day my cousin Rika and the other girls fish in the lake from the windows or chat with their friends rowing by and the youngsters tumble about or hang upon the little bridges over the ditch Then they have coffee and cakes beside a great bunch of water lilies on the table It s very fine I can tell you only between ourselves though I was born here I shall never fancy the odor of stagnant water that hangs about most of the summer houses Nearly every one you see is built over a ditch Probably I feel it more from having lived so long in England Perhaps I shall notice it too said Ben if a thaw comes The early winter has covered up the fragrant waters for my benefit much obliged to it Holland without this glorious skating wouldn t be the same thing at all How very different you are from the Poots exclaimed Lambert who had been listening in a sort of brown study And yet you are cousins I cannot understand it We ARE cousins or rather we have always considered ourselves such but the relationship is not very close Our grandmothers were half sisters MY side of the family is entirely English while he is entirely Dutch Old Great grandfather Poot married twice you see and I am a descendant of his English wife I like Jacob though better than half of my English cousins put together He is the truest hearted best natured boy I ever knew Strange as you may think it my father became accidentally acquainted with Jacob s father while on a business visit to Rotterdam They soon talked over their relationship in French by the way and they have corresponded in the language ever since Queer things come about in this world My sister Jenny would open her eyes at some of Aunt Poot s ways Aunt is a thorough lady but so different from mother and the house too and furniture and way of living everything is different Of course assented Lambert complacently as if to say You could scarcely expect such general perfection anywhere else than in Holland But you will have all the more to tell Jenny when you go back Yes indeed I can say one thing if cleanliness is as they claim next to godliness Broek is safe It is the cleanest place I ever saw in my life Why my Aunt Poot rich as she is scrubs half the time and her house looks as if it were varnished all over I wrote to mother yesterday that I could see my double always with me feet to feet in the polished floor of the dining room Your DOUBLE That word puzzles me what do you mean Oh my reflection my apparition Ben Dobbs number two Ah I see exclaimed Van Mounen Have you ever been in your Aunt Poot s grand parlor Ben laughed Only once and that was on the day of my arrival Jacob says I shall have no chance of entering it again until the time of his sister Kanau s wedding the week after Christmas Father has consented that I shall remain to witness the great event Every Saturday Aunt Poot and her fat Kate go into that parlor and sweep and polish and scrub then it is darkened and closed until Saturday comes again not a soul enters it in the meantime but the schoonmaken as she calls it must be done just the same That is nothing Every parlor in Broek meets with the same treatment said Lambert What do you think of those moving figures in her neighbor s garden Oh they re well enough the swans must seem really alive gliding about the pond in summer but that nodding mandarin in the corner under the chestnut trees is ridiculous only fit for children to laugh at And then the stiff garden patches and the trees all trimmed and painted Excuse me Van Mounen but I shall never learn to admire Dutch taste It will take time answered Lambert condescendingly but you are sure to agree with it at last I saw much to admire in England and I hope I shall be sent back with you to study at Oxford but take everything together I like Holland best Of course you do said Ben in a tone of hearty approval You wouldn t be a good Hollander if you didn t Nothing like loving one s country It is strange though to have such a warm feeling for such a cold place If we were not exercising all the time we should freeze outright Lambert laughed That s your English blood Benjamin I M not cold And look at the skaters here on the canal they re red as roses and happy as lords Halloo good Captain van Holp called out Lambert in Dutch what say you to stopping at yonder farmhouse and warming our toes Who is cold asked Peter turning around Benjamin Dobbs Benjamin Dobbs shall be warmed and the party was brought to a halt On the Way to Haarlem On approaching the door of the farmhouse the boys suddenly found themselves in the midst of a lively domestic scene A burly Dutchman came rushing out closely followed by his dear vrouw and she was beating him smartly with her long handled warming pan The expression on her face gave our boys so little promise of a kind reception that they prudently resolved to carry their toes elsewhere to be warmed The next cottage proved to be more inviting Its low roof of bright red tiles extended over the cow stable that clean as could be nestled close to the main building A neat peaceful looking old woman sat at one window knitting At the other could be discerned part of the profile of a fat figure that pipe in mouth sat behind the shining little panes and snowy curtain In answer to Peter s subdued knock a fair haired rosy cheeked lass in holiday attire opened the upper half of the green door which was divided across the middle and inquired their errand May we enter and warm ourselves jufvrouw asked the captain respectfully Yes and welcome was the reply as the lower half of the door swung softly toward its mate Every boy before entering rubbed long and faithfully upon the rough mat and each made his best bow to the old lady and gentleman at the window Ben was half inclined to think that these personages were automata like the moving figures in the garden at Broek for they both nodded their heads slowly in precisely the same way and both went on with their employment as steadily and stiffly as though they worked by machinery The old man puffed puffed and his vrouw clicked her knitting needles as if regulated by internal cog wheels Even the real smoke issuing from the motionless pipe gave no convincing proof that they were human But the rosy cheeked maiden Ah how she bustled about How she gave the boys polished high backed chairs to sit upon how she made the fire blaze as if it were inspired how she made Jacob Poot almost weep for joy by bringing forth a great square of gingerbread and a stone jug of sour wine How she laughed and nodded as the boys ate like wild animals on good behavior and how blank she looked when Ben politely but firmly refused to take any black bread and sauerkraut How she pulled off Jacob s mitten which was torn at the thumb and mended it before his eyes biting off the thread with her whit teeth and saying Now it will be warmer as she bit and finally how she shook hands with every boy in turn and throwing a deprecating glance at the female automaton insisted upon filling their pockets with gingerbread All this time the knitting needles clicked on and the pipe never missed a puff When the boys were fairly on their way again they came in sight of the Zwanenburg Castle with its massive stone front and its gateway towers each surmounted with a sculptured swan Halfweg boys said Peter off with your skates You see explained Lambert to his companions the Y and the Haarlem Lake meeting here make it rather troublesome The river is five feet higher than the land so we must have everything strong in the way of dikes and sluice gates or there would be wet work at once The sluice arrangements are supposed to be something extra We will walk over them and you shall see enough to make you open your eyes The spring water of the lake they say has the most wonderful bleaching powers of any in the world all the great Haarlem bleacheries use it I can t say much upon that subject but I can tell you ONE thing from personal experience What is that Why the lake is full of the biggest eels you ever saw I ve caught them here often perfectly prodigious I tell you they re sometimes a match for a fellow they d almost wriggle your arm from the socket if you were not on your guard But you re not interested in eels I perceive The castle s a big affair isn t it Yes What do those swans mean Anything asked Ben looking up at the stone gate towers The swan is held almost in reverence by us Hollanders These give the building its name Zwanenburg swan castle That is all I know This is a very important spot for it is here that the wise ones hold council with regard to dike matters The castle was once the residence of the celebrated Christian Brunings What about HIM asked Ben Peter could answer you better than I said Lambert if you could only understand each other or were not such cowards about leaving your mother tongues But I have often heard my grandfather speak of Brunings He is never tired of telling us of the great engineer how good he was and how learned and how when he died the whole country seemed to mourn as for a friend He belonged to a great many learned societies and was at the head of the State Department intrusted with the care of the dikes and other defences against the sea There s no counting the improvements he made in dikes and sluices and water mills and all that kind of thing We Hollanders you know consider our great engineers as the highest of public benefactors Brunings died years ago they ve a monument to his memory in the cathedral of Haarlem I have seen his portrait and I tell you Ben he was right noble looking No wonder the castle looks so stiff and proud It is something to have given shelter to such a man Yes indeed said Ben I wonder Van Mounen whether you or I will ever give any old building a right to feel so proud Heigh ho There s a great deal to be done yet in this world and some of us who are boys now will have to do it Look to your shoe latchet Van It s unfastened A Catastrophe It was nearly one o clock when Captain van Holp and his command entered the grand old city of Haarlem They had skated nearly seventeen miles since morning and were still as fresh as young eagles From the youngest Ludwig van Holp who was just fourteen to the eldest no less a personage than the captain himself a veteran of seventeen there was but one opinion that this was the greatest frolic of their lives To be sure Jacob Poot had become rather short of breath during the last mile of two and perhaps he felt ready for another nap but there was enough jollity in him yet for a dozen Even Carl Schummel who had become very intimate with Ludwig during the excursion forgot to be ill natured As for Peter he was the happiest of the happy and had sung and whistled so joyously while skating that the staidest passersby had smiled as they listened Come boys It s nearly tiffin hour he said as they neared a coffeehouse on the main street We must have something more solid than the pretty maiden s gingerbread and the captain plunged his hands into his pockets as if to say There s money enough here to feed an army Halloo cried Lambert What ails the man Peter pale and staring was clapping his hands upon his breast and sides He looked like one suddenly becoming deranged He s sick cried Ben No he s lost something said Carl Peter could only gasp The pocketbook with all our money in it it s gone For an instant all were too much startled to speak Carl at last came out with a gruff No sense in letting one fellow have all the money I said so from the first Look in your other pocket I did It isn t there Open your underjacket Peter obeyed mechanically He even took off his hat and looked into it then thrust his hand desperately into every pocket It s gone boys he said at last in a hopeless tone No tiffin for us nor dinner either What is to be done We can t get on without money If we were in Amsterdam I could get as much as we want but there is not a man in Haarlem from whom I can borrow a stiver Doesn t one of you know anyone here who would lend us a few guilders Each boy looked into five blank faces Then something like a smile passed around the circle but it got sadly knotted up when it reached Carl That wouldn t do he said crossly I know some people here rich ones too but father would flog me soundly if I borrowed a cent from anyone He has An honest man need not borrow written over the gateway of his summer house Humph responded Peter not particularly admiring the sentiment just at that moment The boys grew desperately hungry at once It wash my fault said Jacob in a penitent tone to Ben I say first petter all de boys put zair pursh into Van Holp s monish Nonsense Jacob You did it all for the best Ben said this in such a sprightly tone that the two Van Holps and Carl felt sure that he had proposed a plan that would relieve the party at once What what Tell us Van Mounen they cried He says it is not Jacob s fault that the money is lost that he did it for the best when he proposed that Van Holp should put all of our money into his purse Is that all said Ludwig dismally He need not have made such a fuss in just saying THAT How much money have we lost Don t you remember said Peter We each put in exactly ten guilders The purse had sixty guilders in it I am the stupidest fellow in the world little Schimmelpenninck would have made you a better captain I could pommel myself for bringing such a disappointment upon you Do it then growled Carl Pooh he added we all know that it was an accident but that doesn t help matters We must have money Van Holp even if you have to sell your wonderful watch Sell my mother s birthday present Never I will sell my coat my hat anything but my watch Come come said Jacob pleasantly we are making too much of this affair We can go home and start again in a day or two YOU may be able to get another ten guilder piece said Carl but the rest of us will not find it so easy If we go home we stay home you may depend Our captain whose good nature had not yet forsaken him for a moment grew indignant Do you think that I will let you suffer for my carelessness he exclaimed I have three times sixty guilders in my strong box at home Oh I beg your pardon said Carl hastily adding in a surlier tone Well I see no better way than to go back hungry I see a better plan than that said the captain What is it cried all the boys Why to make the best of a bad business and go back pleasantly and like men said Peter looking so gallant and handsome as he turned his frank face and clear blue eyes upon them that they caught his spirit Ho for the captain they shouted Now boys we may as well make up our minds there s no place like Broek after all and that we mean to be there in two hours Is that agreed to Agreed cried all as they ran to the canal On with your skates Are you ready Here Jacob let me help you Now One two three start And the boyish faces that left Haarlem at that signal were nearly as bright as those that had entered it with Captain Peter half an hour before Hans Donder and Blixin cried Carl angrily before the party had skated twenty yards from the city gates if here isn t that wooden skate ragamuffin in the patched leather breeches That fellow is everywhere confound him We ll be lucky he added in as sneering a tone as he dared to assume if our captain doesn t order us to halt and shake hands with him Your captain is a terrible fellow said Peter pleasantly but this is a false alarm Carl I cannot spy your bugbear anywhere among the skaters Ah there he is Why what is the matter with the lad Poor Hans His face was pale his lips compressed He skated like one under the effects of a fearful dream Just as he was passing Peter hailed him Good day Hans Brinker Hans s countenance brightened at once Ah mynheer is that you It is well we meet Just like his impertinence hissed Carl Schummel darting scornfully past his companions who seemed inclined to linger with their captain I am glad to see you Hans responded Peter cheerfully but you look troubled Can I serve you I have a trouble mynheer answered Hans casting down his eyes Then lifting them again with almost a happy expression he added But it is Hans who can help Mynheer van Holp THIS time How asked Peter making in his blunt Dutch way no attempt to conceal his surprise By giving you THIS mynheer And Hans held forth the missing purse Hurrah shouted the boys taking their cold hands from their pockets to wave them joyfully in the air But Peter said Thank you Hans Brinker in a tone that made Hans feel as if the king had knelt to him The shout of the delighted boys had reached the muffled ears of the fine young gentleman who under a full pressure of pent up wrath was skating toward Amsterdam A Yankee boy would have wheeled about at once and hastened to satisfy his curiosity But Carl only halted and with his back toward his party wondered what on earth had happened There he stood immovable until feeling sure that nothing but the prospect of something to eat could have made them hurrah so heartily he turned and skated slowly toward his excited comrades In the meantime Peter had drawn Hans aside from the rest How did you know it was my purse he asked You paid me three guilders yesterday mynheer for making the whitewood chain telling me that I must buy skates Yes I remember I saw your purse then It was of yellow leather And where did you find it today I left my home this morning mynheer in great trouble and as I skated I took no heed until I stumbled against some lumber and while I was rubbing my knee I saw your purse nearly hidden under a log That place Ah I remember now Just as we were passing it I pulled my tippet from my pocket and probably flipped out the purse at the same time It would have been gone but for you Hans Here pouring out the contents you must give us the pleasure of dividing the money with you No mynheer answered Hans He spoke quietly without pretence or any grace of manner but Peter somehow felt rebuked and put the silver back without a word I like that boy rich or poor he thought to himself then added aloud May I ask about this trouble of yours Hans Ah mynheer it is a sad case but I have waited here too long I am going to Leyden to see the great doctor Boekman doctor Boekman exclaimed Peter in astonishment Yes mynheer and I have not a moment to lose Good day Stay I am going that way Come my lads Shall we return to Haarlem Yes cried the boys eagerly and off they started Now said Peter drawing near Hans both skimming the ice so easily and lightly as they skated on together that they seemed scarcely conscious of moving We are going to stop at Leyden and if you are going there only with a message to doctor Boekman cannot I do the errand for you The boys may be too tired to skate so far today but I will promise to see him early tomorrow if he is to be found in the city Ah mynheer that would be serving me indeed it is not the distance I dread but leaving my mother so long Is she ill No mynheer It is the father You may have heard it how he has been without wit for many a year ever since the great Schlossen Mill was built but his body has been well and strong Last night the mother knelt upon the hearth to blow the peat it is his only delight to sit and watch the live embers and she will blow them into a blaze every hour of the day to please him Before she could stir he sprang upon her like a giant and held her close to the fire all the time laughing and shaking his head I was on the canal but I heard the mother scream and ran to her The father had never loosened his hold and her gown was smoking I tried to deaden the fire but with one hand he pushed me off There was no water in the cottage or I could have done better and all that time he laughed such a terrible laugh mynheer hardly a sound but all in his face I tried to pull her away but that only made it worse Then it was dreadful but could I see the mother burn I beat him beat him with a stool He tossed me away The gown was on fire I WOULD put it out I can t remember well after that I found myself upon the floor and the mother was praying It seemed to me that she was in a blaze and all the while I could hear that laugh Gretel flew to the closet and filled a porringer with the food he liked and put it upon the floor Then mynheer he left the mother and crawled to it like a little child She was not burned only a part of her clothing Ah how kind she was to him all night watching and tending him He slept in a high fever with his hands pressed to his head The mother says he has done that so much of late as though he felt pain there Ah mynheer I did not mean to tell you If the father was himself he would not harm even a kitten For a moment the two boys moved on in silence It is terrible said Peter at last How is he today Very sick mynheer Why go for doctor Boekman Hans There are others in Amsterdam who could help him perhaps Boekman is a famous man sought only by the wealthiest and they often wait upon him in vain He PROMISED mynheer he promised me yesterday to come to the father in a week But now that the change has come we cannot wait We think the poor father is dying Oh mynheer you can plead with him to come quick He will not wait a whole week and our father dying the good meester is so kind SO KIND echoed Peter in astonishment Why he is known as the crossest man in Holland He looks so because he has no fat and his head is busy but his heart is kind I know Tell the meester what I have told you mynheer and he will come I hope so Hans with all my heart You are in haste to turn homeward I see Promise me that should you need a friend you will go to my mother in Broek Tell her I bade you see her And Hans Brinker not as a reward but as a gift take a few of these guilders Hans shook his head resolutely No no mynheer I cannot take it If I could find work in Broek or at the South Mill I would be glad but it is the same story everywhere Wait until spring It is well you speak of it said Peter eagerly for my father needs help at once Your pretty chain pleased him much He said That boy has a clean cut he would be good at carving There is to be a carved portal to our new summer house and father will pay well for the job God is good cried Hans in sudden delight Oh mynheer that would be too much joy I have never tried big work but I can do it I know I can Well tell my father you are the Hans Brinker of whom I spoke He will be glad to serve you Hans stared in honest surprise Thank you mynheer Now captain shouted Carl anxious to appear as good humored as possible by way of atonement here we are in the midst of Haarlem and no word from you yet We await your orders and we re as hungry as wolves Peter made a cheerful answer and turned hurriedly to Hans Come get something to eat and I will detain you no longer What a quick wistful look Hans threw upon him Peter wondered that he had not noticed before that the poor boy was hungry Ah mynheer even now the mother may need me the father may be worse I must not wait May God care for you And nodding hastily Hans turned his face homeward and was gone Come boys sighed Peter now for our tiffin Homes It must not be supposed that our young Dutchmen had already forgotten the great skating race which was to take place on the twentieth On the contrary they had thought and spoken of it very often during the day Even Ben though he had felt more like a traveler than the rest had never once through all the sight seeing lost a certain vision of silver skates which for a week past had haunted him night and day Like a true John Bull as Jacob had called him he never doubted that his English fleetness English strength English everything could at any time enable him on the ice to put all Holland to shame and the rest of the world too for that matter Ben certainly was a superb skater He had enjoyed not half the opportunities for practicing that had fallen to his new comrades but he had improved his share to the utmost and was besides so strong of frame so supple of limb in short such a tight trim quick graceful fellow in every way that he had taken to skating as naturally as a chamois to leaping or an eagle to soaring Only to the heavy heart of poor Hans had the vision of the silver skates failed to appear during that starry winter night and the brighter sunlit day Even Gretel had seen them flitting before her as she sat beside her mother through those hours of weary watching not as prizes to be won but as treasures passing hopelessly beyond her reach Rychie Hilda and Katrinka why they had scarcely known any other thought than The race the race It will come off on the twentieth These three girls were friends Though of nearly the same age talent and station they were as different as girls could be Hilda van Gleck as you already know was a warm hearted noble girl of fourteen Rychie Korbes was beautiful to look upon far more sparkling and pretty than Hilda but not half so bright and sunny within Clouds of pride of discontent and envy had already gathered in her heart and were growing bigger and darker every day Of course these often relieved themselves very much after the manner of other clouds But who saw the storms and the weeping Only her maid or her father mother and little brother those who loved her better than all Like other clouds too hers often took queer shapes and what was really but mist and vapory fancy assumed the appearance of monster wrongs and mountains of difficulty To her mind the poor peasant girl Gretel was not a human being a God created creature like herself she was only something that meant poverty rags and dirt Such as Gretel had no right to feel to hope above all they should never cross the paths of their betters that is not in a disagreeable way They could toil and labor for them at a respectful distance even admire them if they would do it humbly but nothing more If they rebel put them down if they suffer Don t trouble me about it was Rychie s secret motto And yet how witty she was how tastefully she dressed how charmingly she sang how much feeling she displayed for pet kittens and rabbits and how completely she could bewitch sensible honest minded lads like Lambert van Mounen and Ludwig van Holp Carl was too much like her within to be an earnest admirer and perhaps he suspected the clouds He being deep and surly and always uncomfortably in earnest of course preferred the lively Katrinka whose nature was made of a hundred tinkling bells She was a coquette in her infancy a coquette in her childhood and now a coquette in her school days Without a thought of harm she coquetted with her studies her duties even her little troubles She coquetted with her mother her pet lamb her baby brother even with her own golden curls tossing them back as if she despised them Everyone liked her but who could love her She was never in earnest A pleasant face a pleasant heart a pleasant manner these satisfy for an hour Poor happy Katrinka She tinkled tinkled so merrily through their early days but life is so apt to coquette with them in turn to put all their sweet bells out of tune or to silence them one by one How different were the homes of these three girls from the tumbling old cottage where Gretel dwelt Rychie lived in a beautiful house near Amsterdam where the carved sideboards were laden with services of silver and gold and where silken tapestries hung in folds from ceiling to floor Hilda s father owned the largest mansion in Broek Its glittering roof of polished tiles and its boarded front painted in half a dozen various colors were the admiration of the neighborhood Katrinka s home not a mile distant was the finest of Dutch country seats The garden was so stiffly laid out in little paths and patches that the birds might have mistaken it for a great Chinese puzzle with all the pieces spread out ready for use But in summer it was beautiful the flowers made the best of their stiff quarters and when the gardener was not watching glowed and bent about each other in the prettiest way imaginable Such a tulip bed Why the queen of the fairies would never care for a grander city in which to hold her court But Katrinka preferred the bed of pink and white hyacinths She loved their freshness and fragrance and the lighthearted way in which their bell shaped blossoms swung in the breeze Carl was both right and wrong when he said that Katrinka and Rychie were furious at the very idea of the peasant Gretel joining in the race He had heard Rychie declare that it was Disgraceful shameful too bad which in Dutch as in English is generally the strongest expression an indignant girl can use and he had seen Katrinka nod her pretty head and heard her sweetly echo Shameful too bad as nearly like Rychie as tinkling bells can be like the voice of real anger This had satisfied him He never suspected that had Hilda not Rychie first talked with Katrinka upon the subject the bells would have jingled as willing an echo She would have said Certainly let her join us and would have skipped off thinking no more about it But now Katrinka with sweet emphasis pronounced it a shame that a goose girl a forlorn little creature like Gretel should be allowed to spoil the race Rychie Korbes being rich and powerful in a schoolgirl way had other followers besides Katrinka who were induced to share her opinions because they were either too careless or too cowardly to think for themselves Poor little Gretel Her home was sad and dark enough now Raff Brinker lay moaning upon his rough bed and his vrouw forgetting and forgiving everything bathed his forehead his lips weeping and praying that he might not die Hans as we know had started in desperation for Leyden to search for doctor Boekman and induce him if possible to come to their father at once Gretel filled with a strange dread had done the work as well as she could wiped the rough brick floor brought peat to build up the slow fire and melted ice for her mother s use This accomplished she seated herself upon a low stool near the bed and begged her mother to try to sleep awhile You are so tired she whispered Not once have you closed your eyes since that dreadful hour last night See I have straightened the willow bed in the corner and spread everything soft upon it I could find so that the mother might lie in comfort Here is your jacket Take off that pretty dress I ll fold it away very carefully and put it in the big chest before you go to sleep Dame Brinker shook her head without turning her eyes from her husband s face I can watch mother urged Gretel and I ll wake you every time the father stirs You are so pale and your eyes are so red Oh mother DO The child pleaded in vain Dame Brinker would not leave her post Gretel looked at her in troubled silence wondering whether it were very wicked to care more for one parent than for the other and sure yes quite sure that she dreaded her father while she clung to her mother with a love that was almost idolatry Hans loves the father so well she thought why cannot I Yet I could not help crying when I saw his hand bleed that day last month when he snatched the knife and now when he moans how I ache ache all over Perhaps I love him after all and God will see that I am not such a bad wicked girl as I thought Yes I love the poor father almost as Hans does not quite for Hans is stronger and does not fear him Oh will that moaning go on forever and ever Poor mother how patient she is SHE never pouts as I do about the money that went away so strangely If he only could for one instant open his eyes and look at us as Hans does and tell us where mother s guilders went I would not care for the rest Yes I would care I don t want the poor father to die to be all blue and cold like Annie Bouman s little sister I KNOW I don t Dear God I don t want Father to die Her thoughts merged into a prayer When it ended the poor child scarcely knew Soon she found herself watching a little pulse of light at the side of the fire beating faintly but steadily showing that somewhere in the dark pile there was warmth and light that would overspread it at last A large earthen cup filled with burning peat stood near the bedside Gretel had placed it there to stop the father s shivering she said She watched it as it sent a glow around the mother s form tipping her faded skirt with light and shedding a sort of newness over the threadbare bodice It was a relief to Gretel to see the lines in that weary face soften as the firelight flickered gently across it Next she counted the windowpanes broken and patched as they were and finally after tracing every crack and seam in the walls fixed her gaze upon a carved shelf made by Hans The shelf hung as high as Gretel could reach It held a large leather covered Bible with brass clasps a wedding present to Dame Brinker from the family at Heidelberg Ah how handy Hans is If he were here he could turn the father some way so the moans would stop Dear dear If this sickness lasts we shall never skate anymore I must send my new skates back to the beautiful lady Hans and I will not see the race And Gretel s eyes that had been dry before grew full of tears Never cry child said her mother soothingly This sickness may not be as bad as we think The father has lain this way before Gretel sobbed now Oh mother it is not that alone you do not know all I am very very bad and wicked YOU Gretel you so patient and good and a bright puzzled look beamed for an instant upon the child Hush lovey you ll wake him Gretel hid her face in her mother s lap and tried not to cry Her little hand so thin and brown lay in the coarse palm of her mother s creased with many a hard day s work Rychie would have shuddered to touch either yet they pressed warmly upon each other Soon Gretel looked up with that dull homely look which they say poor children in shanties are apt to have and said in a trembling voice The father tried to burn you he did I saw him and he was LAUGHING Hush child The mother s words came so suddenly and sharply that Raff Brinker dead as he was to all that was passing around him twitched slightly upon the bed Gretel said no more but plucked drearily at the jagged edge of a hole in her mother s holiday gown It had been burned there Well for Dame Brinker that the gown was woolen Haarlem The Boys Hear Voices Refreshed and rested our boys came forth from the coffeehouse just as the big clock in the square after the manner of certain Holland timekeepers was striking two with its half hour bell for half past two The captain was absorbed in thought at first for Hans Brinker s sad story still echoed in his ears Not until Ludwig rebuked him with a laughing Wake up grandfather did he reassume his position as gallant boy leader of his band Ahem this way young gentlemen They were walking through the city not on a curbed sidewalk for such a thing is rarely to be found in Holland but on the brick pavement that lay on the borders of the cobblestone carriage way without breaking its level expanse Haarlem like Amsterdam was gayer than usual in honor of Saint Nicholas A strange figure was approaching them It was a small man dressed in black with a short cloak He wore a wig and a cocked hat from which a long crepe streamer was flying Who comes here cried Ben What a queer looking object That s the aanspreeker said Lambert Someone is dead Is that the way men dress in mourning in this country Oh no The aanspreeker attends funerals and it is his business when anyone dies to notify all the friends and relatives What a strange custom Well said Lambert we needn t feel very badly about this particular death for I see another man has lately been born to the world to fill up the vacant place Ben stared How do you know that Don t you see that pretty red pincushion hanging on yonder door asked Lambert in return Yes Well that s a boy A boy What do you mean I mean that here in Haarlem whenever a boy is born the parents have a red pincushion put out at the door If our young friend had been a girl instead of a boy the cushion would have been white In some places they have much more fanciful affairs all trimmed with lace and even among the very poorest houses you will see a bit of ribbon or even a string tied on the door latch Look screamed Ben There IS a white cushion at the door of that double joined house with the funny roof I don t see any house with a funny roof Oh of course not said Ben I forgot you re a native but all the roofs are queer to me for that matter I mean the house next to that green building True enough there s a girl I tell you what captain called out Lambert slipping easily into Dutch we must get out of this street as soon as possible It s full of babies They ll set up a squall in a moment The captain laughed I shall take you to hear better music than that he said We are just in time to hear the organ of Saint Bavon The church is open today What the great Haarlem organ asked Ben That will be a treat indeed I have often read of it with its tremendous pipes and its vox humana that sounds like a giant singing The same answered Lambert van Mounen Peter was right The church was open though not for religious services Someone was playing upon the organ As the boys entered a swell of sound rushed forth to meet them It seemed to bear them one by one into the shadows of the building Louder and louder it grew until it became like the din and roar of some mighty tempest or like the ocean surging upon the shore In the midst of the tumult a tinkling bell was heard another answered then another and the storm paused as if to listen The bells grew bolder they rang out loud and clear Other deep toned bells joined in they were tolling in solemn concert ding dong ding dong The storm broke forth with redoubled fury gathering its distant thunder The boys looked at each other but did not speak It was growing serious What was that WHO screamed WHAT screamed that terrible musical scream Was it man or demon Or was it some monster shut up behind that carved brass frame behind those great silver columns some despairing monster begging screaming for freedom it was the vox humana At last an answer came soft tender loving like a mother s song The storm grew silent hidden birds sprang forth filling the air with glad ecstatic music rising higher and higher until the last faint note was lost in the distance The vox humana was stilled but in the glorious hymn of thanksgiving that now arose one could almost hear the throbbing of a human heart What did it mean That man s imploring cry should in time be met with a deep content That gratitude would give us freedom To Peter and Ben it seemed that the angels were singing Their eyes grew dim and their souls dizzy with a strange joy At last as if borne upward by invisible hands they were floating away on the music all fatigue forgotten and with no wish but to hear forever those beautiful sounds when suddenly Van Holp s sleeve was pulled impatiently and a gruff voice beside him asked How long are you going to stay here captain blinking at the ceiling like a sick rabbit It s high time we started Hush whispered Peter only half aroused Come man Let s go said Carl giving the sleeve a second pull Peter turned reluctantly He would not detain the boys against their will All but Ben were casting rather reproachful glances upon him Well boys he whispered we will go Softly now That s the greatest thing I ve seen or heard since I ve bee in Holland cried Ben enthusiastically as soon as they reached the open air It s glorious Ludwig and Carl laughed slyly at the English boy s wartaal or gibberish Jacob yawned and Peter gave Ben a look that made him instantly feel that he and Peter were not so very different after all though one hailed from Holland and the other from England And Lambert the interpreter responded with a brisk You may well say so I believe there are one or two organs nowadays that are said to be as fine but for years and years this organ of Saint Bavon was the grandest in the world Do you know how large it is asked Ben I noticed that the church itself was prodigiously high and that the organ filled the end of the great aisle almost from floor to roof That s true said Lambert and how superb the pipes looked just like grand columns of silver They re only for show you know The REAL pipes are behind them some big enough for a man to crawl through and some smaller than a baby s whistle Well sir for size the church is higher than Westminster Abbey to begin with and as you say the organ makes a tremendous show even then Father told me last night that it is one hundred and eight feet high fifty feet wide and has over five thousand pipes It has sixty four stops if you know what they are I don t and three keyboards Good for you said Ben You have a fine memory MY head is a perfect colander for figures They slip through as fast as they re poured in But other facts and historical events stay behind that s some consolation There we differ returned Van Mounen I m great on names and figures but history take it altogether seems to me to be the most hopeless kind of jumble Meantime Carl and Ludwig were having a discussion concerning some square wooden monuments they had observed in the interior of the church Ludwig declared that each bore the name of the person buried beneath and Carl insisted that they had no names but only the heraldic arms of the deceased painted on a black ground with the date of the death in gilt letters I ought to know said Carl for I walked across to the east side to look for the cannonball Mother told me was embedded there It was fired into the church in the year fifteen hundred and something by those rascally Spaniards while the services were going on There it was in the wall sure enough and while I was walking back I noticed the monuments I tell you they haven t the sign of a name on them Ask Peter said Ludwig only half convinced Carl is right replied Peter who though conversing with Jacob had overheard their dispute Well Jacob as I was saying Handel the great composer chanced to visit Haarlem and of course he at once hunted up this famous organ He gained admittance and was playing upon it with all his might when the regular organist chanced to enter the building The man stood awestruck He was a good player himself but he had never heard such music before Who is there he cried If it is not an angel or the devil it must be Handel When he discovered that it WAS the great musician he was still more mystified But how is this he said You have done impossible things no ten fingers on earth can play the passages you have given Human fingers couldn t control all the keys and stops I know it said Handel coolly and for that reason I was forced to strike some notes with the end of my nose Donder just think how the old organist must have stared Hey What exclaimed Jacob startled when Peter s animated voice suddenly became silent Haven t you heard me you rascal was the indignant rejoinder Oh yes no The fact is I heard you at first I m awake now but I do believe I ve been walking beside you half asleep stammered Jacob with such a doleful bewildered look on his face that Peter could not help laughing The Man With Four Heads After leaving the church the boys stopped nearby in the open marketplace to look at the bronze statue of Laurens Janszoon Coster who is believed by the Dutch to have been the inventor of printing This is disputed by those who award the same honor to Johannes Gutenberg of Mayence while many maintain that Faustus a servant of Coster stole his master s wooden types on a Christmas eve when the latter was at church and fled with his booty and his secret to Mayence Coster was a native of Haarlem and the Hollanders are naturally anxious to secure the credit of the invention for their illustrious townsman Certain it is that the first book he printed is kept by the city in a silver case wrapped in silk and is shown with great caution as a precious relic It is said that he first conceived the idea of printing from cutting his name upon the bark of a tree and afterward pressing a piece of paper upon the characters Of course Lambert and his English friend fully discussed this subject They also had a rather warm argument concerning another invention Lambert declared that the honor of giving both the telescope and the microscope to the world lay between Metius and Jansen both Hollanders while Ben as stoutly insisted that Roger Bacon an English monk of the thirteenth century wrote out the whole thing sir perfect descriptions of microscopes and telescopes too long before either of those other fellows was born On one subject however they both agreed that the art of curing and pickling herrings was discovered by William Beukles of Holland and that the country did perfectly right in honoring him as a national benefactor for its wealth and importance had been in a great measure due to its herring trade It is astonishing said Ben in what prodigious quantities those fish are found I don t know how it is here but on the coast of England off Yarmouth the herring shoals have been known to be six and seven feet deep with fish That is prodigious indeed said Lambert but you know your herring is derived from the German heer an army on account of a way the fish have of coming in large numbers Soon afterward while passing a cobbler s shop Ben exclaimed Halloo Lambert here is the name of one of your greatest men over a cobbler s stall Boerhaave If it were only Herman Boerhaave instead of Hendrick it would be complete Lambert knit his brows reflectively as he replied Boerhaave Boerhaave The name is perfectly familiar I remember too that he was born in sixteen sixty eight but the rest is all gone as usual There have been so many famous Hollanders you see that it is impossible for a fellow to know them all What was he Did he have two heads Or was he one of your great natural swimmers like Marco Polo He had FOUR heads answered Ben laughing for he was a great physician naturalist botanist and chemist I am full of him just now for I read his life a few weeks ago Pour out a little then said Lambert only walk faster or we shall lose sight of the other boys Well resumed Ben quickening his pace and looking with great interest at everything going on in the crowded street this doctor Boerhaave was a great anspewker A great WHAT roared Lambert Oh I beg pardon I was thinking of that man over there with the cocked hat He s an anspewker isn t he Yes He s an aanspreeker if that is what you mean to say But what about your friend with the four heads Well as I was going to say the doctor was left a penniless orphan at sixteen without education or friends Jolly beginning interposed Lambert Now don t interrupt He was a poor friendless orphan at sixteen but he was so persevering and industrious so determined to gain knowledge that he made his way and in time became one of the most learned men of Europe All the what is that Where What do you mean Why that paper on the door opposite Don t you see Two or three persons are reading it I have noticed several of these papers since I ve been here Oh that s only a health bulletin Somebody in the house is ill and to prevent a steady knocking at the door the family write an account of the patient s condition on a placard and hang it outside the door for the benefit of inquiring friends a very sensible custom I m sure Nothing strange about it that I can see Go on please You said All the and there you left me hanging I was going to say resumed Ben that all the all the how comically persons do dress here to be sure Just look at those men and women with their sugarloaf hats And see this woman ahead of us with a straw bonnet like a scoop shovel tapering to a point in the back Did ever you see anything so funny And those tremendous wooden shoes too I declare she s a beauty Oh they are only back country folk said Lambert rather impatiently You might as well let old Boerhaave drop or else shut your eyes Ha ha Well I was GOING to say all the big men of his day sought out this great professor Even Peter the Great when he came over to Holland from Russia to learn shipbuilding attended his lectures regularly By that time Boerhaave was professor of medicine and chemistry and botany in the University at Leyden He had grown to be very wealthy as a practicing physician but he used to say that the poor were his best patients because God would be their paymaster All Europe learned to love and honor him In short he became so famous that a certain mandarin of China addressed a letter to the illustrious Boerhaave physician in Europe and the letter found its way to him without any difficulty My goodness That is what I call being a public character The boys have stopped How now Captain van Holp where next We propose to move on said Van Holp There is nothing to see at this season in the Bosch The Bosch is a noble wood Benjamin a grand park where they have most magnificent trees protected by law Do you understand Ya nodded Ben as the captain proceeded Unless you all desire to visit the Museum of Natural History we may go on the grand canal again If we had more time it would be pleasant to take Benjamin up the Blue Stairs What are the Blue Stairs Lambert asked Ben They are the highest point of the Dunes You have a grand view of the ocean from there besides a fine chance to see how wonderful these dunes are One can hardly believe that the wind could ever heap up sand in so remarkable a way But we have to go through Bloemendal to get there not a very pretty village and some distance from here What do you say Oh I am ready for anything For my part I would rather steer direct for Leyden but we ll do as the captain says hey Jacob Ya dat ish goot said Jacob who felt decidedly more like taking a nap than ascending the Blue Stairs The captain was in favor of going to Leyden It s four long miles from here Full sixteen of your English miles Benjamin We have no time to lose if you wish to reach there before midnight Decide quickly boys Blue Stairs or Leyden Leyden they answered and were out of Haarlem in a twinkling admiring the lofty towerlike windmills and pretty country seats as they left the city behind them If you really wish to see Haarlem said Lambert to Ben after they had skated awhile in silence you should visit it in summer It is the greatest place in the world for beautiful flowers The walks around the city are superb and the wood with its miles of noble elms all in full feather is something to remember You need not smile old fellow at my saying full feather I was thinking of waving plumes and got my words mixed up a little But a Dutch elm beats everything it is the noblest tree on earth Ben if you except the English oak Aye said Ben solemnly IF you except the English oak And for some moments he could scarcely see the canal because Robby and Jenny kept bobbing in the air before his eyes Friends in Need In the meantime the other boys were listening to Peter s account of an incident which had occurred long ago in a part of the city where stood an ancient castle whose lord had tyrannized over the burghers of the town to such an extent that they surrounded his castle and laid siege to it Just at the last extremity when the haughty lord felt that he could hold out no longer and was prepared to sell his life as dearly as possible his lady appeared on the ramparts and offered to surrender everything provided she was permitted to bring out and retain as much of her most precious household goods as she could carry upon her back The promise was given and the lady came forth from the gateway bearing her husband upon her shoulders The burghers pledge preserved him from the fury of the troops but left them free to wreak their vengeance upon the castle Do you BELIEVE that story Captain Peter asked Carl in an incredulous tone Of course I do It is historical Why should I doubt it Simply because no woman could do it and if she could she wouldn t That is my opinion And I believe that there are many who WOULD That is to save those they really cared for said Ludwig Jacob who in spite of his fat and sleepiness was of rather a sentimental turn had listened with deep interest That is right little fellow he said nodding his head approvingly I believe every word of it I shall never marry a woman who would not be glad to do as much for ME Heaven help her cried Carl turning to gaze at the speaker Why Poot three MEN couldn t do it Perhaps not said Jacob quietly feeling that he had asked rather too much of the future missus Poot But she must be WILLING that is all Aye responded Peter s cheery voice willing heart makes nimble foot and who knows but it may make strong arms also Pete asked Ludwig changing the subject did you tell me last night that the painter Wouwerman was born in Haarlem Yes and Jacob Ruysdael and Berghem too I like Berghem because he was always good natured They say he always sang while he painted and though he died nearly two hundred years ago there are traditions still afloat concerning his pleasant laugh He was a great painter and he had a wife as cross as Xantippe They balanced each other finely said Ludwig He was kind and she was cross But Peter before I forget it wasn t that picture of Saint Hubert and the horse painted by Wouwerman You remember Father showed us an engraving from it last night Yes indeed There is a story connected with that picture Tell us cried two or three drawing closer to Peter as they skated on Wouwerman began the captain oratorically was born in sixteen twenty just four years before Berghem He was a master of his art and especially excelled in painting horses Strange as it may seem people were so long finding out his merits that even after he had arrived at the height of his excellence he was obliged to sell his pictures for very paltry prices The poor artist became completely discouraged and worst of all was over head and ears in debt One day he was talking over his troubles with his father confessor who was one of the few who recognized his genius The priest determined to assist him and accordingly lent him six hundred guilders advising him at the same time to demand a better price for his pictures Wouwerman did so and in the meantime paid his debts Matters brightened with him at once Everybody appreciated the great artist who painted such costly pictures He grew rich The six hundred guilders were returned and in gratitude Wouwerman sent also a work which he had painted representing his benefactor as Saint Hubert kneeling before his horse the very picture Ludwig of which we were speaking last night So so exclaimed Ludwig with deep interest I must take another look at the engraving as soon as we get home At that same hour while Ben was skating with his companions beside the Holland dike Robby and Jenny stood in their pretty English schoolhouse ready to join in the duties of their reading class Commence Master Robert Dobbs said the teacher page two hundred forty two Now sir mind every stop And Robby in a quick childish voice roared forth at schoolroom pitch Lesson sixty two The Hero of Haarlem Many years ago there lived in Haarlem one of the principal cities of Holland a sunny haired boy of gentle disposition His father was a sluicer that is a man whose business it was to open and close the sluices or large oaken gates that are placed at regular distances across the entrances of the canals to regulate the amount of water that shall flow into them The sluicer raises the gates more or less according to the quantity of water required and closes them carefully at night in order to avoid all possible danger of an oversupply running into the canal or the water would soon overflow it and inundate the surrounding country As a great portion of Holland is lower than the level of the sea the waters are kept from flooding the land only by means of strong dikes or barriers and by means of these sluices which are often strained to the utmost by the pressure of the rising tides Even the little children in Holland know that constant watchfulness is required to keep the rivers and ocean from overwhelming the country and that a moment s neglect of the sluicer s duty may bring ruin and death to all Very good said the teacher Now Susan One lovely autumn afternoon when the boy was about eight years old he obtained his parents consent to carry some cakes to a blind man who lived out in the country on the other side of the dike The little fellow started on his errand with a light heart and having spent an hour with his grateful old friend he bade him farewell and started on his homeward walk Trudging stoutly along the canal he noticed how the autumn rains had swollen the waters Even while humming his careless childish song he thought of his father s brave old gates and felt glad of their strength for thought he If THEY gave way where would Father and Mother be These pretty fields would all be covered with the angry waters Father always calls them the ANGRY waters I suppose he thinks they are mad at him for keeping them out so long And with these thoughts just flitting across his brain the little fellow stooped to pick the pretty flowers that grew along his way Sometimes he stopped to throw some feathery seed ball in the air and watch it as it floated away sometimes he listened to the stealthy rustling of a rabbit speeding through the grass but oftener he smiled as he recalled the happy light he had seen arise on the weary listening face of his blind old friend Now Henry said the teacher nodding to the next little reader Suddenly the boy looked around him in dismay He had not noticed that the sun was setting Now he saw that his long shadow on the grass had vanished It was growing dark he was still some distance from home and in a lonely ravine where even the blue flowers had turned to gray He quickened his footsteps and with a beating heart recalled many a nursery tale of children belated in dreary forests Just as he was bracing himself for a run he was startled by the sound of trickling water Whence did it come He looked up and saw a small hole in the dike through which a tiny stream was flowing Any child in Holland will shudder at the thought of A LEAK IN THE DIKE The boy understood the danger at a glance That little hole if the water were allowed to trickle through would soon be a large one and a terrible inundation would be the result Quick as a flash he saw his duty Throwing away his flowers the boy clambered up the heights until he reached the hole His chubby little finger was thrust in almost before he knew it The flowing was stopped Ah he thought with a chuckle of boyish delight the angry waters must stay back now Haarlem shall not be drowned while I am here This was all very well at first but the night was falling rapidly Chill vapors filled the air Our little hero began to tremble with cold and dread He shouted loudly he screamed Come here come here but no one came The cold grew more intense a numbness commencing in the tired little finger crept over his hand and arm and soon his whole body was filled with pain He shouted again Will no one come Mother Mother Alas his mother good practical soul had already locked the doors and had fully resolved to scold him on the morrow for spending the night with blind Jansen without her permission He tried to whistle Perhaps some straggling boy might heed the signal but his teeth chattered so it was impossible Then he called on God for help And the answer came through a holy resolution I will stay here till morning Now Jenny Dobbs said the teacher Jenny s eyes were glistening but she took a long breath and commenced The midnight moon looked down upon that small solitary form sitting upon a stone halfway up the dike His head was bent but he was not asleep for every now and then one restless hand rubbed feebly the outstretched arm that seemed fastened to the dike and often the pale tearful face turned quickly at some real or fancied sounds How can we know the sufferings of that long and fearful watch what falterings of purpose what childish terrors came over the boy as he thought of the warm little bed at home of his parents his brothers and sisters then looked into the cold dreary night If he drew away that tiny finger the angry waters grown angrier still would rush forth and never stop until they had swept over the town No he would hold it there till daylight if he lived He was not very sure of living What did this strange buzzing mean And then the knives that seemed pricking and piercing him from head to foot He was not certain now that he could draw his finger away even if he wished to At daybreak a clergyman returning from the bedside of a sick parishioner thought he heard groans as he walked along on the top of the dike Bending he saw far down on the side a child apparently writhing with pain In the name of wonder boy he exclaimed what are you doing there I am keeping the water from running out was the simple answer of the little hero Tell them to come quick It is needless to add that they did come quickly and that Jenny Dobbs said the teacher rather impatiently if you cannot control your feelings so as to read distinctly we will wait until you recover yourself Yes sir said Jenny quite startled It was strange but at that very moment Ben far over the sea was saying to Lambert The noble little fellow I have frequently met with an account of the incident but I never knew till now that it was really true True Of course it is said Lambert I have given you the story just as Mother told it to me years ago Why there is not a child in Holland who does not know it And Ben you may not think so but that little boy represents the spirit of the whole country Not a leak can show itself anywhere either in its politics honor or public safety that a million fingers are not ready to stop it at any cost Whew cried Master Ben Big talking that It s true talk anyway rejoined Lambert so very quietly that Ben wisely resolved to make no further comment On the Canal The skating season had commenced unusually early our boys were by no means alone upon the ice The afternoon was so fine that men women and children bent upon enjoying the holiday had flocked to the grand canal from far and near Saint Nicholas had evidently remembered the favorite pastime shining new skates were everywhere to be seen Whole families were skimming their way to Haarlem or Leyden or the neighboring villages The ice seemed fairly alive Men noticed the erect easy carriage of women and their picturesque variety of costume There were the latest fashions fresh from Paris floating past dingy moth eaten garments that had seen service through two generations coal scuttle bonnets perched over freckled faces bright with holiday smiles stiff muslin caps with wings at the sides flapping beside cheeks rosy with health and contentment furs too encircling the whitest of throats and scanty garments fluttering below faces ruddy with exercise In short every quaint and comical mixture of dry goods and flesh that Holland could furnish seemed sent to enliven the scene There were belles from Leyden and fishwives from the border villages cheese women from Gouda and prim matrons from beautiful country seats on the Haarlemmer Meer Gray headed skaters were constantly to be seen wrinkled old women with baskets upon their heads and plump little toddlers on skates clutching at their mothers gowns Some women carried their babies upon their backs firmly secured with a bright shawl The effect was pretty and graceful as they darted by or sailed slowly past now nodding to an acquaintance now chirruping and throwing soft baby talk to the muffled little ones they carried Boys and girls were chasing each other and hiding behind the one horse sleds that loaded high with peat or timber pursued their cautious way along the track marked out as safe Beautiful queenly women were there enjoyment sparkling in their quiet eyes Sometimes a long file of young men each grasping the coat of the one before him flew by with electric speed and sometimes the ice squeaked under the chair of some gorgeous old dowager or rich burgomaster s lady who very red in the nose and sharp in the eyes looked like a scare thaw invented by old Father Winter for the protection of his skating grounds The chair would be heavy with foot stoves and cushions to say nothing of the old lady Mounted upon shining runners it slid along pushed by the sleepiest of servants who looking neither to the right nor the left bent himself to his task while she cast direful glances upon the screaming little rowdies who invariably acted as bodyguard As for the men they were pictures of placid enjoyment Some were attired in ordinary citizen s dress but many looked odd enough with their short woolen coats wide breeches and big silver buckles These seemed to Ben like little boys who had by a miracle sprung suddenly into manhood and were forced to wear garments that their astonished mothers had altered in a hurry He noticed too that nearly all the men had pipes as they passed him whizzing and smoking like so many locomotives There was every variety of pipes from those of common clay to the most expensive meerschaums mounted in silver and gold Some were carved into extraordinary and fantastic shapes representing birds flowers heads bugs and dozens of other things some resembled the Dutchman s pipe that grows in our American woods some were red and many were of a pure snowy white but the most respectable were those which were ripening into a shaded brown The deeper and richer the brown of course the more honored the pipe for it was proof that the owner if honestly shading it was deliberately devoting his manhood to the effort What pipe would not be proud to be the object of such a sacrifice For a while Ben skated on in silence There was so much to engage his attention that he almost forgot his companions Part of the time he had been watching the iceboats as they flew over the great Haarlemmer Meer or lake the frozen surface of which was now plainly visible from the canal These boats had very large sails much larger in proportion than those of ordinary vessels and were set upon a triangular frame furnished with an iron runner at each corner the widest part of the triangle crossing the bow and its point stretching beyond the stem They had rudders for guiding and brakes for arresting their progress and were of all sizes and kinds from small rough affairs managed by a boy to large and beautiful ones filled with gay pleasure parties and manned by competent sailors who smoking their stumpy pipes reefed and tacked and steered with great solemnity and precision Some of the boats were painted and gilded in gaudy style and flaunted gay pennons from their mastheads others white as snow with every spotless sail rounded by the wind looked like swans borne onward by a resistless current It seemed to Ben as following his fancy he watched one of these in the distance that he could almost hear its helpless terrified cry but he soon found that the sound arose from a nearer and less romantic cause from an iceboat not fifty yards from him using its brakes to avoid a collision with a peat sled It was a rare thing for these boats to be upon the canal and their appearance generally caused no little excitement among skaters especially among the timid but today every iceboat in the country seemed afloat or rather aslide and the canal had its full share Ben though delighted at the sight was often startled at the swift approach of the resistless high winged things threatening to dart in any and every possible direction It required all his energies to keep out of the way of the passersby and to prevent those screaming little urchins from upsetting him with their sleds Once he halted to watch some boys who were making a hole in the ice preparatory to using their fishing spears Just as he concluded to start again he found himself suddenly bumped into an old lady s lap Her push chair had come upon him from the rear The old lady screamed the servant who was propelling her gave a warning hiss In another instant Ben found himself apologizing to empty air The indignant old lady was far ahead This was a slight mishap compared with one that now threatened him A huge iceboat under full sail came tearing down the canal almost paralyzing Ben with the thought of instant destruction It was close upon him He saw its gilded prow heard the schipper shout felt the great boom fairly whiz over his head was blind deaf and dumb all in an instant then opened his eyes to find himself spinning some yards behind its great skatelike rudder It had passed within an inch of his shoulder but he was safe Safe to see England again safe to kiss the dear faces that for an instant had flashed before him one by one Father Mother Robby and Jenny that great boom had dashed their images into his very soul He knew now how much he loved them Perhaps this knowledge made him face complacently the scowls of those on the canal who seemed to feel that a boy in danger was necessarily a BAD boy needing instant reprimand Lambert chided him roundly I thought it was all over with you you careless fellow Why don t you look where you are going Not content with sitting on all the old ladies laps you must make a Juggernaut of every iceboat that comes along We shall have to hand you over to the aanspreekers yet if you don t look out Please don t said Ben with mock humility then seeing how pale Lambert s lips were he added in a low tone I do believe I THOUGHT more in that one moment Van Mounen than in all the rest of my past life There was no reply and for a while the two boys skated on in silence Soon a faint sound of distant bells reached their ears Hark said Ben What is that The carillons replied Lambert They are trying the bells in the chapel of yonder village Ah Ben you should hear the chimes of the New Church at Delft They are superb nearly five hundred sweet toned bells and on of the best carillonneurs of Holland to play upon them Hard work though They say the fellow often has to go to bed from positive exhaustion after his performances You see the bells are attached to a kind of keyboard something like they have on pianofortes there is also a set of pedals for the feet when a brisk tune is going on the player looks like a kicking frog fastened to his seat with a skewer For shame said Ben indignantly Peter had for the present exhausted his stock of Haarlem anecdotes and now having nothing to do but skate he and his three companions were hastening to catch up with Lambert and Ben That English lad is fleet enough said Peter If he were a born Hollander he could do no better Generally these John Bulls make but a sorry figure on skates Halloo Here you are Van Mounen Why we hardly hoped for the honor of meeting you again Whom were you flying from in such haste Snails retorted Lambert What kept you We have been talking and besides we halted once to give Poot a chance to rest He begins to look rather worn out said Lambert in a low voice Just then a beautiful iceboat with reefed sail and flying streamers swept leisurely by Its deck was filled with children muffled up to their chins Looking at them from the ice you could see only smiling little faces imbedded in bright colored woolen wrappings They were singing a chorus in honor of Saint Nicholas The music starting in the discord of a hundred childish voices floated as it rose into exquisite harmony Friend of sailors and of children Double claim have we As in youthful joy we re sailing O er a frozen sea Nicholas Saint Nicholas Let us sing to thee While through wintry air we re rushing As our voices blend Are you near us Do you hear us Nicholas our friend Nicholas Saint Nicholas Love can never end Sunny sparkles bright before us Chase away the cold Hearts where sunny thoughts are welcome Never can grow old Nicholas Saint Nicholas Never can grow old Pretty gift and loving lesson Festival and glee Bid us thank thee as we re sailing O er the frozen sea Nicholas Saint Nicholas So we sing to thee Jacob Poot Changes the Plan The last note died away in the distance Our boys who in their vain efforts to keep up with the boat had felt that they were skating backward turned to look at one another How beautiful that was exclaimed Van Mounen Just like a dream Jacob drew close to Ben giving his usual approving nod as he spoke Dat ish goot Dat ish te pest vay I shay petter to take to Leyden mit a poat Take a boat exclaimed Ben in dismay Why man our plan was to SKATE not to be carried like little children Tuyfels retorted Jacob Dat ish no little no papies to go for poat The boys laughed but exchanged uneasy glances It would be great fun to jump on an iceboat if they had a chance but to abandon so shamefully their grand undertaking who could think of such a thing An animated discussion arose at once Captain Peter brought his party to a halt Boys said he it strikes me that we should consult Jacob s wishes in this matter He started the excursion you know Pooh sneered Carl throwing a contemptuous glance at Jacob Who s tired We can rest all night in Leyden Ludwig and Lambert looked anxious and disappointed It was no slight thing to lose the credit of having skated all the way from Broek to the Hague and back again but both agreed that Jacob should decide the question Good natured tired Jacob He read the popular sentiment at a glance Oh no he said in Dutch I was joking We will skate of course The boys gave a delighted shout and started on again with renewed vigor All but Jacob He tried his best not to seem fatigued and by not saying a word saved his breath and energy for the great business of skating But in vain Before long the stout body grew heavier and heavier the tottering limbs weaker and weaker Worse than all the blood anxious to get as far as possible from the ice mounted to the puffy good natured cheeks and made the roots of his thin yellow hair glow into a fiery red This kind of work is apt to summon vertigo of whom good Hans Anderson writes the same who hurls daring young hunters from the mountains or spins them from the sharpest heights of the glaciers or catches them as they tread the stepping stones of the mountain torrent Vertigo came unseen to Jacob After tormenting him awhile with one touch sending a chill from head to foot with the next scorching every vein with fever she made the canal rock and tremble beneath him the white sails bow and spin as they passed then cast him heavily upon the ice Halloo cried Van Mounen There goes Poot Ben sprang hastily forward Jacob Jacob are you hurt Peter and Carl were lifting him The face was white enough now It seemed like a dead face even the good natured look was gone A crowd collected Peter unbuttoned the poor boy s jacket loosened his red tippet and blew between the parted lips Stand off good people he cried Give him air Lay him down called out a woman from the crowd Stand him upon his feet shouted another Give him wine growled a stout fellow who was driving a loaded sled Yes yes give him wine echoed everybody Ludwig and Lambert shouted in concert Wine Wine Who has wine A sleepy headed Dutchman began to fumble mysteriously under the heaviest of blue jackets saying as he did so Not so much noise young masters not so much noise The boy was a fool to faint like a girl Wine quick cried Peter who with Ben s help was rubbing Jacob from head to foot Ludwig stretched forth his hand imploringly toward the Dutchman who with an air of great importance was still fumbling beneath the jacket DO hurry He will die Has anyone else any wine He IS dead said an awful voice from among the bystanders This startled the Dutchman Have a care he said reluctantly drawing forth a small blue flask This is schnapps A little is enough A little WAS enough The paleness gave way to a faint flush Jacob opened his eyes and half bewildered half ashamed feebly tried to free himself from those who were supporting him There was no alternative now for our party but to have their exhausted comrade carried in some way to Leyden As for expecting him to skate anymore that day the thing was impossible In truth by this time each boy began to entertain secret yearnings toward iceboats and to avow a Spartan resolve not to desert Jacob Fortunately a gentle steady breeze was setting southward If some accommodating schipper would but come along matters would not be quite so bad after all Peter hailed the first sail that appeared The men in the stern would not even look at him Three drays on runners came along but they were already loaded to the utmost Then an iceboat a beautiful tempting little one whizzed past like an arrow The boys had just time to stare eagerly at it when it was gone In despair they resolved to prop up Jacob with their strong arms as well as they could and take him to the nearest village At that moment a very shabby iceboat came in sight With but little hope of success Peter hailed at it at the same time taking off his hat and flourishing it in the air The sail was lowered then came the scraping sound of the brake and a pleasant voice called from the deck What now Will you take us on cried Peter hurrying with his companions as fast as he could for the boat as bringing to some distance ahead Will you take us on We ll pay for the ride shouted Carl The man on board scarcely noticed him except to mutter something about its not being a trekschuit Still looking toward Peter he asked How many Six Well it s Nicholas s Day up with you Young gentleman sick He nodded toward Jacob Yes broken down Skated all the way from Broek answered Peter Do you go to Leyden That s as the wind says It s blowing that way now Scramble up Poor Jacob If that willing missus Poot had only appeared just then her services would have been invaluable It was as much as the boys could do to hoist him into the boat All were in at last The schipper puffing away at his pipe let out the sail lifted the brake and sat in the stern with folded arms Whew How fast we go cried Ben This is something like Feel better Jacob Much petter I tanks you Oh you ll be as good as new in ten minutes This makes a fellow feel like a bird Jacob nodded and blinked his eyes Don t go to sleep Jacob it s too cold You might never wake up you know Persons often freeze to death in that way I no sleep said Jacob confidently and in two minutes he was snoring Carl and Ludwig laughed We must wake him cried Ben It is dangerous I tell you Jacob Ja a c Captain Peter interfered for three of the boys were helping Ben for the fun of the thing Nonsense Don t shake him Let him alone boys One never snores like that when one s freezing Cover him up with something Here this cloak will do Hey schipper and he looked toward the stern for permission to use it The man nodded There said Peter tenderly adjusting the garment let him sleep He will be as frisky as a lamb when he wakes How far are we from Leyden schipper Not more n a couple of pipes replied a voice rising from smoke like the genii in fairy tales puff puff Likely not more n one an a half puff puff if this wind holds Puff puff puff What is the man saying Lambert asked Ben who was holding his mittened hands against his cheeks to ward off the cutting air He says we re about two pipes from Leyden Half the boors here on the canal measure distance by the time it takes them to finish a pipe How ridiculous See here Benjamin Dobbs retorted Lambert growing unaccountably indignant at Ben s quiet smile See here you ve a way of calling every other thing you see on THIS side of the German ocean ridiculous It may suit YOU this word but it doesn t suit ME When you want anything ridiculous just remember your English custom of making the Lord Mayor of London at his installation count the nails in a horseshoe to prove HIS LEARNING Who told you we had any such custom as that cried Ben looking grave in an instant Why I KNOW it no use of anyone telling me It s in all the books and it s true It strikes me continued Lambert laughing in spite of himself that you have been kept in happy ignorance of a good many ridiculous things on YOUR side of the map Humph exclaimed Ben trying not to smile I ll inquire into that Lord Mayor business when I get home There must be some mistake B r r roooo How fast we re going This is glorious It was a grand sail or ride I scarcely know which to call it perhaps FLY would be the best word for the boys felt very much as Sinbad did when tied to the roc s leg he darted through the clouds or as Bellerophon felt when he shot through the air on the back of his winged horse Pegasus Sailing riding or flying whichever it was everything was rushing past backward and before they had time to draw a deep breath Leyden itself with its high peaked roofs flew halfway to meet them When the city came in sight it was high time to waken the sleeper That feat accomplished Peter s prophecy came to pass Master Jacob was quite restored and in excellent spirits The schipper made a feeble remonstrance when Peter with hearty thanks endeavored to slip some silver pieces into his tough brown palm Ye see young master said he drawing away his hand the regular line o trade s ONE thing and a favor s another I know it said Peter but those boys and girls of yours will want sweets when you get home Buy them some in the name of Saint Nicholas The man grinned Aye true enough I ve young uns in plenty a clean boatload of them You are a sharp young master at guessing This time the knotty hand hitched forward again quite carelessly it seemed but its palm was upward Peter hastily dropped in the money and moved away The sail came tumbling down Scrape scrape went the brake scattering an ice shower round the boat Good bye schipper shouted the boys seizing their skates and leaping from the deck one by one Many thanks to you Good bye good b Hold Here Stop I want my coat Ben was carefully assisting his cousin over the side of the boat What is the man shouting about Oh I know you have his wrapper round your shoulders Dat ish true answered Jacob half jumping half tumbling down upon the framework dat ish vot make him sho heavy Made YOU so heavy you mean Poot Ya made you sho heavy dat ish true said Jacob innocently as he worked himself free of the big wrapper Dere now you hands it mit him straits way and tells him I vos much tanks for dat Ho for an inn cried Peter as they stepped into the city Be brisk my fine fellows Mynheer Kleef and His Bill of Fare The boys soon found an unpretending establishment near the Breedstraat Broad Street with a funnily painted lion over the door This was the Rood Leeuw or Red Lion kept by one Huygens Kleef a stout Dutchman with short legs and a very long pipe By this time they were in a ravenous condition The tiffin taken at Haarlem had served only to give them an appetite and this had been heightened by their exercise and swift sail upon the canal Come mine host Give us what you can cried Peter rather pompously I can give you anything everything answered Mynheer Kleef performing a difficult bow Well give us sausage and pudding Ah mynheer the sausage is all gone There is no pudding Salmagundi then and plenty of it That is out also young master Eggs and be quick Winter eggs are VERY poor eating answered the innkeeper puckering his lips and lifting his eyebrows No eggs Well caviar The Dutchman raised his fat hands Caviar That is made of gold Who has caviar to sell Peter had sometimes eaten it at home he knew that it was made of the roes of the sturgeon and certain other large fish but he had no idea of its cost Well mine host what have you What have I Everything I have rye bread sauerkraut potato salad and the fattest herring in Leyden What do you say boys asked the captain Will that do Yes cried the famished youths if he ll only be quick Mynheer moved off like one walking in his sleep but soon opened his eyes wide at the miraculous manner in which his herring were made to disappear Next came or rather went potato salad rye bread and coffee then Utrecht water flavored with orange and finally slices of dry gingerbread This last delicacy was not on the regular bill of fare but Mynheer Kleef driven to extremes solemnly produced it from his own private stores and gave only a placid blink when his voracious young travelers started up declaring they had eaten enough I should think so he exclaimed internally but his smooth face gave no sign Softly rubbing his hands he asked Will your worships have beds Will your worships have beds mocked Carl What do you mean Do we look sleepy Not at all master But I would cause them to be warmed and aired None sleep under damp sheets at the Red Lion Ah I understand Shall we come back here to sleep captain Peter was accustomed to finer lodgings but this was a frolic Why not he replied We can fare excellently here Your worship speaks only the truth said mynheer with great deference How fine to be called your worship laughed Ludwig aside to Lambert while Peter replied Well mine host you may get the rooms ready by nine I have one beautiful chamber with three beds that will hold all of your worships said Mynheer Kleef coaxingly That will do Whew whistled Carl when they reached the street Ludwig startled What now Nothing only Mynheer Kleef of the Red Lion little thinks how we shall make things spin in that same room tonight We ll set the bolsters flying Order cried the captain Now boys I must seek this great doctor Boekman before I sleep If he is in Leyden it will be no great task to find him for he always puts up at the Golden Eagle when he comes here I wonder that you did not all go to bed at once Still as you are awake what say you to walking with Ben up by the Museum or the Stadhuis Agreed said Ludwig and Lambert but Jacob preferred to go with Peter In vain Ben tried to persuade him to remain at the inn and rest He declared that he never felt petter and wished of all things to take a look at the city for it was his first stop mit Leyden Oh it will not harm him said Lambert How long the day has been and what glorious sport we have had It hardly seems possible that we left Broek only this morning Jacob yawned I have enjoyed it well he said but it seems to me at least a week since we started Carl laughed and muttered something about twenty naps Here we are at the corner Remember we all meet at the Red Lion at eight said the captain as he and Jacob walked away The Red Lion Becomes Dangerous The boys were glad to find a blazing fire awaiting them upon their return to the Red Lion Carl and his party were there first Soon afterward Peter and Jacob came in They had inquired in vain concerning doctor Boekman All they could ascertain was that he had been seen in Haarlem that morning As for his being in Leyden the landlord of the Golden Eagle had said to Peter the thing is impossible He always lodges here when in town By this time there would be a crowd at my door waiting to consult him Bah People make such fools of themselves He is called a great surgeon said Peter Yes the greatest in Holland But what of that What of being the greatest pill choker and knife slasher in the world The man is a bear Only last month on this very spot he called me a PIG before three customers No exclaimed Peter trying to look surprised and indignant Yes master A PIG repeated the landlord puffing at his pipe with an injured air Bah If he did not pay fine prices and bring customers to my house I would sooner see him in the Vleit Canal than give him lodging Perhaps mine host felt that he was speaking too openly to a stranger or it may be he saw a smile lurking in Peter s face for he added sharply Come now what more do you wish Supper Beds No mynheer I am but searching for doctor Boekman Go find him He is not in Leyden Peter was not to be put off so easily He succeeded in obtaining permission to leave a note for the famous surgeon or rather he BOUGHT from his amiable landlord the privilege of writing it there and a promise that it should be promptly delivered when doctor Boekman arrived This accomplished Peter and Jacob returned to the Red Lion This inn had once been a fine house the home of a rich burgher but having grown old and shabby it had passed through many hands until finally it had fallen into the possession of Mynheer Kleef He was fond of saying as he looked up at its dingy broken walls Mend it and paint it and there s not a prettier house in Leyden It stood six stories high from the street The first three were of equal breadth but of various heights the last three were in the great high roof and grew smaller and smaller like a set of double steps until the top one was lost in a point The roof was built of short shining tiles and the windows with their little panes seemed to be scattered irregularly over the face of the building without the slightest attention to outward effect But the public room on the ground floor was the landlord s joy and pride He never said Mend it and paint it there for everything was in the highest condition of Dutch neatness and order If you will but open your mind s eye you may look into the apartment Imagine a large bare room with a floor that seemed to be made of squares cut out of glazed earthen pie dishes first a yellow piece then a red until the whole looked like a vast checkerboard Fancy a dozen high backed wooden chairs standing around then a great hollow chimney place all aglow with its blazing fire reflected a hundred times in the polished steel firedogs a tiled hearth tiled sides tiled top with a Dutch sentence upon it and over all high above one s head a narrow mantleshelf filled with shining brass candlesticks pipe lighters and tinderboxes Then see in one end of the room three pine tables in the other a closet and a deal dresser The latter is filled with mugs dishes pipes tankards earthen and glass bottles and is guarded at one end by a brass hooped keg standing upon long legs Everything is dim with tobacco smoke but otherwise as clean as soap and sand can make it Next picture two sleepy shabby looking men in wooden shoes seated near the glowing fireplace hugging their knees and smoking short stumpy pipes Mynheer Kleef walking softly and heavily about clad in leather knee breeches felt shoes and a green jacket wider than it is long then throw a heap of skates in the corner and put six tired well dressed boys in various attitudes upon the wooden chairs and you will see the coffee room of the Red Lion just as it appeared at nine o clock upon the evening of December six one hundred eighty four For supper gingerbread again slices of Dutch sausage rye bread sprinkled with anise seed pickles a bottle of Utrecht water and a pot of very mysterious coffee The boys were ravenous enough to take all they could get and pronounce it excellent Ben made wry faces but Jacob declared he had never eaten a better meal After they had laughed and talked awhile and counted their money by way of settling a discussion that arose concerning their expenses the captain marched his company off to bed led on by a greasy pioneer boy who carried skates and a candlestick instead of an ax One of the ill favored men by the fire had shuffled toward the dresser and was ordering a mug of beer just as Ludwig who brought up the rear was stepping from the apartment I don t like that fellow s eye he whispered to Carl He looks like a pirate or something of that kind Looks like a granny answered Carl in sleepy disdain Ludwig laughed uneasily Granny or no granny he whispered I tell you he looks just like one of those men in the voetspoelen Pooh sneered Carl I knew it That picture was too much for you Look sharp now and see if yon fellow with the candle doesn t look like the other villain No indeed his face is as honest as a Gouda cheese But I say Carl that really was a horrid picture Humph What did you stare at it so long for I couldn t help it By this time the boys had reached the beautiful room with three beds in it A dumpy little maiden with long earrings met them at the doorway dropped them a curtsy and passed out She carried a long handled thing that resembled a frying pan with a cover I am glad to see that said Van Mounen to Ben What Why the warming pan It s full of hot ashes she s been heating our beds Oh a warming pan eh Much obliged to her I m sure said Ben too sleepy to make any further comment Meantime Ludwig still talked of the picture that had made such a strong impression upon him He had seen it in a shop window during their walk It was a poorly painted thing representing two men tied back to back standing on shipboard surrounded by a group of seamen who were preparing to cast them together into the sea This mode of putting prisoners to death was called voetspoelen or feet washing and was practiced by the Dutch upon the pirates of Dunkirk in sixteen oh five and again by the Spaniards against the Dutch in the horrible massacre that followed the siege of Haarlem Bad as the painting was the expression upon the pirates faces was well given Sullen and despairing as they seemed they wore such a cruel malignant aspect that Ludwig had felt a secret satisfaction in contemplating their helpless condition He might have forgotten the scene by this time but for that ill looking man by the fire Now while he capered about boylike and threw himself with an antic into his bed he inwardly hoped that the voetspoelen would not haunt his dreams It was a cold cheerless room a fire had been newly kindled in the burnished stove and seemed to shiver even while it was trying to burn The windows with their funny little panes were bare and shiny and the cold waxed floor looked like a sheet of yellow ice Three rush bottomed chairs stood stiffly against the wall alternating with three narrow wooden bedsteads that made the room look like the deserted ward of a hospital At any other time the boys would have found it quite impossible to sleep in pairs especially in such narrow quarters but tonight they lost all fear of being crowded and longed only to lay their weary bodies upon the feather beds that lay lightly upon each cot Had the boys been in Germany instead of Holland they might have been covered also by a bed of down or feathers This peculiar form of luxury was at that time adopted only by wealthy or eccentric Hollanders Ludwig as we have seen had not quite lost his friskiness but the other boys after one or two feeble attempts at pillow firing composed themselves for the night with the greatest dignity Nothing like fatigue for making boys behave themselves Good night boys said Peter s voice from under the covers Good night called back everybody but Jacob who already lay snoring beside the captain I say shouted Carl after a moment don t sneeze anybody Ludwig s in a fright No such thing retorted Ludwig in a smothered voice Then there was a little whispered dispute which was ended by Carl saying For my part I don t know what fear is But you really are a timid fellow Ludwig Ludwig grunted sleepily but made no further reply It was the middle of the night The fire had shivered itself to death and in place of its gleams little squares of moonlight lay upon the floor slowly slowly shifting their way across the room Something else was moving also but the boys did not see it Sleeping boys keep but a poor lookout During the early hours of the night Jacob Poot had been gradually but surely winding himself with all the bed covers He now lay like a monster chrysalis beside the half frozen Peter who accordingly was skating with all his might over the coldest bleakest of dreamland icebergs Something else I say besides the moonlight was moving across the bare polished floor moving not quite so slowly but quite as stealthily Wake up Ludwig The voetspoelen is growing real No Ludwig does not waken but he moans in his sleep Does not Carl hear it Carl the brave the fearless No Carl is dreaming of the race And Jacob Van Mounen Ben Not they They too are dreaming of the race and Katrinka is singing through their dreams laughing flitting past them now and then a wave from the great organ surges through their midst Still the thing moves slowly slowly Peter Captain Peter there is danger Peter heard no call but in his dream he slid a few thousand feet from one iceberg to another and the shock awoke him Whew How cold he was He gave a hopeless desperate tug at the chrysalis in vain Sheet blanket and spread were firmly wound around Jacob s inanimate form Clear moonlight he thought We shall have pleasant weather tomorrow Halloo What s that He saw the moving thing or rather something black crouching upon the floor for it had halted as Peter stirred He watched in silence Soon it moved again nearer and nearer It was a man crawling upon hands and feet The captain s first impulse was to call out but he took an instant to consider matters The creeper had a shining knife in one hand This was ugly but Peter was naturally self possessed When the head turned Peter s eyes were closed as if in sleep but at other times nothing could be keener sharper than the captain s gaze Closer closer crept the robber His back was very near Peter now The knife was laid softly upon the floor One careful arm reached forth stealthily to drag the clothes from the chair by the captain s bed the robbery was commenced Now was Peter s time Holding his breath he sprang up and leaped with all his strength upon the robber s back stunning the rascal with the force of the blow To seize the knife was but a second s work The robber began to struggle but Peter sat like a giant astride the prostrate form If you stir said the brave boy in as terrible a voice as he could command stir but one inch I will plunge this knife into your neck Boys Boys Wake up he shouted still pressing down the black head and holding the knife at pricking distance Give us a hand I ve got him The chrysalis rolled over but made no other sign Up boys cried Peter never budging Ludwig Lambert Donder Are you all dead Dead Not they Van Mounen and Ben were on their feet in an instant Hey What now they shouted I ve got a robber here said Peter coolly Lie still you scoundrel or I ll slice your head off Now boys cut out your bed cord plenty of time he s a dead man if he stirs Peter felt that he weighed a thousand pounds So he did with that knife in his hand The man growled and swore but dared not move Ludwig was up by this time He had a great jackknife the pride of his heart in his breeches pocket It could do good service now They bared the bedstead in a moment It was laced backward and forward with a rope I ll cut it cried Ludwig sawing away at the knot Hold him tight Peter Never fear answered the captain giving the robber a warning prick The boys were soon pulling at the rope like good fellows It was out at last a long stout piece Now boys commanded the captain lift up his rascally arms Cross his hands over his back That s right excuse me for being in the way tie them tight Yes and his feet too the villain cried the boys in great excitement tying knot after knot with Herculean jerks The prisoner changed his tone Oh oh he moaned Spare a poor sick man I was but walking in my sleep Ugh grunted Lambert still tugging away at the rope Asleep were you Well we ll wake you up The man muttered fierce oaths between his teeth then cried in a piteous voice Unbind me good young masters I have five little children at home By Saint Bavon I swear to give you each a ten guilder piece if you will but free me Ha ha laughed Peter Ha ha laughed the other boys Then came threats threats that made Ludwig fairly shudder though he continued to bind and tie with redoubled energy Hold up mynheer housebreaker said Van Mounen in a warning voice That knife is very near your throat If you make the captain nervous there is no telling what may happen The robber took the hint and fell into a sullen silence Just at this moment the chrysalis upon the bed stirred and sat erect What s the matter he asked without opening his eyes Matter echoed Ludwig half trembling half laughing Get up Jacob Here s work for you Come sit on this fellow s back while we get into our clothes we re half perished What fellow Donder Hurrah for Poot cried all the boys as Jacob sliding quickly to the floor bedclothes and all took in the state of affairs at a glance and sat heavily beside Peter on the robber s back Oh didn t the fellow groan then No use in holding him down any longer boys said Peter rising but bending as he did so to draw a pistol from the man s belt You see I ve been keeping a guard over this pretty little weapon for the last ten minutes It s cocked and the least wriggle might have set it off No danger now I must dress myself You and I Lambert will go for the police I d no idea it was so cold Where is Carl asked one of the boys They looked at one another Carl certainly was not among them Oh cried Ludwig frightened at last Where is he Perhaps he s had a fight with the robber and got killed Not a bit of it said Peter quietly as he buttoned his stout jacket Look under the beds They did so Carl was not there Just then they heard a commotion on the stairway Ben hastened to open the door The landlord almost tumbled in he was armed with a big blunderbuss Two or three lodgers followed then the daughter with an upraised frying pan in one hand and a candle in the other and behind her looking pale and frightened the gallant Carl There s your man mine host said Peter nodding toward the prisoner Mine host raised his blunderbuss the girl screamed and Jacob more nimble than usual rolled quickly from the robber s back Don t fire cried Peter he is tied hand and foot Let s roll him over and see what he looks like Carl stepped briskly forward with a bluster Yes We ll turn him over in a way he won t like Lucky we ve caught him Ha ha laughed Ludwig Where were you Master Carl Where was I retorted Carl angrily Why I went to give the alarm to be sure All the boys exchanged glances but they were too happy and elated to say anything ill natured Carl certainly was bold enough now He took the lead while three others aided him in turning the helpless man While the robber lay faceup scowling and muttering Ludwig took the candlestick from the girl s hand I must have a good look at the beauty he said drawing closer but the words were no sooner spoken than he turned pale and started so violently that he almost dropped the candle The voetspoelen he cried Why boys it s the man who sat by the fire Of course it is answered Peter We counted out money before him like simpletons But what have we to do with voetspoelen brother Ludwig A month in jail is punishment enough The landlord s daughter had left the room She now ran in holding up a pair of huge wooden shoes See father she cried here are his great ugly boats It s the man that we put in the next room after the young masters went to bed Ah It was wrong to send the poor young gentlemen up here so far out of sight and sound The scoundrel hissed the landlord He has disgraced my house I go for the police at once In less than fifteen minutes two drowsy looking officers were in the room After telling Mynheer Kleef that he must appear early in the morning with the boys and make his complaint before a magistrate they marched off with their prisoner One would think the captain and his band could have slept no more that night but the mooring has not yet been found that can prevent youth and an easy conscience from drifting down the river of dreams The boys were much too fatigued to let so slight a thing as capturing a robber bind them to wakefulness They were soon in bed again floating away to strange scenes made of familiar things Ludwig and Carl had spread their bedding upon the floor One had already forgotten the voetspoelen the race everything but Carl was wide awake He heard the carillons ringing out their solemn nightly music and the watchman s noisy clapper putting in discord at the quarter hours he saw the moonshine glide away from the window and the red morning light come pouring in and all the while he kept thinking Pooh what a goose I have made of myself Carl Schummel alone with none to look or to listen was not quite so grand a fellow as Carl Schummel strutting about in his boots Before the Court You may believe that the landlord s daughter bestirred herself to prepare a good meal for the boys next morning Mynheer had a Chinese gong that could make more noise than a dozen breakfast bells Its hideous reveille clanging through the house generally startled the drowsiest lodgers into activity but the maiden would not allow it to be sounded this morning Let the brave young gentlemen sleep she said to the greasy kitchen boy They shall be warmly fed when they awaken It was ten o clock when Captain Peter and his band came straggling down one by one A pretty hour said mine host gruffly It is high time we were before the court Fine business this for a respectable inn You will testify truly young masters that you found most excellent fare and lodging at the Red Lion Of course we will answered Carl saucily and pleasant company too though they visit at rather unseasonable hours A stare and a humph was all the answer mynheer made to this but the daughter was more communicative Shaking her earrings at Carl she said sharply Not so very pleasant either master traveler if you could judge by the way YOU ran away from it Impertinent creature hissed Carl under his breath as he began busily to examine his skate straps Meantime the kitchen boy listening outside at the crack of the door doubled himself with silent laughter After breakfast the boys went to the police court accompanied by Huygens Kleef and his daughter Mynheer s testimony was principally to the effect that such a thing as a robber at the Red Lion had been unheard of until last night and as for the Red Lion it was a most respectable inn as respectable as any house in Leyden Each boy in turn told all that he knew of the affair and identified the prisoner in the box as the same man who entered their room in the dead of night Ludwig was surprised to find that the prisoner in the box was a man of ordinary size especially after he had described him under oath to the court as a tremendous fellow with great square shoulders and legs of prodigious weight Jacob swore that he was awakened by the robber kicking and thrashing upon the floor and immediately afterward Peter and the rest feeling sorry that they had not explained the matter to their sleepy comrade testified that the man had not moved a muscle from the moment the point of the dagger touched his throat until bound from head to foot he was rolled over for inspection The landlord s daughter made one boy blush and all the court smile by declaring If it hadn t been for that handsome young gentleman there pointing to Peter they might have all been murdered in their beds for the dreadful man had a great shining knife most as long as Your Honor s arm and SHE believed the handsome young gentleman had struggled hard enough to get it away from him but he was too modest bless him to say so Finally after a little questioning and cross questioning from the public prosecutor the witnesses were dismissed and the robber was handed over to the consideration of the criminal court The scoundrel said Carl savagely when the boys reached the street He ought to be sent to jail at once If I had been in your place Peter I certainly should have killed him outright He was fortunate then in falling into gentler hands was Peter s quiet reply It appears he has been arrested before under a charge of housebreaking He did not succeed in robbing this time but he broke the door fastenings and that I believe constitutes a burglary in the eyes of the law He was armed with a knife too and that makes it worse for him poor fellow Poor fellow mimicked Carl One would think he was your brother So he is my brother and yours too Carl Schummel for that matter answered Peter looking into Carl s eye We cannot say what we might have become under other circumstances WE have been bolstered up from evil since the hour we were born A happy home and good parents might have made that man a fine fellow instead of what he is God grant that the law may cure and not crush him Amen to that said Lambert heartily while Ludwig van Holp looked at his brother in such a bright proud way that Jacob Poot who was an only son wished from his heart that the little form buried in the old church at home had lived to grow up beside him Humph said Carl It s all very well to be saintly and forgiving and all that sort of thing but I m naturally hard All these fine ideas seem to rattle off me like hailstones and it s nobody s business either if they do Peter recognized a touch of good feeling in this clumsy concession Holding out his hand he said in a frank hearty tone Come lad shake hands and let us be good friends even if we don t exactly agree on all questions We do agree better than you think sulked Carl as he returned Peter s grasp All right responded Peter briskly Now Van Mounen we await Benjamin s wishes Where would he like to go To the Egyptian Museum answered Lambert after holding a brief consultation with Ben That is on the Breedstraat To the museum let it be Come boys The Beleaguered Cities This open square before us said Lambert as he and Ben walked on together is pretty in summer with its shady trees They call it the Ruine Years ago it was covered with houses and the Rapenburg Canal here ran through the street Well one day a barge loaded with forty thousand pounds of gunpowder bound for Delft was lying alongside and the bargemen took a notion to cook their dinner on the deck and before anyone knew it sir the whole thing blew up killing lots of persons and scattering about three hundred houses to the winds What exclaimed Ben Did the explosion destroy three hundred houses Yes sir my father was in Leyden at the time He says it was terrible The explosion occurred just at noon and it was like a volcano All this part of the town was on fire in an instant buildings tumbling down and men women and children groaning under the ruins The king himself came to the city and acted nobly Father says staying out in the streets all night encouraging the survivors in their efforts to arrest the fire and rescue as many as possible from under the heaps of stone and rubbish Through his means a collection for the benefit of the sufferers was raised throughout the kingdom besides a hundred thousand guilders paid out of the treasury Father was only nineteen years old then It was in eighteen oh seven I believe but he remembers it perfectly A friend of his Professor Luzac was among the killed They have a tablet erected to his memory in Saint Peter s Church farther on the queerest thing you ever saw with an image of the professor carved upon it representing him just as he looked when he was found after the explosion What a strange idea Isn t Boerhaave s monument in Saint Peter s also I cannot remember Perhaps Peter knows The captain delighted Ben by saying that the monument was there and that he thought they might be able to see it during the day Lambert continued Peter ask Ben if he saw Van der Werf s portrait at the town hall last night No said Lambert I can answer for him It was too late to go in I say boys it is really wonderful how much Ben knows Why he has told me a volume of Dutch history already I ll wager he has the siege of Leyden at his tongue s end His tongue must burn then interposed Ludwig for if Bilderdyk s account is true it was a pretty hot affair Ben was looking at them with an inquiring smile We are speaking of the siege of Leyden explained Lambert Oh yes said Ben eagerly I had forgotten all about it This was the very place Let s give old Van der Werf three cheers Hur Van Mounen uttered a hasty Hush and explained that patriotic as the Dutch were the police would soon have something to say if a party of boys cheered in the street at midday What Not cheer Van der Werf cried Ben indignantly One of the greatest chaps in history Only think Didn t he hold out against those murderous Spaniards for months and months There was the town surrounded on all sides by the enemy great black forts sending fire and death into the very heart of the city but no surrender Every man a hero women and children too brave and fierce as lions provisions giving out the very grass from between the paving stones gone till people were glad to eat horses and cats and dogs and rats Then came the plague hundreds dying in the streets but no surrender Then when they could bear no more when the people brave as they were crowded about Van der Werf in the public square begging him to give up what did the noble old burgomaster say I have sworn to defend this city and with God s help I MEAN TO DO IT If my body can satisfy your hunger take it and divide it among you but expect no surrender so long as I am alive Hurrah hur Ben was getting uproarious Lambert playfully clapped his hand over his friend s mouth The result was one of those quick India rubber scuffles fearful to behold but delightful to human nature in its polliwog state Vat wash te matter Pen asked Jacob hurrying forward Oh nothing at all panted Ben except that Van Mounen was afraid of starting an English riot in this orderly town He stopped my cheering for old Van der Ya ya it ish no goot to sheer to make te noise for dat You vill shee old Van der Does s likeness mit te Stadhuis See old Van der Does I thought it was Van der Werf s picture they had there Ya responded Jacob Van der Werf vell vot of it Both ish just ash goot Yes Van der Does was a noble old Dutchman but he was not Van der Werf I know he defended the city like a brick and Now vot for you shay dat Penchamin He no defend te city mit breek he fight like goot soltyer mit his guns You like make te fun mit effrysinks Tutch No No No I said he defended the city LIKE a brick That is very high praise I would have you understand We English call even the Duke of Wellington a brick Jacob looked puzzled but his indignation was already on the ebb Vell it ish no matter I no tink before soltyer mean breek but it ish no matter Ben laughed good naturedly and seeing that his cousin was tired of talking in English he turned to his friend of the two languages Van Mounen they say the very carrier pigeons that brought news of relief to the besieged city are somewhere here in Leyden I really should like to see them Just think of it At the very height of the trouble if the wind didn t turn and blow in the waters and drown hundreds of Spaniards and enable the Dutch boats to sail in right over the land with men and provisions to the very gates of the city The pigeons you know did great service in bearing letters to and fro I have read somewhere that they were reverently cared for from that day and when they died they were stuffed and placed for safekeeping in the town hall We must be sure to have a look at them Van Mounen laughed On that principle Ben I suppose when you go to Rome you ll expect to see the identical goose who saved the capitol But it will be easy enough to see the pigeons They are in the same building with Van der Werf s portrait Which was the greater defense Ben the siege of Leyden or the siege of Haarlem Well replied Ben thoughtfully Van der Werf is one of my heroes We all have our historical pets you know but I really think the siege of Haarlem brought out a braver more heroic resistance even than the Leyden one besides they set the Leyden sufferers an example of courage and fortitude for their turn came first I don t know much about the Haarlem siege said Lambert except that it was in fifteen seventy three Who beat The Spaniards said Ben The Dutch had stood out for months Not a man would yield nor a woman either for that matter They shouldered arms and fought gallantly beside their husbands and fathers Three hundred of them did duty under Kanau Hesselaer a great woman and brave as Joan of Arc All this time the city was surrounded by the Spaniards under Frederic of Toledo son of that beauty the Duke of Alva Cut off from all possible help from without there seemed to be no hope for the inhabitants but they shouted defiance over the city walls They even threw bread into the enemy s camps to show that they were not afraid of starvation Up to the last they held out bravely waiting for the help that never could come growing bolder and bolder until their provisions were exhausted Then it was terrible In time hundreds of famished creatures fell dead in the streets and the living had scarcely strength to bury them At last they made the desperate resolution that rather than perish by lingering torture the strongest would form a square placing the weakest in the center and rush in a body to their death with the faint chance of being able to fight their way through the enemy The Spaniards received a hint of this and believing that there was nothing the Dutch would not dare to do they concluded to offer terms High time I should think Yes with falsehood and treachery they soon obtained an entrance into the city promising protection and forgiveness to all except those whom the citizens themselves would acknowledge as deserving of death You don t say so said Lambert quite interested That ended the business I suppose Not a bit of it returned en for the Duke of Alva had already given his son orders to show mercy to none Ah That was where the great Haarlem massacre came in I remember now You can t wonder that the Hollanders dislike Spain when you read of the way they were butchered by Alva and his hosts though I admit that our side sometimes retaliated terribly But as I have told you before I have a very indistinct idea of historical matters Everything is confusion from the flood to the battle of Waterloo One thing is plain however the Duke of Alva was about the worst specimen of a man that ever lived That gives only a faint idea of him said Ben but I hate to think of such a wretch What if he HAD brains and military skill and all that sort of thing Give me such men as Van der Werf and What now Why said Van Mounen who was looking up and down the street in a bewildered way We ve walked right past the museum and I don t see the boys Let us go back Leyden The boys met at the museum and were soon engaged in examining its extensive collection of curiosities receiving a new insight into Egyptian life ancient and modern Ben and Lambert had often visited the British Museum but that did not prevent them from being surprised at the richness of the Leyden collection There were household utensils wearing apparel weapons musical instruments sarcophagi and mummies of men women and cats ibexes and other creatures They saw a massive gold armlet that had been worn by an Egyptian king at a time when some of these same mummies perhaps were nimbly treading the streets of Thebes and jewels and trinkets such as Pharaoh s daughter wore and the children of Israel borrowed when they departed out of Egypt There were other interesting relics from Rome and Greece and some curious Roman pottery which had been discovered in digging near The Hague relics of the days when the countrymen of Julius Caesar had settled there Where have they not settled I for one would hardly be astonished if relics of the ancient Romans should someday be found deep under the grass growing around the Bunker Hill monument When the boys left this museum they went to another and saw a wonderful collection of fossil animals skeletons birds minerals precious stones and other natural specimens but as they were not learned men they could only walk about and stare enjoy the little knowledge of natural history they possessed and wish with all their hearts they had acquired more Even the skeleton of the mouse puzzled Jacob What wonder He was not used to seeing the cat fearing little creatures running about in their bones and how could he ever have imagined their necks to be so queer Besides the Museum of Natural History there was Saint Peter s Church to be visited containing Professor Luzac s memorial and Boerhaave s monument of white and black marble with its urn and carved symbols of the four ages of life and its medallion of Boerhaave adorned with his favorite motto Simplex sigillum veri They also obtained admittance to a tea garden which in summer was a favorite resort of the citizens and passing naked oaks and fruit trees ascended to a high mound which stood in the center This was the site of a round tower now in ruins said by some to have been built by Hengist the Anglo Saxon king and by others to have been the castle of one of the ancient counts of Holland As the boys walked about on the top of its stone wall they could get but a poor view of the surrounding city The tower stood higher when more than two centuries ago the inhabitants of beleaguered Leyden shouted to the watcher on its top their wild despairing cries Is there any help Are the waters rising What do you see And for months he could only answer No help I see around us nothing but the enemy Ben pushed these thoughts away and resolutely looking down into the bare tea garden filled it in imagination with gay summer groups He tried to forget old battle clouds and picture only curling wreaths of tobacco smoke rising from among men women and children enjoying their tea and coffee in the open air But a tragedy came in spite of him Poot was bending over the edge of the high wall It would be just like him to grow dizzy and tumble off Ben turned impatiently away If the fellow with his weak head knew no better than to be venturesome why let him tumble Horror What mean that heavy crashing sound Ben could not stir He could only gasp Jacob Jacob cried another startled voice and another Ready to faint Ben managed to turn his head He saw a crowd of boys on the edge of the wall opposite but Jacob was not there Good heavens he cried springing forward where is my cousin The crowd parted It was only four boys after all There sat Jacob in their midst holding his sides and laughing heartily Did I frighten you all he said in his native Dutch Well I will tell you how it was There was a big stone lying on the wall and I put my my foot out just to push it a little you see and the first thing I knew down went the stone all the way to the bottom and left me sitting here on top with both my feet in the air If I had not thrown myself back at that moment I certainly should have rolled over after the stone Well it is no matter

none	none	You re hurt said Ben seeing a shade of seriousness pass over his cousin s face as they lifted him to his feet Jacob tried to laugh again Oh no I feels a little hurt ven I stant up but it ish no matter The monument to Van der Werf in the Hooglandsche Kerk was not accessible that day but the boys spent a few pleasant moments in the Stadhuis or town hall a long irregular structure somewhat in the Gothic style uncouth in architecture but picturesque from age Its little steeple tuneful with bells seemed to have been borrowed from some other building and hastily clapped on as a finishing touch Ascending the grand staircase the boys soon found themselves in a rather gloomy apartment containing the masterpiece of Lucas van Leyden or Hugens a Dutch artist born three hundred and seventy years ago who painted well when he was ten years of age and became distinguished in art when only fifteen This picture called the Last Judgment considering the remote age in which it was painted is truly a remarkable production The boys however were less interested in tracing out the merits of the work than they were in the fact of its being a triptych that is painted on three divisions the two outer ones swung on hinges so as to close when required over the main portion The historical pictures of Harel de Moor and other famous Dutch artists interested them for a while and Ben had to be almost pulled away from the dingy old portrait of Van der Werf The town hall as well as the Egyptian Museum is on the Breedstraat the longest and finest street in Leyden It has no canal running through it and the houses painted in every variety of color have a picturesque effect as they stand with their gable ends to the street some are very tall with half their height in their step like roofs others crouch before the public edifices and churches Being clean spacious well shaded and adorned with many elegant mansions it compares favorably with the finery portions of Amsterdam It is kept scrupulously neat Many of the gutters are covered with boards that open like trapdoors and it is supplied with pumps surmounted with shining brass ornaments kept scoured and bright at the public cost The city is intersected by numerous water roads formed by the river Rhine there grown sluggish fatigued by its long travel but more than one hundred and fifty stone bridges reunite the dissevered streets The same world renowned river degraded from the beautiful free flowing Rhine serves as a moat from the rampart that surrounds Leyden and is crossed by drawbridges at the imposing gateways that give access to the city Fine broad promenades shaded by noble trees border the canals and add to the retired appearance of the houses behind heightening the effect of scholastic seclusion that seems to pervade the place Ben as he scanned the buildings on the Rapenburg Canal was somewhat disappointed in the appearance of the great University of Leyden But when he recalled its history how attended with all the pomp of a grand civic display it had been founded by the Prince of Orange as a tribute to the citizens for the bravery displayed during the siege when he remembered the great men in religion learning and science who had once studied there and thought of the hundreds of students now sharing the benefits of its classes and its valuable scientific museums he was quite willing to forego architectural beauty though he could not help feeling that no amount of it could have been misplaced on such an institution Peter and Jacob regarded the building with an even deeper more practical interest for they were to enter it as students in the course of a few months Poor Don Quixote would have run a hopeless tilt in this part of the world said Ben after Lambert had been pointing out some of the oddities and beauties of the suburbs It is all windmills You remember his terrific contest with one I suppose No said Lambert bluntly Well I don t either that is not definitely But there was something of that kind in his adventures and if there wasn t there should have been Look at them how frantically they whirl their great arms just the thing to excite the crazy knight to mortal combat It bewilders one to look at them Help me to count all those we can see Van Mounen I want a big item for my notebook And after a careful reckoning superintended by all the party Master Ben wrote in pencil Saw Dec one hundred eighty four ninety eight windmills within full view of Leyden He would have been glad to visit the old brick mill in which the painter Rembrandt was born but he abandoned the project upon learning that it would take them out of their way Few boys as hungry as Ben was by this time would hesitate long between Rembrandt s home a mile off and tiffin close by Ben chose the latter After tiffin they rested awhile and then took another which for form s sake they called dinner After dinner the boys sat warming themselves at the inn all but Peter who occupied the time in another fruitless search for doctor Boekman This over the party once more prepared for skating They were thirteen miles from The Hague and not as fresh as when they had left Broek early on the previous day but they were in good spirits and the ice was excellent The Palace in the Wood As the boys skated onward they saw a number of fine country seats all decorated and surrounded according to the Dutchest of Dutch taste but impressive to look upon with their great formal houses elaborate gardens square hedges and wide ditches some crossed by a bridge having a gate in the middle to be carefully locked at night These ditches everywhere traversing the landscape had long ago lost their summer film and now shone under the sunlight like trailing ribbons of glass The boys traveled bravely all the while performing the surprising feat of producing gingerbread from their pockets and causing it to vanish instantly Twelve miles were passed A few more long strokes would take them to The Hague when Van Mounen proposed that they should vary their course by walking into the city through the Bosch Agreed cried one and all and their skates were off in a twinkling The Bosch is a grand park or wood nearly two miles long containing the celebrated House in the Wood Huis in t Bosch sometimes used as a royal residence The building though plain outside for a palace is elegantly furnished within and finely frescoed that is the walls and ceiling are covered with groups and designs painted directly upon them while the plaster was fresh Some of the rooms are tapestried with Chinese silks beautifully embroidered One contains a number of family portraits among them a group of royal children who in time were orphaned by a certain ax which figures very frequently in European history These children were painted many times by the Dutch artist Van Dyck who was court painter to their father Charles the First of England Beautiful children they were What a deal of trouble the English nation would have been spared had they been as perfect in heart and soul as they were in form The park surrounding the palace is charming especially in summer for flowers and birds make it bright as fairyland Long rows of magnificent oaks rear their proud heads conscious that no profaning hand will ever bring them low In fact the Wood has for ages been held as an almost sacred spot Children are never allowed to meddle with its smallest twig The ax of the woodman has never resounded there Even war and riot have passed it reverently pausing for a moment in their devastating way Philip of Spain while he ordered Dutchmen to be mowed down by hundreds issued a mandate that not a bough of the beautiful Wood should be touched And once when in a time of great necessity the State was about to sacrifice it to assist in filling a nearly exhausted treasury the people rushed to the rescue and nobly contributed the required amount rather than that the Bosch should fall What wonder then that the oaks have a grand fearless air Birds from all Holland have told them how elsewhere trees are cropped and bobbed into shape but THEY are untouched Year after year they expand in unclipped luxuriance and beauty their wide spreading foliage alive with song casts a cool shade over lawn and pathway or bows to its image in the sunny ponds Meanwhile as if to reward the citizens for allowing her to have her way for once Nature departs from the invariable level wearing gracefully the ornaments that have been reverently bestowed upon her So the lawn slopes in a velvety green the paths wind in and out flower beds glow and send forth perfume and ponds and sky look at each other in mutual admiration Even on that winter day the Bosch was beautiful Its trees were bare but beneath them still lay the ponds every ripple smoothed into glass The blue sky was bright overhead and as it looked down through the thicket of boughs it saw another blue sky not nearly so bright looking up from the dim thicket under the ice Never had the sunset appeared more beautiful to Peter than when he saw it exchanging farewell glances with the windows and shining roofs of the city before him Never had The Hague itself seemed more inviting He was no longer Peter van Holp going to visit a great city nor a fine young gentleman bent on sight seeing he was a knight an adventurer travel soiled and weary a Hop o my Thumb grown large a Fortunatas approaching the enchanted castle where luxury and ease awaited him for his own sister s house was not half a mile away At last boys he cried in high glee we may hope for a royal resting place good beds warm rooms and something fit to eat I never realized before what a luxury such things are Our lodgings at the Red Lion have made us appreciate our own homes The Merchant Prince and the Sister Princess Well might Peter feel that his sister s house was like an enchanted castle Large and elegant as it was a spell of quiet hung over it The very lion crouching at its gate seemed to have been turned into stone through magic Within it was guarded by genii in the shape of red faced servants who sprang silently forth at the summons of bell or knocker There was a cat also who appeared as knowing as any Puss in Boots and a brass gnome in the hall whose business it was to stand with outstretched arms ready to receive sticks and umbrellas Safe within the walls bloomed a Garden of Delight where the flowers firmly believed it was summer and a sparkling fountain was laughing merrily to itself because Jack Frost could not find it There was a Sleeping Beauty too just at the time of the boys arrival but when Peter like a true prince flew lightly up the stairs and kissed her eyelids the enchantment was broken The princess became his own good sister and the fairy castle just one of the finest most comfortable houses of The Hague As may well be believed the boys received the heartiest of welcomes After they had conversed awhile with their lively hostess one of the genii summoned them to a grand repast in a red curtained room where floor and ceiling shone like polished ivory and the mirrors suddenly blossomed into rosy cheeked boys as far as the eye could reach They had caviar now and salmagundi and sausage and cheese besides salad and fruit and biscuit and cake How the boys could partake of such a medley was a mystery to Ben for the salad was sour and the cake was sweet the fruit was dainty and the salmagundi heavy with onions and fish But while he was wondering he made a hearty meal and was soon absorbed in deciding which he really preferred the coffee or the anisette cordial It was delightful too this taking one s food from dishes of frosted silver and liqueur glasses from which Titania herself might have sipped The young gentleman afterward wrote to his mother that pretty and choice as things were at home he had never known what cut glass china and silver services were until he visited The Hague Of course Peter s sister soon heard all of the boys adventures How they had skated over forty miles and seen rare sights on the way how they had lost their purse and found it again How one of the party had fallen and given them an excuse for a grand sail in an ice boat how above all they had caught a robber and so for a second time saved their slippery purse And now Peter said the lady when the story was finished you must write at once to tell the good people of Broek that your adventures have reached their height that you and your fellow travelers have all been taken prisoners The boys looked startled Indeed I shall do no such thing laughed Peter We must leave tomorrow at noon But the sister had already decided differently and a Holland lady is not to be easily turned from her purpose In short she held forth such strong temptations and was so bright and cheerful and said so many coaxing and unanswerable things both in English and Dutch that the boys were all delighted when it was settled that they should remain at The Hague for at least two days Next the grand skating race was talked over Mevrouw van Gend gladly promised to be present on the occasion I shall witness your triumph Peter she said for you are the fastest skater I ever knew Peter blushed and gave a slight cough as Carl answered for him Ah mevrouw he is swift but all the Broek boys are fine skaters even the rag pickers and he thought bitterly of poor Hans The lady laughed That will make the race all the more exciting she said But I shall wish each of you to be the winner At this moment her husband Mynheer van Gend came in and the enchantment falling upon the boys was complete The invisible fairies of the household at once clustered about them whispering that Jasper van Gend had a heart as young and fresh as their own and if he loved anything in this world more than industry it was sunshine and frolic They hinted also something about his having a hearty full of love and a head full of wisdom and finally gave the boys to understand that when mynheer said a thing he meant it Therefore his frank Well now this is pleasant as he shook hands with them all made the boys feel quite at home and as happy as squirrels There were fine paintings in the drawing room and exquisite statuary and portfolios filled with rare Dutch engravings besides many beautiful and curious things from China and Japan The boys felt that it would require a month to examine all the treasures of the apartment Ben noticed with pleasure English books lying upon the table He saw also over the carved upright piano life sized portraits of William of Orange and his English queen a sight that for a time brought England and Holland side by side in his heart William and Mary have left a halo round the English throne to this day he the truest patriot that ever served an adopted country she the noblest wife that ever sat upon a British throne up to the time of Victoria and Albert the Good As Ben looked at the pictures he remembered accounts he had read of King William s visit to The Hague in the winter of sixteen ninety one He who sang the Battle of Ivry had not yet told the glowing story of that day but Ben knew enough of it to fancy that he could almost hear the shouts of the delighted populace as he looked from the portraits to the street which at this moment was aglow with a bonfire kindled in a neighboring square That royal visit was one never to be forgotten For two years William of Orange had been monarch of a foreign land his head working faithfully for England but his whole heart yearning for Holland Now when he sought its shores once more the entire nation bade him welcome Multitudes flocked to The Hague to meet him Many thousands came sliding or skating along the frozen canals from Amsterdam Rotterdam Leyden Haarlem Delft All day long the festivities of the capital were kept up the streets were gorgeous with banners evergreen arches trophies and mottoes of welcome and emblems of industry William saw the deeds of his ancestors and scenes of his own past life depicted on banners and tapestries along the streets At night superb fireworks were displayed upon the ice Its glassy surface was like a mirror Sparkling fountains of light sprang up from below to meet the glittering cascades leaping upon it Then a feathery fire of crimson and green shook millions of rubies and emeralds into the ruddy depths of the ice and all this time the people were shouting God bless William of Orange Long live the king They were half mad with joy and enthusiasm William their own prince their stadtholder had become the ruler of three kingdoms he had been victorious in council and in war and now in his hour of greatest triumph had come as a simple guest to visit them The king heard their shouts with a beating heart It is a great thing to be beloved by one s country His English courtiers complimented him upon his reception Yes said he but the shouting is nothing to what it would have been if Mary had been with me While Ben was looking at the portraits Mynheer van Gend was giving the boys an account of a recent visit to Antwerp As it was the birthplace of Quentin Matsys the blacksmith who for love of an artist s daughter studied until he became a great painter the boys asked their host if he had seen any of Matsys works Yes indeed he replied and excellent they are His famous triptych in a chapel of the Antwerp cathedral with the Descent from the Cross on the center panel is especially fine but I confess I was more interested in his well What well mynheer asked Ludwig One in the heart of the city near this same cathedral whose lofty steeple is of such delicate workmanship that the French emperor said it reminded him of Mechlin lace The well is covered with a Gothic canopy surmounted by the figure of a knight in full armor It is all of metal and proves that Matsys was an artist at the forge as well as at the easel indeed his great fame is mainly derived from his miraculous skill as an artificer in iron Next mynheer showed the boys some exquisite Berlin castings which he had purchased in Antwerp They were IRON JEWELRY and very delicate beautiful medallions designed from rare paintings bordered with fine tracery and open work worthy he said of being worn by the fairest lady of the land Consequently the necklace was handed with a bow and a smile to the blushing Mevrouw van Gend Something in the lady s aspect as she bent her bright young face over the gift caused mynheer to say earnestly I can read your thoughts sweetheart She looked up in playful defiance Ah now I am sure of them You were thinking of those noblehearted women but for whom Prussia might have fallen I know it by that proud light in your eye The proud light in my eye plays me false then she answered I had no such grand matter in my mind To confess the simple truth I was only thinking how lovely this necklace would be with my blue brocade So so exclaimed the rather crestfallen spouse But I CAN think of the other Jasper and it will add a deeper value to your gift You remember the incident do you not Peter How when the French were invading Prussia and for lack of means the country was unable to defend itself against the enemy the women turned the scale by pouring their plate and jewels into the public treasury Aha thought mynheer as he met his vrouw s kindling glance The proud light is there now in earnest Peter remarked maliciously that the women had still proved true to their vanity on that occasion for jewelry they would have If gold or silver were wanted by the kingdom they would relinquish it and use iron but they could not do without their ornaments What of that said the vrouw kindling again It is no sin to love beautiful things if you adapt your material to circumstances All I have to say is the women saved their country and indirectly introduced a very important branch of manufacture Is not that so Jasper Of course it is sweetheart said mynheer but Peter needs no word of mine to convince him that all the world over women have never been found wanting in their country s hour of trial though bowing to mevrouw his own country women stand foremost in the records of female patriotism and devotion Then turning to Ben the host talked with him in English of the fine old Belgian city Among other things he told the origin of its name Ben had been taught that Antwerp was derived from ae nt werf on the wharf but Mynheer van Gend gave him a far more interesting derivation It appears that about three thousand years ago a great giant named Antigonus lived on the river Scheld on the site of the present city of Antwerp This giant claimed half the merchandise of all navigators who passed his castle Of course some were inclined to oppose this simple regulation In such cases Antigonus by way of teaching them to practice better manners next time cut off and threw into the river the rights hands of the merchants Thus handwerpen or hand throwing changed to Antwerp came to be the name of the place The escutcheon or arms of the city has two hands upon it what better proof than this could one have of the truth of the story especially when one wishes to believe it When Mynheer van Gend had related in two languages this story of Antwerp he was tempted to tell other legends some in English some in Dutch and so the moments borne upon the swift shoulders of gnomes and giants glided rapidly away toward bedtime It was hard to break up so pleasant a party but the Van Gend household moved with the regularity of clockwork There was no lingering at the threshold when the cordial Good night was spoken Even while our boys were mounting the stairs the invisible household fairies again clustered around them whispering that system and regularity had been chief builders of the master s prosperity Beautiful chambers with three beds in them were not to be found in this mansion Some of the rooms contained two but each visitor slept alone Before morning the motto of the party evidently was Every boy his own chrysalis and Peter at least was not sorry to have it so Tired as he was Ben after noting a curious bell rope in the corner began to examine his bedclothes Each article filled him with astonishment the exquisitely fine pillow spread trimmed with costly lace and embroidered with a gorgeous crest and initial the dekbed cover a great silk bag large as the bed stuffed with swan s down and the pink satin quilts embroidered with garlands of flowers He could scarcely sleep for thinking what a queer little bed it was so comfortable and pretty too with all its queerness In the morning he examined the top coverlet with care for he wished to send home a description of it in his next letter It was a beautiful Japanese spread marvelous in texture as well as in its variety of brilliant coloring and worth as Ben afterward learned not less than three hundred dollars The floor was of polished wooden mosaic nearly covered with a rich carpet bordered with thick black fringe Another room displayed a margin of satinwood around the carpet Hung with tapestry its walls of crimson silk were topped with a gilded cornice which shot down gleams of light far into the polished floor Over the doorway of the room in which Jacob and Ben slept was a bronze stork that with outstretched neck held a lamp to light the guests into the apartment Between the two narrow beds of carved whitewood and ebony stood the household treasure of the Van Gends a massive oaken chair upon which the Prince of Orange had once sat during a council meeting Opposite stood a quaintly carved clothespress waxed and polished to the utmost and filled with precious stores of linen beside it a table holding a large Bible whose great golden clasps looked poor compared with its solid ribbed binding made to outlast six generations There was a ship model on the mantleshelf and over it hung an old portrait of Peter the Great who you know once gave the dockyard cats of Holland a fine chance to look at a king which is one of the special prerogatives of cats Peter though czar of Russia was not too proud to work as a common shipwright in the dockyards of Saardam and Amsterdam that he might be able to introduce among his countrymen Dutch improvements in ship building It was this willingness to be thorough even in the smallest beginnings that earned for him the title of Peter the Great Peter the little comparatively speaking was up first the next morning knowing the punctual habits of his brother in law he took good care that none of the boys should oversleep themselves A hard task he found it to wake Jacob Poot but after pulling that young gentleman out of bed and with Ben s help dragging him about the room for a while he succeeded in arousing him While Jacob was dressing and moaning within him because the felt slippers provided him as a guest were too tight for his swollen feet Peter wrote to inform their friends at Broek of the safe arrival of his party at The Hague He also begged his mother to send word to Hans Brinker that doctor Boekman had not yet reached Leyden but that a letter containing Hans s message had been left at the hotel where the doctor always lodged during his visits to the city Tell him also wrote Peter that I shall call there again as I pass through Leyden The poor boy seemed to feel sure that the meester would hasten to save his father but we who know the gruff old gentleman better may be confident he will do no such thing It would be a kindness to send a visiting physician from Amsterdam to the cottage at once if Jufvrouw Brinker will consent to receive any but the great king of the meesters as doctor Boekman certainly is You know Mother added Peter that I have always considered Sister van Gend s house as rather quiet and lonely but I assure you it is not so now He says we make him wish that he had a houseful of boys of his own He has promised to let us ride on his noble black horses They are gentle as kittens he says if one have but a firm touch at the rein Ben according to Jacob s account is a glorious rider and your son Peter is not a very bad hand at the business so we two are to go out together this morning mounted like knights of old After we return Brother van Gend says he will lend Jacob his English pony and obtain three extra horses and all of the party are to trot about the city in a grand cavalcade led on by him He will ride the black horse which Father sent him from Friesland My sister s pretty roan with the long white tail is lame and she will ride none other else she would accompany us I could scarcely close my eyes last night after Sister told me of the plan Only the thought of poor Hans Brinker and his sick father checked me but for that I could have sung for joy Ludwig has given us a name already the Broek Cavalry We flatter ourselves that we shall make an imposing appearance especially in single file The Broek Cavalry were not disappointed Mynheer van Gend readily procured good horses and all the boys could ride though none was as perfect horsemen or horseboys as Peter and Ben They saw The Hague to their hearts content and The Hague saw them expressing its approbation loudly through the mouths of small boys and cart dogs silently through bright eyes that not looking very deeply into things shone as they looked at the handsome Carl and twinkled with fun as a certainly portly youth with shaking cheeks rode past bumpetty bumpetty bump On their return the boys pronounced the great porcelain stove in the family sitting room a decidedly useful piece of furniture for they could gather around it and get warm without burning their noses or bringing on chilblains It was so very large that though hot elsewhere it seemed to send out warmth by the houseful Its pure white sides and polished brass rings made it a pretty object to look upon notwithstanding the fact that our ungrateful Ben while growing thoroughly warm and comfortable beside it concocted a satirical sentence for his next letter to the effect that a stove in Holland must of course resemble a great tower of snow or it wouldn t be in keeping with the oddity of the country To describe all the boys saw and did on that day and the next would render this little book a formidable volume indeed They visited the brass cannon foundry saw the liquid fire poured into molds and watched the smiths who half naked stood in the shadow like demons playing with flame They admired the grand public buildings and massive private houses the elegant streets and noble Bosch pride of all beauty loving Hollanders The palace with its brilliant mosaic floors its frescoed ceilings and gorgeous ornaments filled Ben with delight he was surprised that some of the churches were so very plain elaborate sometimes in external architecture but bare and bleak within with their blank whitewashed walls If there were no printed record the churches of Holland would almost tell her story I will not enter into the subject here except to say that Ben who had read of her struggles and wrongs and of the terrible retribution she had from time to time dealt forth could scarcely tread a Holland town without mentally leaping horror stricken over the bloody stepping stones of its history He could not forget Philip of Spain nor the Duke of Alva even while rejoicing in the prosperity that followed the Liberation He looked into the meekest of Dutch eyes for something of the fire that once lit the haggard faces of those desperate lawless men who wearing with pride the title of Beggars which their oppressors had mockingly cast upon them became the terror of land and sea In Haarlem he had wondered that the air did not still resound with the cries of Alva s three thousand victims In Leyden his heart had swelled in sympathy as he thought of the long procession of scarred and famished creatures who after the siege with Adrian van der Werf at their head tottered to the great church to sing a glorious anthem because Leyden was free He remembered that this was even before they had tasted the bread brought by the Dutch ships They would praise God first then eat Thousands of trembling voices were raised in glad thanksgiving For a moment it swelled higher and higher then suddenly changed to sobbing not one of all the multitude could sing another note But who shall say that anthem even to its very end was not heard in heaven Here in The Hague other thoughts came to Ben of how Holland in later years unwillingly put her head under the French yoke and how galled and lashed past endurance she had resolutely jerked it out again He liked her for that What nation of any spirit thought he could be expected to stand such work paying all her wealth into a foreign treasury and yielding up the flower of her youth under foreign conscription It was not so very long ago either since English guns had been heard booming close by in the German Ocean well all the fighting was over at last Holland was a snug little monarchy now in her own right and Ben for one was glad of it Arrived at this charitable conclusion he was prepared to enjoy to the utmost all the wonders of her capital he quite delighted Mynheer van Gend with his hearty and intelligent interest so in fact did all the boys for a merrier more observant party never went sight seeing Through the Hague The picture gallery in the Maurits Huis one of the finest in the world seemed to have only flashed by the boys during a two hour visit so much was there to admire and examine As for the royal cabinet of curiosities in the same building they felt that they had but glanced at it though they were there nearly half a day It seemed to them that Japan had poured all her treasures within its walls For a long period Holland always foremost in commerce was the only nation allowed to have any intercourse with Japan One can well forego a journey to that country if he can but visit the museum at The Hague Room after room is filled with collections from the Hermit Empire costumes peculiar to various ranks and pursuits articles of ornament household utensils weapons armor and surgical instruments There is also an ingenious Japanese model of the Island of Desina the Dutch factory in Japan It appears almost as the island itself would if seen through a reversed opera glass and makes one feel like a Gulliver coming unexpectedly upon a Japanese Lilliput There you see hundreds of people in native costumes standing kneeling stooping reaching all at work or pretending to be and their dwellings even their very furniture spread out before you plain as day In another room a huge tortoiseshell dollhouse fitted up in Dutch style and inhabited by dignified Dutch dolls stands ready to tell you at a glance how people live in Holland Gretel Hilda Katrinka even the proud Rychie Korbes would have been delighted with this but Peter and his gallant band passed it by without a glance The war implements had the honor of detaining them for an hour such clubs such murderous krits or daggers such firearms and above all such wonderful Japanese swords quite capable of performing the accredited Japanese feat of cutting a man in two at a single stroke There were Chinese and other Oriental curiosities in the collection Native historical relics too upon which our young Dutchmen gazed very soberly though they were secretly proud to show them to Ben There was a model of the cabin at Saardam in which Peter the Great lived during his short career as ship builder Also wallets and bowls once carried by the Beggar Confederates who uniting under the Prince of Orange had freed Holland from the tyranny of Spain the sword of Admiral van Speyk who about ten years before had perished in voluntarily blowing up his own ship and Van Tromp s armor with the marks of bullets upon it Jacob looked around hoping to see the broom which the plucky admiral fastened to his masthead but it was not there The waistcoat which William Third of England wore during the last days of his life possessed great interest for Ben and one and all gazed with a mixture of reverence and horror worship at the identical clothing worn by William the Silent when he was murdered at Delft by Balthazar Geraerts A tawny leather doublet and plain surcoat of gray cloth a soft felt hat and a high neck ruff from which hung one of the Beggars medals these were not in themselves very princely objects though the doublet had a tragic interest from its dark stains and bullet holes Ben could readily believe as he looked upon the garments that the Silent Prince true to his greatness of character had been exceedingly simple in his attire His aristocratic prejudices were however decidedly shocked when Lambert told him of the way in which William s bride first entered The Hague The beautiful Louisa de Coligny whose father and former husband both had fallen at the massacre of saint Bartholomew was coming to be fourth wife to the Prince and of course said Lambert we Hollanders were too gallant to allow the lady to enter the town on foot No sir we sent or rather my ancestors did a clean open post wagon to meet her with a plank across it for her to sit upon Very gallant indeed exclaimed Ben with almost a sneer in his polite laugh And she the daughter of an admiral of France Was she Upon my word I had nearly forgotten that But you see Holland had very plain ways in the good old time in fact we are a very simple frugal people to this day The Van Gend establishment is a decided exception you know A very agreeable exception I think said Ben Certainly certainly But between you and me Mynheer van Gend though he has wrought his own fortunes can afford to be magnificent and yet be frugal Exactly so said Ben profoundly at the same time stroking his upper lip and chin which latterly he believed had been showing delightful and unmistakable signs of coming dignities While tramping on foot through the city Ben often longed for a good English sidewalk Here as in the other towns there was no curb no raised pavement for foot travelers but the streets were clean and even and all vehicles were kept scrupulously within a certain tract Strange to say there were nearly as many sleds as wagons to be seen though there was not a particle of snow The sleds went scraping over the bricks or cobblestones some provided with an apparatus in front for sprinkling water to diminish the friction and some rendered less musical by means of a dripping oil rag which the driver occasionally applied to the runners Ben was surprised at the noiseless way in which Dutch laborers do their work Even around the warehouses and docks there was no bustle no shouting from one to another A certain twitch of the pipe or turn of the head or at most a raising of the hand seemed to be all the signal necessary Entire loads of cheeses or herrings are pitched from cart or canalboat into the warehouses without a word but the passerby must take his chance of being pelted for a Dutchman seldom looks before or behind him while engaged at work Poor Jacob Poot who seemed destined to bear all the mishaps of the journey was knocked nearly breathless by a great cheese which a fat Dutchman was throwing to a fellow laborer but he recovered himself and passed on without evincing the least indignation Ben professed great sympathy upon the occasion but Jacob insisted that it was notting Then why did you screw your face so when it hit you What for screw mine face repeated Jacob soberly Vy it vash de de That what insisted Ben maliciously Vy de de vat you call dis vat you taste mit de nose Ben laughed Oh you mean the smell Yesh Dat ish it said Jacob eagerly It wash de shmell I draw mine face for dat Ha ha roared Ben That s a good one A Dutch boy smell a cheese You can never make me believe THAT Vell it ish no matter replied Jacob trudging on beside Ben in perfect good humor Vait till you hit mit cheese dat ish all Soon he added pathetically Penchamin I no likes to be call Tuch dat ish no goot I bees a Hollander Just as Ben was apologizing Lambert hailed him Hold up Ben here is the fish market There is not much to be seen at this season But we can take a look at the storks if you wish Ben knew that storks were held in peculiar reverence in Holland and that the bird figured upon the arms of the capital He had noticed cart wheels placed upon the roofs of Dutch cottages to entice storks to settle upon them he had seen their huge nests too on many a thatched gable roof from Broek to The Hague But it was winter now The nests were empty No greedy birdlings opened their mouths or rather their heads at the approach of a great white winged thing with outstretched neck and legs bearing a dangling something for their breakfast The long bills were far away picking up food on African shores and before they would return in the spring Ben s visit to the land of dikes would be over Therefore he pressed eagerly forward as Van Mounen led the way through the fish market anxious to see if storks in Holland were anything like the melancholy specimens he had seen in the Zoological Gardens of London It was the same old story A tamed bird is a sad bird say what you will These storks lived in a sort of kennel chained by the feet like felons though supposed to be honored by being kept at the public expense In summer they were allowed to walk about the market where the fish stalls were like so many free dining saloons to them Untasted delicacies in the form of raw fish and butcher s offal lay about their kennels now but the city guests preferred to stand upon one leg curving back their long necks and leaning their heads sidewise in a blinking reverie How gladly they would have changed their petted state for the busy life of some hardworking stork mother or father bringing up a troublesome family on the roof of a rickety old building where flapping wind mills frightened them half to death every time they ventured forth on a frolic Ben soon made up his mind and rightly too that The Hague with its fine streets and public parks shaded with elms was a magnificent city The prevailing costume was like that of London or Paris and his British ears were many a time cheered by the music of British words The shops were different in many respects from those on Oxford Street and the Strand but they often were illumined by a printed announcement that English was spoken within Others proclaimed themselves to have London stout for sale and one actually promised to regale its customers with English roast beef Over every possible shop door was the never failing placard TABAK TE KOOP tobacco to be sold Instead of colored glass globes in the windows or high jars of leeches the drugstores had a gaping Turk s head at the entrance or if the establishment was particularly fine a wooden mandarin entire indulging in a full yawn Some of these queer faces amused Ben exceedingly they seemed to have just swallowed a dose of physic but Van Mounen declared he could not see anything funny about them A druggist showed his sense by putting a Gaper before his door so that his place would be known at once as an apotheek and that was all there was to it Another thing attracted Ben the milkmen s carts These were small affairs filled with shiny brass kettles or stone jars and drawn by dogs The milkman walked meekly beside his cart keeping his dog in order and delivering the milk to customers Certain fish dealers had dogcarts also and when a herring dog chanced to meet a milk dog he invariably put on airs and growled as he passed him Sometimes a milk dog would recognize an acquaintance before another milk cart across the street and then how the kettles would rattle especially if they were empty Each dog would give a bound and never caring for his master s whistle insist upon meeting the other halfway Sometimes they contented themselves with an inquisitive sniff but generally the smaller dog made an affectionate snap snap at the larger one s ear or a friendly tussle was engaged in by way of exercise Then woe to the milk kettles and woe to the dogs The whipping over each dog expressing his feelings as best as he could would trot demurely back to his work If some of these animals were eccentric in their ways others were remarkably well behaved In fact there was a school for dogs in the city established expressly for training them Ben probably saw some of its graduates Many a time he noticed a span of barkers trotting along the street with all the dignity of horses obeying the slightest hint of the man walking briskly beside them Sometimes when their load was delivered the dealer would jump in the cart and have a fine drive to his home beyond the gates of the city and sometimes I regret to say a patient vrouw would trudge beside the cart with a fish basket upon her head and a child in her arms while her lord enjoyed his drive carrying no heavier burden than a stumpy clay pipe the smoke of which mounted lovingly into her face A Day of Rest The sight seeing came to an end at last and so did our boys visit to The Hague They had spent three happy days and nights with the Van Gends and strange to say had not once in all that time put on skates The third day had indeed been one of rest The noise and bustle of the city was hushed sweet Sunday bells sent blessed tranquil thoughts into their hearts Ben felt as he listened to their familiar music that the Christian world is one after all however divided by sects and differences it may be As the clock speaks everyone s native language in whatever land it may strike the hour so church bells are never foreign if our hearts but listen Led on by these clear voices our party with Mevrouw van Gend and her husband trod the quiet but crowded streets until they came to a fine old church in the southern part of the city The interior was large and notwithstanding its great stained windows seemed dimly lighted though the walls were white and dashes of red and purple sunshine lay brightly upon pillar and pew Ben saw a few old women moving softly through the aisles each bearing a high pile of foot stoves which she distributed among the congregation by skillfully slipping out the under one until none were left It puzzled him that mynheer should settle himself with the boys in a comfortable side pew after seating his vrouw in the body of the church which was filled with chairs exclusively appropriated to the women But Ben was learning only a common custom of the country The pews of the nobility and the dignitaries of the city were circular in form each surrounding a column Elaborately carved they formed a massive base to their great pillars standing out in bold relief against the blank white walls beyond These columns lofty and well proportioned were nicked and defaced from violence done to them long ago yet it seemed quite fitting that before they were lost in the deep arches overhead their softened outlines should leaf out as they did into richness and beauty Soon Ben lowered his gaze to the marble floor It was a pavement of gravestones Nearly all the large slabs of which it was composed marked the resting places of the dead An armorial design engraved upon each stone with inscription and date told whose form as sleeping beneath and sometimes three of a family were lying one above the other in the same sepulcher He could not help but think of the solemn funeral procession winding by torchlight through those lofty aisles and bearing its silent burden toward a dark opening whence the slab had been lifted in readiness for its coming It was something to think that his sister Mabel who died in her flower was lying in a sunny churchyard where a brook rippled and sparkled in the daylight and waving trees whispered together all night long where flowers might nestle close to the headstone and moon and stars shed their peace upon it and morning birds sing sweetly overhead Then he looked up from the pavement and rested his eyes upon the carved oaken pulpit exquisitely beautiful in design and workmanship He could not see the minister though not long before he had watched him slowly ascending its winding stair a mild faced man wearing a ruff about his neck and a short cloak reaching nearly to the knee Meantime the great church had been silently filling Its pews were somber with men and its center radiant with women in their fresh Sunday attire Suddenly a soft rustling spread through the pulpit All eyes were turned toward the minister now appearing above the pulpit Although the sermon was spoken slowly Ben could understand little of what was said but when the hymn came he joined in with all his heart A thousand voices lifted in love and praise offered a grander language than he could readily comprehend Once he was startled during a pause in the service by seeing a little bag suddenly shaken before him It had a tinkling bell at its side and was attached to a long stick carried by one of the deacons of the church Not relying solely upon the mute appeal of the poor boxes fastened to the columns near the entrance this more direct method was resorted to of awakening the sympathies of the charitable Fortunately Ben had provided himself with a few stivers or the musical bag must have tinkled before him in vain More than once a dark look rose on our English boy s face that morning He longed to stand up and harangue the people concerning a peculiarity that filled him with pain Some of the men wore their hats during the service or took them off whenever the humor prompted and many put theirs on in the church as soon as they arose to leave No wonder Ben s sense of propriety was wounded and yet a higher sense would have been exercised had he tried to feel willing that Hollanders should follow the customs of their country But his English heart said over and over again It is outrageous It is sinful There is an angel called Charity who would often save our hearts a great deal of trouble if we would but let her in Homeward Bound On Monday morning bright and early our boys bade farewell to their kind entertainers and started on their homeward journey Peter lingered awhile at the lion guarded door for he and his sister had many parting words to say As Ben saw them bidding each other good bye he could not help feeling that kisses as well as clocks were wonderfully alike everywhere The English kiss that his sister Jenny had given him when he left home had said the same thing to him that the Vrouw van Gend s Dutch kiss said to Peter Ludwig had taken his share of the farewell in the most matter of fact manner possible and though he loved his sister well had winced a little at her making such a child of him as to put an extra kiss for mother upon his forehead He was already upon the canal with Carl and Jacob Were they thinking about sisters or kisses Not a bit of it They were so happy to be on skates once more so impatient to dart at once into the very heart of Broek that they spun and wheeled about like crazy fellows relieving themselves meantime by muttering something about Peter and donder not worth translating Even Lambert and Ben who had been waiting at the street corner began to grow impatient The captain joined them at last and they were soon on the canal with the rest Hurry up Peter growled Ludwig We re freezing by inches there I knew you d be the last after all to get on your skates Did you said his brother looking up with an air of deep interest Clever boy Ludwig laughed but tried to look cross as he said I m in earnest We must get home sometime this year Now boys cried Peter springing up as he fastened the last buckle There s a clear way before us We will imagine it s the grand race Ready One two three start I assure you that very little was said for the first half hour They were six Mercuries skimming the ice In plain English they were lightning No that is imaginary too The fact is one cannot decide what to say when half a dozen boys are whizzing past at such a rate I can only tell you that each did his best flying with bent body and eager eyes in and out among the placid skates on the canal until the very guard shouted to them to Hold up This only served to send them onward with a two boy power that startled all beholders But the laws of inertia are stronger even than canal guards After a while Jacob slackened his speed then Ludwig then Lambert then Carl They soon halted to take a long breath and finally found themselves standing in a group gazing after Peter and Ben who were still racing in the distance as if their lives were at stake It is very evident said Lambert at he and his three companions started up again that neither of them will give up until he can t help it What foolishness growled Carl to tire themselves at the beginning of the journey But they re racing in earnest that s certain Halloo Peter s flagging Not so cried Ludwig Catch him being beaten Ha ha sneered Carl I tell you boy Benjamin is ahead Now if Ludwig disliked anything in this world it was to be called a boy probably because he was nothing else He grew indignant at once Humph what are YOU I wonder There sir NOW look and see if Peter isn t ahead I think he IS interposed Lambert but I can t quite tell at this distance I think he isn t retorted Carl Jacob was growing anxious he always abhorred an argument so he said in a coaxing tone Don t quarrel don t quarrel Don t quarrel mocked Carl looking back at Jacob as he skated Who s quarreling Poot you re a goose I can t help that was Jacob s meek reply See they are nearing the turn of the canal NOW we can see cried Ludwig in great excitement Peter will make it first I know He can t for Ben is ahead insisted Carl Gunst That iceboat will run over him No He is clear They re a couple of geese anyhow Hurrah they re at the turn Who s ahead Peter cried Ludwig joyfully Good for the captain shouted Lambert and Jacob And Carl condescended to mutter It IS Peter after all I thought all the time that head fellow was Ben This turn in the canal had evidently been their goal for the two racers came to a sudden halt after passing it Carl said something about being glad that they had sense enough to stop and rest and the four boys skated on in silence to overtake their companions All the while Carl was secretly wishing that he had kept on with Peter and Ben as he felt sure he could easily have come out winner He was a very rapid though by no means a graceful skater Ben was looking at Peter with mingled vexation admiration and surprise as the boys drew near They heard him saying in English You re a perfect bird on the ice Peter van Holp The first fellow that ever beat me in a fair race I can tell you Peter who understood the language better than he could speak it returned a laughing bow at Ben s compliment but made no further reply Possibly he was scant of breath at the time Now Penchamin vat you do mit yourself Get so hot as a fire brick dat ish no goot was Jacob s plaintive comment Nonsense answered Ben This frosty air will cool me soon enough I am not tired You are beaten though my boy said Lambert in English and fairly too How will it be I wonder on the day of the grand race Ben flushed and gave a proud defiant laugh as if to say This was mere pastime I m DETERMINED to beat then come what will Boys and Girls By the time the boys reached the village of Voorhout which stands near the grand canal about halfway between The Hague and Haarlem they were forced to hold a council The wind though moderate at first had grown stronger and stronger until at last they could hardly skate against it The weather vanes throughout the country had evidently entered into a conspiracy No use trying to face such a blow as this said Ludwig It cuts its way down a man s throat like a knife Keep your mouth shut then grunted the affable Carl who was as strong chested as a young ox I m for keeping on In this case interposed Peter we must consul the weakest of the party rather than the strongest The captain s principle was all right but its application was not flattering to Master Ludwig Shrugging his shoulders he retorted Who s weak Not I for one but the wind s stronger than any of us I hope you ll condescend to admit that Ha ha laughed Van Mounen who could barely keep his feet So it is Just then the weather vanes telegraphed to each other by a peculiar twitch and in an instant the gust came It nearly threw the strong chested Carl it almost strangled Jacob and quite upset Ludwig This settles the question shouted Peter Off with your skates We ll go into Voorhout At Voorhout they found a little inn with a big yard The yard was well stocked and better than all was provided with a complete set of skittles so our boys soon turned the detention into a frolic The wind was troublesome even in that sheltered quarter but they were on good standing ground and did not mind it First a hearty dinner then the game With pins as long as their arms and balls as big as their heads plenty of strength left for rolling and a clean sweep of sixty yards for the strokes no wonder they were happy That night Captain Peter and his men slept soundly No prowling robber came to disturb them and as they were distributed in separate rooms they did not even have a bolster battle in the morning Such a breakfast as they ate The landlord looked frightened When he had asked them where they belonged he made up his mind that the Broek people starved their children It was a shame Such fine young gentlemen too Fortunately the wind had tired itself out and fallen asleep in the great sea cradle beyond the dunes There were signs of snow otherwise the weather was fine It was mere child s play for the well rested boys to skate to Leyden Here they halted awhile for Peter had an errand at the Golden Eagle He left the city with a lightened heart doctor Boekman had been at the hotel read the note containing Hans s message and departed for Broek I cannot say that it was your letter sent him off so soon explained the landlord Some rich lady in Broek was taken bad very sudden and he was sent for in haste Peter turned pale What was the name he asked Indeed it went in one ear and out of the other for all I hindered it Plague on people who can t see a traveler in comfortable lodgings but they must whisk him off before one can breathe A lady in Broek did you say Yes Very gruffly Any other business young master No mine host except that I and my comrades here would like a bite of something and a drink of hot coffee Ah said the landlord sweetly a bite you shall have and coffee too the finest in Leyden Walk up to the stove my masters now I think again that was a widow lady from Rotterdam I think they said visiting at one Van Stoepel s if I mistake not Ah said Peter greatly relieved They live in the white house by the Schlossen Mill Now mynheer the coffee please What a goose I was thought he as the party left the Golden Eagle to feel so sure that it was my mother But she may be somebody s mother poor woman for all that Who can she be I wonder There were not many upon the canal that day between Leyden and Haarlem However as the boys neared Amsterdam they found themselves once more in the midst of a moving throng The big ysbreeker had been at work for the first time that season but there was any amount of skating ground left yet Three cheers for home cried Van Mounen as they came in sight of the great Western Dock Westelijk Dok Hurrah Hurrah shouted one and all Hurrah Hurrah This trick of cheering was an importation among our party Lambert van Mounen had brought it from England As they always gave it in English it was considered quite an exploit and when circumstances permitted always enthusiastically performed to the sore dismay of their quiet loving countrymen Therefore their arrival at Amsterdam created a great sensation especially among the small boys on the wharf The Y was crossed They were on the Broek canal Lambert s home was reached first Good bye boys he cried as he left them We ve had the greatest frolic ever known in Holland So we have Good bye Van Mounen answered the boys Good bye Peter hailed him I say Van Mounen the classes begin tomorrow I know it Our holiday is over Good bye again Good bye Broek came in sight Such meetings Katrinka was upon the canal Carl was delighted Hilda was there Peter felt rested in an instant Rychie was there Ludwig and Jacob nearly knocked each other over in their eagerness to shake hands with her Dutch girls are modest and generally quiet but they have very glad eyes For a few moments it was hard to decide whether Hilda Rychie or Katrinka felt the most happy Annie Bouman was also on the canal looking even prettier than the other maidens in her graceful peasant s costume But she did not mingle with Rychie s party neither did she look unusually happy The one she liked most to see was not among the newcomers Indeed he was not upon the canal at all She had not been near Broek before since the Eve of Saint Nicholas for she was staying with her sick grandmother in Amsterdam and had been granted a brief resting spell as the grandmother called it because she had been such a faithful little nurse night and day Annie had devoted her resting spell to skating with all her might toward Broek and back again in the hope of meeting her mother on the canal or it might be Gretel Brinker Not one of them had she seen and she must hurry back without even catching a glimpse of her mother s cottage for the poor helpless grandmother she knew was by this time moaning for someone to turn her upon her cot Where can Gretel be thought Annie as she flew over the ice she can almost always steal a few moments from her work at this time of day Poor Gretel What a dreadful thing it must be to have a dull father I should be woefully afraid of him I know so strong and yet so strange Annie had not heard of his illness Dame Brinker and her affairs received but little notice from the people of the place If Gretel had not been known as a goose girl she might have had more friends among the peasantry of the neighborhood As it was Annie Bouman was the only one who did not feel ashamed to avow herself by word and deed the companion of Gretel and Hans When the neighbors children laughed at her for keeping such poor company she would simply flush when Hans was ridiculed or laugh in a careless disdainful way but to hear little Gretel abused always awakened her wrath Goose girl indeed she would say I can tell you that any of you are fitter for the work than she My father often said last summer that it troubled him to see such a bright eyed patient little maiden tending geese Humph She would not harm them as you would Janzoon Kolp and she would not tread upon them as you might Kate Wouters This would be pretty sure to start a laugh at the clumsy ill natured Kate s expense and Annie would walk loftily away from the group of young gossips Perhaps some memory of Gretel s assailants crossed her mind as she skated rapidly toward Amsterdam for her eyes sparkled ominously and she more than once gave her pretty head a defiant toss When that mood passed such a bright rosy affectionate look illuminated her face that more than one weary working man turned to gaze after her and to wish that he had a glad contented lass like that for a daughter There were five joyous households in Broek that night The boys were back safe and sound and they found all well at home Even the sick lady at neighbor Van Stoepel s was out of danger But the next morning Ah how stupidly school bells will ding dong ding dong when one is tired Ludwig was sure that he had never listened to anything so odious Even Peter felt pathetic on the occasion Carl said it was a shameful thing for a fellow to have to turn out when his bones were splitting And Jacob soberly bade Ben Goot pye and walked off with his satchel as if it weighed a hundred pounds The Crisis While the boys are nursing their fatigue we will take a peep into the Brinker cottage Can it be that Gretel and her mother have not stirred since we saw them last That the sick man upon the bed has not even turned over It was four days ago and there is the sad group just as it was before No not precisely the same for Raff Brinker is paler his fever is gone though he knows nothing of what is passing Then they were alone in the bare clean room Now there is another group in an opposite corner doctor Boekman is there talking in a low tone with a stout young man who listens intently The stout young man is his student and assistant Hans is there also He stands near the window respectfully waiting until he shall be accosted You see Vollenhoven said doctor Boekman it is a clear case of And here the doctor went off into a queer jumble of Latin and Dutch that I cannot conveniently translate After a while as Vollenhoven looked at him rather blankly the learned man condescended to speak to him in simpler phrase It is probably like Rip Donderdunck s case he exclaimed in a low mumbling tone He fell from the top of Voppelploot s windmill After the accident the man was stupid and finally became idiotic In time he lay helpless like yon fellow on the bed moaned too like him and kept constantly lifting his hand to his head My learned friend Von Choppem performed an operation upon this Donderdunck and discovered under the skull a small dark sac which pressed upon the brain This had been the cause of the trouble My friend Von Choppem removed it a splendid operation You see according to Celsius And here the doctor again went off into Latin Did the man live asked the assistant respectfully doctor Boekman scowled That is of no consequence I believe he died but why not fix your mind on the grand features of the case Consider a moment how And he plunged into Latin mysteries more deeply than ever But mynheer gently persisted the student who knew that the doctor would not rise to the surface for hours unless pulled at once from his favorite depths Mynheer you have other engagements today three legs in Amsterdam you remember and an eye in Broek and that tumor up the canal The tumor can wait said the doctor reflectively That is another beautiful case a beautiful case The woman has not lifted her head from her shoulder for two months magnificent tumor sir The doctor by this time was speaking aloud He had quite forgotten where he was Vollenhoven made another attempt This poor fellow on the bed mynheer Do you think you can save him Ah indeed certainly stammered the doctor suddenly perceiving that he had been talking rather off the point Certainly that is I hope so If anyone in Holland can mynheer murmured the assistant with honest bluntness it is yourself The doctor looked displeased growled out a tender request for the student to talk less and beckoned Hans to draw near This strange man had a great horror of speaking to women especially on surgical matters One can never tell he said what moment the creatures will scream or faint Therefore he explained Raff Brinker s case to Hans and told him what he believed should be done to save the patient Hans listened attentively growing red and pale by turns and throwing quick anxious glances toward the bed It may KILL the father did you say mynheer he exclaimed at last in a trembling whisper It may my boy But I have a strong belief that it will cure and not kill Ah If boys were not such dunces I could lay the whole matter before you but it would be of no use Hans looked blank at this compliment It would be of no use repeated doctor Boekman indignantly A great operation is proposed but one might as well do it with a hatchet The only question asked is Will it kill The question is EVERYTHING to us mynheer said Hans with tearful dignity doctor Boekman looked at him in sudden dismay Ah Exactly so You are right boy I am a fool Good boy One does not wish one s father killed of course I am a fool Will he die mynheer if this sickness goes on Humph This is no new illness The same thing growing worse ever instant pressure on the brain will take him off soon like THAT said the doctor snapping his fingers And the operation MAY save him pursued Hans How soon mynheer can we know doctor Boekman grew impatient In a day perhaps an hour Talk with your mother boy and let her decide My time is short Hans approached his mother at first when she looked up at him he could not utter a syllable then turning his eyes away he said in a firm voice I must speak with the mother alone Quick little Gretel who could not quite understand what was passing threw rather an indignant look at Hans and walked away Come back Gretel and sit down said Hans sorrowfully She obeyed Dame Brinker and her boy stood by the window while the doctor and his assistant bending over the bedside conversed together in a low tone There was no danger of disturbing the patient He appeared like one blind and deaf Only his faint piteous moans showed him to be a living man Hans was talking earnestly and in a low voice for he did not wish his sister to hear With dry parted lips Dame Brinker leaned toward him searching his face as if suspecting a meaning beyond his words Once she gave a quick frightened sob that made Gretel start but after that she listened calmly When Hans ceased to speak his mother turned gave one long agonized look at her husband lying there so pale and unconscious and threw herself on her knees beside the bed Poor little Gretel What did all this mean She looked with questioning eyes at Hans he was standing but his head was bent as if in prayer at the doctor He was gently feeling her father s head and looked like one examining some curious stone at the assistant The man coughed and turned away at her mother Ah little Gretel that was the best you could do to kneel beside her and twine your warm young arms about her neck to weep and implore God to listen When the mother arose doctor Boekman with a show of trouble in his eyes asked gruffly Well jufvrouw shall it be done Will it pain him mynheer she asked in a trembling voice I cannot say Probably not Shall it be done It MAY cure him you said and mynheer did you tell my boy that perhaps perhaps She could not finish Yes jufvrouw I said the patient might sink under the operation but we hope it may prove otherwise He looked at his watch The assistant moved impatiently toward the window Come jufvrouw time presses Yes or no Hans wound his arm about his mother It was not his usual way He even leaned his head against her shoulder The meester awaits an answer he whispered Dame Brinker had long been head of her house in every sense Many a time she had been very stern with Hans ruling him with a strong hand and rejoicing in her motherly discipline NOW she felt so weak so helpless It was something to feel that firm embrace There was strength even in the touch of that yellow hair She turned to her boy imploringly Oh Hans What shall I say Say what God tells thee Mother answered Hans bowing his head One quick questioning prayer to Heaven rose from the mother s heart The answer came She turned toward doctor Boekman It is right mynheer I consent Humph grunted the doctor as if to say You ve been long enough about it Then he conferred a moment with his assistant who listened with great outward deference but was inwardly rejoicing at the grand joke he would have to tell his fellow students He had actually seen a tear in old Boekman s eye Meanwhile Gretel looked on in trembling silence but when she saw the doctor open a leather case and take out one sharp gleaming instrument after another she sprang forward Oh Mother The poor father meant no wrong Are they going to MURDER him I do not know child screamed Dame Brinker looking fiercely at Gretel I do not know This will not do jufvrouw said doctor Boekman sternly and at the same time he cast a quick penetrating look at Hans You and the girl must leave the room The boy may stay Dame Brinker drew herself up in an instant Her eyes flashed Her whole countenance was changed She looked like one who had never wept never felt a moment s weakness Her voice was low but decided I stay with my husband mynheer doctor Boekman looked astonished His orders were seldom disregarded in this style For an instant his eye met hers You may remain jufvrouw he said in an altered voice Gretel had already disappeared In one corner of the cottage was a small closet where her rough boxlike bed was fastened against the wall None would think of the trembling little creature crouching there in the dark doctor Boekman took off his heavy coat filled an earthen basin with water and placed it near the bed Then turning to Hans he asked Can I depend upon you boy You can mynheer I believe you Stand at the head here your mother may sit at your right so And he placed a chair near the cot Remember jufvrouw there must be no cries no fainting Dame Brinker answered him with a look He was satisfied Now Vollenhoven Oh that case with the terrible instruments The assistant lifted them Gretel who had been peering with brimming eyes through the crack of the closet door could remain silent no longer She rushed frantically across the apartment seized her hood and ran from the cottage Gretel and Hilda It was recess hour At the first stroke of the schoolhouse bell the canal seemed to give a tremendous shout and grow suddenly alive with boys and girls Dozens of gaily clad children were skating in and out among each other and all their pent up merriment of the morning was relieving itself in song and shout and laughter There was nothing to check the flow of frolic Not a thought of schoolbooks came out with them into the sunshine Latin arithmetic grammar all were locked up for an hour in the dingy schoolroom The teacher might be a noun if he wished and a proper one at that but THEY meant to enjoy themselves As long as the skating was as perfect as this it made no difference whether Holland were on the North Pole or the equator and as for philosophy how could they bother themselves with inertia and gravitation and such things when it was as much as they could do to keep from getting knocked over in the commotion In the height of the fun one of the children called out What is that What Where cried a dozen voices Why don t you see That dark thing over there by the idiot s cottage I don t see anything said one I do shouted another It s a dog Where s any dog put in a squeaky voice that we have heard before It s no such thing it s a heap of rags Pooh Voost retorted another gruffly that s about as near the fact as you ever get It s the goose girl Gretel looking for rats Well what of it squeaked Voost Isn t SHE a bundle of rags I d like to know Ha ha Pretty good for you Voost You ll get a medal for wit yet if you keep on You d get something else if her brother Hans were here I ll warrant you would said a muffled up little fellow with a cold in his head As Hans was NOT there Voost could afford to scout the insinuation Who cares for HIM little sneezer I d fight a dozen like him any day and you in the bargain You would would you I d like to catch you all at it and by way of proving his words the sneezer skated off at the top of his speed Just then a general chase after three of the biggest boys of the school was proposed and friend and foe frolicsome as ever were soon united in a common cause Only one of all that happy throng remembered the dark little form by the idiot s cottage Poor frightened little Gretel She was not thinking of them though their merry laughter floated lightly toward her making her feel like one in a dream How loud the moans were behind the darkened window What if those strange men were really killing her father The thought made her spring to her feet with a cry of horror Ah no She sobbed sinking upon the frozen mound of earth where she had been sitting Mother is there and Hans They will care for him But how pale they were And even Hans was crying Why did the cross old meester keep him and send me away she thought I could have clung to the mother and kissed her That always makes her stroke my hair and speak gently even after she has scolded me How quiet it is now Oh if the father should die and Hans and the mother what WOULD I do And Gretel shivering with cold buried her face in her arms and cried as if her heart would break The poor child had been tasked beyond her strength during the past four days Through all she had been her mother s willing little handmaiden soothing helping and cheering the half widowed woman by day and watching and praying beside her all the long night She knew that something terrible and mysterious was taking place at this moment something that had been too terrible and mysterious for even kind good Hans to tell Then new thoughts came Why had not Hans told her It was a shame It was HER father as well as his She was no baby She had once taken a sharp knife from the father s hand She had even drawn him away from the mother on that awful night when Hans as big as he was could not help her Why then must she be treated like one who could do nothing oh how very still it was how bitter bitter cold If Annie Bouman had only stayed home instead of going to Amsterdam it wouldn t be so lonely How cold her feet were growing Was it the moaning that made her feel as if she were floating in the air This would not do the mother might need her help at any moment Rousing herself with an effort Gretel sat upright rubbing her eyes and wondering wondering that the sky was so bright and blue wondering at the stillness in the cottage more than all at the laughter rising and falling in the distance Soon she sank down again the strange medley of thought growing more and more confused in her bewildered brain What a strange lip the meester had How the stork s nest upon the roof seemed to rustle and whisper down to her How bright those knives were in the leather case brighter perhaps than the silver skates If she had but worn her new jacket she would not shiver so The new jacket was pretty the only pretty thing she had ever worn God had taken care of her father so long He would do it still if those two men would but go away Ah now the meesters were on the roof they were clambering to the top no it was her mother and Hans or the storks It was so dark who could tell And the mound rocking swinging in that strange way How sweetly the birds were singing They must be winter birds for the air was thick with icicles not one bird but twenty Oh hear them Mother Wake me Mother for the race I am so tired with crying and crying A firm hand was laid upon her shoulder Get up little girl cried a kind voice This will not do for you to lie here and freeze Gretel slowly raised her head She was so sleepy that it seemed nothing strange to her that Hilda van Gleck should be leaning over her looking with kind beautiful eyes into her face She had often dreamed it before But she had never dreamed that Hilda was shaking her roughly almost dragging her by main force never dreamed that she heard her saying Gretel Gretel Brinker You MUST wake This was real Gretel looked up Still the lovely delicate young lady was shaking rubbing fairly pounding her It must be a dream No there was the cottage and the stork s nest and the meester s coach by the canal She could see them now quite plainly Her hands were tingling her feet throbbing Hilda was forcing her to walk At last Gretel began to feel like herself again I have been asleep she faltered rubbing her eyes with both hands and looking very much ashamed Yes indeed entirely too much asleep laughed Hilda whose lips were very pale but you are well enough now Lean upon me Gretel There keep moving you will soon be warm enough to go by the fire Now let me take you into the cottage Oh no no no jufvrouw not in there The meester is there He sent me away Hilda was puzzled but she wisely forebore to ask at present for an explanation Very well Gretel try to walk faster I saw you upon the mound some time ago but I thought you were playing That is right keep moving All this time the kindhearted girl had been forcing Gretel to walk up and down supporting her with one arm and with the other striving as well as she could to take off her own warm sacque Suddenly Gretel suspected her intention Oh jufvrouw jufvrouw she cried imploringly PLEASE never think of such a thing as THAT Oh please keep it on I am burning all over jufvrouw I really am burning Not burning exactly but pins and needles pricking all over me Oh jufvrouw don t The poor child s dismay was so genuine that Hilda hastened to reassure her Very well Gretel move your arms then so Why your cheeks are as pink as roses already I think the meester would let you in now he certainly would Is your father so very ill Ah jufvrouw cried Gretel weeping afresh he is dying I think There are two meesters in with him at this moment and the mother has scarcely spoken today Can you hear him moan jufvrouw she added with sudden terror The air buzzes so I cannot hear He may be dead Oh I do wish I could hear him Hilda listened The cottage was very near but not a sound could be heard Something told her that Gretel was right She ran to the window You cannot see there my lady sobbed Gretel eagerly The mother has oiled paper hanging inside But at the other one in the south end of the cottage you can look in where the paper is torn Hilda in her anxiety ran around past the corner where the low roof was fringed with its loosened thatch A sudden thought checked her It is not right for me to peep into another s house in this way she said to herself Then softly calling to Gretel she added in a whisper You may look perhaps he is only sleeping Gretel tried to walk briskly toward the spot but her limbs were trembling Hilda hastened to her support You are sick yourself I fear she said kindly No not sick jufvrouw but my heart cries all the time now even when my eyes are as dry as yours Why jufvrouw your eyes are not dry Are you crying for US Oh jufvrouw if God sees you Oh I know father will get better now And the little creature even while reaching to look through the tiny window kissed Hilda s hand again and again The sash was sadly patched and broken a torn piece of paper hung halfway down across it Gretel s face was pressed to the window Can you see anything whispered Hilda at last Yes the father lies very still his head is bandaged and all their eyes are fastened upon him Oh jufvrouw almost screamed Gretel as she started back and by a quick dexterous movement shook off her heavy wooden shoes I MUST go in to my mother Will you come with me Not now the bell is ringing I shall come again soon Good bye Gretel scarcely heard the words She remembered for many a day afterward the bright pitying smile on Hilda s face as she turned away The Awakening An angel could not have entered the cottage more noiselessly Gretel not daring to look at anyone slid softly to her mother s side The room was very still She could hear the old doctor breathe She could almost hear the sparks as they fell into the ashes on the hearth The mother s hand was very cold but a burning spot glowed on her cheek and her eyes were like a deer s so bright so sad so eager At last there was a movement upon the bed very slight but enough to cause them all to start doctor Boekman leaned eagerly forward Another movement The large hands so white and soft for a poor man s hand twitched then raised itself steadily toward the forehead It felt the bandage not in a restless crazy way but with a questioning movement that caused even doctor Boekman to hold his breath Steady Steady said a voice that sounded very strange to Gretel Shift that mat higher boys Now throw on the clay The waters are rising fast no time to Dame Brinker sprang forward like a young panther She seized his hands and leaning over him cried Raff Raff boy speak to me Is it you Meitje he asked faintly I have been asleep hurt I think Where is little Hans Here I am Father shouted Hans half mad with joy But the doctor held him back He knows us screamed Dame Brinker Great God He knows us Gretel Gretel Come see your father In vain doctor Boekman commanded Silence and tried to force them from the bedside He could not keep them off Hans and the mother laughed and cried together as they hung over the newly awakened man Gretel made no sound but gazed at them all with glad startled eyes Her father was speaking in a faint voice Is the baby asleep Meitje The baby echoed Dame Brinker Oh Gretel that is you And he calls Hans little Hans Ten years asleep Oh mynheer you have saved us all He has known nothing for ten years Children why don t you thank the meester The good woman was beside herself with joy doctor Boekman said nothing but as his eye met hers he pointed upward She understood So did Hans and Gretel With one accord they knelt by the cot side by side Dame Brinker felt for her husband s hand even while she was praying doctor Boekman s head was bowed the assistant stood by the hearth with his back toward them Why do you pray murmured the father looking feebly from the bed as they rose Is it God s day It was not Sunday but his vrouw bowed her head she could not speak Then we should have a chapter said Raff Brinker speaking slowly and with difficulty I do not know how it is I am very very weak Mayhap the minister will read it to us Gretel lifted the big Dutch Bible from its carved shelf doctor Boekman rather dismayed at being called a minister coughed and handed the volume to his assistant Read he murmured These people must be kept quiet or the man will die yet When the chapter was finished Dame Brinker motioned mysteriously to the rest by way of telling them that her husband was asleep Now jufvrouw said the doctor in a subdued tone as he drew on his thick woolen mittens there must be perfect quiet You understand This is truly a most remarkable case I shall come again tomorrow Give the patient no food today and bowing hastily he left the cottage followed by his assistant His grand coach was not far away the driver had kept the horses moving slowly up and down by the canal nearly all the time the doctor had been in the cottage Hans went out also May God bless you mynheer he said blushing and trembling I can never repay you but if Yes you can interrupted the doctor crossly You can use your wits when the patient wakes again This clacking and sniveling is enough to kill a well man let alone one lying on the edge of his grave If you want your father to get well keep em quiet So saying doctor Boekman without another word stalked off to meet his coach leaving Hans standing there with eyes and mouth wide open Hilda was reprimanded severely that day for returning late to school after recess and for imperfect recitations She had remained near the cottage until she heard Dame Brinker laugh until she had heard Hans say Here I am Father And then she had gone back to her lessons What wonder that she missed them How could she get a long string of Latin verbs by heart when her heart did not care a fig for them but would keep saying to itself Oh I am so glad I am so glad Bones and Tongues Bones are strange things One would suppose that they knew nothing at all about school affairs but they do Even Jacob Poot s bones buried as they were in flesh were sharp in the matter of study hours Early on the morning of his return they ached through and through giving Jacob a twinge at every stroke of the school bell as if to say Stop that clapper There s trouble in it After school on the contrary they were quiet and comfortable in fact seemed to be taking a nap among their cushions The other boys bones behaved in a similar manner but that is not so remarkable Being nearer the daylight than Jacob s they might be expected to be more learned in the ways of the world Master Ludwig s especially were like beauty only skin deep they were the most knowing bones you ever heard of Just put before him ever so quietly a grammar book with a long lessons marked in it and immediately the sly bone over his eyes would set up such an aching Request him to go to the garret for your foot stove instantly the bones would remind him that he was too tired Ask him to go to the confectioner s a mile away and PRESTO not a bone would remember that it had ever been used before Bearing all this in mind you will not wonder when I tell you that our five boys were among the happiest of the happy throng pouring forth from the schoolhouse that day Peter was in excellent spirits He had heard through Hilda of Dame Brinker s laugh and of Hans s joyous words and he needed no further proof that Raff Brinker was a cured man In fact the news had gone forth in every direction for miles around Persons who had never before cared for the Brinkers or even mentioned them except with a contemptuous sneer or a shrug of pretended pity now became singularly familiar with every point of their history There was no end to the number of ridiculous stories that were flying about Hilda in the excitement of the moment had stopped to exchange a word with the doctor s coachman as he stood by the horses pommelling his chest and clapping his hands Her kind heart was overflowing She could not help pausing to tell the cold tired looking man that she thought the doctor would be out soon she even hinted to him that she suspected only suspected that a wonderful cure had been performed an idiot brought to his senses Nay she was SURE of it for she had heard his widow laugh no not his widow of course but his wife for the man was as much alive as anybody and for all she knew sitting up and talking like a lawyer All this was very indiscreet Hilda in an impenitent sort of way felt it to be so But it is always so delightful to impart pleasant or surprising news She went tripping along by the canal quite resolved to repeat the sin ad infinitum and tell nearly every girl and boy in the school Meantime Janzoon Kolp came skating by Of course in two seconds he was striking slippery attitudes and shouting saucy things to the coachman who stared at him in indolent disdain This to Janzoon was equivalent to an invitation to draw nearer The coachman was now upon his box gathering up the reins and grumbling at his horses Janzoon accosted him I say What s going on at the idiot s cottage Is your boss in there Coachman nodded mysteriously Whew whistled Janzoon drawing closer Old Brinker dead The driver grew big with importance and silent in proportion See here old pincushion I d run home yonder and get you a chunk of gingerbread if I thought you could open your mouth Old pincushion was human long hours of waiting had made him ravenously hungry At Janzoon s hint his countenance showed signs of a collapse That s right old fellow pursued his tempter Hurry up What news old Brinker dead No CURED Got his wits said the coachman shooting forth his words one at a time like so many bullets Like bullets figuratively speaking they hit Janzoon Kolp He jumped as if he had been shot Goede Gunst You don t say so The man pressed his lips together and looked significantly toward Master Kolp s shabby residence Just then Janzoon saw a group of boys in the distance Hailing them in a rowdy style common to boys of his stamp all over the world weather in Africa Japan Amsterdam or Paris he scampered toward them forgetting coachman gingerbread everything but the wonderful news Therefore by sundown it was well known throughout the neighboring country that doctor Boekman chancing to stop at the cottage had given the idiot Brinker a tremendous dose of medicine as brown as gingerbread It had taken six men to hold him while it was poured down The idiot had immediately sprung to his feet in full possession of all his faculties knocked over the doctor or thrashed him there was admitted to be a slight uncertainty as to which of these penalties was inflicted then sat down and addressed him for all the world like a lawyer After that he had turned and spoken beautifully to his wife and children Dame Brinker had laughed herself into violent hysterics Hans had said Here I am Father your own dear son And Gretel had said Here I am Father your own dear Gretel And the doctor had afterward been seen leaning back in his carriage looking just as white as a corpse A New Alarm When doctor Boekman called the next day at the Brinker cottage he could not help noticing the cheerful comfortable aspect of the place An atmosphere of happiness breathed upon him as he opened the door Dame Brinker sat complacently knitting beside the bed her husband was enjoying a tranquil slumber and Gretel was noiselessly kneading rye bread on the table in the corner The doctor did not remain long He asked a few simple questions appeared satisfied with the answers and after feeling his patient s pulse said Ah very weak yet jufvrouw Very weak indeed He must have nourishment You may begin to feed the patient Ahem Not too much but what you do give him let it be strong and of the best Black bread we have mynheer and porridge replied Dame Brinker cheerily They have always agreed with him well Tut tut said the doctor frowning Nothing of the kind He must have the juice of fresh meat white bread dried and toasted good Malaga wine and ahem The man looks cold Give him more covering something light and warm Where is the boy Hans mynheer has gone into Broek to look for work He will be back soon Will the meester please be seated Whether the hard polished stool offered by Dame Brinker did not look particularly tempting or whether the dame herself frightened him partly because she was a woman and partly because an anxious distressed look had suddenly appeared in her face I cannot say Certain it is that our eccentric doctor looked hurriedly about him muttered something about an extraordinary case bowed and disappeared before Dame Brinker had time to say another word Strange that the visit of their good benefactor should have left a cloud yet so it was Gretel frowned an anxious childish frown and kneaded the bread dough violently without looking up Dame Brinker hurried to her husband s bedside leaned over him and fell into silent but passionate weeping In a moment Hans entered Why Mother he whispered in alarm what ails thee Is the father worse She turned her quivering face toward him making no attempt to conceal her distress Yes He is starving perishing A meester said it Hans turned pale What does this mean Mother We must feed him at once Here Gretel give me the porridge Nay cried his mother distractedly yet without raising her voice It may kill him Our poor fare is too heavy for him Oh Hans he will die the father will DIE if we use him this way He must have meat and sweet wine and a dekbed Oh what shall I do what shall I do she sobbed wringing her hands There is not a stiver in the house Gretel pouted It was the only way she could express sympathy just then Her tears fell one by one into the dough Did the meester say he MUST have these things Mother asked Hans Yes he did Well Mother don t cry HE SHALL HAVE THEM I shall bring meat and wine before night Take the cover from my bed I can sleep in the straw Yes Hans but it is heavy scant as it is The meester said he must have something light and warm He will perish Our peat is giving out Hans The father has wasted it sorely throwing it on when I was not looking dear man Never mind Mother whispered Hans cheerfully We can cut down the willow tree and burn it if need be but I ll bring home something tonight There MUST be work in Amsterdam though there s none in Broek Never fear Mother the worst trouble of all is past We can brave anything now that the father is himself again Aye sobbed Dame Brinker hastily drying her eyes That is true indeed Of course it is Look at him Mother how softly he sleeps Do you think God would let him starve just after giving him back to us Why Mother I m as SURE of getting all the father needs as if my pocket were bursting with gold There now don t fret And hurriedly kissing her Hans caught up his skates and slipped from the cottage Poor Hans Disappointed in his morning s errand half sickened with this new trouble he wore a brave look and tried to whistle as he tramped resolutely off with the firm intention of mending matters Want had never before pressed so sorely upon the Brinker family Their stock of peat was nearly exhausted and all the flour in the cottage was in Gretel s dough They had scarcely cared to eat during the past few days scarcely realized their condition Dame Brinker had felt so sure that she and the children could earn money before the worst came that she had given herself up to the joy of her husband s recovery She had not even told Hans that the few pieces of silver in the old mitten were quite gone Hans reproached himself now that he had not hailed the doctor when he saw him enter his coach and drive rapidly away in the direction of Amsterdam Perhaps there is some mistake he thought The meester surely would have known that meat and sweet wine were not at our command and yet the father looks very weak he certainly does I MUST get work If Mynheer van Holp were back from Rotterdam I could get plenty to do But Master Peter told me to let him know if he could do aught to serve us I shall go to him at once Oh if it were but summer All this time Hans was hastening toward the canal Soon his skates were on and he was skimming rapidly toward the residence of Mynheer van Holp The father must have meat and wine at once he muttered but how can I earn the money in time to buy them today There is no other way but to go as I PROMISED to Master Peter What would a gift of meat and wine be to him When the father is once fed I can rush down to Amsterdam and earn the morrow s supply Then came other thoughts thoughts that made his heart thump heavily and his cheeks burn with a new shame It is BEGGING to say the least Not one of the Brinkers has ever been a beggar Shall I be the first Shall my poor father just coming back into life learn that his family has asked for charity he always so wise and thrifty No cried Hans aloud better a thousand times to part with the watch I can at least borrow money on it in Amsterdam he thought turning around That will be no disgrace I can find work at once and get it back again Nay perhaps I can even SPEAK TO THE FATHER ABOUT IT This last thought made the lad dance for joy Why not indeed speak to the father He was a rational being now He may wake thought Hans quite bright and rested may tell us the watch is of no consequence to sell it of course And Hans almost flew over the ice A few moments more and the skates were again swinging from his arm He was running toward the cottage His mother met him at the door Oh Hans she cried her face radiant with joy the young lady has been here with her maid She brought everything meat jelly wine and bread a whole basketful Then the meester sent a man from town with more wine and a fine bed and blankets for the father Oh he will get well now God bless them God bless them echoed Hans and for the first time that day his eyes filled with tears The Father s Return That evening Raff Brinker felt so much better that he insisted upon sitting up for a while on the rough high backed chair by the fire For a few moments there was quite a commotion in the little cottage Hans was all important on the occasion for his father was a heavy man and needed something firm to lean upon The dame though none of your fragile ladies was in such a state of alarm and excitement at the bold step they were taking in lifting him without the meester s orders that she came near pulling her husband over even while she believed herself to be his main prop and support Steady vrouw steady panted Raff Have I grown old and feeble or is it the fever makes me thus helpless Hear the man Dame Brinker laughed talking like any other Christian Why you re only weak from the fever Raff Here s the chair all fixed snug and warm Now sit thee down hi di didy there we are With these words Dame Brinker let her half of the burden settle slowly into the chair Hans prudently did the same Meanwhile Gretel flew about generally bringing every possible thing to her mother to tuck behind the father s back and spread over his knees Then she twitched the carved bench under his feet and Hans kicked the fire to make it brighter The father was sitting up at last What wonder that he looked about him like one bewildered Little Hans had just been almost carrying him The baby was over four feet long and was demurely brushing up the hearth with a bundle of willow wisps Meitje the vrouw winsome and fair as ever had gained at least fifty pounds in what seemed to him a few hours She also had some new lines in her face that puzzled him The only familiar things in the room were the pine table that he had made before he was married the Bible upon the shelf and the cupboard in the corner Ah Raff Brinker it was only natural that your eyes should fill with hot tears even while looking at the joyful faces of your loved ones Ten years dropped from a man s life are no small loss ten years of manhood of household happiness and care ten years of honest labor of conscious enjoyment of sunshine and outdoor beauty ten years of grateful life one day looking forward to all this the next waking to find them passed and a blank What wonder the scalding tears dropped one by one upon your cheek Tender little Gretel The prayer of her life was answered through those tears She LOVED her father silently at that moment Hans and his mother glanced silently at each other when they saw her spring toward him and throw her arms about his neck Father DEAR Father she whispered pressing her cheek close to his don t cry We are all here God bless thee sobbed Raff kissing her again and again I had forgotten that Soon he looked up again and spoke in a cheerful voice I should know her vrouw he said holding the sweet young face between his hands and gazing at it as though he were watching it grow I should know her The same blue eyes and the lips and ah me the little song she could sing almost before she could stand But that was long ago he added with a sigh still looking at her dreamily Long ago it s all gone now Not so indeed cried Dame Brinker eagerly Do you think I would let her forget it Gretel child sing the old song thou hast known so long Raff Brinker s hand fell wearily and his eyes closed but it was something to see the smile playing about his mouth as Gretel s voice floated about him like incense It was a simple air she had never known the words With loving instinct she softened every note until Raff almost fancied that his two year old baby was once more beside him As soon as the song was finished Hans mounted a wooden stool and began to rummage in the cupboard Have a care Hans said Dame Brinker who through all her poverty was ever a tidy housewife Have a care the wine is there at your right and the white bread beyond it Never fear Mother answered Hans reaching far back on an upper shelf I shall do no mischief Jumping down he walked toward his father and placed an oblong block of pine wood in his hands One of its ends was rounded off and some deep cuts had been made on the top Do you know what that is Father asked Hans Raff Brinker s face brightened Indeed I do boy It is the boat I was making you yest alack not yesterday but years ago I have kept it ever since Father It can be finished when your hand grows strong again Yes but not for you my lad I must wait for the grandchildren Why you are nearly a man Have you helped your mother through all these years Aye and bravely put in Dame Brinker Let me see muttered the father looking in a puzzled way at them all how long is it since the night when the waters were coming in Tis the last I remember We have told thee true Raff It was ten years last Pinxter week Ten years and I fell then you say Has the fever been on me ever since Dame Brinker scarcely knew how to reply Should she tell him all Tell him that he had been an idiot almost a lunatic The doctor had charged her on no account to worry or excite his patient Hans and Gretel looked astonished Like enough Raff she said nodding her head and raising her eyebrows When a heavy man like thee falls on his head it s hard to say what will come but thou rt well NOW Raff Thank the good Lord The newly awakened man bowed his head Aye well enough mine vrouw he said after a moment s silence but my brain turns somehow like a spinning wheel It will not be right till I get on the dikes again When shall I be at work think you Hear the man cried Dame Brinker delighted yet frightened too for that matter We must get him on the bed Hans Work indeed They tried to raise him from the chair but he was not ready yet Be off with ye he said with something like his old smile Gretel had never seen it before Does a man want to be lifted about like a log I tell you before three suns I shall be on the dikes again Ah There ll be some stout fellows to greet me Jan Kamphuisen and young Hoogsvliet They have been good friends to thee Hans I ll warrant Hans looked at his mother Young Hoogsvliet had been dead five years Jan Kamphuisen was in the jail at Amsterdam Aye they d have done their share no doubt said Dame Brinker parrying the inquiry had we asked them But what with working and studying Hans has been busy enough without seeking comrades Working and studying echoed Raff in a musing tone Can the youngsters read and cipher Meitje You should hear them she answered proudly They can run through a book while I mop the floor Hans there is as happy over a page of big words as a rabbit in a cabbage patch as for ciphering Here lad help a bit interrupted Raff Brinker I must get me on the bed again The Thousand Guilders None seeing the humble supper eaten in the Brinker cottage that night would have dreamed of the dainty repast hidden away nearby Hans and Gretel looked rather wistfully toward the cupboard as they drank their cupful of water and ate their scanty share of black bread but even in thought they did not rob their father He relished his supper well said Dame Brinker nodding sidewise toward the bed and fell asleep the next moment Ah the dear man will be feeble for many a day He wanted sore to sit up again but while I made show of humoring him and getting ready he dropped off Remember that my girl when you have a man of your own and many a day may it be before that comes to pass remember that you can never rule by differing humble wife is husband s boss Tut tut Never swallow such a mouthful as that again child Why I could make a meal off two such pieces What s in thee Hans One would think there were cobwebs on the walls Oh no Mother I was only thinking Thinking about what Ah no use asking she added in a changed tone I was thinking of the same a while ago Well it s no blame if we DID look to hear something by this time about the thousand guilders but not a word no it s plain enough he knows naught about them Hans looked up anxiously dreading lest his mother should grow agitated as usual when speaking of the lost money but she was silently nibbling her bread and looking with a doleful stare toward the window Thousand guilders echoed a faint voice from the bed Ah I am sure they have been of good use to you vrouw through the long years when your man was idle The poor woman started up These words quite destroyed the hope that of late had been glowing within her Are you awake Raff she faltered Yes Meitje and I feel much better Our money was well saved vrouw I was saying Did it last through all those ten years I I have not got it Raff I She was going to tell him the whole truth when Hans lifted his finger warningly and whispered Remember what the meester told us The father must not be worried Speak to him child she answered trembling Hans hurried to the bedside I am glad you are feeling better he said leaning over his father Another day will see you quite strong again Aye like enough How long did the money last Hans I could not hear your mother What did she say I said Raff stammered Dame Brinker in great distress that it was all gone Well well wife do not fret at that one thousand guilders is not so very much for ten years and with children to bring up but it has helped to make you all comfortable Have you had much sickness to bear No no sobbed Dame Brinker lifting her apron to her eyes Tut tut woman why do you cry said Raff kindly We will soon fill another pouch when I am on my feet again Lucky I told you all about it before I fell Told me what man Why that I buried the money In my dream just now it seemed that I had never said aught about it Dame Brinker started forward Hans caught her arm Hist Mother he whispered hastily leading her away we must be very careful Then while she stood with clasped hands waiting in breathless anxiety he once more approached the cot Trembling with eagerness he said That was a troublesome dream Do you remember WHEN you buried the money Father Yes my boy It was just before daylight on the same day I was hurt Jan Kamphuisen said something the sundown before that made me distrust his honesty He was the only one living besides Mother who knew that we had saved a thousand guilders so I rose up that night and buried the money blockhead that I was ever to suspect an old friend I ll be bound Father pursued Hans in a laughing voice motioning to his mother and Gretel to remain quiet that you ve forgotten where you buried it Ha ha Not I indeed But good night my son I can sleep again Hans would have walked away but his mother s gestures were not to be disobeyed So he said gently Good night Father Where did you say you buried the money I was only a little one then Close by the willow sapling behind the cottage said Raff Brinker drowsily Ah yes North side of the tree wasn t it Father No the south side Ah you know the spot well enough you rogue Like enough you were there when your mother lifted it Now son easy Shift this pillow so Good night Good night Father said Hans ready to dance for joy The moon rose very late that night shining in full and clear at the little window but its beams did not disturb Raff Brinker He slept soundly so did Gretel As for Hans and his mother they had something else to do After making a few hurried preparations they stole forth with bright expectant faces bearing a broken spade and a rusty implement that had done many a day s service when Raff was a hale worker on the dikes It was so light out of doors that they could see the willow tree distinctly The frozen ground was hard as stone but Hans and his mother were resolute Their only dread was that they might disturb the sleepers in the cottage This ysbreeker is just the thing Mother said Hans striking many a vigorous blow but the ground has set so firm it ll be a fair match for it Never fear Hans she answered watching him eagerly Here let me try awhile They soon succeeded in making an impression One opening and the rest was not so difficult Still they worked on taking turns and whispering cheerily to one another Now and then Dame Brinker stepped noiselessly over the threshold and listened to be certain that her husband slept What grand news it will be for him she said laughing when he is strong enough to bear it How I should like to put the pouch and the stocking just as we find them all full of money near him this blessed night for the dear man to see when he wakens We must get them first Mother panted Hans still tugging away at his work There s no doubt of that They can t slip away from us now she answered shivering with cold and excitement as she crouched beside the opening Like enough we ll find them stowed in the old earthen pot I lost long ago By this time Hans too began to tremble but not with cold He had penetrated a foot deep for quite a space on the south side of the tree At any moment they might come upon the treasure Meantime the stars winked and blinked at each other as if to say Queer country this Holland How much we do see to be sure Strange that the dear father should have put it down so woeful deep said Dame Brinker in rather a provoked tone Ah the ground was soft enough then I warrant How wise of him to mistrust Jan Kamphuisen and Jan in full credit at the time Little I thought that handsome fellow with his gay ways would ever go to jail Now Hans let me take a turn It s lighter work d ye see the deeper we go I d be loath to kill the tree Hans Will we harm it do you think I cannot say he answered gravely Hour after hour mother and son worked on The hole grew larger and deeper Clouds began to gather in the sky throwing elfish shadows as they passed Not until moon and stars faded away and streaks of daylight began to appear did Meitje Brinker and Hans look hopelessly into each other s faces They had searched the ground thoroughly desperately all round the tree south north east west THE HIDDEN MONEY WAS NOT THERE Glimpses Annie Bouman had a healthy distaste for Janzoon Kolp Janzoon Kolp in his own rough way adored Annie Annie declared that she could not to save her life say one civil word to that odious boy Janzoon believed her to be the sweetest sauciest creature in the world Annie laughed among her playmates at the comical flapping of Janzoon s tattered and dingy jacket he sighed in solitude over the floating grace of her jaunty blue petticoat She thanked her stars that her brothers were not like the Kolps and he growled at his sister because she was not like the Boumans His presence made her harsh and unfeeling and the very sight of her made him gentle as a lamb Of course they were thrown together very often It is thus that in some mysterious way we are convinced of error and cured of prejudice In this case however the scheme failed Annie detested Janzoon more and more at each encounter and Janzoon liked her better and better every day He killed a stork the wicked old wretch she would say to herself She knows I am strong and fearless thought Janzoon How red and freckled and ugly he is was Annie s secret comment when she looked at him How she stares and stares thought Janzoon Well I am a fine weather beaten fellow anyway Janzoon Kolp you impudent boy go right away from me Annie often said I don t want any of your company Ha Ha laughed Janzoon to himself Girls never say what they mean I ll skate with her every chance I can get And so it came to pass that the pretty maid would not look up that morning when skating homeward from Amsterdam she became convinced that a great burly boy was coming down the canal toward her Humph if I look at him thought Annie I ll Good morrow Annie Bouman said a pleasant voice How a smile brightens a girl s face Good morrow Master Hans I am right glad to meet you How a smile brightens a boy s face Good morrow again Annie There has been a great change at our house since you left How so she exclaimed opening her eyes very wide Hans who had been in a great hurry and rather moody grew talkative and quite at leisure in Annie s sunshine Turning about and skating slowly with her toward Broek he told the good news of his father Annie was so true a friend that he told her even of their present distress of how money was needed and how everything depended upon his obtaining work and he could find nothing to do in the neighborhood All this was not said as a complaint but just because she was looking at him and really wished to know He could not speak of last night s bitter disappointment for that secret was not wholly his own Good bye Annie he said at last The morning is going fast and I must haste to Amsterdam and sell these skates Mother must have money at once Before nightfall I shall certainly find a job somewhere Sell your new skates Hans cried Annie You the best skater around Broek Why the race is coming off in five days I know it he answered resolutely Good bye I shall skate home again on the old wooden ones Such a bright glance So different from Janzoon s ugly grin and Hans was off like an arrow Hans come back she called Her voice changed the arrow into a top Spinning around he darted in one long leaning sweep toward her Then you really are going to sell your new skates if you can find a customer Well Hans if you ARE going to sell your skates said Annie quite confused I mean if you well I know somebody who would like to buy them that s all Not Janzoon Kolp asked Hans flushing Oh no she said pouting he is not one of my friends But you KNOW him persisted Hans Annie laughed Yes I know him and it s all the worse for him that I do Now please Hans don t ever talk any more to me about Janzoon I hate him Hate him YOU hate anybody Annie She shook her head saucily Yes and I ll hate you too if you persist in calling him one of my friends You boys may like him because he caught the greased goose at the kermis last summer and climbed the pole with his great ugly body tied up in a sack but I don t care for such things I ve disliked him ever since I saw him try to push his little sister out of the merry go round at Amsterdam and it s no secret up OUR way who killed the stork on your mother s roof But we mustn t talk about such a bad wicked fellow Really Hans I know somebody who would be glad to buy your skates You won t get half a price for them in Amsterdam Please give them to me I ll take you the money this very afternoon If Annie was charming even when she said HATE there was no withstanding her when she said PLEASE at least Hans found it to be so Annie he said taking off the skates and rubbing them carefully with a snarl of twine before handing them to her I am sorry to be so particular but if your friend should not want them will you bring them back to me today I must buy peat and meal for the mother early tomorrow morning My friend WILL want them Annie laughed nodding gaily and skated off at the top of her speed As Hans drew forth the wooden runners from his capricious pockets and fastened them on as best he could he did not hear Annie murmur I wish I had not been so rude Poor brave Hans What a noble boy he is And as Annie skated homeward filled with pleasant thoughts she did not hear Hans say I grumbled like a bear But bless her Some girls are like angels Perhaps it was all for the best One cannot be expected to know everything that is going on around the world Looking For Work Luxuries unfit us for returning to hardships easily endured before The wooden runners squeaked more than ever It was as much as Hans could do to get on with the clumsy old things still he did not regret that he had parted with his beautiful skates but resolutely pushed back the boyish trouble that he had not been able to keep them just a little longer at least until after the race Mother surely will not be angry with me he thought for selling them without her leave She has had care enough already It will be full time to speak of it when I take home the money Hans went up and down the streets of Amsterdam that day looking for work He succeeded in earning a few stivers by assisting a man who was driving a train of loaded mules into the city but he could not secure steady employment anywhere He would have been glad to obtain a situation as porter or errand boy but though he passed on his way many a loitering shuffling urchin laden with bundles there was no place for him Some shopkeepers had just supplied themselves others needed a trimmer more lightly built fellow they meant better dressed but did not choose to say so others told him to call again in a month or two when the canals would probably be broken up and many shook their heads at him without saying a word At the factories he met with no better luck It seemed to him that in those great buildings turning out respectively such tremendous quantities of woolen cotton and linen stuffs such world renowned dyes and paints such precious diamonds cut from the rough such supplies of meal of bricks of glass and china that in at least one of these a strong armed boy able and eager to work could find something to do But no nearly the same answer met him everywhere No need of more hands just now If he had called before Saint Nicholas s Day they might have given him a job as they were hurried then but at present they had more boys than they needed Hans wished they could see just for a moment his mother and Gretel He did not know how the anxiety of both looked out from his eyes and how more than once the gruffest denials were uttered with an uncomfortable consciousness that the lad ought not be turned away Certain fathers when they went home that night spoke more kindly than usual to their youngsters from memory of a frank young face saddened at their words and before morning one man actually resolved that he would instruct his head man Blankert to set the boy from Broek at something if he should come in again But Hans knew nothing of all this Toward sundown he started on his return to Broek uncertain whether the strange choking sensation in his throat arose from discouragement or resolution There was certainly one more chance Mynheer van Holp might have returned by this time Master Peter it was reported had gone to Haarlem the night before to attend to something connected with the great skating race Still Hans would go and try Fortunately Peter had returned early that morning He was at home when Hans reached there and was just about starting for the Brinker cottage Ah Hans he cried as the weary boy approached the door You are the very one I wished to see You are the very one I wished to see Come in and warm yourself After tugging at his well worn hat which always WOULD stick to his head when he was embarrassed Hans knelt down not by way of making a new style of oriental salute nor to worship the goddess of cleanliness who presided there but because his heavy shoes would have filled the soul of a Broek housewife with horror When their owner stepped softly into the house they were left outside to act as sentinels until his return Hans left the Van Holp mansion with a lightened heart Peter had brought word from Haarlem that young Brinker was to commence working upon the summer house doors immediately There was a comfortable workshop on the place and it was to be at his service until the carving was done Peter did not tell him that he had skated all the way to Haarlem for the purpose of arranging this plan with Mynheer van Holp It was enough for him to see the glad eager look rise on young Brinker s face I THINK I can do it said Hans though I have never learned the trade I am SURE you can responded Peter heartily You will find every tool you require in the workshop It is nearly hidden yonder by that wall of twigs In summer when the hedge is green one cannot see the shop from here at all How is your father today Better mynheer He improves every hour It is the most astonishing thing I ever heard of That gruff old doctor is a great fellow after all Ah mynheer said Hans warmly he is more than great He is good But for the meester s kind heart and great skill my poor father would yet be in the dark I think mynheer he added with kindling eyes surgery is the very noblest science in the world Peter shrugged his shoulders Very noble it may be but not quite to my taste This doctor Boekman certainly has skill As for his heart defend me from such hearts as his Why do you say so mynheer asked Hans Just then a lady slowly entered from an adjoining apartment It was Mevrouw van Holp arrayed in the grandest of caps and the longest of satin aprons ruffled with lace She nodded placidly as Hans stepped back from the fire bowing as well as he knew how Peter at once drew a high backed oaken chair toward the fire and the lady seated herself There was a block of cork on each side of the chimney place One of these he placed under his mother s feet Hans turned to go Wait a moment if you please young man said the lady I accidentally overheard you and my son speaking I think of my friend doctor Boekman You are right young man doctor Boekman has a very kind heart You perceive Peter that we may be quite mistaken in judging a person solely by his manners though a courteous deportment is by no means to be despised I intended no disrespect mother said Peter but surely one has no right to go growling and snarling through the world as they say he does They say Ah Peter they means everybody or nobody Surgeon Boekman has had a great sorrow Many years ago he lost his only child under very painful circumstances A fine lad except that he was a thought too hasty and high spirited Before then Gerard Boekman was one of the most agreeable gentlemen I ever knew So saying Mevrouw van Holp looking kindly upon the two boys rose and left the room with the same dignity with which she had entered Peter only half convinced muttered something about the sin of allowing sorrow to turn all one s honey into gall as he conducted his visitor to the narrow side door Before they parted he advised Hans to keep himself in good skating order for he added now that your father is all right you will be in fine spirits for the race That will be the prettiest skating show ever seen in this part of the world Everybody is talking of it you are to try for the prize remember I shall not be in the race mynheer said Hans looking down Not in the race Why not indeed And immediately Peter s thoughts swept on a full tide of suspicion toward Carl Schummel Because I cannot mynheer answered Hans as he bent to slip his feet into his big shoes Something in the boy s manner warned Peter that it would be no kindness to press the matter further He bade Hans good bye and stood thoughtfully watching him as he walked away In a minute Peter called out Hans Brinker Yes mynheer I ll take back all I said about doctor Boekman Yes mynheer Both were laughing But Peter s smile changed to a look of puzzled surprise when he saw Hans kneel down by the canal and put on the wooden skates Very queer muttered Peter shaking his head as he turned to go into the house Why in the world doesn t the boy wear his new ones The Fairy Godmother The sun had gone down quite out of sight when our hero with a happy heart but with something like a sneer on his countenance as he jerked off the wooden runners trudged hopefully toward the tiny hutlike building known of old as the idiot s cottage Duller eyes than his would have discerned two slight figures moving near the doorway That gray well patched jacket and the dull blue skirt covered with an apron of still duller blue that faded close fitting cap and those quick little feet in their great boatlike shoes they were Gretel s of course He would have known them anywhere That bright coquettish red jacket with its pretty skirt bordered with black that graceful cap bobbing over the gold earrings that dainty apron and those snug leather shoes that seemed to have grown with the feet why if the Pope of Rome had sent them to him by express Hans could have sworn they were Annie s The two girls were slowly pacing up and down in front of the cottage Their arms were entwined of course and their heads were nodding and shaking as emphatically as if all the affairs of the kingdom were under discussion With a joyous shout Hans hastened toward them Huzza girls I ve found work This brought his mother to the cottage door She too had pleasant tidings The father was still improving He had been sitting up nearly all day and was now sleeping as Dame Brinker declared Just as quiet as a lamb It is my turn now Hans said Annie drawing him aside after he had told his mother the good word from Mynheer van Holp Your skates are sold and here s the money Seven guilders cried Hans counting the pieces in astonishment Why that is three times as much as I paid for them I cannot help that said Annie If the buyer knew no better that is not our fault Hans looked up quickly Oh Annie Oh Hans she mimicked pursing her lips and trying to look desperately wicked and unprincipled Now Annie I know you would never mean that You must return some of this money But I ll not do any such thing insisted Annie They re sold and that s an end of it Then seeing that he looked really pained she added in a lower tone Will you believe me Hans when I say that there has been no mistake that the person who bought your skates INSISTED upon paying seven guilders for them I will he answered and the light from his clear blue eyes seemed to settle and sparkle under Annie s lashes Dame Brinker was delighted at the sight of so much silver but when she learned that Hans had parted with his treasures to obtain it she sighed and then exclaimed Bless thee child That will be a sore loss for thee Here Mother said the boy plunging his hands far into his pocket here is more we shall be rich if we keep on Aye indeed she answered eagerly reaching forth her hand Then lowering her voice added We SHOULD be rich but for that Jan Kamphuisen He was at the willow tree years ago Hans Depend upon it Indeed it seems likely sighed Hans Well Mother we must give up the money bravely It is certainly gone The father has told us all he knows Let us think no more about it That s easy saying Hans I shall try but it s hard and my poor man wanting so many comforts Bless me How girls fly about They were here but this instant Where did they run to They slipped behind the cottage said Hans like enough to hide from us Hist I ll catch them for you They both can move quicker and softer than yonder rabbit but I ll give them a good start first Why there IS a rabbit sure enough Hold Hans the poor thing must have been in sore need to venture from its burrow in this bitter weather I ll get a few crumbs for it within So saying the good woman bustled into the cottage She soon came out again but Hans had forgotten to wait and the rabbit after taking a cool survey of the premises had scampered off to unknown quarters Turning the corner of the cottage Dame Brinker came upon the children Hans and Gretel were standing before Annie who was seated carelessly upon a stump That is as good as a picture cried Dame Brinker halting in admiration of the group Many a painting have I seen at the grand house at Heidelberg not a whit prettier My two are rough chubs Annie but YOU look like a fairy Do I laughed Annie sparkling with animation Well then Gretel and Hans imagine I m your godmother just paying you a visit Now I ll grant you each a wish What will you have Master Hans A shade of earnestness passed over Annie s face as she looked up at him perhaps it was because she wished from the depths of her heart that for once she could have a fairy s power Something whispered to Hans that for a moment she was more than mortal I wish said he solemnly that I could find something I was searching for last night Gretel laughed merrily Dame Brinker moaned Shame on you Hans And she went wearily into the cottage The fairy godmother sprang up and stamped her foot three times Thou shalt have thy wish said she Let them say what they will Then with playful solemnity she put her hand in her apron pocket and drew forth a large glass bead Bury this said she giving it to Hans where I have stamped and ere moonrise thy wish shall be granted Gretel laughed more merrily than ever The godmother pretended great displeasure Naughty child said she scowling terribly In punishment for laughing at a fairy THY wish shall not be granted Ha cried Gretel in high glee better wait till you re asked godmother I haven t made any wish Annie acted her part well Never smiling through all their merry laughter she stalked away the embodiment of offended dignity Good night fairy they cried again and again Good night mortals she called out at last as she sprang over a frozen ditch and ran quickly homeward Oh isn t she just like flowers so sweet and lovely cried Gretel looking after her in great admiration And to think how many days she stays in that dark room with her grandmother Why brother Hans What is the matter What are you going to do Wait and see answered Hans as he plunged into the cottage and came out again all in an instant bearing the spade and ysbreeker in his hands I m going to bury my magic bead Raff Brinker still slept soundly His wife took a small block of peat from her nearly exhausted store and put it upon the embers Then opening the door she called gently Come in children Mother Mother See here shouted Hans Holy Saint Bavon exclaimed the dame springing over the doorstep What ails the boy Come quick Mother he cried in great excitement working with all his might and driving in the ysbreeker at each word Don t you see THIS is the spot right here on the south side of the stump Why didn t we think of it last night THE STUMP is the old willow tree the one you cut down last spring because it shaded the potatoes That little tree wasn t here when Father Huzza Dame Brinker could not speak She dropped on her knees beside Hans just in time to see him drag forth THE OLD STONE POT He thrust in his hand and took out a piece of brick then another then another then the stocking and the pouch black and moldy but filled with the long lost treasure Such a time Such laughing Such crying Such counting after they went into the cottage It was a wonder that Raff did not waken His dreams were pleasant however for he smiled in his sleep Dame Brinker and her children had a fine supper I can assure you No need of saving the delicacies now We ll get Father some nice fresh things tomorrow Dame Brinker said as she brought forth cold meat wine bread and jelly and placed them on the clean pine table Sit by children sit by That night Annie fell asleep wondering whether it was a knife Hans had lost and thinking how funny it would be if he should find it after all Hans had scarcely closed his eyes before he found himself trudging along a thicket pots of gold were lying all around and watches and skates and glittering beads were swinging from every branch Strange to say each tree as he approached it changed into a stump and on the stump sat the prettiest fairy imaginable clad in a scarlet jacket and a blue petticoat The Mysterious Watch Something else than the missing guilders was brought to light on the day of the fairy godmother s visit This was the story of the watch that for ten long years had been so jealously guarded by Raff s faithful vrouw Through many an hour of sore temptation she had dreaded almost to look upon it lest she might be tempted to disobey her husband s request It had been hard to see her children hungry and to know that the watch if sold would enable the roses to bloom in their cheeks again But nay she would exclaim Meitje Brinker is not one to forget her man s last bidding come what may Take good care of this mine vrouw he had said as he handed it to her that was all No explanation followed for the words were scarcely spoken when one of his fellow workmen rushed into the cottage crying Come man The waters are rising You re wanted on the dikes Raff had started at once and that was the last Dame Brinker saw of him in his right mind On the day when Hans was in Amsterdam looking for work and Gretel after performing her household labors was wandering in search of chips twigs anything that could be burned Dame Brinker with suppressed excitement had laid the watch in her husband s hand It wasn t in reason as she afterward said to Hans to wait any longer when a word from the father would settle all No woman living but would want to know how he came by that watch Raff Brinker turned the bright polished thing over and over in his hand then he examined the bit of smoothly ironed black ribbon fastened to it He seemed hardly to recognize it At last he said Ah I remember this Why you ve been rubbing it vrouw till it shines like a new guilder Aye said Dame Brinker nodding her head complacently Raff looked at it again Poor boy he murmured then fell into a brown study This was too much for the dame Poor boy she echoed somewhat tartly What do you think I m standing here for Raff Brinker and my spinning awaiting if not to hear more than that I told ye all long since said Raff positively as he looked up in surprise Indeed and you never did retorted the vrouw Well if not since it s no affair of ours we ll say no more about it said Raff shaking his head sadly Like enough while I ve been dead on the earth all this time the poor boy s died and been in heaven He looked near enough to it poor lad Raff Brinker If you re going to treat me this way and I nursing you and bearing with you since I was twenty two years old it s a shame Aye and a disgrace cried the vrouw growing quite red and scant of breath Raff s voice was feeble yet Treat you WHAT way Meitje What way said Dame Brinker mimicking his voice and manner What way Why just as every woman in the world is treated after she s stood by a man through the worst like a Meitje Raff was leaning forward with outstretched arms His eyes were full of tears In an instant Dame Brinker was at his feet clasping his hands in hers Oh what have I done Made my good man cry and he not back with me four days Look up Raff Nay Raff my own boy I m sorry I hurt thee It s hard not to be told about the watch after waiting ten years to know but I ll ask thee no more Raff Here we ll put the thing away that s made the first trouble between us after God just gave thee back to me I was a fool to cry Meitje he said kissing her and it s no more than right that ye should know the truth But it seemed as if it might be telling the secrets of the dead to talk about the matter Is the man the lad thou wert talking of dead think thee asked the vrouw hiding the watch in her hand but seating herself expectantly on the end of his long foot bench It s hard telling he answered Was he so sick Raff No not sick I may say but troubled vrouw very troubled Had he done wrong think ye she asked lowering her voice Raff nodded MURDER whispered the wife not daring to look up He said it was like to that indeed Oh Raff you frighten me Tell me more you speak so strange and you tremble I must know all If I tremble mine vrouw it must be from the fever There is no guilt on my soul thank God Take a sip of this wine Raff There now you are better It was like to a crime you were saying Aye Meitje like to murder THAT he told me himself But I ll never believe it A likely lad fresh and honest looking as our own youngster but with something not so bold and straight about him Aye I know said the dame gently fearing to interrupt the story He came upon me quite suddenly continued Raff I had never seen his face before the palest frightenedest face that ever was He caught me by the arm You look like an honest man says he Aye he was right in that interrupted the dame emphatically Raff looked somewhat bewildered Where was I mine vrouw The lad took hold of your arm Raff she said gazing at him anxiously Aye so The words come awkward to me and everything is like a dream ye see S stut What wonder poor man She sighed stroking his hand If ye had not had enough for a dozen the wit would never have come to ye again Well the lad caught me by the arm and said ye looked honest Well he might What then Was it noontime Nay before daylight long before early chimes It was the same day you were hurt said the dame I know it seemed that you went to your work in the middle of the night You left off where he caught your arm Raff Yes resumed her husband and I can see his face this minute so white and wild looking Take me down this river a way says he I was working then you ll remember far down on the line across from Amsterdam I told him I was no boatman It s an affair of life and death says he Take me on a few miles Yonder skiff is not locked but it may be a poor man s boat and I d be loath to rob him The words might differ some vrouw for it s all like a dream Well I took him down it might be six or eight miles and then he said he could run the rest of the way on shore I was in haste to get the boat back Before he jumped out he says sobbing like I can trust you I ve done a thing God knows I never intended it but the man is dead I must fly from Holland What was it Did he say Raff Had he been shooting at a comrade as they do down at the University at Gottingen I can t recall that Mayhap he told me but it s all like a dream I said it wasn t for me a good Hollander to cheat the laws of my country by helping him off that way but he kept saying God knows I am innocent And he looked at me in the starlight as fair now and clear eyed as our little Hans might and I just pulled away faster It must have been Jan Kamphuisen s boat remarked Dame Brinker dryly None other would have left his oars out that careless Aye it was Jan s boat sure enough The man will be coming in to see me Sunday likely if he s heard and young Hoogsvliet too Where was I Where were you Why not very far forsooth the lad hadn t yet given ye the watch alack I misgive whether he came by it honestly Why vrouw exclaimed Raff Brinker in an injured tone He was dressed soft and fine as the prince himself The watch was his own clear enough How came he to give it up asked the dame looking uneasily at the fire for it needed another block of peat I told ye just now he answered with a puzzled air Tell me again said Dame Brinker wisely warding off another digression Well just before jumping from the boat he says handing me the watch I m flying from my country as I never thought I could I ll trust you because you look honest Will you take this to my father not today but in a week and tell him his unhappy boy sent it and tell him if ever the time comes that he wants me to come back to him I ll brave everything and come Tell him to send a letter to to there the rest is all gone from me I CAN T remember where the letter was to go Poor lad poor lad resumed Raff sorrowfully taking the watch from his vrouw s lap as he spoke And it s never been sent to his father to this day I ll take it Raff never fear the moment Gretel gets back She will be in soon What was the father s name did you say Where were you to find him Alack answered Raff speaking very slowly It s all slipped me I can see the lad s face and his great eyes just as plain and I remember his opening the watch and snatching something from it and kissing it but no more All the rest whirls past me there s a sound like rushing waters comes over me when I try to think Aye That s plain to see Raff but I ve had the same feeling after a fever You re tired now I must get ye straight on the bed again Where IS the child I wonder Dame Brinker opened the door and called Gretel Gretel Stand aside vrouw said Raff feebly as he leaned forward and endeavored to look out upon the bare landscape I ve half a mind to stand beyond the door just once Nay nay She laughed I ll tell the meester how ye tease and fidget and bother to be let out in the air and if he says it I ll bundle ye warm tomorrow and give ye a turn on your feet But I m freezing you with this door open I declare if there isn t Gretel with her apron full skating on the canal like wild Why man she continued almost in a scream as she slammed the door thou rt walking to the bed without my touching thee Thou lieutenant fall The dame s thee proved her mingled fear and delight even more than the rush which she made toward her husband Soon he was comfortably settled under the new cover declaring as his vrouw tucked him in snug and warm that it was the last daylight that should see him abed Aye I can hope it myself laughed Dame Brinker now you have been frisking about at that rate As Raff closed his eyes the dame hastened to revive her fire or rather to dull it for Dutch peat is like a Dutchman slow to kindle but very good at a blaze once started Then putting her neglected spinning wheel away she drew forth her knitting from some invisible pocket and seated herself by the bedside If you could remember the man s name Raff she began cautiously I might take the watch to him while you re sleeping Gretel can t but be in soon Raff tried to think but in vain Could it be Boomphoffen suggested the dame I ve heard how they ve had two sons turn out bad Gerard and Lambert It might be said Raff Look if there s letters on the watch that ll guide us some Bless thee man cried the happy dame eagerly lifting the watch Why thou rt sharper than ever Sure enough Here s letters L J B That s Lambert Boomphoffen you may depend What the J is for I can t say but they used to be grand kind o people high feathered as fancy fowl Just the kind to give their children all double names which isn t Scripture anyway I don t know about that vrouw Seems to me there s long mixed names in the holy Book hard enough to make out But you ve got the right guess at a jump It was your way always said Raff closing his eyes Take the watch to Boompkinks and try Not Boompkinks I know no such name it s Boomphoffen Aye take it there Take it there man Why the whole brood of them s been gone to America these four years But go to sleep Raff you look pale and out of strength It ll al come to you what s best to do in the morning So Mistress Gretel Here you are at last Before Raff awoke that evening the fairy godmother as we know had been in the cottage the guilders were once more safely locked in the big chest and Dame Brinker and the children were faring sumptuously on meat and white bread and wine So the mother in the joy of her heart told them the story of the watch as far as she deemed it prudent to divulge it It was no more than fair she thought that the poor things should know after keeping the secret so safe ever since they had been old enough to know anything A Discovery The next sun brought a busy day to the Brinkers In the first place the news of the thousand guilders had of course to be told to the father Such tidings as that surely could not harm him Then while Gretel was diligently obeying her mother s injunction to clean the place fresh as a new brewing Hans and the dame sallied forth to revel in the purchasing of peat and provisions Hans was careless and contented the dame was filled with delightful anxieties caused by the unreasonable demands of ten thousand guilders worth of new wants that had sprung up like mushrooms in a single night The happy woman talked so largely to Hans on their way to Amsterdam and brought back such little bundles after all that he scratched his bewildered head as he leaned against the chimney piece wondering whether Bigger the pouch tighter the string was in Jacob Cats and therefore true or whether he had dreamed it when he lay in a fever What thinking on Big eyes chirruped his mother half reading his thoughts as she bustled about preparing the dinner What thinking on Why Raff would ye believe it the child thought to carry half Amsterdam back on his head Bless us He would have bought us as much coffee as would have filled this fire pot No no my lad says I No time for leaks when the ship is rich laden And then how he stared aye just as he stares this minute Hoot lad fly around a mite Ye ll grow to the chimney place with your staring and wondering Now Raff here s your chair at the head of the table where it should be for there s a man to the house now I d say it to the king s face Aye that s the way lean on Hans There s a strong staff for you Growing like a weed too and it seems only yesterday since he was toddling Sit by my man sit by Can you call to mind vrouw said Raff settling himself cautiously in the big chair the wonderful music box that cheered your working in the big house at Heidelberg Aye that I can answered the dame Three turns of a brass key and the witchy thing would send the music fairly running up and down one s back I remember it well But Raff growing solemn in an instant you would never throw our guilders away for a thing like that No no not I vrouw for the good Lord has already given me a music box without pay All three cast quick frightened glances at one another and at Raff Were his wits on the wing again Aye and a music box that fifty pouchful would not buy from me insisted Raff And it s set going by the turn of a mop handle and it slips and glides around the room everywhere in a flash carrying the music about till you d swear the birds were back again Holy Saint Bavon screeched the dame What s in the man Comfort and joy vrouw that s what s in him Ask Gretel ask my little music box Gretel if your man has lacked comfort and joy this day Not he Mother laughed Gretel He s been MY music box too We sang together half the time you were gone Aye so said the dame greatly relieved Now Hans you ll never get through with a piece like that but never mind chick thou saint had a long fasting Here Gretel take another slice of the sausage It ll put blood in your cheeks Oh Oh Mother laughed Gretel eagerly holding forth her platter Blood doesn t grow in girls cheeks you mean roses Isn t it roses Hans While Hans was hastily swallowing a mammoth mouthful in order to give a suitable reply to this poetic appeal Dame Brinker settled the matter with a quick Well roses or blood it s all one to me so the red finds its way on your sunny face It s enough for mother to get pale and weary looking without Hoot vrouw spoke up Raff hastily thou rt fresher and rosier this minute than both our chicks put together This remark though not bearing very strong testimony to the clearness of Raff s newly awakened intellect nevertheless afforded the dame immense satisfaction The meal accordingly went on in the most delightful manner After dinner the affair of the watch was talked over and the mysterious initials duly discussed Hans had just pushed back his stool intending to start at once for Mynheer van Holp s and his mother had risen to put the watch away in its old hiding place when they heard the sound of wheels upon the frozen ground Someone knocked at the door opening it at the same time Come in stammered Dame Brinker hastily trying to hide the watch in her bosom Oh is it you mynheer Good day The father is nearly well as you see It s a poor place to greet you in mynheer and the dinner not cleared away doctor Boekman scarcely noticed the dame s apology He was evidently in haste Ahem he exclaimed Not needed here I perceive The patient is mending fast Well he may mynheer cried the dame for only last night we found a thousand guilders that s been lost to us these ten years doctor Boekman opened his eyes Yes mynheer said Raff I bid the vrouw tell you though it s to be held a secret among us for I see you can keep your lips closed as well as any man The doctor scowled He never liked personal remarks Now mynheer continued Raff you can take your rightful pay God knows you have earned it if bringing such a poor tool back to the world and his family can be called a service Tell the vrouw what s to pay mynheer She will hand out the sum right willingly Tut tut said the doctor kindly Say nothing about money I can find plenty of such pay any time but gratitude comes seldom That boy s thank you he added nodding sidewise toward Hans was pay enough for me Like enough ye have a boy of your own said Dame Brinker quite delighted to see the great man becoming so sociable doctor Boekman s good nature vanished at once He gave a growl at least it seemed so to Gretel but made no actual reply Do not think the vrouw meddlesome mynheer said Raff She has been sore touched of late about a lad whose folks have gone away none knows where and I had a message for them from the young gentleman The name was Boomphoffen said the dame eagerly Do you know aught of the family mynheer The doctor s reply was brief and gruff Yes A troublesome set They went long since to America It might be Raff persisted Dame Brinker timidly that the meester knows somebody in that country though I m told they are mostly savages over there If he could get the watch to the Boomphoffens with the poor lad s message it would be a most blessed thing Tut vrouw why pester the good meester and dying men and women wanting him everywhere How do ye know ye have the true name I m sure of it she replied They had a son Lambert and there s an L for Lambert and a B for Boomphoffen on the back though to be sure there s an odd J too but the meester can look for himself So saying she drew forth the watch L J B cried doctor Boekman springing toward her Why attempt to describe the scene that followed I need only say that the lad s message was delivered to his father at last delivered while the great surgeon was sobbing like a little child Laurens My Laurens he cried gazing with yearning eyes at the watch as he held it tenderly in his palm Ah if I had but known sooner Laurens a homeless wanderer great heaven He may be suffering dying at this moment Think man where is he Where did my boy say that the letter must be sent Raff shook his head sadly Think implored the doctor Surely the memory so lately awakened through his aid could not refuse to serve him in a moment like this It is all gone mynheer sighed Raff Hans forgetting distinctions of rank and station forgetting everything but that his good friend was in trouble threw his arms around the doctor s neck I can find your son mynheer If alive he is SOMEWHERE The earth is not so very large I will devote every day of my life to the search Mother can spare me now You are rich mynheer Send me where you will Gretel began to cry It was right for Hans to go but how could they ever live without him doctor Boekman made no reply neither did he push Hans away His eyes were fixed anxiously upon Raff Brinker Suddenly he lifted the watch and with trembling eagerness attempted to open it Its stiffened spring yielded at last the case flew open disclosing a watch paper in the back bearing a group of blue forget me nots Raff seeing a shade of intense disappointment pass over the doctor s face hastened to say There was something else in it mynheer but the young gentleman tore it out before he handed it to me I saw him kiss it as he put it away It was his mother s picture moaned the doctor She died when he was ten years old Thank God The boy had not forgotten Both dead It is impossible he cried starting up My boy is alive You shall hear his story Laurens acted as my assistant By mistake he portioned out the wrong medicine for one of my patients a deadly poison but it was never administered for I discovered the error in time The man died that day I was detained with other bad cases until the next evening When I reached home my boy was gone Poor Laurens sobbed the doctor breaking down completely Never to hear from me through all these years His message disregarded Oh what he must have suffered Dame Brinker ventured to speak Anything was better than to see the meester cry It is a mercy to know the young gentleman was innocent Ah how he fretted Telling you Raff that his crime was like unto murder It was sending the wrong physic that he meant Crime indeed Why our own Gretel might have done that Like enough the poor young gentleman heard that the man was dead that s why he ran mynheer He said you know Raff that he never could come back to Holland again unless she hesitated ah your honor ten years is a dreary time to be waiting to hear from Hist vrouw said Raff sharply Waiting to hear the doctor groaned and I like a fool sitting stubbornly at home thinking that he had abandoned me I never dreamed Brinker that the boy had discovered the mistake I believed it was youthful folly ingratitude love of adventure that sent him away My poor poor Laurens But you know all now mynheer whispered Hans You know he was innocent of wrong that he loved you and his dead mother We will find him You shall see him again dear meester God bless you said doctor Boekman seizing the boy s hand It may be as you say I shall try I shall try and Brinker if ever the faintest gleam of recollection concerning him should come to you you will send me word at once Indeed we will cried all but Hans whose silent promise would have satisfied the doctor even had the others not spoken Your boy s eyes he said turning to Dame Brinker are strangely like my son s The first time I met him it seemed that Laurens himself was looking at me Aye mynheer replied the mother proudly I have marked that you were much drawn to the child For a few moments the meester seemed lost in thought then arousing himself he spoke in a new voice Forgive me Raff Brinker for this tumult Do not feel distressed on my account I leave your house today a happier man than I have been for many a long year Shall I take the watch Certainly you must mynheer It was your son s wish Even so responded the doctor regarding his treasure with a queer frown for his face could not throw off its bad habits in an hour even so And now I must be gone No medicine is needed by my patient only peace and cheerfulness and both are here in plenty Heaven bless you my good friends I shall ever be grateful to you May Heaven bless you too mynheer and may you soon find the young gentleman said Dame Brinker earnestly after hurriedly wiping her eyes upon the corner of her apron Raff uttered a hearty Amen and Gretel threw such a wistful eager glance at the doctor that he patted her head as he turned to leave the cottage Hans went out also When I can serve you mynheer I am ready Very well boy replied doctor Boekman with peculiar mildness Tell them within to say nothing of what has just happened Meantime Hans when you are with his father watch his mood You have tact At any moment he may suddenly be able to tell us more Trust me for that mynheer Good day my boy cried the doctor as he sprang into his stately coach Aha thought Hans as it rolled away the meester has more life in him than I thought The Race The twentieth of December came at last bringing with it the perfection of winter weather All over the level landscape lay the warm sunlight It tried its power on lake canal and river but the ice flashed defiance and showed no sign of melting The very weathercocks stood still to enjoy the sight This gave the windmills a holiday Nearly all the past week they had been whirling briskly now being rather out of breath they rocked lazily in the clear still air Catch a windmill working when the weathercocks have nothing to do There was an end to grinding crushing and sawing for that day It was a good thing for the millers near Broek Long before noon they concluded to take in their sails and go to the race Everybody would be there already the north side of the frozen Y was bordered with eager spectators The news of the great skating match had traveled far and wide Men women and children in holiday attire were flocking toward the spot Some wore furs and wintry cloaks or shawls but many consulting their feelings rather than the almanac were dressed as for an October day The site selected for the race was a faultless plain of ice near Amsterdam on that great arm of the Zuider Zee which Dutchmen of course must call the Eye The townspeople turned out in large numbers Strangers to the city deemed it a fine chance to see what was to be seen Many a peasant from the northward had wisely chosen the twentieth as the day for the next city trading It seemed that everybody young and old who had wheels skates or feet at command had hastened to the scene There were the gentry in their coaches dressed like Parisians fresh from the boulevards Amsterdam children in charity uniforms girls from the Roman Catholic Orphan House in sable gowns and white headbands boys from the Burgher Asylum with their black tights and short skirted harlequin coats There were old fashioned gentlemen in cocked hats and velvet knee breeches old fashioned ladies too in stiff quilted skirts and bodices of dazzling brocade These were accompanied by servants bearing foot stoves and cloaks There were the peasant folk arrayed in every possible Dutch costume shy young rustics in brazen buckles simple village maidens concealing their flaxen hair under fillets of gold women whose long narrow aprons were stiff with embroidery women with short corkscrew curls hanging over their foreheads women with shaved heads and close fitting caps and women in striped skirts and windmill bonnets Men in leather in homespun in velvet and in broadcloth burghers in model European attire and burghers in short jackets wide trousers and steeple crowned hats There were beautiful Friesland girls in wooden shoes and coarse petticoats with solid gold crescents encircling their heads finished at each temple with a golden rosette and hung with lace a century old Some wore necklaces pendants and earrings of the purest gold Many were content with gilt or even with brass but it is not an uncommon thing for a Friesland woman to have all the family treasure in her headgear More than one rustic lass displayed the value of two thousand guilders upon her head that day Scattered throughout the crowd were peasants from the Island or Marken with sabots black stockings and the widest of breeches also women from Marken with short blue petticoats and black jackets gaily figured in front They wore red sleeves white aprons and a cap like a bishop s miter over their golden hair The children often were as quaint and odd looking as their elders In short one third of the crowd seemed to have stepped bodily from a collection of Dutch paintings Everywhere could be seen tall women and stumpy men lively faced girls and youths whose expression never changed from sunrise to sunset There seemed to be at least one specimen from every known town in Holland There were Utrecht water bearers Gouda cheesemakers Delft pottery men Schiedam distillers Amsterdam diamond cutters Rotterdam merchants dried up herring packers and two sleepy eyes shepherds from Texel Every man of them had his pipe and tobacco pouch Some carried what might be called the smoker s complete outfit a pipe tobacco a pricker with which to clean the tube a silver net for protecting the bowl and a box of the strongest brimstone matches A true Dutchman you must remember is rarely without his pipe on any possible occasion He may for a moment neglect to breathe but when the pipe is forgotten he must be dying indeed There were no such sad cases here Wreaths of smoke were rising from every possible quarter The more fantastic the smoke wreath the more placid and solemn the smoker Look at those boys and girls on stilts That is a good idea They can see over the heads of the tallest It is strange to see those little bodies high in the air carried about on mysterious legs They have such a resolute look on their round faces what wonder that nervous old gentlemen with tender feet wince and tremble while the long legged little monsters stride past them You will read in certain books that the Dutch are a quiet people so they are generally But listen Did you ever hear such a din All made up of human voices no the horses are helping somewhat and the fiddles are squeaking pitifully how it must pain fiddles to be tuned but the mass of the sound comes from the great vox humana that belongs to a crowd That queer little dwarf going about with a heavy basket winding in and out among the people helps not a little You can hear his shrill cry above all the other sounds Pypen en tabac Pypen en tabac Another his big brother though evidently some years younger is selling doughnuts and bonbons He is calling on all pretty children far and near to come quickly or the cakes will be gone You know quite a number among the spectators High up in yonder pavilion erected upon the border of the ice are some persons whom you have seen very lately In the center is Madame van Gleck It is her birthday you remember she has the post of honor There is Mynheer van Gleck whose meerschaum has not really grown fast to his lips it only appears so There are Grandfather and Grandmother whom you met at the Saint Nicholas fete All the children are with them It is so mild they have brought even the baby The poor little creature is swathed very much after the manner of an Egyptian mummy but it can crow with delight and when the band is playing open and shut its animated mittens in perfect time to the music Grandfather with his pipe and spectacles and fur cap makes quite a picture as he holds baby upon his knee Perched high upon their canopied platforms the party can see all that is going on No wonder the ladies look complacently at the glassy ice with a stove for a foot stool one might sit cozily beside the North Pole There is a gentleman with them who somewhat resembles Saint Nicholas as he appeared to the young Van Glecks on the fifth of December But the saint had a flowing white beard and this face is as smooth as a pippin His saintship was larger around the body too and between ourselves he had a pair of thimbles in his mouth which this gentleman certain has not It cannot be Saint Nicholas after all Nearby in the next pavilion sit the Van Holps with their son and daughter the Van Gends from The Hague Peter s sister is not one to forget her promises She has brought bouquets of exquisite hothouse flowers for the winners These pavilions and there are others besides have all been erected since daylight That semicircular one containing Mynheer Korbes s family is very pretty and proves that the Hollanders are quite skilled at tentmaking but I like the Van Glecks best the center one striped red and white and hung with evergreens The one with the blue flags contains the musicians Those pagodalike affairs decked with seashells and streamers of every possible hue are the judges stands and those columns and flagstaffs upon the ice mark the limit of the race course The two white columns twined with green connected at the top by that long floating strip of drapery form the starting point Those flagstaffs half a mile off stand at each end of the boundary line which is cut sufficiently deep to be distinct to the skaters though not deep enough to trip them when they turn to come back to the starting point The air is so clear that is seems scarcely possible that the columns and the flagstaffs are so far apart Of course the judges stands are but little nearer together Half a mile on the ice when the atmosphere is like this is but a short distance after all especially when fenced with a living chain of spectators The music has commenced How melody seems to enjoy itself in the open air The fiddles have forgotten their agony and everything is harmonious Until you look at the blue tent it seems that the music springs from the sunshine it is so boundless so joyous Only when you see the staid faced musicians do you realize the truth Where are the racers All assembled together near the white columns It is a beautiful sight Forty boys and girls in picturesque attire darting with electric swiftness in and out among each other or sailing in pairs and triplets beckoning chatting whispering in the fullness of youthful glee A few careful ones are soberly tightening their straps others halting on one leg with flushed eager faces suddenly cross the suspected skate over their knee give it an examining shake and dart off again One and all are possessed with the spirit of motion They cannot stand still Their skates are a part of them and every runner seems bewitched Holland is the place for skaters after all Where else can nearly every boy and girl perform feats on the ice that would attract a crowd if seen in Central Park Look at Ben He is really astonishing the natives no easy thing to do in the Netherlands Save your strength Ben you will need it soon Now other boys are trying Ben is surpassed already Such jumping such poising such spinning such India rubber exploits generally That boy with a red cap is the lion now his back is a watch spring his body is cork no it is iron or it would snap at that He s a bird a top a rabbit a corkscrew a sprite a fleshball all in an instant When you think he s erect he is down and when you think he is down he is up He drops his glove on the ice and turns a somersault as he picks it up Without stopping he snatches the cap from Jacob Poot s astonished head and claps it back again hindside before Lookers on hurrah and laugh Foolish boy It is arctic weather under your feet but more than temperate over head Big drops already are rolling down your forehead Superb skater as you are you may lose the race A French traveler standing with a notebook in his hand sees our English friend Ben buy a doughnut of the dwarf s brother and eat it Thereupon he writes in his notebook that the Dutch take enormous mouthfuls and universally are fond of potatoes boiled in molasses There are some familiar faces near the white columns Lambert Ludwig Peter and Carl are all there cool and in good skating order Hans is not far off Evidently he is going to join in the race for his skates are on the very pair that he sold for seven guilders He had soon suspected that his fairy godmother was the mysterious friend who bought them This settled he had boldly charged her with the deed and she knowing well that all her little savings had been spent in the purchase had not had the face to deny it Through the fairy godmother too he had been rendered amply able to buy them back again Therefore Hans is to be in the race Carl is more indignant than ever about it but as three other peasant boys have entered Hans is not alone Twenty boys and twenty girls The latter by this time are standing in front braced for the start for they are to have the first run Hilda Rychie and Katrinka are among them two or three bend hastily to give a last pull at their skate straps It is pretty to see them stamp to be sure that all is firm Hilda is speaking pleasantly to a graceful little creature in a red jacket and a new brown petticoat Why it is Gretel What a difference those pretty shoes make and the skirt and the new cap Annie Bouman is there too Even Janzoon Kolp s sister has been admitted but Janzoon himself has been voted out by the directors because he killed the stork and only last summer was caught in the act of robbing a bird s nest a legal offence in Holland This Janzoon Kolp you see was There I cannot tell the story just now The race is about to commence Twenty girls are formed in a line The music has ceased A man whom we shall call the crier stands between the columns and the first judges stand He reads the rules in a loud voice The girls and boys are to race in turn until one girl and one boy have beaten twice They are to start in a line from the united columns skate to the flagstaff line turn and then come back to the starting point thus making a mile at each run A flag is waved from the judges stand Madame van Gleck rises in her pavilion She leans forward with a white handkerchief in her hand When she drops it a bugler is to give the signal for them to start The handkerchief is fluttering to the ground Hark They are off No Back again Their line was not true in passing the judges stand The signal is repeated Off again No mistake this time Whew How fast they go The multitude is quiet for an instant absorbed in eager breathless watching Cheers spring up along the line of spectators Huzza Five girls are ahead Who comes flying back from the boundary mark We cannot tell Something red that is all There is a blue spot flitting near it and a dash of yellow nearer still Spectators at this end of the line strain their eyes and wish they had taken their post nearer the flagstaff The wave of cheers is coming back again Now we can see Katrinka is ahead She passes the Van Holp pavilion The next is Madame van Gleck s That leaning figure gazing from it is a magnet Hilda shoots past Katrinka waving her hand to her mother as she passes Two others are close now whizzing on like arrows What is that flash of red and gray Hurray it is Gretel She too waves her hand but toward no gay pavilion The crowd is cheering but she hears only her father s voice Well done little Gretel Soon Katrinka with a quick merry laugh shoots past Hilda The girl in yellow is gaining now She passes them all all except Gretel The judges lean forward without seeming to lift their eyes from their watches Cheer after cheer fills the air the very columns seem rocking Gretel has passed them She has won Gretel Brinker one mile shouts the crier The judges nod They write something upon a tablet which each holds in his hand While the girls are resting some crowding eagerly around our frightened little Gretel some standing aside in high disdain the boys form a line Mynheer van Gleck drops the handkerchief this time The buglers give a vigorous blast The boys have started Halfway already Did ever you see the like Three hundred legs flashing by in an instant But there are only twenty boys No matter there were hundreds of legs I am sure Where are they now There is such a noise one gets bewildered What are the people laughing at Oh at that fat boy in the rear See him go See him He ll be down in an instant no he won t I wonder if he knows he is all alone the other boys are nearly at the boundary line Yes he knows it He stops He wipes his hot face He takes off his cap and looks about him Better to give up with a good grace He has made a hundred friends by that hearty astonished laugh Good Jacob Poot The fine fellow is already among the spectators gazing as eagerly as the rest A cloud of feathery ice flies from the heels of the skaters as they bring to and turn at the flagstaffs Something black is coming now one of the boys it is all we know He has touched the vox humana stop of the crowd it fairly roars Now they come nearer we can see the red cap There s Ben there s Peter there s Hans Hans is ahead Young Madame van Gend almost crushes the flowers in her hand she had been quite sure that Peter would be first Carl Schummel is next then Ben and the youth with the red cap A tall figure darts from among them He passes the red cap he passes Ben then Carl Now it is an even race between him and Hans Madame van Gend catches her breath It is Peter He is ahead Hans shoots past him Hilda s eyes fill with tears Peter MUST beat Annie s eyes flash proudly Gretel gazes with clasped hands four strokes more will take her brother to the columns He is there Yes but so was young Schummel just a second before At the last instant Carl gathering his powers had whizzed between them and passed the goal Carl Schummel one mile shouts the crier Soon Madame van Gleck rises again The falling handkerchief starts the bugle and the bugle using its voice as a bowstring shoots of twenty girls like so many arrows It is a beautiful sight but one has not long to look before we can fairly distinguish them they are far in the distance This time they are close upon one another it is hard to say as they come speeding back from the flagstaff which will reach the columns first There are new faces among the foremost eager glowing faces unnoticed before Katrinka is there and Hilda but Gretel and Rychie are in the rear Gretel is wavering but when Rychie passes her she starts forward afresh Now they are nearly beside Katrinka Hilda is still in advance she is almost home She has not faltered since that bugle note sent her flying like an arrow still she is speeding toward the goal Cheer after cheer rises in the air Peter is silent but his eyes shine like stars Huzza Huzza The crier s voice is heard again Hilda van Gleck one mile A loud murmur of approval runs through the crowd catching the music in its course till all seems one sound with a glad rhythmic throbbing in its depths When the flag waves all is still Once more the bugle blows a terrific blast It sends off the boys like chaff before the wind dark chaff I admit and in big pieces It is whisked around at the flagstaff driven faster yet by the cheers and shouts along the line We begin to see what is coming There are three boys in advance this time and all abreast Hans Peter and Lambert Carl soon breaks the ranks rushing through with a whiff Fly Hans fly Peter don t let Carl beat again Carl the bitter Carl the insolent Van Mounen is flagging but you are strong as ever Hans and Peter Peter and Hans which is foremost We love them both We scarcely care which is the fleeter Hilda Annie and Gretel seated upon the long crimson bench can remain quiet no longer They spring to their feet so different and yet one in eagerness Hilda instantly reseats herself None shall know how interested she is none shall know how anxious how filled with one hope Shut your eyes then Hilda hide our face rippling with joy Peter has beaten Peter van Holp one mile calls the crier The same buzz of excitement as before while the judges take notes the same throbbing of music through the din but something is different A little crowd presses close about some object near the column Carl has fallen He is not hurt though somewhat stunned If he were less sullen he would find more sympathy in these warm young hearts As it is they forget him as soon as he is fairly on his feet again The girls are to skate their third mile How resolute the little maidens look as they stand in a line Some are solemn with a sense of responsibility some wear a smile half bashful half provoked but one air of determination pervades them all This third mile may decide the race Still if neither Gretel nor Hilda wins there is yet a chance among the rest for the silver skates Each girl feels sure that this time she will accomplish the distance in one half of the time How they stamp to try their runners How nervously they examine each strap How erect they stand at last every eye upon Madame van Gleck The bugle thrills through them again With quivering eagerness they spring forward bending but in perfect balance Each flashing stroke seems longer than the last Now they are skimming off in the distance Again the eager straining of eyes again the shouts and cheering again the thrill of excitement as after a few moments four or five in advance of the rest come speeding back nearer nearer to the white columns Who is first Not Rychie Katrinka Annie nor Hilda nor the girl in yellow but Gretel Gretel the fleetest sprite of a girl that ever skated She was but playing in the earlier races NOW she is in earnest or rather something within her has determined to win That lithe little form makes no effort but it cannot stop not until the goal is passed In vain the crier lifts his voice He cannot be heard He has no news to tell it is already ringing through the crowd GRETEL HAS WON THE SILVER SKATES Like a bird she has flown over the ice like a bird she looks about her in a timid startled way She longs to dart to the sheltered nook where her father and mother stand But Hans is beside her the girls are crowding round Hilda s kind joyous voice breathes in her ear From that hour none will despise her Goose girl or not Gretel stands acknowledged queen of the skaters With natural pride Hans turns to see if Peter van Holp is witnessing his sister s triumph Peter is not looking toward them at all He is kneeling bending his troubled face low and working hastily at his skate strap Hans is beside him at once Are you in trouble mynheer Ah Hans that you Yes my fun is over I tried to tighten my strap to make a new hole and this botheration of a knife has cut it nearly in two Mynheer said Hans at the same time pulling off a skate you must use my strap Not I indeed Hans Brinker cried Peter looking up though I thank you warmly Go to your post my friend the bugle will be sounding in another minute Mynheer pleaded Hans in a husky voice you have called me your friend Take this strap quick There is not an instant to lose I shall not skate this time Indeed I am out of practice Mynheer you MUST take it And Hans blind and deaf to any remonstrance slipped his strap into Peter s skate and implored him to put it on Come Peter cried Lambert from the line We are waiting for you For madame s sake pleaded Hans be quick She is motioning to you to join the racers There the skate is almost on Quick mynheer fasten it I could not possibly win The race lies between Master Schummel and yourself You are a noble fellow Hans cried Peter yielding at last He sprang to his post just as the white handkerchief fell to the ground The bugle sends forth its blast loud clear and ringing Off go the boys Mine Gott cries a tough old fellow from Delft They beat everything these Amsterdam youngsters See them See them indeed They are winged Mercuries every one of them What mad errand are they on Ah I know They are hunting Peter van Holp He is some fleet footed runaway from Olympus Mercury and his troop of winged cousins are in full chase They will catch him Now Carl is the runaway The pursuit grows furious Ben is foremost The chase turns in a cloud of mist It is coming this way Who is hunted now Mercury himself It is Peter Peter van Holp fly Peter Hans is watching you He is sending all his fleetness all his strength into your feet Your mother and sister are pale with eagerness Hilda is trembling and dares not look up Fly Peter The crowd has not gone deranged it is only cheering The pursuers are close upon you Touch the white column It beckons it is reeling before you it Huzza Huzza Peter has won the silver skates Peter van Holp shouted the crier But who heard him Peter van Holp shouted a hundred voices for he was the favorite boy of the place Huzza Huzza Now the music was resolved to be heard It struck up a lively air then a tremendous march The spectators thinking something new was about to happen deigned to listen and to look The racers formed in single file Peter being tallest stood first Gretel the smallest of all took her place at the end Hans who had borrowed a strap from the cake boy was near the head Three gaily twined arches were placed at intervals upon the river facing the Van Gleck pavilion Skating slowly and in perfect time to the music the boys and girls moved forward led on by Peter It was beautiful to see the bright procession glide along like a living creature It curved and doubled and drew its graceful length in and out among the arches whichever way Peter the head went the body was sure to follow Sometimes it steered direct for the center arch then as if seized with a new impulse turned away and curled itself about the first one then unwound slowly and bending low with quick snakelike curvings crossed the river passing at length through the furthest arch When the music was slow the procession seemed to crawl like a thing afraid It grew livelier and the creature darted forward with a spring gliding rapidly among the arches in and out curling twisting turning never losing form until at the shrill call of the bugle rising above the music it suddenly resolved itself into boys and girls standing in a double semicircle before Madam van Gleck s pavilion Peter and Gretel stand in the center in advance of the others Madame van Gleck rises majestically Gretel trembles but feels that she must look at the beautiful lady She cannot hear what is said there is such a buzzing all around her She is thinking that she ought to try and make a curtsy such as her mother makes to the meester when suddenly something so dazzling is placed in her hand that she gives a cry of joy Then she ventures to look about her Peter too has something in his hands Oh Oh How splendid she cries and Oh How splendid is echoed as far as people can see Meantime the silver skates flash in the sunshine throwing dashes of light upon those two happy faces Mevrouw van Gend sends a little messenger with her bouquets One for Hilda one for Carl and others for Peter and Gretel At sight of the flowers the queen of the skaters becomes uncontrollable With a bright stare of gratitude she gathers skates and bouquets in her apron hugs them to her bosom and darts off to search for her father and mother in the scattering crowd Joy in the Cottage Perhaps you were surprised to learn that Raff and his vrouw were at the skating race You would have been more so had you been with them on the evening of that merry twentieth of December To see the Brinker cottage standing sulkily alone on the frozen marsh with its bulgy rheumatic looking walls and its slouched hat of a roof pulled far over its eyes one would never suspect that a lively scene was passing within Without nothing was left of the day but a low line of blaze at the horizon A few venturesome clouds had already taken fire and others with their edges burning were lost in the gathering smoke A stray gleam of sunshine slipping down from the willow stump crept stealthily under the cottage It seemed to feel that the inmates would give it welcome if it could only get near them The room under which it hid was as clean as clean could be The very cracks in the rafters were polished Delicious odors filled the air A huge peat fire upon the hearth sent flashes of harmless lightning at the somber walls It played in turn upon the great leather Bible upon Gretel s closet bed the household things upon their pegs and the beautiful silver skates and the flowers upon the table Dame Brinker s honest face shone and twinkled in the changing light Gretel and Hans with arms entwined were leaning against the fireplace laughing merrily and Raff Brinker was dancing I do not mean that he was pirouetting or cutting a pigeon wing either of which would have been entirely too undignified for the father of a family I simply affirm that while they were chatting pleasantly together Raff suddenly sprang from his seat snapped his fingers and performed two or three flourishes very much like the climax of a highland fling Next he caught his vrouw in his arms and fairly lifted her from the ground in his delight Huzza he cried I have it I have it It s Thomas Higgs That s the name It came upon me like a flash Write it down lad write it down Someone knocked at the door It s the meester cried the delighted dame Goede Gunst How things come to pass Mother and children came in merry collision as they rushed to open the door It was not the doctor after all but three boys Peter van Holp Lambert and Ben Good evening young gentlemen said Dame Brinker so happy and proud that she would scarcely have been surprised at a visit from the king himself Good evening jufvrouw said the trio making magnificent bows Dear me thought Dame Brinker as she bobbed up and down like a churn dasher it s lucky I learned to curtsy at Heidelberg Raff was content to return the boys salutations with a respectful nod Pray be seated young masters said the dame as Gretel bashfully thrust a stool at them There s a lack of chairs as you see but this one by the fire is at your service and if you don t mind the hardness that oak chest is as good a seat as the best That s right Hans pull it out By the time the boys were seated to the dame s satisfaction Peter acting as a spokesman had explained that they were going to attend a lecture at Amsterdam and had stopped on the way to return Hans s strap Oh mynheer cried Hans earnestly it is too much trouble I am very sorry No trouble at all Hans I could have waited for you to come to your work tomorrow had I not wished to call And Hans talking of your work my father is much pleased with it A carver by trade could not have done it better He would like to have the south arbor ornamented also but I told him you were going to school again Aye put in Raff Brinker emphatically Hans must go to school at once and Gretel as well that is true I am glad to hear you say so responded Peter turning toward the father and very glad to know that you are again a well man Yes young master a well man and able to work as steady as ever thank God Here Hans hastily wrote something on the edge of a time worn almanac that hung by the chimney place Aye that s right lad set it down Figgs Wiggs Alack Alack added Raff in great dismay it s gone again All right Father said Hans the name s down now in black and white Here look at it father mayhap the rest will come to you If we had the place as well it would be complete Then turning to Peter he said in a low tone I have an important errand in town mynheer and if Wist exclaimed the dame lifting her hands Not to Amsterdam tonight and you ve owned your legs were aching under you Nay nay it ll be soon enough to go at early daylight Daylight indeed echoed Raff That would never do Nay Meitje he must go this hour The vrouw looked for an instant as if Raff s recovery was becoming rather a doubtful benefit her word was no longer sole law in the house Fortunately the proverb Humble wife is husband s boss had taken deep root in her mind even as the dame pondered it bloomed Very well Raff she said smilingly it is thy boy as well as mine Ah I ve a troublesome house young masters Just then Peter drew a long strap from his pocket Handing it to Hans he said in an undertone I need not thank you for lending me this Hans Brinker Such boys as you do not ask for thanks but I must say you did me a great kindness and I am proud to acknowledge it I did not know he added laughingly until fairly in the race how anxious I was to win Hans was glad to join in Peter s laugh it covered his embarrassment and gave his face a chance to cool off a little Honest generous boys like Hans have such a stupid way of blushing when you least expect it It was nothing mynheer said the dame hastening to her son s relief The lad s whole soul was in having you win the race I know it was This helped matters beautifully Ah mynheer Hans hurried to say from the first start I felt stiff and strange on my feet I was well out of it so long as I had no chance of winning Peter looked rather distressed We may hold different opinions here That part of the business troubles me It is too late to mend it now but it would be really a kindness to me if The rest of Peter s speech was uttered so confidentially that I cannot record it Enough to say Hans soon started back in dismay and Peter looking very much ashamed stammered out something to the effect that he would keep them since he won the race but it was all wrong Here Van Mounen coughed as if to remind Peter that lecture hour was approaching fast At the same moment Ben laid something upon the table Ah exclaimed Peter I forgot my other errand Your sister ran off so quickly today that Madame van Gleck had no opportunity to give her the case for her skates S s t said Dame Brinker shaking her head reproachfully at Gretel She was a very rude girl I m sure Secretly she was thinking that very few women had such a fine little daughter No indeed Peter laughed she did exactly the right thing ran home with her richly won treasures Who would not Don t let us detain you Hans he continued turning around as he spoke but Hans who was eagerly watching his father seemed to have forgotten their presence Meantime Raff lost in thought was repeating under his breath Thomas Higgs Thomas Higgs aye that s the name Alack if I could but remember the place as well The skate case was elegantly made of crimson morocco ornamented with silver If a fairy had designed its delicate tracery they could not have been more daintily beautiful For the Fleetest was written upon the cover in sparkling letters It was lined with velvet and in one corner was stamped the name and address of the maker Gretel thanked Peter in her own simple way then being quite delighted and confused and not knowing what else to do she lifted the case carefully examining it in every part It s made by Mynheer Birmingham she said after a while still blushing and holding it before her eyes Birmingham replied Lambert van Mounen that s the name of a place in England Let me see it Ha ha He laughed holding the open case toward the firelight No wonder you thought so but it s a slight mistake The case was made at Birmingham but the maker s name is in smaller letters Humph They re so small I can t read them Let me try said Peter leaning over his shoulder Why man it s perfectly distinct It s T H it s T Well exclaimed Lambert triumphantly if you can read it so easily let s hear it T H what T H T H Oh Why Thomas Higgs to be sure replied Peter pleased to be able to decipher it at last Then feeling that they had been acting rather unceremoniously he turned to Hans Peter turned pale What was the matter with the people Raff and Hans had started up and were staring at him in glad amazement Gretel looked wild Dame Brinker with an unlighted candle in her hand was rushing about the room crying Hans Hans Where s your hat Oh the meester Oh the meester Birmingham Higgs exclaimed Hans Did you say Higgs We ve found him I must be off You see young masters The dame was panting at the same time snatching Hans s hat from the bed you see we know him He s our no he isn t I mean oh Hans you must go to Amsterdam this minute Good night mynheers panted Hans radiant with sudden joy Good night You will excuse me I must go Birmingham Higgs Higgs Birmingham And seizing his hat from his mother and his skates from Gretel he rushed from the cottage What could the boys think but that the entire Brinker family had suddenly gone crazy They bade an embarrassed Good evening and turned to go But Raff stopped them This Thomas Higgs young masters is a a person Ah exclaimed Peter quite sure that Raff was the most crazy of all Yes a person A ahem a friend We thought him dead I hope it is the same man In England did you say Yes Birmingham answered Peter It must be Birmingham in England I know the man said Ben addressing Lambert His factory is not four miles from our place A queer fellow still as an oyster doesn t seem at all like an Englishman I ve often seen him a solemn looking chap with magnificent eyes He made a beautiful writing case once for me to give Jenny on her birthday Makes pocketbooks telescope cases and all kinds of leatherwork As this was said in English Van Mounen of course translated it for the benefit of all concerned noticing meanwhile that neither Raff nor his vrouw looked very miserable though Raff was trembling and the dame s eyes were swimming with tears You may believe that the doctor heard every word of the story when later in the evening he came driving back with Hans The three young gentlemen have been gone some time Dame Brinker said but like enough by hurrying it would be easy to find them coming out from the lecture wherever that was True said Raff nodding his head The vrouw always hits upon the right thing It would be well to see the young English gentleman mynheer before he forgets all about Thomas Higgs It s a slippery name d ye see One can t hold it safe a minute It come upon me sudden and strong as a pile driver and my boy writ it down Aye mynheer I d haste to talk with the English lad He s seen your son many a time only to think on t Dame Brinker took up the thread of the discourse You ll pick out the lad quick enough mynheer because he s in company with Peter van Holp and his hair curls up over his forehead like foreign folk s and if you hear him speak he talks of big and fast only it s English but that wouldn t be any hindrance to your honor The doctor had already lifted his hat to go With a beaming face he muttered something about its being just like the young scamp to give himself a rascally English name called Hans my son thereby making that young gentleman as happy as a lord and left the cottage with very little ceremony considering what a great meester he was The grumbling coachman comforted himself by speaking his mind as he drove back to Amsterdam Since the doctor was safely stowed away in the coach and could not hear a word it was a fine time to say terrible things of folks who hadn t no manner of feeling for nobody and who were always wanting the horses a dozen times of a night Mysterious Disappearance of Thomas Higgs Higgs s factory was a mine of delight for the gossips of Birmingham It was a small building but quite large enough to hold a mystery Who the proprietor was or where he came from none could tell He looked like a gentleman that was certain though everybody knew he had risen from an apprenticeship and he could handle his pen like a writing master Years ago he had suddenly appeared in the place a lad of eighteen learned his trade faithfully and risen in the confidence of his employer been taken in as a partner soon after the time was up Finally when old Willett died had assumed the business on his own hands This was all that was known of his affairs It was a common remark among some of the good people that he never had a word to say to a Christian soul while others declared that though he spoke beautifully when he chose to there was something wrong in his accent A tidy man too they called him all but for having that scandalous green pond alongside of his factory which wasn t deep enough for an eel and was just a fever nest as sure as you live His nationality was a great puzzle The English name spoke plain enough for ONE side of his house but of what manner of nation was his mother If she d been an American he d certainly have had high cheekbones and reddish skin if a German he would have known the language and Squire Smith declared that he didn t if French and his having that frog pond made it seem likely it would come out in his speech No there was nothing he could be but Dutch And strangest of all though the man always pricked up his ears when you talked of Holland he didn t seem to know the first thing about the country when you put him to the point Anyhow as no letters ever came to him from his mother s family in Holland and as nobody living had ever seen old Higgs the family couldn t be anything much Probably Thomas Higgs himself was no better than he should be for all he pretended to carry himself so straight and for their parts the gossips declared they were not going to trouble their heads about him Consequently Thomas Higgs and his affairs were never failing subjects of discussion Picture then the consternation among all the good people when it was announced by somebody who was there and ought to know that the postboy had that very morning handed Higgs a foreign looking letter and the man had turned as white as the wall rushed to his factory talked a bit with one of the head workmen and without bidding a creature good bye was off bag and baggage before you could wink ma am Mistress Scrubbs his landlady was in deep affliction The dear soul became quite out of breath while speaking of him To leave lodgin s in that suddent way without never so much as a day s warnin which was what every woman who didn t wish to be trodden underfoot which thank hevving wasn t HER way had a perfect right to expect yes and a week s warnin now you mention it and without even so much as sayin Many thanks Mistress Scrubbs for all past kindnesses which was most numerous though she said it who shouldn t say it leastwise she wasn t never no kind of person to be lookin for thanks every minnit It was really scanderlous though to be sure Mister iggs paid up everythin to the last farthin and it fairly brought tears to my eyes to see his dear empty boots lyin there in the corner of his room which alone showed trouble of mind for he always stood em up straight as solgers though bein half soled twice they hadn t of course been worth takin away Whereupon her dearest friend Miss Scrumpkins ran home to tell all about it And as everybody knew the Scrumpkinses a shining gossamer of news was soon woven from one end of the street to the other An investigating committee met that evening at missus Snigham s sitting in secret session over her best china Though invited only to a quiet tea the amount of judicial business they transacted on the occasion was prodigious The biscuits were actually cold before the committee had a chance to eat anything There was so much to talk over and it was so important that it should be firmly established that each member had always been certain sure that something extraordinary would be happening to that man yet that it was nearly eight o clock before missus Snigham gave anybody a second cup Broad Sunshine One snowy day in January Laurens Boekman went with his father to pay his respects to the Brinker family Raff was resting after the labors of the day Gretel having filled and lighted his pipe was brushing every speck of ash from the hearth the dame was spinning and Hans perched upon a stool by the window was diligently studying his lessons It was a peaceful happy household whose main excitement during the past week had been the looking forward to this possible visit from Thomas Higgs As soon as the grand presentation was over Dame Brinker insisted upon giving her guests some hot tea it was enough to freeze anyone she said to be out in such crazy blustering weather While they were talking with her husband she whispered to Gretel that the young gentleman s eyes and her boy s were certainly as much alike as four beans to say nothing of a way they both had of looking as if they were stupid and yet knew as much as a body s grandfather Gretel was disappointed She had looked forward to a tragic scene such as Annie Bouman had often described to her from storybooks and here was the gentleman who came so near being a murderer who for ten years had been wandering over the face of the earth who believed himself deserted and scorned by his father the very young gentleman who had fled from his country in such magnificent trouble sitting by the fire just as pleasant and natural as could be To be sure his voice had trembled when he talked with her parents and he had met his father s look with a bright kind of smile that would have suited a dragon killer bringing the waters of perpetual youth to his king but after all he wasn t at all like the conquered hero in Annie s book He did not say lifting his arm toward heaven I hereby swear to be forever faithful to my home my God and my country which would have been only right and proper under the circumstances All things considered Gretel was disappointed Raff however was perfectly satisfied The message was delivered doctor Boekman had his son safe and sound and the poor lad had done nothing sinful after all except in thinking that his father would have abandoned him for an accident To be sure the graceful stripling had become rather a heavy man Raff had unconsciously hoped to clasp that same boyish hand again but all things were changed to Raff for that matter So he pushed back every feeling but joy as he saw father and son sitting side by side at his hearthstone Meantime Hans was wholly occupied in the thought of Thomas Higgs s happiness in being able to be the meester s assistant again and Dame Brinker was sighing softly to herself wishing that the lad s mother were alive to see him such a fine young gentleman as he was and wondering how doctor Boekman could bear to see the silver watch getting so dull He had worn it ever since Raff handed it over that was evident What had he done with the gold one he used to wear The light was shining full upon doctor Boekman s face How contented he looked how much younger and brighter than formerly The hard lines were quite melting away He was laughing as he said to the father Am I not a happy man Raff Brinker My son will sell out his factory this month and open a warehouse in Amsterdam I shall have all my spectacle cases for nothing Hans started from his reverie A warehouse mynheer And will Thomas Higgs I mean is your son not to be your assistant again A shade passed over the meester s face but he brightened with an effort as he replied Oh no Laurens has had quite enough of that He wishes to be a merchant Hans appeared so surprised and disappointed that his friend asked good naturedly Why so silent boy Is it any disgrace to be a merchant N not a disgrace mynheer stammered Hans but But what Why the other calling is so much better answered Hans so much nobler I think mynheer he added with enthusiasm that to be a surgeon to cure the sick and crippled to save human life to be able to do what you have done for my father is the grandest thing on earth The doctor was regarding him sternly Hans felt rebuked His cheeks were flushed hot tears were gathering under his lashes It is an ugly business boy this surgery said the doctor still frowning at Hans It requires great patience self denial and perseverance I am sure that it does cried Hans It calls for wisdom too and a reverence for God s work Ah mynheer it may have its trials and drawbacks but you do not mean what you say It is great and noble not ugly Pardon me mynheer It is not for me to speak so boldly doctor Boekman was evidently displeased He turned his back on the boy and conferred aside with Laurens Meanwhile the dame scowled a terrible warning at Hans These great people she knew well enough never like to hear poor folk speak up so pertly The meester turned around How old are you Hans Brinker Fifteen mynheer was the startled reply Would you like to become a physician Yes mynheer answered Hans quivering with excitement Would you be willing with your parents consent to devote yourself to study to go to the university and in time be a student in my office Yes mynheer You would not grow restless think you and change your mind just as I had set my heart upon preparing you to be my successor Hans s eyes flashed No mynheer I would not change You may believe him there cried the dame who could remain quiet no longer Hans is like a rock when once he decides and as for study mynheer the child has almost grown fast to his books of late He can jumble off Latin already like any priest The doctor smiled Well Hans I see nothing to prevent us from carrying out this plan if your father agrees Ahem said Raff too proud of his boy to be very meek The fact is mynheer I prefer an active out of door life myself But if the lad s inclined to study for a meester and he d have the benefit of your good word to push him on in the world it s all one to me The money s all that s wanting but it mightn t be long with two strong pair of arms to earn it before we Tut tut interrupted the doctor If I take your right hand man away I must pay the cost and glad enough will I be to do it It will be like having TWO sons eh Laurens One a merchant and the other a surgeon I shall be the happiest man in Holland Come to me in the morning Hans and we will arrange matters at once Hans bowed assent He dared not trust himself to speak And Brinker continued the doctor my son Laurens will need a trusty ready man like you when he opens his warehouse in Amsterdam someone to oversee matters and see that the lazy clowns round about the place do their duty Someone to Why don t you tell him yourself you rascal This last was addressed to the son and did not sound half as fierce as it looks in print The rascal and Raff soon understood each other perfectly I m loath to leave the dikes said the latter after they had talked together awhile but it is such a good offer mynheer I d be robbing my family if I let it go past me Take a long look at Hans as he sits there staring gratefully at the meester for you shall not see him again for many years And Gretel ah what a vista of puzzling work suddenly opens before her Yes for dear Hans s sake she will study now If he really is to be a meester his sister must not shame his greatness How faithfully those glancing eyes shall yet seek for the jewels that lie hidden in rocky schoolbooks And how they shall yet brighten and droop at the coming of one whom she knows of now only as the boy who wore a red cap on that wonderful day when she found the silver skates in her apron But the doctor and Laurens are going Dame Brinker is making her best curtsy Raff stands beside her looking every inch a man as he grasps the meester s hand Through the open cottage door we can look out upon the level Dutch landscape all alive with the falling snow Conclusion Our story is nearly told Time passes in Holland just as surely and steadily as here In that respect no country is odd To the Brinker family it has brought great changes Hans has spent the years faithfully and profitably conquering obstacles as they arose and pursuing one object with all the energy of his nature If often the way has been rugged his resolution has never failed Sometimes he echoes with his good friend the words said long ago in that little cottage near Broek Surgery is an ugly business but always in his heart of hearts lingers the echo of those truer words It is great and noble It awakes a reverence for God s work Were you in Amsterdam today you might see the famous doctor Brinker riding in his grand coach to visit his patients or it might be you would see him skating with his own boys and girls upon the frozen canal For Annie Bouman the beautiful frank hearted peasant girl you would inquire in vain but Annie Brinker the vrouw of the great physician is very like her only as Hans says she is even lovelier wiser more like a fairy godmother than ever Peter van Holp also is a married man I could have told you before that he and Hilda would join hands and glide through life together just as years ago they skimmed side by side over the frozen sunlit river At one time I came near hinting that Katrinka and Carl would join hands It is fortunate that the report was not started for Katrinka changed her mind and is single to this day The lady is not quite so merry as formerly and I grieve to say some of the tinkling bells are out of tune But she is the life of her social circle still I wish she would be in earnest just for a little while but no it is not in her nature Her cares and sorrows do nothing more than disturb the tinkling they never waken any deeper music Rychie s soul has been stirred to its depths during these long years Her history would tell how seed carelessly sown is sometimes reaped in anguish and how a golden harvest may follow a painful planting If I mistake not you may be able to read the written record before long that is if you are familiar with the Dutch language In the witty but earnest author whose words are welcomed to this day in thousands of Holland homes few could recognize the haughty flippant Rychie who scoffed at little Gretel Lambert van Mounen and Ludwig van Holp are good Christian men and what is more easily to be seen at a glance thriving citizens Both are dwellers in Amsterdam but one clings to the old city of that name and the other is a pilgrim to the new Van Mounen s present home is not far from Central Park and he says if the New Yorkers do their duty the park will in time equal his beautiful Bosch near The Hague He often thinks of the Katrinka of his boyhood but he is glad now that Katrinka the woman sent him away though it seemed at the time his darkest hour Ben s sister Jenny has made him very happy happier than he could have been with anyone else in the wide world Carl Schummel has had a hard life His father met with reverses in business and as Carl had not many warm friends and above all was not sustained by noble principles he has been tossed about by fortune s battledore until his gayest feathers are nearly all knocked off He is a bookkeeper in the thriving Amsterdam house of Boekman and Schimmelpenninck Voostenwalbert the junior partner treats him kindly and he in turn is very respectful to the monkey with a long name for a tail Of all our group of Holland friends Jacob Poot is the only one who has passed away Good natured true hearted and unselfish to the last he is mourned now as heartily as he was loved and laughed at while on earth He grew to be very thin before he died thinner than Benjamin Dobbs who is now portliest among the portly Raff Brinker and his vrouw have been living comfortably in Amsterdam for many years a faithful happy pair as simple and straightforward in their good fortune as they were patient and trustful in darker days They have a zomerhuis near the old cottage and thither they often repair with their children and grandchildren on the pleasant summer afternoons when the pond lilies rear their queenly heads above the water The story of Hans Brinker would be but half told if we did not leave him with Gretel standing near Dear quick patient little Gretel What is she now Ask old doctor Boekman he will declare that she is the finest singer the loveliest woman in Amsterdam Ask Hans and Annie they will assure you that she is the dearest sister ever known Ask her husband he will tell you that she is the brightest sweetest little wife in Holland Ask Dame Brinker and Raff their eyes will glisten with joyous tears Ask the poor and the air will be filled with blessings But lest you forget a tiny form trembling and sobbing on the mound before the Brinker cottage ask the Van Glecks they will never weary of telling of the darling little girl who won the silver skates End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Hans Brinker by
