Jew Who that has looked on Gustave DorA C s marvellous illustrations to this wild legend can forget the impression they made upon his imagination I do not refer to the first illustration as striking where the Jewish shoemaker is refusing to suffer the cross laden Savior to rest a moment on his door step and is receiving with scornful lip the judgment to wander restless till the Second Coming of that same Redeemer But I refer rather to the second which represents the Jew after the lapse of ages bowed beneath the burden of the curse worn with unrelieved toil wearied with ceaseless travelling trudging onward at the last lights of evening when a rayless night of unabating rain is creeping on along a sloppy path between dripping bushes and suddenly he comes over against a wayside crucifix on which the white glare of departing daylight falls to throw it into ghastly relief against the pitch black rain clouds For a moment we see the working of the miserable shoemaker s mind We feel that he is recalling the tragedy of the first Good Friday and his head hangs heavier on his breast as he recalls the part he had taken in that awful catastrophe Or is that other illustration more remarkable where the wanderer is amongst the Alps at the brink of a hideous chasm and seeing in the contorted pine branches the ever haunting scene of the Via Dolorosa he is lured to cast himself into that black gulf in quest of rest when an angel flashes out of the gloom with the sword of flame turning every way keeping him back from what would be to him a Paradise indeed the repose of Death Or that last scene when the trumpet sounds and earth is shivering to its foundations the fire is bubbling forth through the rents in its surface and the dead are coming together flesh to flesh and bone to bone and muscle to muscle then the weary man sits down and casts off his shoes Strange sights are around him he sees them not strange sounds assail his ears he hears but one the trumpet note which gives the signal for him to stay his wanderings and rest his weary feet I can linger over those noble woodcuts and learn from them something new each time that I study them they are picture poems full of latent depths of thought And now let us to the history of this most thrilling of all mediA val myths if a myth If a myth I say for who can say for certain that it is not true Verily I say unto you There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom one are our Lord s words which I can hardly think apply to the destruction of Jerusalem as commentators explain it to escape the difficulty That some should live to see Jerusalem destroyed was not very surprising and hardly needed the emphatic Verily which Christ only used when speaking something of peculiarly solemn or mysterious import Besides saint Luke s account manifestly refers the coming in the kingdom to the Judgment for the saying stands as follows Whosoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He shall come in His own glory and in His Father s and of the holy angels But I tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God two There can I think be no doubt in the mind of an unprejudiced person that the words of our Lord do imply that some one or more of those then living should not die till He came again I do not mean to insist on the literal signification but I plead that there is no improbability in our Lord s words being fulfilled to the letter That the circumstance is unrecorded in the Gospels is no evidence that it did not take place for we are expressly told Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His disciples which are not written in this book three and again There are also many other things which Jesus did the which if they should be written every one I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written four We may remember also the mysterious witnesses who are to appear in the last eventful days of the world s history and bear testimony to the Gospel truth before the antichristian world One of these has been often conjectured to be saint John the Evangelist of whom Christ said to Peter If I will that he tarry till I come what is that to thee The historical evidence on which the tale rests is however too slender for us to admit for it more than the barest claim to be more than myth The names and the circumstances connected with the Jew and his doom vary in every account and the only point upon which all coincide is that such an individual exists in an undying condition wandering over the face of the earth seeking rest and finding none The earliest extant mention of the Wandering Jew is to be found in the book of the chronicles of the Abbey of saint Albans which was copied and continued by Matthew Paris He records that in the year twelve twenty eight a certain Archbishop of Armenia the Greater came on a pilgrimage to England to see the relics of the saints and visit the sacred places in the kingdom as he had done in others he also produced letters of recommendation from his Holiness the Pope to the religious and the prelates of the churches in which they were enjoined to receive and entertain him with due reverence and honor On his arrival he came to saint Albans where he was received with all respect by the abbot and the monks and at this place being fatigued with his journey he remained some days to rest himself and his followers and a conversation took place between him and the inhabitants of the convent by means of their interpreters during which he made many inquiries relating to the religion and religious observances of this country and told many strange things concerning the countries of the East In the course of conversation he was asked whether he had ever seen or heard any thing of Joseph a man of whom there was much talk in the world who when our Lord suffered was present and spoke to Him and who is still alive in evidence of the Christian faith in reply to which a knight in his retinue who was his interpreter replied speaking in French My lord well knows that man and a little before he took his way to the western countries the said Joseph ate at the table of my lord the Archbishop of Armenia and he has often seen and conversed with him He was then asked about what had passed between Christ and the said Joseph to which he replied At the time of the passion of Jesus Christ He was seized by the Jews and led into the hall of judgment before Pilate the governor that He might be judged by him on the accusation of the Jews and Pilate finding no fault for which he might sentence Him to death said unto them Take Him and judge Him according to your law the shouts of the Jews however increasing he at their request released unto them Barabbas and delivered Jesus to them to be crucified When therefore the Jews were dragging Jesus forth and had reached the door Cartaphilus a porter of the hall in Pilate s service as Jesus was going out of the door impiously struck Him on the back with his hand and said in mockery Go quicker Jesus go quicker why do you loiter and Jesus looking back on him with a severe countenance said to him I am going and you shall wait till I return And according as our Lord said this Cartaphilus is still awaiting His return At the time of our Lord s suffering he was thirty years old and when he attains the age of a hundred years he always returns to the same age as he was when our Lord suffered After Christ s death when the Catholic faith gained ground this Cartaphilus was baptized by Ananias who also baptized the Apostle Paul and was called Joseph He dwells in one or other divisions of Armenia and in divers Eastern countries passing his time amongst the bishops and other prelates of the Church he is a man of holy conversation and religious a man of few words and very circumspect in his behavior for he does not speak at all unless when questioned by the bishops and religious and then he relates the events of olden times and speaks of things which occurred at the suffering and resurrection of our Lord and of the witnesses of the resurrection namely of those who rose with Christ and went into the holy city and appeared unto men He also tells of the creed of the Apostles and of their separation and preaching And all this he relates without smiling or levity of conversation as one who is well practised in sorrow and the fear of God always looking forward with dread to the coming of Jesus Christ lest at the Last Judgment he should find him in anger whom when on his way to death he had provoked to just vengeance Numbers came to him from different parts of the world enjoying his society and conversation and to them if they are men of authority he explains all doubts on the matters on which he is questioned He refuses all gifts that are offered him being content with slight food and clothing Much about the same date Philip Mouskes afterwards Bishop of Tournay wrote his rhymed chronicle twelve forty two which contains a similar account of the Jew derived from the same Armenian prelate Adonques vint un arceveskes De ASec A mer plains de bonnes tA ques Par samblant et fut d Armenie and this man having visited the shrine of saint Tumas de Kantorbire and then having paid his devotions at Monsigour saint Jake he went on to Cologne to see the heads of the three kings The version told in the Netherlands much resembled that related at saint Albans only that the Jew seeing the people dragging Christ to his death exclaims AtendA C s moi g i vois S iert mis le faus profA te en crois Then Le vrais Dieux se regarda Et li a dit qu e n i tarda Icist ne t atenderont pas Mais saces tu m atenderas We hear no more of the wandering Jew till the sixteenth century when we hear first of him in a casual manner as assisting a weaver Kokot at the royal palace in Bohemia fifteen oh five to find a treasure which had been secreted by the great grandfather of Kokot sixty years before at which time the Jew was present He then had the appearance of being a man of seventy years five Curiously enough we next hear of him in the East where he is confounded with the prophet Elijah Early in the century he appeared to Fadhilah under peculiar circumstances After the Arabs had captured the city of Elvan Fadhilah at the head of three hundred horsemen pitched his tents late in the evening between two mountains Fadhilah having begun his evening prayer with a loud voice heard the words Allah akbar God is great repeated distinctly and each word of his prayer was followed in a similar manner Fadhilah not believing this to be the result of an echo was much astonished and cried out O thou whether thou art of the angel ranks or whether thou art of some other order of spirits it is well the power of God be with thee but if thou art a man then let mine eyes light upon thee that I may rejoice in thy presence and society Scarcely had he spoken these words before an aged man with bald head stood before him holding a staff in his hand and much resembling a dervish in appearance After having courteously saluted him Fadhilah asked the old man who he was Thereupon the stranger answered Bassi Hadhret Issa I am here by command of the Lord Jesus who has left me in this world that I may live therein until he comes a second time to earth I wait for this Lord who is the Fountain of Happiness and in obedience to his command I dwell behind yon mountain When Fadhilah heard these words he asked when the Lord Jesus would appear and the old man replied that his appearing would be at the end of the world at the Last Judgment But this only increased Fadhilah s curiosity so that he inquired the signs of the approach of the end of all things whereupon Zerib Bar Elia gave him an account of general social and moral dissolution which would be the climax of this world s history six In fifteen forty seven he was seen in Europe if we are to believe the following narration Paul von Eitzen doctor of the Holy Scriptures and Bishop of Schleswig seven related as true for some years past that when he was young having studied at Wittemberg he returned home to his parents in Hamburg in the winter of the year fifteen forty seven and that on the following Sunday in church he observed a tall man with his hair hanging over his shoulders standing barefoot during the sermon over against the pulpit listening with deepest attention to the discourse and whenever the name of Jesus was mentioned bowing himself profoundly and humbly with sighs and beating of the breast He had no other clothing in the bitter cold of the winter except a pair of hose which were in tatters about his feet and a coat with a girdle which reached to his feet and his general appearance was that of a man of fifty years And many people some of high degree and title have seen this same man in England France Italy Hungary Persia Spain Poland Moscow Lapland Sweden Denmark Scotland and other places Every one wondered over the man Now after the sermon the said Doctor inquired diligently where the stranger was to be found and when he had sought him out he inquired of him privately whence he came and how long that winter he had been in the place Thereupon he replied modestly that he was a Jew by birth a native of Jerusalem by name Ahasverus by trade a shoemaker he had been present at the crucifixion of Christ and had lived ever since travelling through various lands and cities the which he substantiated by accounts he gave he related also the circumstances of Christ s transference from Pilate to Herod and the final crucifixion together with other details not recorded in the Evangelists and historians he gave accounts of the changes of government in many countries especially of the East through several centuries and moreover he detailed the labors and deaths of the holy Apostles of Christ most circumstantially Now when Doctor Paul v Eitzen heard this with profound astonishment on account of its incredible novelty he inquired further in order that he might obtain more accurate information Then the man answered that he had lived in Jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion of Christ whom he had regarded as a deceiver of the people and a heretic he had seen Him with his own eyes and had done his best along with others to bring this deceiver as he regarded Him to justice and to have Him put out of the way When the sentence had been pronounced by Pilate Christ was about to be dragged past his house then he ran home and called together his household to have a look at Christ and see what sort of a person He was This having been done he had his little child on his arm and was standing in his doorway to have a sight of the Lord Jesus Christ As then Christ was led by bowed under the weight of the heavy cross He tried to rest a little and stood still a moment but the shoemaker in zeal and rage and for the sake of obtaining credit among the other Jews drove the Lord Christ forward and told Him to hasten on His way Jesus obeying looked at him and said I shall stand and rest but thou shalt go till the last day At these words the man set down the child and unable to remain where he was he followed Christ and saw how cruelly He was crucified how He suffered how He died As soon as this had taken place it came upon him suddenly that he could no more return to Jerusalem nor see again his wife and child but must go forth into foreign lands one after another like a mournful pilgrim Now when years after he returned to Jerusalem he found it ruined and utterly razed so that not one stone was left standing on another and he could not recognize former localities He believes that it is God s purpose in thus driving him about in miserable life and preserving him undying to present him before the Jews at the end as a living token so that the godless and unbelieving may remember the death of Christ and be turned to repentance For his part he would well rejoice were God in heaven to release him from this vale of tears After this conversation Doctor Paul v Eitzen along with the rector of the school of Hamburg who was well read in history and a traveller questioned him about events which had taken place in the East since the death of Christ and he was able to give them much information on many ancient matters so that it was impossible not to be convinced of the truth of his story and to see that what seems impossible with men is after all possible with God Since the Jew has had his life extended he has become silent and reserved and only answers direct questions When invited to become any one s guest he eats little and drinks in great moderation then hurries on never remaining long in one place When at Hamburg Dantzig and elsewhere money has been offered him he never took more than two skillings fourpence one farthing and at once distributed it to the poor as token that he needed no money for God would provide for him as he rued the sins he had committed in ignorance During the period of his stay in Hamburg and Dantzig he was never seen to laugh In whatever land he travelled he spoke its language and when he spoke Saxon it was like a native Saxon Many people came from different places to Hamburg and Dantzig in order to see and hear this man and were convinced that the providence of God was exercised in this individual in a very remarkable manner He gladly listened to God s word or heard it spoken of always with great gravity and compunction and he ever reverenced with sighs the pronunciation of the name of God or of Jesus Christ and could not endure to hear curses but whenever he heard any one swear by God s death or pains he waxed indignant and exclaimed with vehemence and with sighs Wretched man and miserable creature thus to misuse the name of thy Lord and God and His bitter sufferings and passion Hadst thou seen as I have how heavy and bitter were the pangs and wounds of thy Lord endured for thee and for me thou wouldst rather undergo great pain thyself than thus take His sacred name in vain Such is the account given to me by Doctor Paul von Eitzen with many circumstantial proofs and corroborated by certain of my own old acquaintances who saw this same individual with their own eyes in Hamburg In the year fifteen seventy five the Secretary Christopher Krause and Master Jacob von Holstein legates to the Court of Spain and afterwards sent into the Netherlands to pay the soldiers serving his Majesty in that country related on their return home to Schleswig and confirmed with solemn oaths that they had come across the same mysterious individual at Madrid in Spain in appearance manner of life habits clothing just the same as he had appeared in Hamburg They said that they had spoken with him and that many people of all classes had conversed with him and found him to speak good Spanish In the year fifteen ninety nine in December a reliable person wrote from Brunswick to Strasburg that the same mentioned strange person had been seen alive at Vienna in Austria and that he had started for Poland and Dantzig and that he purposed going on to Moscow This Ahasverus was at Lubeck in sixteen oh one also about the same date in Revel in Livonia and in Cracow in Poland In Moscow he was seen of many and spoken to by many What thoughtful God fearing persons are to think of the said person is at their option God s works are wondrous and past finding out and are manifested day by day only to be revealed in full at the last great day of account Dated Revel August first sixteen thirteen D W D Chrysostomus DudulA us Westphalus The statement that the Wandering Jew appeared in Lubeck in sixteen oh one does not tally with the more precise chronicle of Henricus Bangert which gives Die fourteen Januarii Anno MDCIII adnotatum reliquit LubecA fuisse JudA um illum immortalem qui se Christi crucifixioni interfuisse affirmavit eight In sixteen oh four he seems to have appeared in Paris Rudolph Botoreus says under this date I fear lest I be accused of giving ear to old wives fables if I insert in these pages what is reported all over Europe of the Jew coeval with the Savior Christ however nothing is more common and our popular histories have not scrupled to assert it Following the lead of those who wrote our annals I may say that he who appeared not in one century only in Spain Italy and Germany was also in this year seen and recognized as the same individual who had appeared in Hamburg anno MDLXVI The common people bold in spreading reports relate many things of him and this I allude to lest anything should be left unsaid nine J C Bulenger puts the date of the Hamburg visit earlier It was reported at this time that a Jew of the time of Christ was wandering without food and drink having for a thousand and odd years been a vagabond and outcast condemned by God to rove because he of that generation of vipers was the first to cry out for the crucifixion of Christ and the release of Barabbas and also because soon after when Christ panting under the burden of the rood sought to rest before his workshop he was a cobbler the fellow ordered Him off with acerbity Thereupon Christ replied Because thou grudgest Me such a moment of rest I shall enter into My rest but thou shalt wander restless At once frantic and agitated he fled through the whole earth and on the same account to this day he journeys through the world It was this person who was seen in Hamburg in MDLXIV Credat JudA us Apella I did not see him or hear anything authentic concerning him at that time when I was in Paris ten A curious little book eleven written against the quackery of Paracelsus by Leonard Doldius a NAone fourrnberg physician and translated into Latin and augmented by Andreas Libavius doctor and physician of Rotenburg alludes to the same story and gives the Jew a new name nowhere else met with After having referred to a report that Paracelsus was not dead but was seated alive asleep or napping in his sepulchre at Strasburg preserved from death by some of his specifics Libavius declares that he would sooner believe in the old man the Jew Ahasverus wandering over the world called by some ButtadA us and otherwise again by others He is said to have appeared in Naumburg but the date is not given he was noticed in church listening to the sermon After the service he was questioned and he related his story On this occasion he received presents from the burgers twelve In sixteen thirty three he was again in Hamburg thirteen In the year sixteen forty two citizens living in the Gerberstrasse in Brussels were walking in the Sonian wood when they encountered an aged man whose clothes were in tatters and of an antiquated appearance They invited him to go with them to a house of refreshment and he went with them but would not seat himself remaining on foot to drink When he came before the doors with the two burgers he told them a great deal but they were mostly stories of events which had happened many hundred years before Hence the burgers gathered that their companion was Isaac Laquedem the Jew who had refused to permit our Blessed Lord to rest for a moment at his door step and they left him full of terror In sixteen forty two he is reported to have visited Leipzig On the twenty twod July seventeen twenty one he appeared at the gates of the city of Munich fourteen About the end of the seventeenth century or the beginning of the eighteenth an impostor calling himself the Wandering Jew attracted attention in England and was listened to by the ignorant and despised by the educated He however managed to thrust himself into the notice of the nobility who half in jest half in curiosity questioned him and paid him as they might a juggler He declared that he had been an officer of the Sanhedrim and that he had struck Christ as he left the judgment hall of Pilate He remembered all the Apostles and described their personal appearance their clothes and their peculiarities He spoke many languages claimed the power of healing the sick and asserted that he had travelled nearly all over the world Those who heard him were perplexed by his familiarity with foreign tongues and places Oxford and Cambridge sent professors to question him and to discover the imposition if any An English nobleman conversed with him in Arabic The mysterious stranger told his questioner in that language that historical works were not to be relied upon And on being asked his opinion of Mahomet he replied that he had been acquainted with the father of the prophet and that he dwelt at Ormuz As for Mahomet he believed him to have been a man of intelligence once when he heard the prophet deny that Christ was crucified he answered abruptly by telling him he was a witness to the truth of that event He related also that he was in Rome when Nero set it on fire he had known Saladin Tamerlane Bajazeth Eterlane and could give minute details of the history of the Crusades fifteen Whether this wandering Jew was found out in London or not we cannot tell but he shortly after appeared in Denmark thence travelled into Sweden and vanished Such are the principal notices of the Wandering Jew which have appeared It will be seen at once how wanting they are in all substantial evidence which could make us regard the story in any other light than myth But no myth is wholly without foundation and there must be some substantial verity upon which this vast superstructure of legend has been raised What that is I am unable to discover It has been suggested by some that the Jew Ahasverus is an impersonation of that race which wanders Cain like over the earth with the brand of a brother s blood upon it and one which is not to pass away till all be fulfilled not to be reconciled to its angered God till the times of the Gentiles are accomplished And yet probable as this supposition may seem at first sight it is not to be harmonized with some of the leading features of the story The shoemaker becomes a penitent and earnest Christian whilst the Jewish nation has still the veil upon its heart the wretched wanderer eschews money and the avarice of the Israelite is proverbial According to local legend he is identified with the Gypsies or rather that strange people are supposed to be living under a curse somewhat similar to that inflicted on Ahasverus because they refused shelter to the Virgin and Child on their flight into Egypt sixteen Another tradition connects the Jew with the wild huntsman and there is a forest at Bretten in Swabia which he is said to haunt Popular superstition attributes to him there a purse containing a groschen which as often as it is expended returns to the spender seventeen In the Harz one form of the Wild Huntsman myth is to this effect that he was a Jew who had refused to suffer our Blessed Lord to drink out of a river or out of a horse trough but had contemptuously pointed out to Him the hoof print of a horse in which a little water had collected and had bid Him quench His thirst thence eighteen As the Wild Huntsman is the personification of the storm it is curious to find in parts of France that the sudden roar of a gale at night is attributed by the vulgar to the passing of the Everlasting Jew A Swiss story is that he was seen one day standing upon the Matterberg which is below the Matterhorn contemplating the scene with mingled sorrow and wonder Once before he stood on that spot and then it was the site of a flourishing city now it is covered with gentian and wild pinks Once again will he revisit the hill and that will be on the eve of Judgment Perhaps of all the myths which originated in the middle ages none is more striking than that we have been considering indeed there is something so calculated to arrest the attention and to excite the imagination in the outline of the story that it is remarkable that we should find an interval of three centuries elapse between its first introduction into Europe by Matthew Paris and Philip Mouskes and its general acceptance in the sixteenth century As a myth its roots lie in that great mystery of human life which is an enigma never solved and ever originating speculation What was life Was it of necessity limited to fourscore years or could it be extended indefinitely were questions curious minds never wearied of asking And so the mythology of the past teemed with legends of favored or accursed mortals who had reached beyond the term of days set to most men Some had discovered the water of life the fountain of perpetual youth and were ever renewing their strength Others had dared the power of God and were therefore sentenced to feel the weight of His displeasure without tasting the repose of death John the Divine slept at Ephesus untouched by corruption with the ground heaving over his breast as he breathed waiting the summons to come forth and witness against Antichrist The seven sleepers reposed in a cave and centuries glided by like a watch in the night The monk of Hildesheim doubting how with God a thousand years could be as yesterday listened to the melody of a bird in the green wood during three minutes and found that in three minutes three hundred years had flown Joseph of ArimathA a in the blessed city of Sarras draws perpetual life from the Saint Graal Merlin sleeps and sighs in an old tree spell bound of Vivien Charlemagne and Barbarossa wait crowned and armed in the heart of the mountain till the time comes for the release of Fatherland from despotism And on the other hand the curse of a deathless life has passed on the Wild Huntsman because he desired to chase the red deer for evermore on the Captain of the Phantom Ship because he vowed he would double the Cape whether God willed it or not on the Man in the Moon because he gathered sticks during the Sabbath rest on the dancers of Kolbeck because they desired to spend eternity in their mad gambols I began this article intending to conclude it with a bibliographical account of the tracts letters essays and books written upon the Wandering Jew but I relinquish my intention at the sight of the multitude of works which have issued from the press upon the subject and this I do with less compunction as the bibliographer may at little trouble and expense satisfy himself by perusing the lists given by GrAsse in his essay on the myth and those to be found in Notice historique et bibliographique sur les Juifs errants par O B Gustave Brunet Paris TA C chener eighteen forty five also in the article by M Mangin in

Prester John Illustration Arms of the See of Chichester About the middle of the twelfth century a rumor circulated through Europe that there reigned in Asia a powerful Christian Emperor Presbyter Johannes In a bloody fight he had broken the power of the Mussulmans and was ready to come to the assistance of the Crusaders Great was the exultation in Europe for of late the news from the East had been gloomy and depressing the power of the infidel had increased overwhelming masses of men had been brought into the field against the chivalry of Christendom and it was felt that the cross must yield before the odious crescent The news of the success of the Priest King opened a door of hope to the desponding Christian world Pope Alexander III determined at once to effect a union with this mysterious personage and on the twenty seventh of September eleven seventy seven wrote him a letter which he intrusted to his physician Philip to deliver in person Philip started on his embassy but never returned The conquests of Tschengis Khan again attracted the eyes of Christian Europe to the East The Mongol hordes were rushing in upon the west with devastating ferocity Russia Poland Hungary and the eastern provinces of Germany had succumbed or suffered grievously and the fears of other nations were roused lest they too should taste the misery of a Mongolian invasion It was Gog and Magog come to slaughter and the times of Antichrist were dawning But the battle of Liegnitz stayed them in their onward career and Europe was saved Pope Innocent IV determined to convert these wild hordes of barbarians and subject them to the cross of Christ he therefore sent among them a number of Dominican and Franciscan missioners and embassies of peace passed between the Pope the King of France and the Mogul Khan The result of these communications with the East was that the travellers learned how false were the prevalent notions of a mighty Christian empire existing in Central Asia Vulgar superstition or conviction is not however to be upset by evidence and the locality of the monarchy was merely transferred by the people to Africa and they fixed upon Abyssinia with a show of truth as the seat of the famous Priest King However still some doubted John de Plano Carpini and Marco Polo though they acknowledged the existence of a Christian monarch in Abyssinia yet stoutly maintained as well that the Prester John of popular belief reigned in splendor somewhere in the dim Orient But before proceeding with the history of this strange fable it will be well to extract the different accounts given of the Priest King and his realm by early writers and we shall then be better able to judge of the influence the myth obtained in Europe Otto of Freisingen is the first author to mention the monarchy of Prester John with whom we are acquainted Otto wrote a chronicle up to the date eleven fifty six and he relates that in eleven forty five the Catholic Bishop of Cabala visited Europe to lay certain complaints before the Pope He mentioned the fall of Edessa and also he stated that a few years ago a certain King and Priest called John who lives on the farther side of Persia and Armenia in the remote East and who with all his people were Christians though belonging to the Nestorian Church had overcome the royal brothers Samiardi kings of the Medes and Persians and had captured Ecbatana their capital and residence The said kings had met with their Persian Median and Assyrian troops and had fought for three consecutive days each side having determined to die rather than take to flight Prester John for so they are wont to call him at length routed the Persians and after a bloody battle remained victorious After which victory the said John was hastening to the assistance of the Church at Jerusalem but his host on reaching the Tigris was hindered from passing through a deficiency in boats and he directed his march North since he had heard that the river was there covered with ice In that place he had waited many years expecting severe cold but the winters having proved unpropitious and the severity of the climate having carried off many soldiers he had been forced to retreat to his own land This king belongs to the family of the Magi mentioned in the Gospel and he rules over the very people formerly governed by the Magi moreover his fame and his wealth are so great that he uses an emerald sceptre only Excited by the example of his ancestors who came to worship Christ in his cradle he had proposed to go to Jerusalem but had been impeded by the above mentioned causes nineteen At the same time the story crops up in other quarters so that we cannot look upon Otto as the inventor of the myth The celebrated Maimonides alludes to it in a passage quoted by Joshua Lorki a Jewish physician to Benedict XIII Maimonides lived from eleven thirty five to twelve oh four The passage is as follows It is evident both from the letters of Rambam Maimonides whose memory be blessed and from the narration of merchants who have visited the ends of the earth that at this time the root of our faith is to be found in the lands of Babel and Teman where long ago Jerusalem was an exile not reckoning those who live in the land of Paras twenty and Madai twenty one of the exiles of Schomrom the number of which people is as the sand of these some are still under the yoke of Paras who is called the Great Chief Sultan by the Arabs others live in a place under the yoke of a strange people governed by a Christian chief Preste Cuan by name With him they have made a compact and he with them and this is a matter concerning which there can be no manner of doubt Benjamin of Tudela another Jew travelled in the East between the years eleven fifty nine and eleven seventy three the last being the date of his death He wrote an account of his travels and gives in it some information with regard to a mythical Jew king who reigned in the utmost splendor over a realm inhabited by Jews alone situate somewhere in the midst of a desert of vast extent About this period there appeared a document which produced intense excitement throughout Europe a letter yes a letter from the mysterious personage himself to Manuel Comnenus Emperor of Constantinople eleven forty three eleven eighty The exact date of this extraordinary epistle cannot be fixed with any certainty but it certainly appeared before twelve forty one the date of the conclusion of the chronicle of Albericus Trium Fontium This Albericus relates that in the year eleven sixty five Presbyter Joannes the Indian king sent his wonderful letter to various Christian princes and especially to Manuel of Constantinople and Frederic the Roman Emperor Similar letters were sent to Alexander III to Louis VII of France and to the King of Portugal which are alluded to in chronicles and romances and which were indeed turned into rhyme and sung all over Europe by minstrels and trouvA res The letter is as follows John Priest by the Almighty power of God and the Might of our Lord Jesus Christ King of Kings and Lord of Lords to his friend Emanuel Prince of Constantinople greeting wishing him health prosperity and the continuance of Divine favor Our Majesty has been informed that you hold our Excellency in love and that the report of our greatness has reached you Moreover we have heard through our treasurer that you have been pleased to send to us some objects of art and interest that our Exaltedness might be gratified thereby Being human I receive it in good part and we have ordered our treasurer to send you some of our articles in return Now we desire to be made certain that you hold the right faith and in all things cleave to Jesus Christ our Lord for we have heard that your court regard you as a god though we know that you are mortal and subject to human infirmities Should you desire to learn the greatness and excellency of our Exaltedness and of the land subject to our sceptre then hear and believe I Presbyter Johannes the Lord of Lords surpass all under heaven in virtue in riches and in power seventy two kings pay us tribute In the three Indies our Magnificence rules and our land extends beyond India where rests the body of the holy Apostle Thomas it reaches towards the sunrise over the wastes and it trends towards deserted Babylon near the tower of Babel Seventy two provinces of which only a few are Christian serve us Each has its own king but all are tributary to us Our land is the home of elephants dromedaries camels crocodiles meta collinarum cametennus tensevetes wild asses white and red lions white bears white merules crickets griffins tigers lamias hyenas wild horses wild oxen and wild men men with horns one eyed men with eyes before and behind centaurs fauns satyrs pygmies forty ell high giants Cyclopses and similar women it is the home too of the phA nix and of nearly all living animals We have some people subject to us who feed on the flesh of men and of prematurely born animals and who never fear death When any of these people die their friends and relations eat him ravenously for they regard it as a main duty to munch human flesh Their names are Gog and Magog Anie Agit Azenach Fommeperi Befari Conei Samante Agrimandri Vintefolei Casbei Alanei These and similar nations were shut in behind lofty mountains by Alexander the Great towards the North We lead them at our pleasure against our foes and neither man nor beast is left undevoured if our Majesty gives the requisite permission And when all our foes are eaten then we return with our hosts home again These accursed fifteen nations will burst forth from the four quarters of the earth at the end of the world in the times of Antichrist and overrun all the abodes of the Saints as well as the great city Rome which by the way we are prepared to give to our son who will be born along with all Italy Germany the two Gauls Britain and Scotland We shall also give him Spain and all the land as far as the icy sea The nations to which I have alluded according to the words of the prophet shall not stand in the judgment on account of their offensive practices but will be consumed to ashes by a fire which will fall on them from heaven Our land streams with honey and is overflowing with milk In one region grows no poisonous herb nor does a querulous frog ever quack in it no scorpion exists nor does the serpent glide amongst the grass nor can any poisonous animals exist in it or injure any one Among the heathen flows through a certain province the River Indus encircling Paradise it spreads its arms in manifold windings through the entire province Here are found the emeralds sapphires carbuncles topazes chrysolites onyxes beryls sardius and other costly stones Here grows the plant Assidos which when worn by any one protects him from the evil spirit forcing it to state its business and name consequently the foul spirits keep out of the way there In a certain land subject to us all kinds of pepper is gathered and is exchanged for corn and bread leather and cloth At the foot of Mount Olympus bubbles up a spring which changes its flavor hour by hour night and day and the spring is scarcely three days journey from Paradise out of which Adam was driven If any one has tasted thrice of the fountain from that day he will feel no fatigue but will as long as he lives be as a man of thirty years Here are found the small stones called Nudiosi which if borne about the body prevent the sight from waxing feeble and restore it where it is lost The more the stone is looked at the keener becomes the sight In our territory is a certain waterless sea consisting of tumbling billows of sand never at rest None have crossed this sea it lacks water altogether yet fish are cast up upon the beach of various kinds very tasty and the like are nowhere else to be seen Three days journey from this sea are mountains from which rolls down a stony waterless river which opens into the sandy sea As soon as the stream reaches the sea its stones vanish in it and are never seen again As long as the river is in motion it cannot be crossed only four days a week is it possible to traverse it Between the sandy sea and the said mountains in a certain plain is a fountain of singular virtue which purges Christians and would be Christians from all transgressions The water stands four inches high in a hollow stone shaped like a mussel shell Two saintly old men watch by it and ask the comers whether they are Christians or are about to become Christians then whether they desire healing with all their hearts If they have answered well they are bidden to lay aside their clothes and to step into the mussel If what they said be true then the water begins to rise and gush over their heads thrice does the water thus lift itself and every one who has entered the mussel leaves it cured of every complaint Near the wilderness trickles between barren mountains a subterranean rill which can only by chance be reached for only occasionally the earth gapes and he who would descend must do it with precipitation ere the earth closes again All that is gathered under the ground there is gem and precious stone The brook pours into another river and the inhabitants of the neighborhood obtain thence abundance of precious stones Yet they never venture to sell them without having first offered them to us for our private use should we decline them they are at liberty to dispose of them to strangers Boys there are trained to remain three or four days under water diving after the stones Beyond the stone river are the ten tribes of the Jews which though subject to their own kings are for all that our slaves and tributary to our Majesty In one of our lands hight Zone are worms called in our tongue Salamanders These worms can only live in fire and they build cocoons like silk worms which are unwound by the ladies of our palace and spun into cloth and dresses which are worn by our Exaltedness These dresses in order to be cleaned and washed are cast into flames When we go to war we have fourteen golden and bejewelled crosses borne before us instead of banners each of these crosses is followed by ten thousand horsemen and one hundred thousand foot soldiers fully armed without reckoning those in charge of the luggage and provision When we ride abroad plainly we have a wooden unadorned cross without gold or gem about it borne before us in order that we may meditate on the sufferings of Our Lord Jesus Christ also a golden bowl filled with earth to remind us of that whence we sprung and that to which we must return but besides these there is borne a silver bowl full of gold as a token to all that we are the Lord of Lords All riches such as are upon the world our Magnificence possesses in superabundance With us no one lies for he who speaks a lie is thenceforth regarded as dead he is no more thought of or honored by us No vice is tolerated by us Every year we undertake a pilgrimage with retinue of war to the body of the holy prophet Daniel which is near the desolated site of Babylon In our realm fishes are caught the blood of which dyes purple The Amazons and the Brahmins are subject to us The palace in which our Supereminency resides is built after the pattern of the castle built by the Apostle Thomas for the Indian king Gundoforus Ceilings joists and architrave are of Sethym wood the roof of ebony which can never catch fire Over the gable of the palace are at the extremities two golden apples in each of which are two carbuncles so that the gold may shine by day and the carbuncles by night The greater gates of the palace are of sardius with the horn of the horned snake inwrought so that no one can bring poison within The other portals are of ebony The windows are of crystal the tables are partly of gold partly of amethyst and the columns supporting the tables are partly of ivory partly of amethyst The court in which we watch the jousting is floored with onyx in order to increase the courage of the combatants In the palace at night nothing is burned for light but wicks supplied with balsam Before our palace stands a mirror the ascent to which consists of five and twenty steps of porphyry and serpentine After a description of the gems adorning this mirror which is guarded night and day by three thousand armed men he explains its use We look therein and behold all that is taking place in every province and region subject to our sceptre Seven kings wait upon us monthly in turn with sixty two dukes two hundred and fifty six counts and marquises and twelve archbishops sit at table with us on our right and twenty bishops on the left besides the patriarch of saint Thomas the Sarmatian Protopope and the Archpope of Susa Our lord high steward is a primate and king our cup bearer is an archbishop and king our chamberlain a bishop and king our marshal a king and abbot I may be spared further extracts from this extraordinary letter which proceeds to describe the church in which Prester John worships by enumerating the precious stones of which it is constructed and their special virtues Whether this letter was in circulation before Pope Alexander wrote his it is not easy to decide Alexander does not allude to it but speaks of the reports which have reached him of the piety and the magnificence of the Priest King At the same time there runs a tone of bitterness through the letter as though the Pope had been galled at the pretensions of this mysterious personage and perhaps winced under the prospect of the man eaters overrunning Italy as suggested by John the Priest The papal epistle is an assertion of the claims of the See of Rome to universal dominion and it assures the Eastern Prince Pope that his Christian professions are worthless unless he submits to the successor of Peter Not every one that saith unto me Lord Lord c quotes the Pope and then explains that the will of God is that every monarch and prelate should eat humble pie to the Sovereign Pontiff Sir John Maundevil gives the origin of the priestly title of the Eastern despot in his curious book of travels So it befelle that this emperour cam with a Cristene knyght with him into a chirche in Egypt and it was Saterday in Wyttson woke And the bishop made orders And he beheld and listened the servyse fulle tentyfly and he asked the Cristene knyght what men of degree thei scholden ben that the prelate had before him And the knyght answerede and seyde that thei scholde ben prestes And then the emperour seyde that he wolde no longer ben clept kyng ne emperour but preest and that he wolde have the name of the first preest that wente out of the chirche and his name was John And so evere more sittiens he is clept Prestre John It is probable that the foundation of the whole Prester John myth lay in the report which reached Europe of the wonderful successes of Nestorianism in the East and there seems reason to believe that the famous letter given above was a Nestorian fabrication It certainly looks un European the gorgeous imagery is thoroughly Eastern and the disparaging tone in which Rome is spoken of could hardly have been the expression of Western feelings The letter has the object in view of exalting the East in religion and arts to an undue eminence at the expense of the West and it manifests some ignorance of European geography when it speaks of the land extending from Spain to the Polar Sea Moreover the sites of the patriarchates and the dignity conferred on that of saint Thomas are indications of a Nestorian bias A brief glance at the history of this heretical Church may be of value here as showing that there really was a foundation for the wild legends concerning a Christian empire in the East so prevalent in Europe Nestorius a priest of Antioch and a disciple of saint Chrysostom was elevated by the emperor to the patriarchate of Constantinople and in the year four hundred twenty eight began to propagate his heresy denying the hypostatic union The Council of Ephesus denounced him and in spite of the emperor and court Nestorius was anathematized and driven into exile His sect spread through the East and became a flourishing church It reached to China where the emperor was all but converted its missionaries traversed the frozen tundras of Siberia preaching their maimed Gospel to the wild hordes which haunted those dreary wastes it faced Buddhism and wrestled with it for the religious supremacy in Thibet it established churches in Persia and in Bokhara it penetrated India it formed colonies in Ceylon in Siam and in Sumatra so that the Catholicos or Pope of Bagdad exercised sway more extensive than that ever obtained by the successor of saint Peter The number of Christians belonging to that communion probably exceeded that of the members of the true Catholic Church in East and West But the Nestorian Church was not founded on the Rock it rested on Nestorius and when the rain descended and the winds blew and the floods came and beat upon that house it fell leaving scarce a fragment behind Rubruquis the Franciscan who in twelve fifty three was sent on a mission into Tartary was the first to let in a little light on the fable He writes The Catai dwelt beyond certain mountains across which I wandered and in a plain in the midst of the mountains lived once an important Nestorian shepherd who ruled over the Nestorian people called Nayman When Coir Khan died the Nestorian people raised this man to be king and called him King Johannes and related of him ten times as much as the truth The Nestorians thereabouts have this way with them that about nothing they make a great fuss and thus they have got it noised abroad that Sartach Mangu Khan and Ken Khan were Christians simply because they treated Christians well and showed them more honor than other people Yet in fact they were not Christians at all And in like manner the story got about that there was a great King John However I traversed his pastures and no one knew anything about him except a few Nestorians In his pastures lives Ken Khan at whose court was Brother Andrew whom I met on my way back This Johannes had a brother a famous shepherd named Unc who lived three weeks journey beyond the mountains of Caracatais This Unk Khan was a real individual he lost his life in the year twelve oh three Kuschhik prince of the Nayman and follower of Kor Khan fell in twelve eighteen Marco Polo the Venetian traveller twelve fifty four thirteen twenty four identifies Unk Khan with Prester John he says I will now tell you of the deeds of the Tartars how they gained the mastery and spread over the whole earth The Tartars dwelt between Georgia and Bargu where there is a vast plain and level country on which are neither cities nor forts but capital pasturage and water They had no chief of their own but paid to Prester Johannes tribute Of the greatness of this Prester Johannes who was properly called Un Khan the whole world spake the Tartars gave him one of every ten head of cattle When Prester John noticed that they were increasing he feared them and planned how he could injure them He determined therefore to scatter them and he sent barons to do this But the Tartars guessed what Prester John purposed and they went away into the wide wastes of the North where they might be beyond his reach He then goes on to relate how Tschengis Jenghiz Khan became the head of the Tartars and how he fought against Prester John and after a desperate fight overcame and slew him The Syriac Chronicle of the Jacobite Primate Gregory Bar HebrA us born twelve twenty six died twelve eighty six also identifies Unk Khan with Prester John In the year of the Greeks fifteen fourteen of the Arabs five hundred ninety nine A D twelve oh two when Unk Khan who is the Christian King John ruled over a stock of the barbarian Hunns called Kergt Tschingys Khan served him with great zeal When John observed the superiority and serviceableness of the other he envied him and plotted to seize and murder him But two sons of Unk Khan having heard this told it to Tschingys whereupon he and his comrades fled by night and secreted themselves Next morning Unk Khan took possession of the Tartar tents but found them empty Then the party of Tschingys fell upon him and they met by the spring called Balschunah and the side of Tschingys won the day and the followers of Unk Khan were compelled to yield They met again several times till Unk Khan was utterly discomfited and was slain himself and his wives sons and daughters carried into captivity Yet we must consider that King John the Kergtajer was not cast down for nought nay rather because he had turned his heart from the fear of Christ his Lord who had exalted him and had taken a wife of the Zinish nation called Quarakhata Because he forsook the religion of his ancestors and followed strange gods therefore God took the government from him and gave it to one better than he and whose heart was right before God Some of the early travellers such as John de Plano Carpini and Marco Polo in disabusing the popular mind of the belief in Prester John as a mighty Asiatic Christian monarch unintentionally turned the popular faith in that individual into a new direction They spoke of the black people of Abascia in Ethiopia which by the way they called Middle India as a great people subject to a Christian monarch Marco Polo says that the true monarch of Abyssinia is Christ but that it is governed by six kings three of whom are Christians and three Saracens and that they are in league with the Soudan of Aden Bishop Jordanus in his description of the world accordingly sets down Abyssinia as the kingdom of Prester John and such was the popular impression which was confirmed by the appearance at intervals of ambassadors at European courts from the King of Abyssinia The discovery of the Cape of Good Hope was due partly to a desire manifested in Portugal to open communications with this monarch twenty two and King John II sent two men learned in Oriental languages through Egypt to the court of Abyssinia The might and dominion of this prince who had replaced the Tartar chief in the popular creed as Prester John was of course greatly exaggerated and was supposed to extend across Arabia and Asia to the wall of China The spread of geographical knowledge has contracted the area of his dominions and a critical acquaintance with history has exploded the myth which invested Unk Khan the nomad chief with all the attributes of a demigod uniting in one the utmost pretensions of a Pope and the proudest claims of a monarch FOOTNOTES nineteen Otto Ep Frising lib vii c thirty three twenty Persia twenty one Media twenty two Ludolfi Hist Athiopica lib ii cap one two Petrus Petri filius LusitaniA princeps M Pauli

authority and Holy Scripture employs it in the popular sense Thus David speaks of Thy rod and Thy staff comforting me and Moses works his miracles before Pharaoh with the rod as emblem of Divine commission It was his rod which became a serpent which turned the water of Egypt into blood which opened the waves of the Red Sea and restored them to their former level which smote the rock of stone so that the water gushed out abundantly The rod of Aaron acted an oracular part in the contest with the princes laid up before the ark it budded and brought forth almonds In this instance we have it no longer as a symbol of authority but as a means of divining the will of God And as such it became liable to abuse thus Hosea rebukes the chosen people for practising similar divinations My people ask counsel at their stocks and their staff declareth unto them twenty three Long before this Jacob had made a different use of rods employing them as a charm to make his father in law s sheep bear pied and spotted lambs We find rhabdomancy a popular form of divination among the Greeks and also among the Romans Cicero in his De Officiis alludes to it If all that is needful for our nourishment and support arrives to us by means of some divine rod as people say then each of us free from all care and trouble may give himself up to the exclusive pursuit of study and science Probably it is to this rod that the allusion of Ennius as the agent in discovering hidden treasures quoted in the first book of his De Divinatione refers According to Vetranius Maurus Varro left a satire on the Virgula divina which has not been preserved Tacitus tells us that the Germans practised some sort of divination by means of rods For the purpose their method is simple They cut a rod off some fruit tree into bits and after having distinguished them by various marks they cast them into a white cloth Then the priest thrice draws each piece and explains the oracle according to the marks Ammianus Marcellinus says that the Alains employed an osier rod The fourteenth law of the Frisons ordered that the discovery of murders should be made by means of divining rods used in Church These rods should be laid before the altar and on the sacred relics after which God was to be supplicated to indicate the culprit This was called the Lot of Rods or Tan teen the Rod of Rods But the middle ages was the date of the full development of the superstition and the divining rod was believed to have efficacy in discovering hidden treasures veins of precious metal springs of water thefts and murders The first notice of its general use among late writers is in the Testamentum Novum lib i cap twenty five of Basil Valentine a Benedictine monk of the fifteenth century Basil speaks of the general faith in and adoption of this valuable instrument for the discovery of metals which is carried by workmen in mines either in their belts or in their caps He says that there are seven names by which this rod is known and to its excellences under each title he devotes a chapter of his book The names are Divine Rod Shining Rod Leaping Rod Transcendent Rod Trembling Rod Dipping Rod Superior Rod In his admirable treatise on metals Agricola speaks of the rod in terms of disparagement he considers its use as a relic of ancient magical forms and he says that it is only irreligious workmen who employ it in their search after metals Goclenius however in his treatise on the virtue of plants stoutly does battle for the properties of the hazel rod Whereupon Roberti a Flemish Jesuit falls upon him tooth and nail disputes his facts overwhelms him with abuse and gibbets him for popular ridicule Andreas Libavius a writer I have already quoted in my article on the Wandering Jew undertook a series of experiments upon the hazel divining rod and concluded that there was truth in the popular belief The Jesuit Kircher also experimentalized several times on wooden rods which were declared to be sympathetic with regard to certain metals by placing them on delicate pivots in equilibrium but they never turned on the approach of metal De Arte Magnetica However a similar course of experiments over water led him to attribute to the rod the power of indicating subterranean springs and water courses I would not affirm it he says unless I had established the fact by my own experience Dechales another Jesuit author of a treatise on natural springs and of a huge tome entitled Mundus Mathematicus declared in the latter work that no means of discovering sources is equal to the divining rod and he quotes a friend of his who with a hazel rod in his hand could discover springs with the utmost precision and facility and could trace on the surface of the ground the course of a subterranean conduit Another writer Saint Romain in his Science dA C gagA C e des ChimA res de l A cole exclaims Is it not astonishing to see a rod which is held firmly in the hands bow itself and turn visibly in the direction of water or metal with more or less promptitude according as the metal or the water are near or remote from the surface In sixteen fifty nine the Jesuit Gaspard Schott writes that the rod is used in every town of Germany and that he had frequent opportunity of seeing it used in the discovery of hidden treasures I searched with the greatest care he adds into the question whether the hazel rod had any sympathy with gold and silver and whether any natural property set it in motion In like manner I tried whether a ring of metal held suspended by a thread in the midst of a tumbler and which strikes the hours is moved by any similar force I ascertained that these effects could only have rise from the deception of those holding the rod or the pendulum or may be from some diabolic impulsion or more likely still because imagination sets the hand in motion The Sieur le Royer a lawyer of Rouen in sixteen seventy four published his TraitA C du BActon universel in which he gives an account of a trial made with the rod in the presence of Father Jean FranASec ois who had ridiculed the operation in his treatise on the science of waters published at Rennes in sixteen fifty five and which succeeded in convincing the blasphemer of the divine Rod Le Royer denies to it the power of picking out criminals which had been popularly attributed to it and as had been unhesitatingly claimed for it by Debrio in his Disquisitio Magica And now I am brought to the extraordinary story of Jacques Aymar which attracted the attention of Europe to the marvellous properties of the divining rod I shall give the history of this man in full as such an account is rendered necessary by the mutilated versions I have seen current in English magazine articles which follow the lead of missus Crowe who narrates the earlier portion of this impostor s career but says nothing of his exposA C and downfall On the fifth July sixteen ninety two at about ten o clock in the evening a wine seller of Lyons and his wife were assassinated in their cellar and their money carried off On the morrow the officers of justice arrived and examined the premises Beside the corpses lay a large bottle wrapped in straw and a bloody hedging bill which undoubtedly had been the instrument used to accomplish the murder Not a trace of those who had committed the horrible deed was to be found and the magistrates were quite at fault as to the direction in which they should turn for a clew to the murderer or murderers At this juncture a neighbor reminded the magistrates of an incident which had taken place four years previous It was this In sixteen eighty eight a theft of clothes had been made in Grenoble In the parish of CrA le lived a man named Jacques Aymar supposed to be endowed with the faculty of using the divining rod This man was sent for On reaching the spot where the theft had been committed his rod moved in his hand He followed the track indicated by the rod and it continued to rotate between his fingers as long as he followed a certain direction but ceased to turn if he diverged from it in the smallest degree Guided by his rod Aymar went from street to street till he was brought to a standstill before the prison gates These could not be opened without leave of the magistrate who hastened to witness the experiment The gates were unlocked and Aymar under the same guidance directed his steps towards four prisoners lately incarcerated He ordered the four to be stood in a line and then he placed his foot on that of the first The rod remained immovable He passed to the second and the rod turned at once Before the third prisoner there were no signs the fourth trembled and begged to be heard He owned himself the thief along with the second who also acknowledged the theft and mentioned the name of the receiver of the stolen goods This was a farmer in the neighborhood of Grenoble The magistrate and officers visited him and demanded the articles he had obtained The farmer denied all knowledge of the theft and all participation in the booty Aymar however by means of his rod discovered the secreted property and restored it to the persons from whom it had been stolen On another occasion Aymar had been in quest of a spring of water when he felt his rod turn sharply in his hand On digging at the spot expecting to discover an abundant source the body of a murdered woman was found in a barrel with a rope twisted round her neck The poor creature was recognized as a woman of the neighborhood who had vanished four months before Aymar went to the house which the victim had inhabited and presented his rod to each member of the household It turned upon the husband of the deceased who at once took to flight The magistrates of Lyons at their wits ends how to discover the perpetrators of the double murder in the wine shop urged the Procureur du Roi to make experiment of the powers of Jacques Aymar The fellow was sent for and he boldly asserted his capacity for detecting criminals if he were first brought to the spot of the murder so as to be put en rapport with the murderers He was at once conducted to the scene of the outrage with the rod in his hand This remained stationary as he traversed the cellar till he reached the spot where the body of the wine seller had lain then the stick became violently agitated and the man s pulse rose as though he were in an access of fever The same motions and symptoms manifested themselves when he reached the place where the second victim had lain Having thus received his impression Aymar left the cellar and guided by his rod or rather by an internal instinct he ascended into the shop and then stepping into the street he followed from one to another like a hound upon the scent the track of the murderers It conducted him into the court of the archiepiscopal palace across it and down to the gate of the Rhone It was now evening and the city gates being all closed the quest of blood was relinquished for the night Next morning Aymar returned to the scent Accompanied by three officers he left the gate and descended the right bank of the Rhone The rod gave indications of there having been three involved in the murder and he pursued the traces till two of them led to a gardener s cottage Into this he entered and there he asserted with warmth against the asseverations of the proprietor to the contrary that the fugitives had entered his room had seated themselves at his table and had drunk wine out of one of the bottles which he indicated Aymar tested each of the household with his rod to see if they had been in contact with the murderers The rod moved over the two children only aged respectively ten and nine years These little things on being questioned answered with reluctance that during their father s absence on Sunday morning against his express commands they had left the door open and that two men whom they described had come in suddenly upon them and had seated themselves and made free with the wine in the bottle pointed out by the man with the rod This first verification of the talents of Jacques Aymar convinced some of the sceptical but the Procurateur GA C nA C ral forbade the prosecution of the experiment till the man had been further tested As already stated a hedging bill had been discovered on the scene of the murder smeared with blood and unquestionably the weapon with which the crime had been committed Three bills from the same maker and of precisely the same description were obtained and the four were taken into a garden and secretly buried at intervals Aymar was then brought staff in hand into the garden and conducted over the spots where lay the bills The rod began to vibrate as his feet stood upon the place where was concealed the bill which had been used by the assassins but was motionless elsewhere Still unsatisfied the four bills were exhumed and concealed anew The comptroller of the province himself bandaged the sorcerer s eyes and led him by the hand from place to place The divining rod showed no signs of movement till it approached the blood stained weapon when it began to oscillate The magistrates were now so far satisfied as to agree that Jacques Aymar should be authorized to follow the trail of the murderers and have a company of archers to follow him Guided by his rod Aymar now recommenced his pursuit He continued tracing down the right bank of the Rhone till he came to half a league from the bridge of Lyons Here the footprints of three men were observed in the sand as though engaged in entering a boat A rowing boat was obtained and Aymar with his escort descended the river he found some difficulty in following the trail upon water still he was able with a little care to detect it It brought him under an arch of the bridge of Vienne which boats rarely passed beneath This proved that the fugitives were without a guide The way in which this curious journey was made was singular At intervals Aymar was put ashore to test the banks with his rod and ascertain whether the murderers had landed He discovered the places where they had slept and indicated the chairs or benches on which they had sat In this manner by slow degrees he arrived at the military camp of Sablon between Vienne and Saint Valier There Aymar felt violent agitation his cheeks flushed and his pulse beat with rapidity He penetrated the crowds of soldiers but did not venture to use his rod lest the men should take it ill and fall upon him He could not do more without special authority and was constrained to return to Lyons The magistrates then provided him with the requisite powers and he went back to the camp Now he declared that the murderers were not there He recommenced his pursuit and descended the Rhone again as far as Beaucaire On entering the town he ascertained by means of his rod that those whom he was pursuing had parted company He traversed several streets then crowded on account of the annual fair and was brought to a standstill before the prison doors One of the murderers was within he declared he would track the others afterwards Having obtained permission to enter he was brought into the presence of fourteen or fifteen prisoners Amongst these was a hunchback who had only an hour previously been incarcerated on account of a theft he had committed at the fair Aymar applied his rod to each of the prisoners in succession it turned upon the hunchback The sorcerer ascertained that the other two had left the town by a little path leading into the Nismes road Instead of following this track he returned to Lyons with the hunchback and the guard At Lyons a triumph awaited him The hunchback had hitherto protested his innocence and declared that he had never set foot in Lyons But as he was brought to that town by the way along which Aymar had ascertained that he had left it the fellow was recognized at the different houses where he had lodged the night or stopped for food At the little town of Bagnols he was confronted with the host and hostess of a tavern where he and his comrades had slept and they swore to his identity and accurately described his companions their description tallied with that given by the children of the gardener The wretched man was so confounded by this recognition that he avowed having staid there a few days before along with two ProvenASec als These men he said were the criminals he had been their servant and had only kept guard in the upper room whilst they committed the murders in the cellar On his arrival in Lyons he was committed to prison and his trial was decided on At his first interrogation he told his tale precisely as he had related it before with these additions the murderers spoke patois and had purchased two bills At ten o clock in the evening all three had entered the wine shop The ProvenASec als had a large bottle wrapped in straw and they persuaded the publican and his wife to descend with them into the cellar to fill it whilst he the hunchback acted as watch in the shop The two men murdered the wine seller and his wife with their bills and then mounted to the shop where they opened the coffer and stole from it one hundred and thirty crowns eight louis d ors and a silver belt The crime accomplished they took refuge in the court of a large house this was the archbishop s palace indicated by Aymar and passed the night in it Next day early they left Lyons and only stopped for a moment at a gardener s cottage Some way down the river they found a boat moored to the bank This they loosed from its mooring and entered They came ashore at the spot pointed out by the man with the stick They staid some days in the camp at Sablon and then went on to Beaucaire Aymar was now sent in quest of the other murderers He resumed their trail at the gate of Beaucaire and that of one of them after considerable dA C tours led him to the prison doors of Beaucaire and he asked to be allowed to search among the prisoners for his man This time he was mistaken The second fugitive was not within but the jailer affirmed that a man whom he described and his description tallied with the known appearance of one of the ProvenASec als had called at the gate shortly after the removal of the hunchback to inquire after him and on learning of his removal to Lyons had hurried off precipitately Aymar now followed his track from the prison and this brought him to that of the third criminal He pursued the double scent for some days But it became evident that the two culprits had been alarmed at what had transpired in Beaucaire and were flying from France Aymar traced them to the frontier and then returned to Lyons On the thirtieth of August sixteen ninety two the poor hunchback was according to sentence broken on the wheel in the Place des Terreaux On his way to execution he had to pass the wine shop There the recorder publicly read his sentence which had been delivered by thirty judges The criminal knelt and asked pardon of the poor wretches in whose murder he was involved after which he continued his course to the place fixed for his execution It may be well here to give an account of the authorities for this extraordinary story There are three circumstantial accounts and numerous letters written by the magistrate who sat during the trial and by an eye witness of the whole transaction men honorable and disinterested upon whose veracity not a shadow of doubt was supposed to rest by their contemporaries M Chauvin Doctor of Medicine published a Lettre A Mme la Marquise de Senozan sur les moyens dont on s est servi pour dA C couvrir les complices d un assassinat commis A Lyon le five Juillet sixteen ninety two Lyons sixteen ninety two The procA s verbal of the Procureur du Roi M de Vanini is also extant and published in the Physique occulte of the AbbA C de Vallemont Pierre Gamier Doctor of Medicine of the University of Montpellier wrote a Dissertation physique en forme de lettre A M de SA ve seigneur de FlA C chA res on Jacques Aymar printed the same year at Lyons and republished in the Histoire critique des pratiques superstitieuses du PA re Lebrun Doctor Chauvin was witness of nearly all the circumstances related as was also the AbbA C Lagarde who has written a careful account of the whole transaction as far as to the execution of the hunchback Another eye witness writes to the AbbA C Bignon a letter printed by Lebrun in his Histoire critique cited above The following circumstance happened to me yesterday evening he says M le Procureur du Roi here who by the way is one of the wisest and cleverest men in the country sent for me at six o clock and had me conducted to the scene of the murder We found there M Grimaut director of the customs whom I knew to be a very upright man and a young attorney named Besson with whom I am not acquainted but who M le Procureur du Roi told me had the power of using the rod as well as M Grimaut We descended into the cellar where the murder had been committed and where there were still traces of blood Each time that M Grimaut and the attorney passed the spot where the murder had been perpetrated the rods they held in their hands began to turn but ceased when they stepped beyond the spot We tried experiments for more than an hour as also with the bill which M le Procureur had brought along with him and they were satisfactory I observed several curious facts in the attorney The rod in his hands was more violently moved than in those of M Grimaut and when I placed one of my fingers in each of his hands whilst the rod turned I felt the most extraordinary throbbings of the arteries in his palms His pulse was at fever heat He sweated profusely and at intervals he was compelled to go into the court to obtain fresh air The Sieur Pauthot Dean of the College of Medicine at Lyons gave his observations to the public as well Some of them are as follows We began at the cellar in which the murder had been committed into this the man with the rod Aymar shrank from entering because he felt violent agitations which overcame him when he used the stick over the place where the corpses of those who had been assassinated had lain On entering the cellar the rod was put in my hands and arranged by the master as most suitable for operation I passed and repassed over the spot where the bodies had been found but it remained immovable and I felt no agitation A lady of rank and merit who was with us took the rod after me she felt it begin to move and was internally agitated Then the owner of the rod resumed it and passing over the same places the stick rotated with such violence that it seemed easier to break than to stop it The peasant then quitted our company to faint away as was his wont after similar experiments I followed him He turned very pale and broke into a profuse perspiration whilst for a quarter of an hour his pulse was violently troubled indeed the faintness was so considerable that they were obliged to dash water in his face and give him water to drink in order to bring him round He then describes experiments made over the bloody bill and others similar which succeeded in the hands of Aymar and the lady but failed when he attempted them himself Pierre Garnier physician of the medical college of Montpellier appointed to that of Lyons has also written an account of what he saw as mentioned above He gives a curious proof of Aymar s powers M le Lieutenant GA C nA C ral having been robbed by one of his lackeys seven or eight months ago and having lost by him twenty five crowns which had been taken out of one of the cabinets behind his library sent for Aymar and asked him to discover the circumstances Aymar went several times round the chamber rod in hand placing one foot on the chairs on the various articles of furniture and on two bureaux which are in the apartment each of which contains several drawers He fixed on the very bureau and the identical drawer out of which the money had been stolen M le Lieutenant GA C nA C ral bade him follow the track of the robber He did so With his rod he went out on a new terrace upon which the cabinet opens thence back into the cabinet and up to the fire then into the library and from thence he went direct up stairs to the lackeys sleeping apartment when the rod guided him to one of the beds and turned over one side of the bed remaining motionless over the other The lackeys then present cried out that the thief had slept on the side indicated by the rod the bed having been shared with another footman who occupied the further side Garnier gives a lengthy account of various experiments he made along with the Lieutenant GA C nA C ral the uncle of the same the AbbA C de saint Remain and M de Puget to detect whether there was imposture in the man But all their attempts failed to discover a trace of deception He gives a report of a verbal examination of Aymar which is interesting The man always replied with candor The report of the extraordinary discovery of murder made by the divining rod at Lyons attracted the attention of Paris and Aymar was ordered up to the capital There however his powers left him The Prince de CondA C submitted him to various tests and he broke down under every one Five holes were dug in the garden In one was secreted gold in another silver in a third silver and gold in the fourth copper and in the fifth stones The rod made no signs in presence of the metals and at last actually began to move over the buried pebbles He was sent to Chantilly to discover the perpetrators of a theft of trout made in the ponds of the park He went round the water rod in hand and it turned at spots where he said the fish had been drawn out Then following the track of the thief it led him to the cottage of one of the keepers but did not move over any of the individuals then in the house The keeper himself was absent but arrived late at night and on hearing what was said he roused Aymar from his bed insisting on having his innocence vindicated The divining rod however pronounced him guilty and the poor fellow took to his heels much upon the principle recommended by Montesquieu a while after Said he If you are accused of having stolen the towers of Notre Dame bolt at once A peasant taken at haphazard from the street was brought to the sorcerer as one suspected The rod turned slightly and Aymar declared that the man did not steal the fish but ate of them A boy was then introduced who was said to be the keeper s son The rod rotated violently at once This was the finishing stroke and Aymar was sent away by the Prince in disgrace It now transpired that the theft of fish had taken place seven years before and the lad was no relation of the keeper but a country boy who had only been in Chantilly eight or ten months M Goyonnot Recorder of the King s Council broke a window in his house and sent for the diviner to whom he related a story of his having been robbed of valuables during the night Aymar indicated the broken window as the means whereby the thief had entered the house and pointed out the window by which he had left it with the booty As no such robbery had been committed Aymar was turned out of the house as an impostor A few similar cases brought him into such disrepute that he was obliged to leave Paris and return to Grenoble Some years after he was made use of by the MarA C chal Montrevel in his cruel pursuit of the Camisards Was Aymar an impostor from first to last or did his powers fail him in Paris and was it only then that he had recourse to fraud Much may be said in favor of either supposition His exposA C at Paris tells heavily against him but need not be regarded as conclusive evidence of imposture throughout his career If he really did possess the powers he claimed it is not to be supposed that these existed in full vigor under all conditions and Paris is a place most unsuitable for testing them built on artificial soil and full of disturbing influences of every description It has been remarked with others who used the rod that their powers languished under excitement and that the faculties had to be in repose the attention to be concentrated on the subject of inquiry or the action nervous magnetic or electrical or what you will was impeded Now Paris visited for the first time by a poor peasant its salons open to him dazzling him with their splendor and the novelty of finding himself in the midst of princes dukes marquises and their families not only may have agitated the countryman to such an extent as to deprive him of his peculiar faculty but may have led him into simulating what he felt had departed from him at the moment when he was under the eyes of the grandees of the Court We have analogous cases in Bleton and Angelique Cottin The former was a hydroscope who fell into convulsions whenever he passed over running water This peculiarity was noticed in him when a child of seven years old When brought to Paris he failed signally to detect the presence of water conveyed underground by pipes and conduits but he pretended to feel the influence of water where there certainly was none Angelique Cottin was a poor girl highly charged with electricity Any one touching her received a violent shock one medical gentleman having seated her on his knee was knocked clean out of his chair by the electric fluid which thus exhibited its sense of propriety But the electric condition of Angelique became feebler as she approached Paris and failed her altogether in the capital I believe that the imagination is the principal motive force in those who use the divining rod but whether it is so solely I am unable to decide The powers of nature are so mysterious and inscrutable that we must be cautious in limiting them under abnormal conditions to the ordinary laws of experience Illustration The manner in which the rod was used by certain persons renders self deception possible The rod is generally of hazel and is forked like a Y the forefingers are placed against the diverging arms of the rod and the elbows are brought back against the side thus the implement is held in front of the operator delicately balanced before the pit of the stomach at a distance of about eight inches Now if the pressure of the balls of the digits be in the least relaxed the stalk of the rod will naturally fall It has been assumed by some that a restoration of the pressure will bring the stem up again pointing towards the operator and a little further pressure will elevate it into a perpendicular position A relaxation of force will again lower it and thus the rotation observed in the rod be maintained I confess myself unable to accomplish this The lowering of the leg of the rod is easy enough but no efforts of mine to produce a revolution on its axis have as yet succeeded The muscles which would contract the fingers upon the arms of the stick pass the shoulder and it is worthy of remark that one of the medical men who witnessed the experiments made on Bleton the hydroscope expressly alludes to a slight rising of the shoulders during the rotation of the divining rod But the manner of using the rod was by no means identical in all cases If in all cases it had simply been balanced between the fingers some probability might be given to the suggestion above made that the rotation was always effected by the involuntary action of the muscles The usual manner of holding the rod however precluded such a possibility The most ordinary use consisted in taking a forked stick in such a manner that the palms were turned upwards and the fingers closed upon the branching arms of the rod Some required the normal position of the rod to be horizontal others elevated the point others again depressed it If the implement were straight it was held in a similar manner but the hands were brought somewhat together so as to produce a slight arc in the rod Some who practised rhabdomancy sustained this species of rod between their thumbs and forefingers or else the thumb and forefingers were closed and the rod rested on their points or again it reposed on the flat of the hand or on the back the hand being held vertically and the rod held in equilibrium A third species of divining rod consisted in a straight staff cut in two one extremity of the one half was hollowed out the other half was sharpened at the end and this end was inserted in the hollow and the pointed stick rotated in the cavity Illustration POSITIONS OF THE HANDS From Lettres qui dA C couvrent l Illusion des Philosophes sur la Baguette Paris sixteen ninety three The way in which Bleton used his rod is thus minutely described He does not grasp it nor warm it in his hands and he does not regard with preference a hazel branch lately cut and full of sap He places horizontally between his forefingers a rod of any kind given to him or picked up in the road of any sort of wood except elder fresh or dry not always forked but sometimes merely bent If it is straight it rises slightly at the extremities by little jerks but does not turn If bent it revolves on its axis with more or less rapidity in more or less time according to the quantity and current of the water I counted from thirty to thirty five revolutions in a minute and afterwards as many as eighty A curious phenomenon is that Bleton is able to make the rod turn between another person s fingers even without seeing it or touching it by approaching his body towards it when his feet stand over a subterranean watercourse It is true however that the motion is much less strong and less durable in other fingers than his own If Bleton stood on his head and placed the rod between his feet though he felt strongly the peculiar sensations produced in him by flowing water yet the rod remained stationary If he were insulated on glass silk or wax the sensations were less vivid and the rotation of the stick ceased But this experiment failed in Paris under circumstances which either proved that Bleton s imagination produced the movement or that his integrity was questionable It is quite possible that in many instances the action of the muscles is purely involuntary and is attributable to the imagination so that the operator deceives himself as well as others This is probably the explanation of the story of Mdlle Olivet a young lady of tender conscience who was a skilful performer with the divining rod but shrank from putting her powers in operation lest she should be indulging in unlawful acts She consulted the PA re Lebrun author of a work already referred to in this paper and he advised her to ask God to withdraw the power from her if the exercise of it was harmful to her spiritual condition She entered into retreat for two days and prayed with fervor Then she made her communion asking God what had been recommended to her at the moment when she received the Host In the afternoon of the same day she made experiment with her rod and found that it would no longer operate The girl had strong faith in it before a faith coupled with fear and as long as that faith was strong in her the rod moved now she believed that the faculty was taken from her and the power ceased with the loss of her faith If the divining rod is put in motion by any other force except the involuntary action of the muscles we must confine its powers to the property of indicating the presence of flowing water There are numerous instances of hydroscopes thus detecting the existence of a spring or of a subterranean watercourse the most remarkably endowed individuals of this description are Jean Jacques Parangue born near Marseilles in seventeen sixty who experienced a horror when near water which no one else perceived He was endowed with the faculty of seeing water through the ground says l AbbA C Sauri who gives his history Jenny Leslie a Scotch girl about the same date claimed similar powers In seventeen ninety Pennet a native of DauphinA C attracted attention in Italy but when carefully tested by scientific men in Padua his attempts to discover buried metals failed at Florence he was detected in an endeavor to find out by night what had been secreted to test his powers on the morrow Vincent Amoretti was an Italian who underwent peculiar sensations when brought in proximity to water coal and salt he was skilful in the use of the rod but made no public exhibition of his powers The rod is still employed I have heard it asserted by Cornish miners but I have never been able to ascertain that such is really the case The mining captains whom I have questioned invariably repudiated all knowledge of its use In Wiltshire however it is still employed for the purpose of detecting water and the following extract from a letter I have just received will show that it is still in vogue on the Continent I believe the use of the divining rod for discovering springs of water has by no means been confined to mediA val times for I was personally acquainted with a lady now deceased who has successfully practised with it in this way She was a very clever and accomplished woman Scotch by birth and education by no means credulous possibly a little imaginative for she wrote not unsuccessfully and of a remarkably open and straightforward disposition Captain C her husband had a large estate in Holstein near Lubeck supporting a considerable population and whether for the wants of the people or for the improvement of the land it now and then happened that an additional well was needed On one of these occasions a man was sent for who made a regular profession of finding water by the divining rod there happened to be a large party staying at the house and the whole company turned out to see the fun The rod gave indications in the usual way and water was ultimately found at the spot missus C utterly sceptical took the rod into her own hands to make experiment believing that she would prove the man an impostor and she said afterwards she was never more frightened in her life than when it began to move on her walking over the spring Several other gentlemen and ladies tried it but it was quite inactive in their hands Well said the host to his wife we shall have no occasion to send for the man again as you are such an adept Some months after this water was wanted in another part of the estate and it occurred to missus C that she would use the rod again After some trials it again gave decided indications and a well was begun and carried down a very considerable depth At last she began to shrink from incurring more expense but the laborers had implicit faith and begged to be allowed to persevere Very soon the water burst up with such force that the men escaped with difficulty and this proved afterwards the most unfailing spring for miles round You will take the above for what it is worth the facts I have given are undoubtedly true whatever conclusions may be drawn from them I do not propose that you should print my narrative but I think in these cases personal testimony even indirect is more useful in forming one s opinion than a hundred old volumes I did not hear it from missus C s own lips but I was sufficiently acquainted with her to form a very tolerable estimate of her character and my wife who has known her intimately from her own childhood was in her younger days often staying with her for months together I remember having been much perplexed by reading a series of experiments made with a pendulous ring over metals by a mister Mayo he ascertained that it oscillated in various directions under peculiar circumstances when suspended by a thread over the ball of the thumb I instituted a series of experiments and was surprised to find the ring vibrate in an unaccountable manner in opposite directions over different metals On consideration I closed my eyes whilst the ring was oscillating over gold and on opening them I found that it had become stationary I got a friend to change the metals whilst I was blindfolded the ring no longer vibrated I was thus enabled to judge of the involuntary action of muscles quite sufficient to have deceived an eminent medical man like mister Mayo and to have perplexed me till I succeeded in solving the mystery twenty four FOOTNOTES twenty three Hos iv twelve twenty four A similar series of experiments was undertaken as I learned afterwards by M Chevreuil in Paris with similar results The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus One of the most picturesque myths of ancient days is that which forms the subject of this article It is thus told by Jacques de Voragine in his Legenda Aurea The seven sleepers were natives of Ephesus The Emperor Decius who persecuted the Christians having come to Ephesus ordered the erection of temples in the city that all might come and sacrifice before him and he commanded that the Christians should be sought out and given their choice either to worship the idols or to die So great was the consternation in the city that the friend denounced his friend the father his son and the son his father Now there were in Ephesus seven Christians Maximian Malchus Marcian Dionysius John Serapion and Constantine by name These refused to sacrifice to the idols and remained in their houses praying and fasting They were accused before Decius and they confessed themselves to be Christians However the emperor gave them a little time to consider what line they would adopt They took advantage of this reprieve to dispense their goods among the poor and then they retired all seven to Mount Celion where they determined to conceal themselves One of their number Malchus in the disguise of a physician went to the town to obtain victuals Decius who had been absent from Ephesus for a little while returned and gave orders for the seven to be sought Malchus having escaped from the town fled full of fear to his comrades and told them of the emperor s fury They were much alarmed and Malchus handed them the loaves he had bought bidding them eat that fortified by the food they might have courage in the time of trial They ate and then as they sat weeping and speaking to one another by the will of God they fell asleep The pagans sought everywhere but could not find them and Decius was greatly irritated at their escape He had their parents brought before him and threatened them with death if they did not reveal the place of concealment but they could only answer that the seven young men had distributed their goods to the poor and that they were quite ignorant as to their whereabouts Decius thinking it possible that they might be hiding in a cavern blocked up the mouth with stones that they might perish of hunger Three hundred and sixty years passed and in the thirtieth year of the reign of Theodosius there broke forth a heresy denying the resurrection of the dead Now it happened that an Ephesian was building a stable on the side of Mount Celion and finding a pile of stones handy he took them for his edifice and thus opened the mouth of the cave Then the seven sleepers awoke and it was to them as if they had slept but a single night They began to ask Malchus what decision Decius had given concerning them He is going to hunt us down so as to force us to sacrifice to the idols was his reply God knows replied Maximian we shall never do that Then exhorting his companions he urged Malchus to go back to the town to buy some more bread and at the same time to obtain fresh information Malchus took five coins and left the cavern On seeing the stones he was filled with astonishment however he went on towards the city but what was his bewilderment on approaching the gate to see over it a cross He went to another gate and there he beheld the same sacred sign and so he observed it over each gate of the city He believed that he was suffering from the effects of a dream Then he entered Ephesus rubbing his eyes and he walked to a baker s shop He heard people using our Lord s name and he was the more perplexed Yesterday no one dared pronounce the name of Jesus and now it is on every one s lips Wonderful I can hardly believe myself to be in Ephesus He asked a passer by the name of the city and on being told it was Ephesus he was thunderstruck Now he entered a baker s shop and laid down his money The baker examining the coin inquired whether he had found a treasure and began to whisper to some others in the shop The youth thinking that he was discovered and that they were about to conduct him to the emperor implored them to let him alone offering to leave loaves and money if he might only be suffered to escape But the shop men seizing him said Whoever you are you have found a treasure show us where it is that we may share it with you and then we will hide you Malchus was too frightened to answer So they put a rope round his neck and drew him through the streets into the market place The news soon spread that the young man had discovered a great treasure and there was presently a vast crowd about him He stoutly protested his innocence No one recognized him and his eyes ranging over the faces which surrounded him could not see one which he had known or which was in the slightest degree familiar to him saint Martin the bishop and Antipater the governor having heard of the excitement ordered the young man to be brought before them along with the bakers The bishop and the governor asked him where he had found the treasure and he replied that he had found none but that the few coins were from his own purse He was next asked whence he came He replied that he was a native of Ephesus if this be Ephesus Send for your relations your parents if they live here ordered the governor They live here certainly replied the youth and he mentioned their names No such names were known in the town Then the governor exclaimed How dare you say that this money belonged to your parents when it dates back three hundred and seventy seven years twenty five and is as old as the beginning of the reign of Decius and it is utterly unlike our modern coinage Do you think to impose on the old men and sages of Ephesus Believe me I shall make you suffer the severities of the law till you show where you made the discovery I implore you cried Malchus in the name of God answer me a few questions and then I will answer yours Where is the Emperor Decius gone to The bishop answered My son there is no emperor of that name he who was thus called died long ago Malchus replied All I hear perplexes me more and more Follow me and I will show you my comrades who fled with me into a cave of Mount Celion only yesterday to escape the cruelty of Decius I will lead you to them The bishop turned to the governor The hand of God is here he said Then they followed and a great crowd after them And Malchus entered first into the cavern to his companions and the bishop after him And there they saw the martyrs seated in the cave with their faces fresh and blooming as roses so all fell down and glorified God The bishop and the governor sent notice to Theodosius and he hurried to Ephesus All the inhabitants met him and conducted him to the cavern As soon as the saints beheld the emperor their faces shone like the sun and the emperor gave thanks unto God and embraced them and said I see you as though I saw the Savior restoring Lazarus Maximian replied Believe us for the faith s sake God has resuscitated us before the great resurrection day in order that you may believe firmly in the resurrection of the dead For as the child is in its mother s womb living and not suffering so have we lived without suffering fast asleep And having thus spoken they bowed their heads and their souls returned to their Maker The emperor rising bent over them and embraced them weeping He gave them orders for golden reliquaries to be made but that night they appeared to him in a dream and said that hitherto they had slept in the earth and that in the earth they desired to sleep on till God should raise them again Such is the beautiful story It seems to have travelled to us from the East Jacobus Sarugiensis a Mesopotamian bishop in the fifth or sixth century is said to have been the first to commit it to writing Gregory of Tours De Glor Mart i nine was perhaps the first to introduce it to Europe Dionysius of Antioch ninth century told the story in Syrian and Photius of Constantinople reproduced it with the remark that Mahomet had adopted it into the Koran Metaphrastus alludes to it as well in the tenth century Eutychius inserted it in his annals of Arabia it is found in the Coptic and the Maronite books and several early historians as Paulus Diaconus Nicephorus c have inserted it in their works A poem on the Seven Sleepers was composed by a trouvA re named Chardri and is mentioned by M Fr Michel in his Rapports Ministre de l Instruction Public a German poem on the same subject of the thirteenth century in nine hundred thirty five verses has been published by M Karajan and the Spanish poet Augustin Morreto composed a drama on it entitled Los Siete Durmientes which is inserted in the nineteenth volume of the rare work Comedias Nuevas Escogidas de los Mejores Ingenios Mahomet has somewhat improved on the story He has made the Sleepers prophesy his coming and he has given them a dog named Kratim or Kratimir which sleeps with them and which is endowed with the gift of prophecy As a special favor this dog is to be one of the ten animals to be admitted into his paradise the others being Jonah s whale Solomon s ant Ishmael s ram Abraham s calf the Queen of Sheba s ass the prophet Salech s camel Moses ox Belkis cuckoo and Mahomet s ass It was perhaps too much for the Seven Sleepers to ask that their bodies should be left to rest in earth In ages when saintly relics were valued above gold and precious stones their request was sure to be shelved and so we find that their remains were conveyed to Marseilles in a large stone sarcophagus which is still exhibited in saint Victor s Church In the MusA um Victorium at Rome is a curious and ancient representation of them in a cement of sulphur and plaster Their names are engraved beside them together with certain attributes Near Constantine and John are two clubs near Maximian a knotty club near Malchus and Martinian two axes near Serapion a burning torch and near Danesius or Dionysius a great nail such as those spoken of by Horace Lib one Od three and saint Paulinus Nat nine or Carm twenty four as having been used for torture In this group of figures the seven are represented as young without beards and indeed in ancient martyrologies they are frequently called boys It has been inferred from this curious plaster representation that the seven may have suffered under Decius A D two hundred fifty and have been buried in the afore mentioned cave whilst the discovery and translation of their relics under Theodosius in four hundred seventy nine may have given rise to the fable And this I think probable enough The story of long sleepers and the number seven connected with it is ancient enough and dates from heathen mythology Like many another ancient myth it was laid hold of by Christian hands and baptized Pliny relates the story of Epimenides the epic poet who when tending his sheep one hot day wearied and oppressed with slumber retreated into a cave where he fell asleep After fifty seven years he awoke and found every thing changed His brother whom he had left a stripling was now a hoary man Epimenides was reckoned one of the seven sages by those who exclude Periander He flourished in the time of Solon After his death at the age of two hundred and eighty nine he was revered as a god and honored especially by the Athenians This story is a version of the older legend of the perpetual sleep of the shepherd Endymion who was thus preserved in unfading youth and beauty by Jupiter According to an Arabic legend saint George thrice rose from his grave and was thrice slain In Scandinavian mythology we have Siegfrid or Sigurd thus resting and awaiting his call to come forth and fight Charlemagne sleeps in the Odenberg in Hess or in the Untersberg near Salzburg seated on his throne with his crown on his head and his sword at his side waiting till the times of Antichrist are fulfilled when he will wake and burst forth to avenge the blood of the saints Ogier the Dane or Olger Dansk will in like manner shake off his slumber and come forth from the dream land of Avallon to avenge the right O that he had shown himself in the Schleswig Holstein war Well do I remember as a child contemplating with wondering awe the great KyffhAuserberg in Thuringia for therein I was told slept Frederic Barbarossa and his six knights A shepherd once penetrated into the heart of the mountain by a cave and discovered therein a hall where sat the emperor at a stone table and his red beard had grown through the slab At the tread of the shepherd Frederic awoke from his slumber and asked Do the ravens still fly over the mountains Sire they do Then we must sleep another hundred years But when his beard has wound itself thrice round the table then will the emperor awake with his knights and rush forth to release Germany from its bondage and exalt it to the first place among the kingdoms of Europe In Switzerland slumber three Tells at Rutli near the VierwaldstAtter see waiting for the hour of their country s direst need A shepherd crept into the cave where they rest The third Tell rose and asked the time Noon replied the shepherd lad The time is not yet come said Tell and lay down again In Scotland beneath the Eilden hills sleeps Thomas of Erceldoune the murdered French who fell in the Sicilian Vespers at Palermo are also slumbering till the time is come when they may wake to avenge themselves When Constantinople fell into the hands of the Turks a priest was celebrating the sacred mysteries at the great silver altar of saint Sophia The celebrant cried to God to protect the sacred host from profanation Then the wall opened and he entered bearing the Blessed Sacrament It closed on him and there he is sleeping with his head bowed before the Body of Our Lord waiting till the Turk is cast out of Constantinople and saint Sophia is released from its profanation God speed the time In Bohemia sleep three miners deep in the heart of the Kuttenberg In North America Rip Van Winkle passed twenty years slumbering in the Katskill mountains In Portugal it is believed that Sebastian the chivalrous young monarch who did his best to ruin his country by his rash invasion of Morocco is sleeping somewhere but he will wake again to be his country s deliverer in the hour of need Olaf Tryggvason is waiting a similar occasion in Norway Even Napoleon Bonaparte is believed among some of the French peasantry to be sleeping on in a like manner saint Hippolytus relates that saint John the Divine is slumbering at Ephesus and Sir John Mandeville relates the circumstances as follows From Pathmos men gone unto Ephesim a fair citee and nyghe to the see And there dyede Seynte Johne and was buryed behynde the highe Awtiere in a toumbe And there is a faire chirche For Christene mene weren wont to holden that place alweyes And in the tombe of Seynt John is noughte but manna that is clept Aungeles mete For his body was translated into Paradys And Turkes holden now alle that place and the citee and the Chirche And all Asie the lesse is yclept Turkye And ye shalle undrestond that Seynt Johne bid make his grave there in his Lyf and leyd himself there inne all quyk And therefore somme men seyn that he dyed noughte but that he resteth there till the Day of Doom And forsoothe there is a gret marveule For men may see there the erthe of the tombe apertly many tymes steren and moven as there weren quykke thinges undre The connection of this legend of saint John with Ephesus may have had something to do with turning the seven martyrs of that city into seven sleepers The annals of Iceland relate that in fourteen oh three a Finn of the name of Fethmingr living in Halogaland in the North of Norway happening to enter a cave fell asleep and woke not for three whole years lying with his bow and arrows at his side untouched by bird or beast There certainly are authentic accounts of persons having slept for an extraordinary length of time but I shall not mention any as I believe the legend we are considering not to have been an exaggeration of facts but a Christianized myth of paganism The fact of the number seven being so prominent in many of the tales seems to lead to this conclusion Barbarossa changes his position every seven years Charlemagne starts in his chair at similar intervals Olger Dansk stamps his iron mace on the floor once every seven years Olaf Redbeard in Sweden uncloses his eyes at precisely the same distances of time I believe that the mythological core of this picturesque legend is the repose of the earth through the seven winter months In the North Frederic and Charlemagne certainly replace Odin The German and Scandinavian still heathen legends represent the heroes as about to issue forth for the defence of Fatherland in the hour of direst need The converted and Christianized tale brings the martyr youths forth in the hour when a heresy is afflicting the Church that they may destroy the heresy by their witness to the truth of the Resurrection If there is something majestic in the heathen myth there are singular grace and beauty in the Christian tale teaching as it does such a glorious doctrine but it is surpassed in delicacy by the modern form which the same myth has assumed a form which is a real transformation leaving the doctrine taught the same It has been made into a romance by Hoffman and is versified by Trinius I may perhaps be allowed to translate with some freedom the poem of the latter In an ancient shaft of Falun Year by year a body lay God preserved as though a treasure Kept unto the waking day Not the turmoil nor the passions Of the busy world o erhead Sounds of war or peace rejoicings Could disturb the placid dead Once a youthful miner whistling Hewed the chamber now his tomb Crash the rocky fragments tumbled Closed him in abysmal gloom Sixty years passed by ere miners Toiling hundred fathoms deep Broke upon the shaft where rested That poor miner in his sleep As the gold grains lie untarnished In the dingy soil and sand Till they gleam and flicker stainless In the digger s sifting hand As the gem in virgin brilliance Rests till ushered into day So uninjured uncorrupted Fresh and fair the body lay And the miners bore it upward Laid it in the yellow sun Up from out the neighboring houses Fast the curious peasants run Who is he with eyes they question Who is he they ask aloud

which had divided Now united them in one FOOTNOTE twenty five This calculation is sadly inaccurate William Tell I suppose that most people regard William Tell the hero of Switzerland as an historical character and visit the scenes made memorable by his exploits with corresponding interest when they undertake the regular Swiss round It is one of the painful duties of the antiquarian to dispel many a popular belief and to probe the groundlessness of many an historical statement The antiquarian is sometimes disposed to ask with Pilate What is truth when he finds historical facts crumbling beneath his touch into mythological fables and he soon learns to doubt and question the most emphatic declarations of and claims to reliability Sir Walter Raleigh in his prison was composing the second volume of his History of the World Leaning on the sill of his window he meditated on the duties of the historian to mankind when suddenly his attention was attracted by a disturbance in the court yard before his cell He saw one man strike another whom he supposed by his dress to be an officer the latter at once drew his sword and ran the former through the body The wounded man felled his adversary with a stick and then sank upon the pavement At this juncture the guard came up and carried off the officer insensible and then the corpse of the man who had been run through Next day Raleigh was visited by an intimate friend to whom he related the circumstances of the quarrel and its issue To his astonishment his friend unhesitatingly declared that the prisoner had mistaken the whole series of incidents which had passed before his eyes The supposed officer was not an officer at all but the servant of a foreign ambassador it was he who had dealt the first blow he had not drawn his sword but the other had snatched it from his side and had run him through the body before any one could interfere whereupon a stranger from among the crowd knocked the murderer down with his stick and some of the foreigners belonging to the ambassador s retinue carried off the corpse The friend of Raleigh added that government had ordered the arrest and immediate trial of the murderer as the man assassinated was one of the principal servants of the Spanish ambassador Excuse me said Raleigh but I cannot have been deceived as you suppose for I was eye witness to the events which took place under my own window and the man fell there on that spot where you see a paving stone standing up above the rest My dear Raleigh replied his friend I was sitting on that stone when the fray took place and I received this slight scratch on my cheek in snatching the sword from the murderer and upon my word of honor you have been deceived upon every particular Sir Walter when alone took up the second volume of his History which was in MS and contemplating it thought If I cannot believe my own eyes how can I be assured of the truth of a tithe of the events which happened ages before I was born and he flung the manuscript into the fire twenty six Now I think that I can show that the story of William Tell is as fabulous as what shall I say any other historical event It is almost too well known to need repetition In the year thirteen oh seven Gessler Vogt of the Emperor Albert of Hapsburg set a hat on a pole as symbol of imperial power and ordered every one who passed by to do obeisance towards it A mountaineer of the name of Tell boldly traversed the space before it without saluting the abhorred symbol By Gessler s command he was at once seized and brought before him As Tell was known to be an expert archer he was ordered by way of punishment to shoot an apple off the head of his own son Finding remonstrance vain he submitted The apple was placed on the child s head Tell bent his bow the arrow sped and apple and arrow fell together to the ground But the Vogt noticed that Tell before shooting had stuck another arrow into his belt and he inquired the reason It was for you replied the sturdy archer Had I shot my child know that it would not have missed your heart This event observe took place in the beginning of the fourteenth century But Saxo Grammaticus a Danish writer of the twelfth century tells the story of a hero of his own country who lived in the tenth century He relates the incident in horrible style as follows Nor ought what follows to be enveloped in silence Toki who had for some time been in the king s service had by his deeds surpassing those of his comrades made enemies of his virtues One day when he had drunk too much he boasted to those who sat at table with him that his skill in archery was such that with the first shot of an arrow he could hit the smallest apple set on the top of a stick at a considerable distance His detractors hearing this lost no time in conveying what he had said to the king Harald Bluetooth But the wickedness of this monarch soon transformed the confidence of the father to the jeopardy of the son for he ordered the dearest pledge of his life to stand in place of the stick from whom if the utterer of the boast did not at his first shot strike down the apple he should with his head pay the penalty of having made an idle boast The command of the king urged the soldier to do this which was so much more than he had undertaken the detracting artifices of the others having taken advantage of words spoken when he was hardly sober As soon as the boy was led forth Toki carefully admonished him to receive the whir of the arrow as calmly as possible with attentive ears and without moving his head lest by a slight motion of the body he should frustrate the experience of his well tried skill He also made him stand with his back towards him lest he should be frightened at the sight of the arrow Then he drew three arrows from his quiver and the very first he shot struck the proposed mark Toki being asked by the king why he had taken so many more arrows out of his quiver when he was to make but one trial with his bow That I might avenge on thee he replied the error of the first by the points of the others lest my innocence might happen to be afflicted and thy injustice go unpunished The same incident is told of Egil brother of the mythical Velundr in the Saga of Thidrik In Norwegian history also it appears with variations again and again It is told of King Olaf the Saint d ten thirty that desiring the conversion of a brave heathen named Eindridi he competed with him in various athletic sports he swam with him wrestled and then shot with him The king dared Eindridi to strike a writing tablet from off his son s head with an arrow Eindridi prepared to attempt the difficult shot The king bade two men bind the eyes of the child and hold the napkin so that he might not move when he heard the whistle of the arrow The king aimed first and the arrow grazed the lad s head Eindridi then prepared to shoot but the mother of the boy interfered and persuaded the king to abandon this dangerous test of skill In this version also Eindridi is prepared to revenge himself on the king should the child be injured But a closer approximation still to the Tell myth is found in the life of Hemingr another Norse archer who was challenged by King Harald Sigurd s son d ten sixty six The story is thus told The island was densely overgrown with wood and the people went into the forest The king took a spear and set it with its point in the soil then he laid an arrow on the string and shot up into the air The arrow turned in the air and came down upon the spear shaft and stood up in it Hemingr took another arrow and shot up his was lost to sight for some while but it came back and pierced the nick of the king s arrow Then the king took a knife and stuck it into an oak he next drew his bow and planted an arrow in the haft of the knife Thereupon Hemingr took his arrows The king stood by him and said They are all inlaid with gold you are a capital workman Hemingr answered They are not my manufacture but are presents He shot and his arrow cleft the haft and the point entered the socket of the blade We must have a keener contest said the king taking an arrow and flushing with anger then he laid the arrow on the string and drew his bow to the farthest so that the horns were nearly brought to meet Away flashed the arrow and pierced a tender twig All said that this was a most astonishing feat of dexterity But Hemingr shot from a greater distance and split a hazel nut All were astonished to see this Then said the king Take a nut and set it on the head of your brother Bjorn and aim at it from precisely the same distance If you miss the mark then your life goes Hemingr answered Sire my life is at your disposal but I will not adventure that shot Then out spake Bjorn Shoot brother rather than die yourself Hemingr said Have you the pluck to stand quite still without shrinking I will do my best said Bjorn Then let the king stand by said Hemingr and let him see whether I touch the nut The king agreed and bade Oddr Ufeigs son stand by Bjorn and see that the shot was fair Hemingr then went to the spot fixed for him by the king and signed himself with the cross saying God be my witness that I had rather die myself than injure my brother Bjorn let all the blame rest on King Harald Then Hemingr flung his spear The spear went straight to the mark and passed between the nut and the crown of the lad who was not in the least injured It flew farther and stopped not till it fell Then the king came up and asked Oddr what he thought about the shot Years after this risk was revenged upon the hard hearted monarch In the battle of Stamfordbridge an arrow from a skilled archer penetrated the windpipe of the king and it is supposed to have sped observes the Saga writer from the bow of Hemingr then in the service of the English monarch The story is related somewhat differently in the Faroe Isles and is told of Geyti Aslak s son The same Harald asks his men if they know who is his match in strength Yes they reply there is a peasant s son in the uplands Geyti son of Aslak who is the strongest of men Forth goes the king and at last rides up to the house of Aslak And where is your youngest son Alas alas he lies under the green sod of Kolrin kirkgarth Come then and show me his corpse old man that I may judge whether he was as stout of limb as men say The father puts the king off with the excuse that among so many dead it would be hard to find his boy So the king rides away over the heath He meets a stately man returning from the chase with a bow over his shoulder And who art thou friend Geyti Aslak s son The dead man in short alive and well The king tells him he has heard of his prowess and is come to match his strength with him So Geyti and the king try a swimming match The king swims well but Geyti swims better and in the end gives the monarch such a ducking that he is borne to his house devoid of sense and motion Harald swallows his anger as he had swallowed the water and bids Geyti shoot a hazel nut from off his brother s head Aslak s son consents and invites the king into the forest to witness his dexterity On the string the shaft he laid And God hath heard his prayer He shot the little nut away Nor hurt the lad a hair Next day the king sends for the skilful bowman List thee Geyti Aslak s son And truly tell to me Wherefore hadst thou arrows twain In the wood yestreen with thee The bowman replies Therefore had I arrows twain Yestreen in the wood with me Had I but hurt my brother dear The other had piercA C d thee A very similar tale is told also in the celebrated Malleus Maleficarum of a man named Puncher with this difference that a coin is placed on the lad s head instead of an apple or a nut The person who had dared Puncher to the test of skill inquires the use of the second arrow in his belt and receives the usual answer that if the first arrow had missed the coin the second would have transfixed a certain heart which was destitute of natural feeling We have moreover our English version of the same story in the venerable ballad of William of Cloudsley The Finn ethnologist CastrA C n obtained the following tale in the Finnish village of Uhtuwa A fight took place between some freebooters and the inhabitants of the village of AlajAwi The robbers plundered every house and carried off amongst their captives an old man As they proceeded with their spoils along the strand of the lake a lad of twelve years old appeared from among the reeds on the opposite bank armed with a bow and amply provided with arrows he threatened to shoot down the captors unless the old man his father were restored to him The robbers mockingly replied that the aged man would be given to him if he could shoot an apple off his head The boy accepted the challenge and on successfully accomplishing it the surrender of the venerable captive was made Farid Uddin A ttar was a Persian dealer in perfumes born in the year eleven nineteen He one day was so impressed with the sight of a dervish that he sold his possessions and followed righteousness He composed the poem Mantic UttaA r or the language of birds Observe the Persian A ttar lived at the same time as the Danish Saxo and long before the birth of Tell Curiously enough we find a trace of the Tell myth in the pages of his poem According to him however the king shoots the apple from the head of a beloved page and the lad dies from sheer fright though the arrow does not even graze his skin The coincidence of finding so many versions of the same story scattered through countries as remote as Persia and Iceland Switzerland and Denmark proves I think that it can in no way be regarded as history but is rather one of the numerous household myths common to the whole stock of Aryan nations Probably some one more acquainted with Sanskrit literature than myself and with better access to its unpublished stores of fable and legend will some day light on an early Indian tale corresponding to that so prevalent among other branches of the same family The coincidence of the Tell myth being discovered among the Finns is attributable to Russian or Swedish influence I do not regard it as a primeval Turanian but as an Aryan story which like an erratic block is found deposited on foreign soil far from the mountain whence it was torn German mythologists I suppose consider the myth to represent the manifestation of some natural phenomena and the individuals of the story to be impersonifications of natural forces Most primeval stories were thus constructed and their origin is traceable enough In Thorn rose for instance who can fail to see the earth goddess represented by the sleeping beauty in her long winter slumber only returning to life when kissed by the golden haired sun god PhA bus or Baldur But the Tell myth has not its signification thus painted on the surface and those who suppose Gessler or Harald to be the power of evil and darkness the bold archer to be the storm cloud with his arrow of lightning and his iris bow bent against the sun which is resting like a coin or a golden apple on the edge of the horizon are over straining their theories and exacting too much from our credulity In these pages and elsewhere I have shown how some of the ancient myths related by the whole Aryan family of nations are reducible to allegorical explanations of certain well known natural phenomena but I must protest against the manner in which our German friends fasten rapaciously upon every atom of history sacred and profane and demonstrate all heroes to represent the sun all villains to be the demons of night or winter all sticks and spears and arrows to be the lightning all cows and sheep and dragons and swans to be clouds In a work on the superstition of Werewolves I have entered into this subject with some fulness and am quite prepared to admit the premises upon which mythologists construct their theories at the same time I am not disposed to run to the extravagant lengths reached by some of the most enthusiastic German scholars A wholesome warning to these gentlemen was given some years ago by an ingenious French ecclesiastic who wrote the following argument to prove that Napoleon Bonaparte was a mythological character Archbishop Whately s Historic Doubts was grounded on a totally different line of argument I subjoin the other as a curiosity and as a caution Napoleon is says the writer an impersonification of the sun one Between the name Napoleon and Apollo or Apoleon the god of the sun there is but a trifling difference indeed the seeming difference is lessened if we take the spelling of his name from the column of the Place VendA me where it stands NA C apoleA cubed But this syllable Ne prefixed to the name of the sun god is of importance like the rest of the name it is of Greek origin and is Ione twoI or Ione twoI I a particle of affirmation as though indicating Napoleon as the very true Apollo or sun His other name Bonaparte makes this apparent connection between the French hero and the luminary of the firmament conclusively certain The day has its two parts the good and luminous portion and that which is bad and dark To the sun belongs the good part to the moon and stars belongs the bad portion It is therefore natural that Apollo or NA C ApoleA cubedn should receive the surname of Bonaparte two Apollo was born in Delos a Mediterranean island Napoleon in Corsica an island in the same sea According to Pausanias Apollo was an Egyptian deity and in the mythological history of the fabulous Napoleon we find the hero in Egypt regarded by the inhabitants with veneration and receiving their homage three The mother of Napoleon was said to be Letitia which signifies joy and is an impersonification of the dawn of light dispensing joy and gladness to all creation Letitia is no other than the break of day which in a manner brings the sun into the world and with rosy fingers opes the gates of Day It is significant that the Greek name for the mother of Apollo was Leto From this the Romans made the name Latona which they gave to his mother But LA to is the unused form of the verb lA tor and signified to inspire joy it is from this unused form that the substantive Letitia is derived The identity then of the mother of Napoleon with the Greek Leto and the Latin Latona is established conclusively four According to the popular story this son of Letitia had three sisters and was it not the same with the Greek deity who had the three Graces five The modern Gallic Apollo had four brothers It is impossible not to discern here the anthropomorphosis of the four seasons But it will be objected the seasons should be females Here the French language interposes for in French the seasons are masculine with the exception of autumn upon the gender of which grammarians are undecided whilst Autumnus in Latin is not more feminine than the other seasons This difficulty is therefore trifling and what follows removes all shadow of doubt Of the four brothers of Napoleon three are said to have been kings and these of course are Spring reigning over the flowers Summer reigning over the harvest Autumn holding sway over the fruits And as these three seasons owe all to the powerful influence of the Sun we are told in the popular myth that the three brothers of Napoleon drew their authority from him and received from him their kingdoms But if it be added that of the four brothers of Napoleon one was not a king that was because he is the impersonification of Winter which has no reign over anything If however it be asserted in contradiction that the winter has an empire he will be given the principality over snows and frosts which in the dreary season of the year whiten the face of the earth Well the fourth brother of Napoleon is thus invested by popular tradition commonly called history with a vain principality accorded to him in the decline of the power of Napoleon The principality was that of Canino a name derived from cani or the whitened hairs of a frozen old age true emblem of winter To the eyes of poets the forests covering the hills are their hair and when winter frosts them they represent the snowy locks of a decrepit nature in the old age of the year Cum gelidus crescit canis in montibus humor Consequently the Prince of Canino is an impersonification of winter winter whose reign begins when the kingdoms of the three fine seasons are passed from them and when the sun is driven from his power by the children of the North as the poets call the boreal winds This is the origin of the fabulous invasion of France by the allied armies of the North The story relates that these invaders the northern gales banished the many colored flag and replaced it by a white standard This too is a graceful but at the same time purely fabulous account of the Northern winds driving all the brilliant colors from the face of the soil to replace them by the snowy sheet six Napoleon is said to have had two wives It is well known that the classic fable gave two also to Apollo These two were the moon and the earth Plutarch asserts that the Greeks gave the moon to Apollo for wife whilst the Egyptians attributed to him the earth By the moon he had no posterity but by the other he had one son only the little Horus This is an Egyptian allegory representing the fruits of agriculture produced by the earth fertilized by the Sun The pretended son of the fabulous Napoleon is said to have been born on the twentieth of March the season of the spring equinox when agriculture is assuming its greatest period of activity seven Napoleon is said to have released France from the devastating scourge which terrorized over the country the hydra of the revolution as it was popularly called Who cannot see in this a Gallic version of the Greek legend of Apollo releasing Hellas from the terrible Python The very name revolution derived from the Latin verb revolvo is indicative of the coils of a serpent like the Python eight The famous hero of the nineteenth century had it is asserted twelve Marshals at the head of his armies and four who were stationary and inactive The twelve first as may be seen at once are the signs of the zodiac marching under the orders of the sun Napoleon and each commanding a division of the innumerable host of stars which are parted into twelve portions corresponding to the twelve signs As for the four stationary officers immovable in the midst of general motion they are the cardinal points nine It is currently reported that the chief of these brilliant armies after having gloriously traversed the Southern kingdoms penetrated North and was there unable to maintain his sway This too represents the course of the Sun which assumes its greatest power in the South but after the spring equinox seeks to reach the North and after a three months march towards the boreal regions is driven back upon his traces following the sign of Cancer a sign given to represent the retrogression of the sun in that portion of the sphere It is on this that the story of the march of Napoleon towards Moscow and his humbling retreat is founded ten Finally the sun rises in the East and sets in the Western sea The poets picture him rising out of the waters in the East and setting in the ocean after his twelve hours reign in the sky Such is the history of Napoleon coming from his Mediterranean isle holding the reins of government for twelve years and finally disappearing in the mysterious regions of the great Atlantic To those who see in Samson the image of the sun the correlative of the classic Hercules this clever skit of the accomplished French AbbA C may prove of value as a caution FOOTNOTE twenty six This anecdote is taken from the Journal de Paris May seventeen eighty seven but whence did the Journal obtain it The Dog Gellert Having demolished William Tell I proceed to the destruction of another article of popular belief Who that has visited Snowdon has not seen the grave of Llewellyn s faithful hound Gellert and been told by the guide the touching story of the death of the noble animal How can we doubt the facts seeing that the place Beth Gellert is named after the dog and that the grave is still visible But unfortunately for the truth of the legend its pedigree can be traced with the utmost precision The story is as follows The Welsh Prince Llewellyn had a noble deerhound Gellert whom he trusted to watch the cradle of his baby son whilst he himself was absent One day on his return to his intense horror he beheld the cradle empty and upset the clothes dabbled with blood and Gellert s mouth dripping with gore Concluding hastily that the hound had proved unfaithful had fallen on the child and devoured it in a paroxysm of rage the prince drew his sword and slew the dog Next instant the cry of the babe from behind the cradle showed him that the child was uninjured and on looking farther Llewellyn discovered the body of a huge wolf which had entered the house to seize and devour the child but which had been kept off and killed by the brave dog Gellert In his self reproach and grief the prince erected a stately monument to Gellert and called the place where he was buried after the poor hound s name Now I find in Russia precisely the same story told with just the same appearance of truth of a Czar Piras In Germany it appears with considerable variations A man determines on slaying his old dog Sultan and consults with his wife how this is to be effected Sultan overhears the conversation and complains bitterly to the wolf who suggests an ingenious plan by which the master may be induced to spare his dog Next day when the man is going to his work the wolf undertakes to carry off the child from its cradle Sultan is to attack him and rescue the infant The plan succeeds admirably and the dog spends his remaining years in comfort Grimm K M forty eight But there is a story in closer conformity to that of Gellert among the French collections of fabliaux made by Le Grand d Aussy and EdA C lA C stand du MA C ril It became popular through the Gesta Romanorum a collection of tales made by the monks for harmless reading in the fourteenth century In the Gesta the tale is told as follows Folliculus a knight was fond of hunting and tournaments He had an only son for whom three nurses were provided Next to this child he loved his falcon and his greyhound It happened one day that he was called to a tournament whither his wife and domestics went also leaving the child in the cradle the greyhound lying by him and the falcon on his perch A serpent that inhabited a hole near the castle taking advantage of the profound silence that reigned crept from his habitation and advanced towards the cradle to devour the child The falcon perceiving the danger fluttered with his wings till he awoke the dog who instantly attacked the invader and after a fierce conflict in which he was sorely wounded killed him He then lay down on the ground to lick and heal his wounds When the nurses returned they found the cradle overturned the child thrown out and the ground covered with blood as was also the dog who they immediately concluded had killed the child Terrified at the idea of meeting the anger of the parents they determined to escape but in their flight fell in with their mistress to whom they were compelled to relate the supposed murder of the child by the greyhound The knight soon arrived to hear the sad story and maddened with fury rushed forward to the spot The poor wounded and faithful animal made an effort to rise and welcome his master with his accustomed fondness but the enraged knight received him on the point of his sword and he fell lifeless to the ground On examination of the cradle the infant was found alive and unhurt with the dead serpent lying by him The knight now perceived what had happened lamented bitterly over his faithful dog and blamed himself for having too hastily depended on the words of his wife Abandoning the profession of arms he broke his lance in pieces and vowed a pilgrimage to the Holy Land where he spent the rest of his days in peace The monkish hit at the wife is amusing and might have been supposed to have originated with those determined misogynists as the gallant Welshmen lay all the blame on the man But the good compilers of the Gesta wrote little of their own except moral applications of the tales they relate and the story of Folliculus and his dog like many others in their collection is drawn from a foreign source It occurs in the Seven Wise Masters and in the Calumnia Novercalis as well so that it must have been popular throughout mediA val Europe Now the tales of the Seven Wise Masters are translations from a Hebrew work the Kalilah and Dimnah of Rabbi Joel composed about A D twelve fifty or from Simeon Seth s Greek Kylile and Dimne written in ten eighty These Greek and Hebrew works were derived from kindred sources That of Rabbi Joel was a translation from an Arabic version made by Nasr Allah in the twelfth century whilst Simeon Seth s was a translation of the Persian Kalilah and Dimnah But the Persian Kalilah and Dimnah was not either an original work it was in turn a translation from the Sanskrit Pantschatantra made about A D five hundred forty In this ancient Indian book the story runs as follows A Brahmin named Devasaman had a wife who gave birth to a son and also to an ichneumon She loved both her children dearly giving them alike the breast and anointing them alike with salves But she feared the ichneumon might not love his brother One day having laid her boy in bed she took up the water jar and said to her husband Hear me master I am going to the tank to fetch water Whilst I am absent watch the boy lest he gets injured by the ichneumon After she had left the house the Brahmin went forth begging leaving the house empty In crept a black snake and attempted to bite the child but the ichneumon rushed at it and tore it in pieces Then proud of its achievement it sallied forth all bloody to meet its mother She seeing the creature stained with blood concluded with feminine precipitance that it had fallen on the baby and killed it and she flung her water jar at it and slew it Only on her return home did she ascertain her mistake The same story is also told in the Hitopadesa iv thirteen but the animal is an otter not an ichneumon In the Arabic version a weasel takes the place of the ichneumon The Buddhist missionaries carried the story into Mongolia and in the Mongolian Uligerun which is a translation of the Tibetian Dsanghen the story reappears with the pole cat as the brave and suffering defender of the child Stanislaus Julien the great Chinese scholar has discovered the same tale in the Chinese work entitled The Forest of Pearls from the Garden of the Law This work dates from six hundred sixty eight and in it the creature is an ichneumon In the Persian Sindibad nAcmeh is the same tale but the faithful animal is a cat In Sandabar and Syntipas it has become a dog Through the influence of Sandabar on the Hebrew translation of the Kalilah and Dimnah the ichneumon is also replaced by a dog Such is the history of the Gellert legend it is an introduction into Europe from India every step of its transmission being clearly demonstrable From the Gesta Romanorum it passed into a popular tale throughout Europe and in different countries it was like the Tell myth localized and individualized Many a Welsh story such as those contained in the Mabinogion are as easily traced to an Eastern origin But every story has its root The root of the Gellert tale is this A man forms an alliance of friendship with a beast or bird The dumb animal renders him a signal service He misunderstands the act and kills his preserver We have tracked this myth under the Gellert form from India to Wales but under another form it is the property of the whole Aryan family and forms a portion of the traditional lore of all nations sprung from that stock Thence arose the classic fable of the peasant who as he slept was bitten by a fly He awoke and in a rage killed the insect When too late he observed that the little creature had aroused him that he might avoid a snake which lay coiled up near his pillow In the Anvar i Suhaili is the following kindred tale A king had a falcon One day whilst hunting he filled a goblet with water dropping from a rock As he put the vessel to his lips his falcon dashed upon it and upset it with its wings The king in a fury slew the bird and then discovered that the water dripped from the jaws of a serpent of the most poisonous description This story with some variations occurs in Asop Alian and Apthonius In the Greek fable a peasant liberates an eagle from the clutches of a dragon The dragon spirts poison into the water which the peasant is about to drink without observing what the monster had done The grateful eagle upsets the goblet with his wings The story appears in Egypt under a whimsical form A Wali once smashed a pot full of herbs which a cook had prepared The exasperated cook thrashed the well intentioned but unfortunate Wali within an inch of his life and when he returned exhausted with his efforts at belaboring the man to examine the broken pot he discovered amongst the herbs a poisonous snake How many brothers sisters uncles aunts and cousins of all degrees a little story has And how few of the tales we listen to can lay any claim to originality There is scarcely a story which I hear which I cannot connect with some family of myths and whose pedigree I cannot ascertain with more or less precision Shakespeare drew the plots of his plays from Boccaccio or Straparola but these Italians did not invent the tales they lent to the English dramatist King Lear does not originate with Geofry of Monmouth but comes from early Indian stores of fable whence also are derived the Merchant of Venice and the pound of flesh ay and the very incident of the three caskets But who would credit it were it not proved by conclusive facts that Johnny Sands is the inheritance of the whole Aryan family of nations and that Peeping Tom of Coventry peeped in India and on the Tartar steppes ages before Lady Godiva was born If you listen to Traviata at the opera you have set before you a tale which has lasted for centuries and which was perhaps born in India If you read in classic fable of Orpheus charming woods and meadows beasts and birds with his magic lyre you remember to have seen the same fable related in the Kalewala of the Finnish Wainomainen and in the Kaleopoeg of the Esthonian Kalewa If you take up English history and read of William the Conqueror slipping as he landed on British soil and kissing the earth saying he had come to greet and claim his own you remember that the same story is told of Napoleon in Egypt of King Olaf Harold s son in Norway and in classic history of Junius Brutus on his return from the oracle A little while ago I cut out of a Sussex newspaper a story purporting to be the relation of a fact which had taken place at a fixed date in Lewes This was the story A tyrannical husband locked the door against his wife who was out having tea with a neighbor gossiping and scandal mongering when she applied for admittance he pretended not to know her She threatened to jump into the well unless he opened the door The man not supposing that she would carry her threat into execution declined alleging that he was in bed and the night was chilly besides which he entirely disclaimed all acquaintance with the lady who claimed admittance The wife then flung a log into a well and secreted herself behind the door The man hearing the splash fancied that his good lady was really in the deeps and forth he darted in his nocturnal costume which was of the lightest to ascertain whether his deliverance was complete At once the lady darted into the house locked the door and on the husband pleading for admittance she declared most solemnly from the window that she did not know him Now this story I can positively assert unless the events of this world move in a circle did not happen in Lewes or any other Sussex town It was told in the Gesta Romanorum six hundred years ago and it was told may be as many hundred years before in India for it is still to be found in Sanskrit collections of tales Tailed Men I well remember having it impressed upon me by a Devonshire nurse as a little child that all Cornishmen were born with tails and it was long before I could overcome the prejudice thus early implanted in my breast against my Cornubian neighbors I looked upon those who dwelt across the Tamar as uncanny as being scarcely to be classed with Christian people and certainly not to be freely associated with by tailless Devonians I think my eyes were first opened to the fact that I had been deceived by a worthy bookseller of L with whom I had contracted a warm friendship he having at sundry times contributed pictures to my scrapbook I remember one day resolving to broach the delicate subject with my tailed friend whom I liked notwithstanding his caudal appendage mister X is it true that you are a Cornishman Yes my little man born and bred in the West country I like you very much but have you really got a tail When the bookseller had recovered from the astonishment which I had produced by my question he stoutly repudiated the charge But you are a Cornishman To be sure I am And all Cornishmen have tails I believe I satisfied my own mind that the good man had sat his off and my nurse assured me that such was the case with those of sedentary habits It is curious that Devonshire superstition should attribute the tail to Cornishmen for it was asserted of certain men of Kent in olden times and was referred to Divine vengeance upon them for having insulted saint Thomas A Becket if we may believe Polydore Vergil There were some he says to whom it seemed that the king s secret wish was that Thomas should be got rid of He indeed as one accounted to be an enemy of the king s person was already regarded with so little respect nay was treated with so much contempt that when he came to Strood which village is situated on the Medway the river that washes Rochester the inhabitants of the place being eager to show some mark of contumely to the prelate in his disgrace did not scruple to cut off the tail of the horse on which he was riding but by this profane and inhospitable act they covered themselves with eternal reproach for it so happened after this by the will of God that all the offspring born from the men who had done this thing were born with tails like brute animals But this mark of infamy which formerly was everywhere notorious has disappeared with the extinction of the race whose fathers perpetrated this deed John Bale the zealous reformer and Bishop of Ossory in Edward VI s time refers to this story and also mentions a variation of the scene and cause of this ignoble punishment He writes quoting his authorities John Capgrave and Alexander of Esseby sayth that for castynge of fyshe tayles at thys Augustyne Dorsettshyre men had tayles ever after But Polydorus applieth it unto Kentish men at Stroud by Rochester for cuttinge off Thomas Becket s horse s tail Thus hath England in all other land a perpetual infamy of tayles by theye wrytten legendes of lyes yet can they not well tell where to bestowe them truely Bale a fierce and unsparing reformer and one who stinted not hard words applying to the inventors of these legends an epithet more strong than elegant says In the legends of their sanctified sorcerers they have diffamed the English posterity with tails as has been showed afore That an Englyshman now cannot travayle in another land by way of marchandyse or any other honest occupyinge but it is most contumeliously thrown in his tethe that all Englyshmen have tails That uncomely note and report have the nation gotten without recover by these laisy and idle lubbers the monkes and the priestes which could find no matters to advance their canonized gains by or their saintes as they call them but manifest lies and knaveries twenty seven Andrew Marvel also makes mention of this strange judgment in his Loyal Scot But who considers right will find indeed Tis Holy Island parts us not the Tweed Nothing but clergy could us two seclude No Scotch was ever like a bishop s feud All Litanys in this have wanted faith There s no Deliver us from a Bishop s wrath Never shall Calvin pardoned be for sales Never for Burnet s sake the Lauderdales For Becket s sake Kent always shall have tails It may be remembered that Lord Monboddo a Scotch judge of last century and a philosopher of some repute though of great eccentricity stoutly maintained the theory that man ought to have a tail that the tail is a desideratum and that the abrupt termination of the spine without caudal elongation is a sad blemish in the origination of man The tail the point in which man is inferior to the brute what a delicate index of the mind it is how it expresses the passions of love and hate how nicely it gives token of the feelings of joy or fear which animate the soul But Lord Monboddo did not consider that what the tail is to the brute that the eye is to man the lack of one member is supplied by the other I can tell a proud man by his eye just as truly as if he stalked past one with erect tail and anger is as plainly depicted in the human eye as in the bottle brush tail of a cat I know a sneak by his cowering glance though he has not a tail between his legs and pleasure is evident in the laughing eye without there being any necessity for a wagging brush to express it doctor Johnson paid a visit to the judge and knocked on the head his theory that men ought to have tails and actually were born with them occasionally for said he Of a standing fact sir there ought to be no controversy if there are men with tails catch a homo caudatus And It is a pity to see Lord Monboddo publish such notions as he has done a man of sense and of so much elegant learning There would be little in a fool doing it we should only laugh but when a wise man does it we are sorry Other people have strange notions but they conceal them If they have tails they hide them but Monboddo is as jealous of his tail as a squirrel And yet Johnson seems to have been tickled with the idea and to have been amused with the notion of an appendage like a tail being regarded as the complement of human perfection It may be remembered how Johnson made the acquaintance of the young Laird of colonel during his Highland tour and how pleased he was with him colonel says he is a noble animal He is as complete an islander as the mind can figure He is a farmer a sailor a hunter a fisher he will run you down a dog if any man has a tail it is colonel And notwithstanding all his aversion to puns the great Doctor was fain to yield to human weakness on one occasion under the influence of the mirth which Monboddo s name seems to have excited Johnson writes to missus Thrale of a party he had met one night which he thus enumerates There were Smelt and the Bishop of saint Asaph who comes to every place and Sir Joshua and Lord Monboddo and ladies out of tale There is a Polish story of a witch who made a girdle of human skin and laid it across the threshold of a door where a marriage feast was being held On the bridal pair stepping across the girdle they were transformed into wolves Three years after the witch sought them out and cast over them dresses of fur with the hair turned outward whereupon they recovered their human forms but unfortunately the dress cast over the bridegroom was too scanty and did not extend over his tail so that when he was restored to his former condition he retained his lupine caudal appendage and this became hereditary in his family so that all Poles with tails are lineal descendants of the ancestor to whom this little misfortune happened John Struys a Dutch traveller who visited the Isle of Formosa in sixteen seventy seven gives a curious story which is worth transcribing Before I visited this island he writes I had often heard tell that there were men who had long tails like brute beasts but I had never been able to believe it and I regarded it as a thing so alien to our nature that I should now have difficulty in accepting it if my own senses had not removed from me every pretence for doubting the fact by the following strange adventure The inhabitants of Formosa being used to see us were in the habit of receiving us on terms which left nothing to apprehend on either side so that although mere foreigners we always believed ourselves in safety and had grown familiar enough to ramble at large without an escort when grave experience taught us that in so doing we were hazarding too much As some of our party were one day taking a stroll one of them had occasion to withdraw about a stone s throw from the rest who being at the moment engaged in an eager conversation proceeded without heeding the disappearance of their companion After a while however his absence was observed and the party paused thinking he would rejoin them They waited some time but at last tired of the delay they returned in the direction of the spot where they remembered to have seen him last Arriving there they were horrified to find his mangled body lying on the ground though the nature of the lacerations showed that he had not had to suffer long ere death released him Whilst some remained to watch the dead body others went off in search of the murderer and these had not gone far when they came upon a man of peculiar appearance who finding himself enclosed by the exploring party so as to make escape from them impossible began to foam with rage and by cries and wild gesticulations to intimate that he would make any one repent the attempt who should venture to meddle with him The fierceness of his desperation for a time kept our people at bay but as his fury gradually subsided they gathered more closely round him and at length seized him He then soon made them understand that it was he who had killed their comrade but they could not learn from him any cause for this conduct As the crime was so atrocious and if allowed to pass with impunity might entail even more serious consequences it was determined to burn the man He was tied up to a stake where he was kept for some hours before the time of execution arrived It was then that I beheld what I had never thought to see He had a tail more than a foot long covered with red hair and very like that of a cow When he saw the surprise that this discovery created among the European spectators he informed us that his tail was the effect of climate for that all the inhabitants of the southern side of the island where they then were were provided with like appendages twenty eight After Struys Hornemann reported that between the Gulf of Benin and Abyssinia were tailed anthropophagi named by the natives Niam niams and in eighteen forty nine M Descouret on his return from Mecca affirmed that such was a common report and added that they had long arms low and narrow foreheads long and erect ears and slim legs mister Harrison in his Highlands of Ethiopia alludes to the common belief among the Abyssinians in a pygmy race of this nature MM Arnault and VayssiA re travellers in the same country in eighteen fifty brought the subject before the Academy of Sciences In eighteen fifty one M de Castelnau gave additional details relative to an expedition against these tailed men The Niam niams he says were sleeping in the sun the Haoussas approached and falling on them massacred them to the last man They had all of them tails forty centimetres long and from two to three in diameter This organ is smooth Among the corpses were those of several women who were deformed in the same manner In all other particulars the men were precisely like all other negroes They are of a deep black their teeth are polished their bodies not tattooed They are armed with clubs and javelins in war they utter piercing cries They cultivate rice maize and other grain They are fine looking men and their hair is not frizzled M d Abbadie another Abyssinian traveller writing in eighteen fifty two gives the following account from the lips of an Abyssinian priest At the distance of fifteen days journey south of Herrar is a place where all the men have tails the length of a palm covered with hair and situated at the extremity of the spine The females of that country are very beautiful and are tailless I have seen some fifteen of these people at Besberah and I am positive that the tail is natural It will be observed that there is a discrepancy between the accounts of M de Castelnau and M d Abbadie The former accords tails to the ladies whilst the latter denies it According to the former the tail is smooth according to the latter it is covered with hair doctor Wolf has improved on this in his Travels and Adventures vol ii eighteen sixty one There are men and women in Abyssinia with tails like dogs and horses Wolf heard also from a great many Abyssinians and Armenians and Wolf is convinced of the truth of it that there are near Narea in Abyssinia people men and women with large tails with which they are able to knock down a horse and there are also such people near China And in a note In the College of Surgeons at Dublin may still be seen a human skeleton with a tail seven inches long There are many known instances of this elongation of the caudal vertebra as in the Poonangs in Borneo But the most interesting and circumstantial account of the Niam niams is that given by doctor Hubsch physician to the hospitals of Constantinople It was in eighteen fifty two says he that I saw for the first time a tailed negress I was struck with this phenomenon and I questioned her master a slave dealer I learned from him that there exists a tribe called Niam niam occupying the interior of Africa All the members of this tribe bear the caudal appendage and as Oriental imagination is given to exaggeration I was assured that the tails sometimes attained the length of two feet That which I observed was smooth and hairless It was about two inches long and terminated in a point This woman was as black as ebony her hair was frizzled her teeth white large and planted in sockets which inclined considerably outward her four canine teeth were filed her eyes bloodshot She ate meat raw her clothes fidgeted her her intellect was on a par with that of others of her condition Her master had been unable during six months to sell her notwithstanding the low figure at which he would have disposed of her the abhorrence with which she was regarded was not attributed to her tail but to the partiality which she was unable to conceal for human flesh Her tribe fed on the flesh of the prisoners taken from the neighboring tribes with whom they were constantly at war As soon as one of the tribe dies his relations instead of burying him cut him up and regale themselves upon his remains consequently there are no cemeteries in this land They do not all of them lead a wandering life but many of them construct hovels of the branches of trees They make for themselves weapons of war and of agriculture they cultivate maize and wheat and keep cattle The Niam niams have a language of their own of an entirely primitive character though containing an infusion of Arabic words They live in a state of complete nudity and seek only to satisfy their brute appetites There is among them an utter disregard for morality incest and adultery being common The strongest among them becomes the chief of the tribe and it is he who apportions the shares of the booty obtained in war It is hard to say whether they have any religion but in all probability they have none as they readily adopt any one which they are taught It is difficult to tame them altogether their instinct impelling them constantly to seek for human flesh and instances are related of slaves who have massacred and eaten the children confided to their charge I have seen a man of the same race who had a tail an inch and a half long covered with a few hairs He appeared to be thirty five years old he was robust well built of an ebon blackness and had the same peculiar formation of jaw noticed above that is to say the tooth sockets were inclined outwards Their four canine teeth are filed down to diminish their power of mastication I know also at Constantinople the son of a physician aged two years who was born with a tail an inch long he belonged to the white Caucasian race One of his grandfathers possessed the same appendage This phenomenon is regarded generally in the East as a sign of great brute force About ten years ago a newspaper paragraph recorded the birth of a boy at Newcastle on Tyne provided with a tail about an inch and a quarter long It was asserted that the child when sucking wagged this stump as token of pleasure Yet notwithstanding all this testimony in favor of tailed men and women it is simply a matter of impossibility for a human being to have a tail for the spinal vertebrA in man do not admit of elongation as in many animals for the spine terminates in the os sacrum a large and expanded bone of peculiar character entirely precluding all possibility of production to the spine as in caudate animals FOOTNOTES twenty seven Actes of English Votaries twenty eight Voyages de Jean Struys An sixteen fifty Antichrist and Pope Joan From the earliest ages of the Church the advent of the Man of Sin has been looked forward to with terror and the passages of Scripture relating to him have been studied with solemn awe lest that day of wrath should come upon the Church unawares As events in the world s history took place which seemed to be indications of the approach of Antichrist a great horror fell upon men s minds and their imaginations conjured up myths which flew from mouth to mouth and which were implicitly believed Before speaking of these strange tales which produced such an effect on the minds of men in the middle ages it will be well briefly to examine the opinions of divines of the early ages on the passages of Scripture connected with the coming of the last great persecutor of the Church Antichrist was believed by most ancient writers to be destined to arise out of the tribe of Dan a belief founded on the prediction of Jacob Dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path conf Jeremiah viii sixteen and on the exclamation of the dying patriarch when looking on his son Dan I have waited for Thy Salvation O Lord as though the long suffering of God had borne long with that tribe but in vain and it was to be extinguished without hope This indeed is implied in the sealing of the servants of God in their foreheads Revelation vii when twelve thousand out of every tribe except Dan were seen by saint John to receive the seal of adoption whilst of the tribe of Dan not one was sealed as though it to a man had apostatized Opinions as to the nature of Antichrist were divided Some held that he was to be a devil in phantom body and of this number was Hippolytus Others again believed that he would be an incarnate demon true man and true devil in fearful and diabolical parody of the Incarnation of our Lord A third view was that he would be merely a desperately wicked man acting upon diabolical inspirations just as the saints act upon divine inspirations saint John Damascene expressly asserts that he will not be an incarnate demon but a devilish man for he says Not as Christ assumed humanity so will the devil become human but the Man will receive all the inspiration of Satan and will suffer the devil to take up his abode within him In this manner Antichrist could have many forerunners and so saint Jerome and saint Augustine saw an Antichrist in Nero not the Antichrist but one of those of whom the Apostle speaks Even now are there many Antichrists Thus also every enemy of the faith such as Diocletian Julian and Mahomet has been regarded as a precursor of the Arch persecutor who was expected to sum up in himself the cruelty of a Nero or Diocletian the show of virtue of a Julian and the spiritual pride of a Mahomet From infancy the evil one is to take possession of Antichrist and to train him for his office instilling into him cunning cruelty and pride His doctrine will be not downright infidelity but a show of godliness whilst denying the power thereof i e the miraculous origin and divine authority of Christianity He will sow doubts of our Lord s manifestation in the flesh he will allow Christ to be an excellent Man capable of teaching the most exalted truths and inculcating the purest morality yet Himself fallible and carried away by fanaticism In the end however Antichrist will exalt himself to sit as God in the temple of God and become the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place At the same time there is to be an awful alliance struck between himself the impersonification of the world power and the Church of God some high pontiff of which or the episcopacy in general will enter into league with the unbelieving state to oppress the very elect It is a strange instance of religionary virulence which makes some detect the Pope of Rome in the Man of Sin the Harlot the Beast and the Priest going before it The Man of Sin and the Beast are unmistakably identical and refer to an Antichristian world power whilst the Harlot and the Priest are symbols of an apostasy in the Church There is nothing Roman in this but something very much the opposite How the Abomination of Desolation can be considered as set up in a Church where every sanctuary is adorned with all that can draw the heart to the Crucified and raise the thoughts to the imposing ritual of Heaven is a puzzle to me To the man uninitiated in the law that Revelation is to be interpreted by contraries it would seem more like the Abomination of Desolation in the Holy Place if he entered a Scotch Presbyterian or a Dutch Calvinist place of worship Rome does not fight against the Daily Sacrifice and endeavor to abolish it that has been rather the labor of so called Church Reformers who with the suppression of the doctrine of Eucharistic Sacrifice and Sacramental Adoration have well nigh obliterated all notion of worship to be addressed to the God Man Rome does not deny the power of the godliness of which she makes show but insists on that power with no broken accents It is rather in other communities where authority is flung aside and any man is permitted to believe or reject what he likes that we must look for the leaven of the Antichristian spirit at work It is evident that this spirit will infect the Church and especially those in place of authority therein so that the elect will have to wrestle against both principalities and powers in the state and also spiritual wickedness in the high places of the Church Perhaps it will be this feeling of antagonism between the inferior orders and the highest which will throw the Bishops into the arms of the state and establish that unholy alliance which will be cemented for the purpose of oppressing all who hold the truth in sincerity who are definite in their dogmatic statements of Christ s having been manifested in the flesh who labor to establish the Daily Sacrifice and offer in every place the pure offering spoken of by Malachi Perhaps it was in anticipation of this that ancient mystical interpreters explained the scene at the well in Midian as having reference to the last times The Church like the daughters of Reuel comes to the Well of living waters to water her parched flock whereupon the shepherds her chief pastors arise and strive with her Fear not O flock fear not O daughter exclaims the commentator thy true Moses is seated on the well and He will arise out of His resting place and will with His own hand smite the shepherds and water the flock Let the sheep be in barren and dry pastures so long the shepherds strive not let the sheep pant and die so long the shepherds show no signs of irritation but let the Church approach the limpid well of life and at once her prelates will in the latter days combine to strive with her and keep back the flock from the reviving streams In the time of Antichrist the Church will be divided one portion will hold to the world power the other will seek out the old paths and cling to the only true Guide The high places will be filled with unbelievers in the Incarnation and the Church will be in a condition of the utmost spiritual degradation but enjoying the highest State patronage The religion in favor will be one of morality but not of dogma and the Man of Sin will be able to promulgate his doctrine according to saint Anselm through his great eloquence and wisdom his vast learning and mightiness in the Holy Scriptures which he will wrest to the overthrowing of dogma He will be liberal in bribes for he will be of unbounded wealth he will be capable of performing great signs and wonders so as to deceive the very elect and at the last he will tear the moral veil from his countenance and a monster of impiety and cruelty he will inaugurate that awful persecution which is to last for three years and a half and to excel in horror all the persecutions that have gone before In that terrible season of confusion faith will be all but extinguished When the Son of Man cometh shall He find faith on the earth asks our Blessed Lord as though expecting the answer No and then says Marchantius the vessel of the Church will disappear in the foam of that boiling deep of infidelity and be hidden in the blackness of that storm of destruction which sweeps over the earth The sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven the sun of faith shall have gone out the moon the Church shall not give her light being turned into blood through stress of persecution and the stars the great ecclesiastical dignitaries shall fall into apostasy But still the Church will remain unwrecked she will weather the storm still will she come forth beautiful as the moon terrible as an army with banners for after the lapse of those three and a half years Christ will descend to avenge the blood of the saints by destroying Antichrist and the world power Such is a brief sketch of the scriptural doctrine of Antichrist as held by the early and mediA val Church Let us now see to what myths it gave rise among the vulgar and the imaginative Rabanus Maurus in his work on the life of Antichrist gives a full account of the miracles he will perform he tells us that the Man fiend will heal the sick raise the dead restore sight to the blind hearing to the deaf speech to the dumb he will raise storms and calm them will remove mountains make trees flourish or wither at a word He will rebuild the temple at Jerusalem and making the Holy City the great capital of the world Popular opinion added that his vast wealth would be obtained from hidden treasures which are now being concealed by the demons for his use Various possessed persons when interrogated announced that such was the case and that the amount of buried gold was vast In the year fifteen ninety nine says Canon Moreau a contemporary historian a rumor circulated with prodigious rapidity through Europe that Antichrist had been born at Babylon and that already the Jews of that part were hurrying to receive and recognize him as their Messiah The news came from Italy and Germany and extended to Spain England and other Western kingdoms troubling many people even the most discreet however the learned gave it no credence saying that the signs predicted in Scripture to precede that event were not yet accomplished and among other that the Roman empire was not yet abolished Others said that as for the signs the majority had already appeared to the best of their knowledge and with regard to the rest they might have taken place in distant regions without their having been made known to them that the Roman empire existed but in name and that the interpretation of the passage on which its destruction was predicted might be incorrect that for many centuries the most learned and pious had believed in the near approach of Antichrist some believing that he had already come on account of the persecutions which had fallen on the Christians others on account of fires or eclipses or earthquakes Every one was in excitement some declared that the news must be correct others believed nothing about it and the agitation became so excessive that Henry IV who was then on the throne was compelled by edict to forbid any mention of the subject The report spoken of by Moreau gained additional confirmation from the announcement made by an exorcised demoniac that in sixteen hundred the Man of Sin had been born in the neighborhood of Paris of a Jewess named Blanchefleure who had conceived by Satan The child had been baptized at the Sabbath of Sorcerers and a witch under torture acknowledged that she had rocked the infant Antichrist on her knees and she averred that he had claws on his feet wore no shoes and spoke all languages In sixteen twenty three appeared the following startling announcement which obtained an immense circulation among the lower orders We brothers of the Order of saint John of Jerusalem in the Isle of Malta have received letters from our spies who are engaged in our service in the country of Babylon now possessed by the Grand Turk by the which letters we are advertised that on the first of May in the year of our Lord sixteen twenty three a child was born in the town of Bourydot otherwise called Calka near Babylon of the which child the mother is a very aged woman of race unknown called Fort Juda of the father nothing is known The child is dusky has pleasant mouth and eyes teeth pointed like those of a cat ears large stature by no means exceeding that of other children the said child incontinent on his birth walked and talked perfectly well His speech is comprehended by every one admonishing the people that he is the true Messiah and the son of God and that in him all must believe Our spies also swear and protest that they have seen the said child with their own eyes and they add that on the occasion of his nativity there appeared marvellous signs in heaven for at full noon the sun lost its brightness and was for some time obscured This is followed by a list of other signs appearing the most remarkable being a swarm of flying serpents and a shower of precious stones According to Sebastian Michaeliz in his history of the possessed of Flanders on the authority of the exorcised demons we learn that Antichrist is to be a son of Beelzebub who will accompany his offspring under the form of a bird with four feet and a bull s head that he will torture Christians with the same tortures with which the lost souls are racked that he will be able to fly speak all languages and will have any number of names We find that Antichrist is known to the Mussulmans as well as to Christians Lane in his edition of the Arabian Nights gives some curious details on Moslem ideas regarding him According to these Antichrist will overrun the earth mounted on an ass and followed by forty thousand Jews his empire will last forty days whereof the first day will be a year long the duration of the second will be a month that of the third a week the others being of their usual length He will devastate the whole world leaving Mecca and Medina alone in security as these holy cities will be guarded by angelic legions Christ at last will descend to earth and in a great battle will destroy the Man devil Several writers of different denominations no less superstitious than the common people connected the apparition of Antichrist with the fable of Pope Joan which obtained such general credence at one time but which modern criticism has at length succeeded in excluding from history Perhaps the earliest writer to mention Pope Joan is Marianus Scotus who in his chronicle inserts the following passage A D eight hundred fifty four Lotharii fourteen Joanna a woman succeeded Leo and reigned two years five months and four days Marianus Scotus died A D ten eighty six Sigebert de Gemblours d fifth Oct eleven twelve inserts the same story in his valuable chronicle copying from an interpolated passage in the work of Anastasius the librarian His words are It is reported that this John was a female and that she conceived by one of her servants The Pope becoming pregnant gave birth to a child wherefore some do not number her among the Pontiffs Hence the story spread among the mediA val chroniclers who were great plagiarists Otto of Frisingen and Gotfrid of Viterbo mention the Lady Pope in their histories and Martin Polonus gives details as follows After Leo IV John Anglus a native of Metz reigned two years five months and four days And the pontificate was vacant for a month He died in Rome He is related to have been a female and when a girl to have accompanied her sweetheart in male costume to Athens there she advanced in various sciences and none could be found to equal her So after having studied for three years in Rome she had great masters for her pupils and hearers And when there arose a high opinion in the city of her virtue and knowledge she was unanimously elected Pope But during her papacy she became in the family way by a familiar Not knowing the time of birth as she was on her way from saint Peter s to the Lateran she had a painful delivery between the Coliseum and saint Clement s Church in the street Having died after it is said that she was buried on the spot and therefore the Lord Pope always turns aside from that way and it is supposed by some out of detestation for what happened there Nor on that account is she placed in the catalogue of the Holy Pontiffs not only on account of her sex but also because of the horribleness of the circumstance Certainly a story at all scandalous crescit eundo William Ocham alludes to the story and John Huss only too happy to believe it provides the lady with a name and asserts that she was baptized Agnes or as he will have it with a strong aspirate Hagnes Others however insist upon her name having been Gilberta and some stout Germans not relishing the notion of her being a daughter of Fatherland palm her off on England As soon as we arrive at Reformation times the German and French Protestants fasten on the story with the utmost avidity and add sweet little touches of their own and draw conclusions galling enough to the Roman See illustrating their accounts with wood engravings vigorous and graphic but hardly decent One of these represents the event in a peculiarly startling manner The procession of bishops with the Host and tapers is sweeping along when suddenly the cross bearer before the triple crowned and vested Pope starts aside to witness the unexpected arrival This engraving which it is quite impossible for me to reproduce is in a curious little book entitled Puerperium Johannis PapA eight fifteen thirty The following jingling record of the event is from the Rhythmical VitA Pontificum of Gulielmus Jacobus of Egmonden a work never printed This fragment is preserved in Wolfii Lectionum Memorabilium centenarii XVI PriusquA m reconditur Sergius vocatur Ad summam qui dicitur Johannes huic addatur Anglicus Moguntia iste procreatur

event and asked her to choose whether she would prefer burning eternally in hell or having her confinement in public with sense which does her credit she chose the latter The Protestant writers were not satisfied that the father of the unhappy baby should have been a servant some made him a Cardinal and others the devil himself According to an eminent Dutch minister it is immaterial whether the child be fathered on Satan or a monk at all events the former took a lively interest in the youthful Antichrist and on the occasion of his birth was seen and heard fluttering overhead crowing and chanting in an unmusical voice the Sibylline verses announcing the birth of the Arch persecutor Papa pater patrum PapissA pandito partum Et tibi tunc eadem de corpore quando recedam which lines as being perhaps the only ones known to be of diabolic composition are deserving of preservation The Reformers in order to reconcile dates were put to the somewhat perplexing necessity of moving Pope Joan to their own times or else of giving to the youthful Antichrist an age of seven hundred years It must be allowed that the accouchement of a Pope in full pontificals during a solemn procession was a prodigy not likely to occur more than once in the world s history and was certain to be of momentous import It will be seen by the curious woodcut reproduced as frontispiece from Baptista Mantuanus that he consigned Pope Joan to the jaws of hell notwithstanding her choice The verses accompanying this picture are Hic pendebat adhuc sexum mentita virile FA mina cui triplici Phrygiam diademate mitram Extollebat apex et pontificalis adulter It need hardly be stated that the whole story of Pope Joan is fabulous and rests on not the slightest historical foundation It was probably a Greek invention to throw discredit on the papal hierarchy first circulated more than two hundred years after the date of the supposed Pope Even Martin Polonus A D twelve eighty two who is the first to give the details does so merely on popular report The great champions of the myth were the Protestants of the sixteenth century who were thoroughly unscrupulous in distorting history and suppressing facts so long as they could make a point A paper war was waged upon the subject and finally the whole story was proved conclusively to be utterly destitute of historical truth A melancholy example of the blindness of party feeling and prejudice is seen in Mosheim who assumes the truth of the ridiculous story and gravely inserts it in his Ecclesiastical History Between Leo IV who died eight hundred fifty five and Benedict III a woman who concealed her sex and assumed the name of John it is said opened her way to the Pontifical throne by her learning and genius and governed the Church for a time She is commonly called the Papess Joan During the five subsequent centuries the witnesses to this extraordinary event are without number nor did any one prior to the Reformation by Luther regard the thing as either incredible or disgraceful to the Church Such are Mosheim s words and I give them as a specimen of the credit which is due to his opinion The Ecclesiastical History he wrote is full of perversions of the plainest facts and that under our notice is but one out of many During the five centuries after her reign he says the witnesses to the story are innumerable Now for two centuries there is not an allusion to be found to the events The only passage which can be found is a universally acknowledged interpolation of the Lives of the Popes by Anastasius Bibliothecarius and this interpolation is stated in the first printed edition by BusA us Mogunt sixteen oh two to be only found in two MS copies From Marianus Scotus or Sigebert de Gemblours the story passed into other chronicles totidem verbis and generally with hesitation and an expression of doubt in its accuracy Martin Polonus is the first to give the particulars some four hundred and twenty years after the reign of the fabulous Pope Mosheim is false again in asserting that no one prior to the Reformation regarded the thing as either incredible or disgraceful This is but of a piece with his malignity and disregard for truth whenever he can hit the Catholic Church hard Bart Platina in his Lives of the Popes written before Luther was born after relating the story says These things which I relate are popular reports but derived from uncertain and obscure authors which I have therefore inserted briefly and baldly lest I should seem to omit obstinately and pertinaciously what most people assert Thus the facts were justly doubted by Platina on the legitimate grounds that they rested on popular gossip and not on reliable history Marianus Scotus the first to relate the story died in ten eighty six He was a monk of saint Martin of Cologne then of Fulda and lastly of saint Alban s at Metz How could he have obtained reliable information or seen documents upon which to ground the assertion Again his chronicle has suffered severely from interpolations in numerous places and there is reason to believe that the Pope Joan passage is itself a late interpolation If so we are reduced to Sigebert de Gemblours d eleven twelve placing two centuries and a half between him and the event he records and his chronicle may have been tampered with The historical discrepancies are sufficiently glaring to make the story more than questionable Leo IV died on the seventeenth July eight hundred fifty five and Benedict III was consecrated on the first September in the same year so that it is impossible to insert between their pontificates a reign of two years five months and four days It is however true that there was an antipope elected upon the death of Leo at the instance of the Emperor Louis but his name was Anastasius This man possessed himself of the palace of the Popes and obtained the incarceration of Benedict However his supporters almost immediately deserted him and Benedict assumed the pontificate The reign of Benedict was only for two years and a half so that Anastasius cannot be the supposed Joan nor do we hear of any charge brought against him to the effect of his being a woman But the stout partisans of the Pope Joan tale assert on the authority of the Annales Augustani twenty nine and some other but late authorities that the female Pope was John VIII who consecrated Louis II of France and Ethelwolf of England Here again is confusion Ethelwolf sent Alfred to Rome in eight hundred fifty three and the youth received regal unction from the hands of Leo IV In eight hundred fifty five Ethelwolf visited Rome it is true but was not consecrated by the existing Pope whilst Charles the Bald was anointed by John VIII in eight hundred seventy five John VIII was a Roman son of Gundus and an archdeacon of the Eternal City He assumed the triple crown in eight hundred seventy two and reigned till December eighteen eight hundred eighty two John took an active part in the troubles of the Church under the incursions of the Sarasins and three hundred twenty five letters of his are extant addressed to the princes and prelates of his day Any one desirous of pursuing this examination into the untenable nature of the story may find an excellent summary of the arguments used on both sides in Gieseler Lehrbuch c Cunningham s trans vol ii pp twenty twenty one or in Bayle Dictionnaire tom iii art Papesse The arguments in favor of the myth may be seen in Spanheim Exercit de Papa FA mina Opp tom ii p five hundred seventy seven or in Lenfant Histoire de la Papesse Jeanne

iii p seven hundred seventy seven and in the pages of the Lutheran Huemann Sylloge Diss Sacras tom i par ii p three hundred fifty two The final development of this extraordinary story under the delicate fingers of the German and French Protestant controversialists may not prove uninteresting Joan was the daughter of an English missionary who left England to preach the Gospel to the recently converted Saxons She was born at Engelheim and according to different authors she was christened Agnes Gerberta Joanna Margaret Isabel Dorothy or Jutt the last must have been a nickname surely She early distinguished herself for genius and love of letters A young monk of Fulda having conceived for her a violent passion which she returned with ardor she deserted her parents dressed herself in male attire and in the sacred precincts of Fulda divided her affections between the youthful monk and the musty books of the monastic library Not satisfied with the restraints of conventual life nor finding the library sufficiently well provided with books of abstruse science she eloped with her young man and after visiting England France and Italy she brought him to Athens where she addicted herself with unflagging devotion to her literary pursuits Wearied out by his journey the monk expired in the arms of the blue stocking who had influenced his life for evil and the young lady of so many aliases was for a while inconsolable She left Athens and repaired to Rome There she opened a school and acquired such a reputation for learning and feigned sanctity that on the death of Leo IV she was unanimously elected Pope For two years and five months under the name of John VIII she filled the papal chair with reputation no one suspecting her sex But having taken a fancy to one of the cardinals by him she became pregnant At length arrived the time of Rogation processions Whilst passing the street between the amphitheatre and saint Clement s she was seized with violent pains fell to the ground amidst the crowd and whilst her attendants ministered to her was delivered of a son Some say the child and mother died on the spot some that she survived but was incarcerated some that the child was spirited away to be the Antichrist of the last days A marble monument representing the papess with her baby was erected on the spot which was declared to be accursed to all ages I have little doubt myself that Pope Joan is an impersonification of the great whore of Revelation seated on the seven hills and is the popular expression of the idea prevalent from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries that the mystery of iniquity was somehow working in the papal court The scandal of the Antipopes the utter worldliness and pride of others the spiritual fornication with the kings of the earth along with the words of Revelation prophesying the advent of an adulterous woman who should rule over the imperial city and her connection with Antichrist crystallized into this curious myth much as the floating uncertainty as to the signification of our Lord s words There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God condensed into the myth of the Wandering Jew The literature connected with Antichrist is voluminous I need only specify some of the most curious works which have appeared on the subject saint Hippolytus and Rabanus Maurus have been already alluded to Commodianus wrote Carmen Apologeticum adversus Gentes which has been published by Dom Pitra in his Spicilegium Solesmense with an introduction containing Jewish and Christian traditions relating to Antichrist De Turpissima Conceptione Nativitate et aliis PrA sagiis Diaboliciis illius Turpissimi Hominis Antichristi is the title of a strange little volume published by Lenoir in A D fifteen hundred containing rude yet characteristic woodcuts representing the birth life and death of the Man of Sin each picture accompanied by French verses in explanation An equally remarkable illustrated work on Antichrist is the famous Liber de Antichristo a blockbook of an early date It is in twenty seven folios and is excessively rare Dibdin has reproduced three of the plates in his Bibliotheca Spenseriana and Falckenstein has given full details of the work in his Geschichte der Buchdruckerkunst There is an Easter miracle play of the twelfth century still extant the subject of which is the Life and Death of Antichrist More curious still is the Farce de l AntA C christ et de Trois Femmes a composition of the sixteenth century when that mysterious personage occupied all brains The farce consists in a scene at a fish stall with three good ladies quarrelling over some fish Antichrist steps in for no particular reason that one can see upsets fish and fish women sets them fighting and skips off the stage The best book on Antichrist and that most full of learning and judgment is Malvenda s great work in two folio volumes De Antichristo libri xii Lyons

7871-107222-0045	train-other-500	The belief in the Moon man seems to exist among the natives of British Columbia for I read in one of mister Duncan s letters to the Church Missionary Society
7871-107222-0046	train-other-500	One very dark night I was told that there was a moon to see on the beach On going to see there was an illuminated disk with the figure of a man upon it The water was then very low
7871-107222-0047	train-other-500	and one of the conjuring parties had lit up this disk at the water s edge They had made it of wax with great exactness and presently it was at full It was an imposing sight
none	none	 Nothing could be seen around it but the Indians suppose that the medicine party are then holding converse with the man in the moon After a short time the moon waned away and the conjuring party returned whooping to their house 
7871-107222-0048	train-other-500	Now let us turn to Scandinavian mythology
none	none	 and see what we learn from that source MAcni the moon stole two children from their parents 
7871-107222-0049	train-other-500	and carried them up to heaven Their names were Hjuki and Bil They had been drawing water from the well
none	none	 Byrgir 
7871-107222-0050	train-other-500	in the bucket SA gr suspended from the pole Simul which they bore upon their shoulders
none	none	 These children pole and bucket were placed in heaven where they could be seen from earth This refers undoubtedly to the spots in the moon 
7871-107222-0051	train-other-500	and so the Swedish peasantry explain these spots to this day as representing a boy and a girl bearing a pail of water between them Are we not reminded at once of our nursery rhyme
7871-107222-0052	train-other-500	Jack and Jill went up a hill To fetch a pail of water Jack fell down and broke his crown And Jill came tumbling after
7871-107222-0053	train-other-500	This verse which to us seems at first sight nonsense I have no hesitation in saying has a high antiquity and refers to the Eddaic Hjuki and Bil The names indicate as much Hjuki in Norse would be pronounced
none	none	 Juki 
7871-107222-0054	train-other-500	which would readily become Jack and Bil for the sake of euphony and in order to give a female name to one of the children would become Jill The fall of Jack
none	none	 and the subsequent fall of Jill 
7871-107222-0055	train-other-500	simply represent the vanishing of one moon spot after another as the moon wanes But the old Norse myth had a deeper signification than merely an explanation of the moon spots Hjuki is derived from the verb jakka
7871-107222-0056	train-other-500	to heap or pile together to assemble and increase and Bil from bila to break up or dissolve Hjuki and Bil therefore signify nothing more than the waxing
none	none	 and waning of the moon 
7871-107222-0057	train-other-500	and the water they are represented as bearing signifies the fact that the rainfall depends on the phases of the moon Waxing and waning were individualized and the meteorological fact of the connection of the rain with the moon
7871-107222-0058	train-other-500	was represented by the children as water bearers
none	none	 But though Jack and Jill became by degrees dissevered in the popular mind from the moon the original myth went through a fresh phase and exists still under a new form The Norse superstition attributed theft to the moon and the vulgar soon began to believe that the figure they saw in the moon was the thief The lunar specks certainly may be made to resemble one figure and only a lively imagination can discern two The girl soon dropped out of popular mythology the boy oldened into a venerable man he retained his pole and the bucket was transformed into the thing he had stolen 
7871-107222-0059	train-other-500	sticks or vegetables The theft was in some places exchanged for Sabbath breaking
none	none	 especially among those in Protestant countries who were acquainted with the Bible story 
7871-107222-0060	train-other-500	of the stick gatherer The Indian superstition is worth examining because of the connection existing between Indian and European mythology
none	none	 on account of our belonging to the same Aryan stock According to a Buddhist legend SAckyamunni himself in one of his earlier stages of existence was a hare and lived in friendship with a fox and an ape In order to test the virtue of the Bodhisattwa 
7871-107222-0062	train-other-500	Indra came to the friends

7871-107222-0063	train-other-500	asking for food Hare ape and fox went forth in quest of victuals for their guest The two latter returned from their foraging expedition successful but the hare had found nothing Then
7871-107222-0064	train-other-500	rather than that he should treat the old man with inhospitality the hare had a fire kindled and cast himself into the flames
none	none	 that he might himself become food for his guest In reward for this act of self sacrifice Indra carried the hare to heaven and placed him in the moon thirty five Here we have an old man and a hare in connection with the lunar planet just as in Shakspeare we have a fagot bearer and a dog The fable rests upon the name of the moon in Sanskrit ASec aASec in or that marked with the hare but whether the belief in the spots taking the shape of a hare gave the name ASec aASec in to the moon or the lunar name ASec aASec in originated the belief it is impossible for us to say Grounded upon this myth is the curious story of The Hare and the Elephant in the Pantschatantra an ancient collection of Sanskrit fables It will be found as the first tale in the third book I have room only for an outline of the story THE CRAFTY HARE In a certain forest lived a mighty elephant king of a herd Toothy by name On a certain occasion there was a long drought so that pools tanks swamps and lakes were dried up Then the elephants sent out exploring parties in search of water A young one discovered an extensive lake surrounded with trees and teeming with water fowl It went by the name of the Moon lake The elephants delighted at the prospect of having an inexhaustible supply of water marched off to the spot and found their most sanguine hopes realized Round about the lake in the sandy soil were innumerable hare warrens and as the herd of elephants trampled on the ground the hares were severely injured their homes broken down their heads legs and backs crushed beneath the ponderous feet of the monsters of the forest As soon as the herd had withdrawn the hares assembled some halting some dripping with blood some bearing the corpses of their cherished infants some with piteous tales of ruination in their houses all with tears streaming from their eyes and wailing forth Alas we are lost The elephant herd will return for there is no water elsewhere and that will be the death of all of us But the wise and prudent Longear volunteered to drive the herd away and he succeeded in this manner Longear went to the elephants and having singled out their king he addressed him as follows Ha ha bad elephant what brings you with such thoughtless frivolity to this strange lake Back with you at once When the king of the elephants heard this he asked in astonishment Pray who are you I replied Longear I am Vidschajadatta by name the hare who resides in the Moon Now am I sent by his Excellency the Moon as an ambassador to you I speak to you in the name of the Moon Ahem Hare said the elephant somewhat staggered and what message have you brought me from his Excellency the Moon You have this day injured several hares Are you not aware that they are the subjects of me If you value your life venture not near the lake again Break my command and I shall withdraw my beams from you at night and your bodies will be consumed with perpetual sun The elephant after a short meditation said Friend it is true that I have acted against the rights of the excellent Majesty of the Moon I should wish to make an apology how can I do so The hare replied Come along with me and I will show you The elephant asked Where is his Excellency at present The other replied He is now in the lake hearing the complaints of the maimed hares If that be the case said the elephant humbly bring me to my lord that I may tender him my submission So the hare conducted the king of the elephants to the edge of the lake and showed him the reflection of the moon in the water saying There stands our lord in the midst of the water plunged in meditation reverence him with devotion and then depart with speed Thereupon the elephant poked his proboscis into the water and muttered a fervent prayer By so doing he set the water in agitation so that the reflection of the moon was all of a quiver Look exclaimed the hare his Majesty is trembling with rage at you Why is his supreme Excellency enraged with me asked the elephant Because you have set the water in motion Worship him and then be off The elephant let his ears droop bowed his great head to the earth and after having expressed in suitable terms his regret for having annoyed the Moon and the hare dwelling in it he vowed never to trouble the Moon lake again Then he departed and the hares have ever since lived there unmolested FOOTNOTES thirty

7871-107223-0008	train-other-500	he saw a white glimmering figure of matchless beauty standing before him and beckoning him to her He knew her at once by her attributes and by her superhuman perfection to be none other than Venus
7871-107223-0009	train-other-500	As she spake to him the sweetest strains of music floated in the air a soft roseate light glowed around her and nymphs of exquisite loveliness
none	none	 scattered roses at her feet A thrill of passion ran through the veins of the minnesinger and leaving his horse he followed the apparition It led him up the mountain to the cave and as it went flowers bloomed upon the soil and a radiant track was left for TanhAuser to follow He entered the cavern and descended to the palace of Venus in the heart of the mountain Seven years of revelry and debauch were passed 
7871-107223-0010	train-other-500	and the minstrel s heart began to feel a strange void The beauty the magnificence the variety of the scenes in the pagan goddess s home and all its heathenish pleasures palled upon him

none	none	 and he longed to make his peace with God 
7871-107223-0012	train-other-500	In vain did he entreat Venus to permit him to depart
none	none	 and it was only when in the bitterness of his grief 
7871-107223-0013	train-other-500	he called upon the Virgin Mother that a rift in the mountain side appeared to him and he stood again above ground How sweet was the morning air balmy with the scent of hay as it rolled up the mountain to him and fanned
7871-107223-0014	train-other-500	his haggard cheek How delightful to him was the cushion of moss and scanty grass after the downy couches of the palace of revelry below He plucked the little heather bells and held them before him
7871-107223-0015	train-other-500	the tears rolled from his eyes and moistened his thin and wasted hands He looked up at the soft blue sky and the newly risen sun and his heart overflowed What were the golden jewel incrusted
7871-107223-0016	train-other-500	lamp lit vaults beneath to that pure dome of God s building The chime of a village church struck sweetly on his ear satiated with Bacchanalian songs and he hurried down the mountain to the church which called him
7871-107223-0017	train-other-500	There he made his confession but the priest horror struck at his recital dared not give him absolution but passed him on to another And so he went from one to another
7871-107223-0018	train-other-500	till at last he was referred to the Pope himself To the Pope he went
none	none	 Urban IV then occupied the chair of saint Peter To him TanhAuser related the sickening story of his guilt 
7871-107223-0019	train-other-500	and prayed for absolution Urban was a hard and stern man and shocked at the immensity of the sin he thrust the penitent indignantly from him exclaiming Guilt such as thine can never never be remitted
7871-107223-0020	train-other-500	Sooner shall this staff in my hand grow green and blossom than that God should pardon thee
none	none	 Then TanhAuser 
7871-107223-0021	train-other-500	full of despair and with his soul darkened went away and returned to the only asylum open to him the Venusberg But lo three days after he had gone
7871-107223-0022	train-other-500	Urban discovered that his pastoral staff had put forth buds and had burst into flower
none	none	 Then he sent messengers after TanhAuser and they reached the HArsel vale to hear that a wayworn man with haggard brow and bowed head had just entered the HArselloch Since then TanhAuser has not been seen Such is the sad yet beautiful story of TanhAuser 
7871-107223-0023	train-other-500	It is a very ancient myth Christianized

7871-107223-0028	train-other-500	new word roots and this is perfectly true The same story root remains but it is varied according to the temperament of the narrator or the exigencies of localization The story root of the Venusberg is this

none	none	 to watch him in the night The same author mentions another young man who had been carried away and after his return was removed a second time upon the eve of his marriage Gervase of Tilbury says that in Catalonia 
7871-107223-0047	train-other-500	there is a lofty mountain named Cavagum at the foot of which runs a river with golden sands in the vicinity of which there are likewise silver mines This mountain is steep and almost inaccessible

7871-107223-0054	train-other-500	on the finger of a statue of Venus When he wished to resume it he found that the stony hand had become clinched so that it was impossible to remove the ring Thenceforth he was haunted by the Goddess Venus

none	none	 and again for one year by the enchantress Circe contains the root of the same story of the TanhAuser 
7871-107223-0057	train-other-500	What may have been the significance of the primeval story radical it is impossible for us now to ascertain but the legend as it shaped itself in the middle ages is certainly indicative of the struggle between the new and the old faith

7871-107223-0059	train-other-500	which seems to satisfy his poetic instincts and which gives full rein to his passions
none	none	 But these excesses pall on him after a while and the religion of sensuality 
7871-107223-0060	train-other-500	leaves a great void in his breast He turns to Christianity and at first it seems to promise all that he requires But alas he is repelled by its ministers On all sides he is met by practice widely at variance with profession
none	none	 Pride worldliness want of sympathy exist among those who should be the foremost to guide sustain and receive him All the warm springs which gushed up in his broken heart are choked his softened spirit is hardened again and he returns in despair to bury his sorrows and drown his anxieties in the debauchery of his former creed A sad picture but doubtless one very true Fatality of Numbers The laws governing numbers are so perplexing to the uncultivated mind and the results arrived at by calculation are so astonishing that it cannot be matter of surprise if superstition has attached itself to numbers But even to those who are instructed in numeration there is much that is mysterious and unaccountable much that only an advanced mathematician can explain to his own satisfaction The neophyte sees the numbers obedient to certain laws but why they obey these laws he cannot understand and the fact of his not being able so to do tends to give to numbers an atmosphere of mystery which impresses him with awe For instance the property of the number nine discovered I believe by W Green who died in seventeen ninety four is inexplicable to any one but a mathematician The property to which I allude is this that when nine is multiplied by two by three by four by five by six c it will be found that the digits composing the product when added together give nine Thus two A nine eighteen and one eight nine three A nine twenty seven two seven nine four A nine thirty six three six nine five A nine forty five four five nine six A nine fifty four five four nine seven A nine sixty three six three nine eight A nine seventy two seven two nine nine A nine eighty one eight one nine ten A nine ninety nine zero nine It will be noticed that nine A eleven makes ninety nine the sum of the digits of which is eighteen and not nine but the sum of the digits one eight equals nine nine A twelve one hundred eight and one zero eight nine nine A thirteen one hundred seventeen one one seven nine nine A fourteen one hundred twenty six one two six nine And so on to any extent M de Maivan discovered another singular property of the same number If the order of the digits expressing a number be changed and this number be subtracted from the former the remainder will be nine or a multiple of nine and being a multiple the sum of its digits will be nine For instance take the number twenty one reverse the digits and you have twelve subtract twelve from twenty one and the remainder is nine Take sixty three reverse the digits and subtract thirty six from sixty three you have twenty seven a multiple of nine and two seven nine Once more the number thirteen is the reverse of thirty one the difference between these numbers is eighteen or twice nine Again the same property found in two numbers thus changed is discovered in the same numbers raised to any power Take twenty one and twelve again The square of twenty one is four hundred forty one and the square of twelve is one hundred forty four subtract one hundred forty four from four hundred forty one and the remainder is two hundred ninety seven a multiple of nine besides the digits expressing these powers added together give nine The cube of twenty one is nine thousand two hundred sixty one and that of twelve is seventeen twenty eight their difference is seven thousand five hundred thirty three also a multiple of nine The number thirty seven has also somewhat remarkable properties when multiplied by three or a multiple of three up to twenty seven it gives in the product three digits exactly similar From the knowledge of this the multiplication of thirty seven is greatly facilitated the method to be adopted being to multiply merely the first cipher of the multiplicand by the first multiplier it is then unnecessary to proceed with the multiplication it being sufficient to write twice to the right hand the cipher obtained so that the same digit will stand in the unit tens and hundreds places For instance take the results of the following table thirty seven multiplied by three gives one hundred eleven and three times one three thirty seven six two hundred twenty two three two six thirty seven nine three hundred thirty three three three nine thirty seven twelve four hundred forty four three four twelve thirty seven fifteen five hundred fifty five three five fifteen thirty seven eighteen six hundred sixty six three six eighteen thirty seven twenty one seven hundred seventy seven three seven twenty one thirty seven twenty four eight hundred eighty eight three eight twenty four thirty seven twenty seven nine hundred ninety nine three nine twenty seven The singular property of numbers the most different when added to produce the same sum originated the use of magical squares for talismans Although the reason may be accounted for mathematically yet numerous authors have written concerning them as though there were something uncanny about them But the most remarkable and exhaustive treatise on the subject is that by a mathematician of Dijon which is entitled TraitA C complet des CarrA C s magiques pairs et impairs simple et composA C s A Bordures Compartiments Croix Chassis A querres Bandes dA C tachA C es c suivi d un TraitA C des Cubes magiques et d un Essai sur les Cercles magiques par M Violle GA C omA tre Chevalier de saint Louis avec Atlas de fifty four

three examples of magical squares two seven six nine five one four three eight These nine ciphers are disposed in three horizontal lines add the three ciphers of each line and the sum is fifteen add the three ciphers in each column the sum is fifteen add the three ciphers forming diagonals and the sum is fifteen one two three four one seven thirteen nineteen twenty five two three two three eighteen twenty four five six twelve four one four one ten eleven seventeen twenty three four three four one two twenty two three nine fifteen sixteen fourteen twenty twenty one two eight The sum is ten The sum is sixty five But the connection of certain numbers with the dogmas of religion was sufficient besides their marvellous properties to make superstition attach itself to them Because there were thirteen at the table when the Last Supper was celebrated and one of the number betrayed his Master and then hung himself it is looked upon through Christendom as unlucky to sit down thirteen at table the consequence being that one of the number will die before the year is out When I see said Vouvenargues men of genius not daring to sit down thirteen at table there is no error ancient or modern which astonishes me Nine having been consecrated by Buddhism is regarded with great veneration by the Moguls and Chinese the latter bow nine times on entering the presence of their Emperor Three is sacred among Brahminical and Christian people because of the Trinity of the Godhead Pythagoras taught that each number had its own peculiar character virtue and properties The unit or the monad he says is the principle and the end of all it is this sublime knot which binds together the chain of causes it is the symbol of identity of equality of existence of conservation and of general harmony Having no parts the monad represents Divinity it announces also order peace and tranquillity which are founded on unity of sentiments consequently ONE is a good principle The number TWO or the dyad the origin of contrasts is the symbol of diversity or inequality of division and of separation TWO is accordingly an evil principle a number of bad augury characterizing disorder confusion and change THREE or the triad is the first of unequals it is the number containing the most sublime mysteries for everything is composed of three substances it represents God the soul of the world the spirit of man This number which plays so great a part in the traditions of Asia and in the Platonic philosophy is the image of the attributes of God FOUR or the tetrad as the first mathematical power is also one of the chief elements it represents the generating virtue whence come all combinations it is the most perfect of numbers it is the root of all things It is holy by nature since it constitutes the Divine essence by recalling His unity His power His goodness and His wisdom the four perfections which especially characterize God Consequently Pythagoricians swear by the quaternary number which gives the human soul its eternal nature The number FIVE or the pentad has a peculiar force in sacred expiations it is everything it stops the power of poisons and is redoubted by evil spirits The number SIX or the hexad is a fortunate number and it derives its merit from the first sculptors having divided the face into six portions but according to the Chaldeans the reason is because God created the world in six days SEVEN or the heptad is a number very powerful for good or for evil It belongs especially to sacred things The number EIGHT or the octad is the first cube that is to say squared in all senses as a die proceeding from its base two an even number so is man four square or perfect The number NINE or the ennead being the multiple of three should be regarded as sacred Finally TEN or the decad is the measure of all since it contains all the numeric relations and harmonies As the reunion of the four first numbers it plays an eminent part since all the branches of science all nomenclatures emanate from and retire into it It is hardly necessary for me here to do more than mention the peculiar character given to different numbers by Christianity One is the numeral indicating the Unity of the Godhead Two points to the hypostatic union Three to the Blessed Trinity Four to the Evangelists Five to the Sacred Wounds Six is the number of sin Seven that of the gifts of the Spirit Eight that of the Beatitudes Ten is the number of the commandments Eleven speaks of the Apostles after the loss of Judas Twelve of the complete apostolic college I shall now point out certain numbers which have been regarded with superstition and certain events connected with numbers which are of curious interest The number fourteen has often been observed as having singularly influenced the life of Henry IV and other French princes Let us take the history of Henry On the fourteenth May ten twenty nine the first king of France named Henry was consecrated and on the fourteenth May sixteen ten the last Henry was assassinated Fourteen letters enter into the composition of the name of Henri de Bourbon who was the fourteenth king bearing the titles of France and Navarre The fourteenth December fifteen fifty three that is fourteen centuries fourteen decades and fourteen years after the birth of Christ Henry IV was born the ciphers of the date fifteen fifty three when added together giving the number fourteen The fourteenth May fifteen fifty four Henry II ordered the enlargement of the Rue de la Ferronnerie The circumstance of this order not having been carried out occasioned the murder of Henry IV in that street four times fourteen years after The fourteenth May fifteen fifty two was the date of the birth of MarguA C rite de Valois first wife of Henry IV On the fourteenth May fifteen eighty eight the Parisians revolted against Henry III at the instigation of the Duke of Guise On the fourteenth March fifteen ninety Henry IV gained the battle of Ivry On the fourteenth May fifteen ninety Henry was repulsed from the Fauxbourgs of Paris On the fourteenth November fifteen ninety the Sixteen took oath to die rather than serve Henry On the fourteenth November fifteen ninety two the Parliament registered the Papal Bull giving power to the legate to nominate a king to the exclusion of Henry On the fourteenth December fifteen ninety nine the Duke of Savoy was reconciled to Henry IV On the fourteenth September sixteen oh six the Dauphin afterwards Louis XIII was baptized On the fourteenth May sixteen ten the king was stopped in the Rue de la Ferronnerie by his carriage becoming locked with a cart on account of the narrowness of the street Ravaillac took advantage of the occasion for stabbing him Henry IV lived four times fourteen years fourteen weeks and four times fourteen days that is to say fifty six years and five months On the fourteenth May sixteen forty three died Louis XIII son of Henry IV not only on the same day of the same month as his father but the date sixteen forty three when its ciphers are added together gives the number fourteen just as the ciphers of the date of the birth of his father gave fourteen Louis XIV mounted the throne in sixteen forty three one six four three fourteen He died in the year seventeen fifteen one seven one five fourteen He lived seventy seven years and seven seven fourteen Louis XV mounted the throne in the same year he died in seventeen seventy four which also bears the stamp of fourteen the extremes being fourteen and the sum of the means seven seven making fourteen Louis XVI had reigned fourteen years when he convoked the States General which was to bring about the Revolution The number of years between the assassination of Henry IV and the dethronement of Louis XVI is divisible by fourteen Louis XVII died in seventeen ninety four the extreme digits of the date are fourteen and the first two give his number The restoration of the Bourbons took place in eighteen fourteen also marked by the extremes being fourteen also by the sum of the ciphers making fourteen The following are other curious calculations made respecting certain French kings Add the ciphers composing the year of the birth or of the death of some of the kings of the third race and the result of each sum is the titular number of each prince Thus Louis IX was born in twelve fifteen add the four ciphers of this date and you have IX Charles VII was born in fourteen oh two the sum of one four two gives VII Louis XII was born in fourteen sixty one and one four six one XII Henry IV died in sixteen ten and one six one twice IV Louis XIV was crowned in sixteen forty three and these four ciphers give XIV The same king died in seventeen fifteen and this date gives also XIV He was aged seventy seven years and again seven seven fourteen Louis XVIII was born in seventeen fifty five add the digits and you have XVIII What is remarkable is that this number eighteen is double the number of the king to whom the law first applies and is triple the number of the kings to whom it has applied Here is another curious calculation Robespierre fell in seventeen ninety four Napoleon in eighteen fifteen and Charles X in eighteen thirty Now the remarkable fact in connection with these dates is that the sum of the digits composing them added to the dates gives the date of the fall of the successor Robespierre fell in seventeen ninety four one seven nine four twenty one seventeen ninety four twenty one eighteen fifteen the date of the fall of Napoleon one eight one five fifteen and eighteen fifteen fifteen eighteen thirty the date of the fall of Charles X There is a singular rule which has been supposed to determine the length of the reigning Pope s life in the earlier half of a century Add his number to that of his predecessor to that add ten and the result gives the year of his death Pius VII succeeded Pius VI six seven thirteen add ten and the sum is twenty three Pius VII died in eighteen twenty three Leo XII succeeded Pius VII twelve seven ten twenty nine and Leo XII died in eighteen twenty nine Pius VIII succeeded Leo XII eight twelve ten thirty and Pius VIII died in eighteen thirty However this calculation does not always apply Gregory XVI ought to have died in eighteen thirty four but he did not actually vacate his see till eighteen forty six It is also well known that an ancient tradition forbids the hope of any of saint Peter s successors pervenire ad annos Petri i e to reign twenty five years Those who sat longest are Years Months Days Pius VI who reigned twenty four six fourteen Hadrian I twenty three ten seventeen Pius VII twenty three five six Alexander III twenty one eleven twenty three saint Silvester I twenty one zero four There is one numerical curiosity of a very remarkable character which I must not omit The ancient Chamber of Deputies such as it existed in eighteen thirty was composed of four hundred two members and was divided into two parties The one numbering two hundred twenty one members declared itself strongly for the revolution of July the other party numbering one hundred eighty one did not favor a change The result was the constitutional monarchy which re established order after the three memorable days of July The parties were known by the following nicknames The larger was commonly called La queue de Robespierre and the smaller Les honnAtes gens Now the remarkable fact is that if we give to the letters of the alphabet their numerical values as they stand in their order as one for A two for B three for C and so on to Z which is valued at twenty five and then write vertically on the left hand the words La queue de Robespierre with the number equivalent to each letter opposite to it and on the right hand in like manner Les honnAtes gens if each column of numbers be summed up the result is the number of members who formed each party one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen A B C D E F G H I J K L M fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five N O P Q R S T U V X Y Z L twelve L

Navarre On the same day of the same month in fifteen seventy two the Calvinists were massacred in Paris and elsewhere On the twenty fifth October sixteen fifteen Louis XIII married Anne of Austria infanta of Spain whereupon we may remark the following coincidences The name Loys thirty six de Bourbon contains thirteen letters so does the name Anne d Austriche Louis was thirteen years old when this marriage was decided on Anne was the same age He was the thirteenth king of France bearing the name of Louis and she was the thirteenth infanta of the name of Anne of Austria On the twenty threed

broke out in Scotland The Emperor Charles V was born on February twenty four fifteen hundred on that day he won the battle of Pavia in fifteen twenty five and on the same day was crowned in fifteen thirty On the twenty ninth January sixteen ninety seven M de Broquemar president of the Parliament of Paris died suddenly in that city next day his brother an officer died suddenly at Bergue where he was governor The lives of these brothers present remarkable coincidences One day the officer being engaged in battle was wounded in his leg by a sword blow On the same day at the same moment the president was afflicted with acute pain which attacked him suddenly in the same leg as that of his brother which had been injured John Aubrey mentions the case of a friend of his who was born on the

7871-107225-0014	train-other-500	in an unapproachable region of Asia surrounded by flames and having an armed angel to guard the only gate Lambertus Floridus
none	none	 in a MS of the twelfth century 
7871-107225-0015	train-other-500	preserved in the Imperial Library in Paris describes it as
none	none	 Paradisus insula in oceano in oriente and in the map accompanying it 
7871-107225-0016	train-other-500	Paradise is represented as an island a little south east of Asia surrounded by rays and at some distance from the main land
none	none	 and in another MS of the same library a mediA val encyclopA dia under the word Paradisus is a passage which states that in the centre of Paradise is a fountain which waters the garden that in fact described by Prester John and that of which story telling Sir John Mandeville declared he had dronken three or four sithes 
7871-107225-0017	train-other-500	Close to this fountain is the Tree of Life The temperature of the country is equable neither frosts nor burning heats destroy the vegetation The four rivers already mentioned rise in it

7871-107225-0019	train-other-500	of course on incontrovertible authority that Alexander the Great was full of desire to see the terrestrial Paradise and that he undertook his wars in
none	none	 the East for the express purpose of reaching it 
7871-107225-0020	train-other-500	and obtaining admission into it He states that on his nearing Eden
none	none	 an old man was captured in a ravine by some of Alexander s soldiers 
7871-107225-0021	train-other-500	and they were about to conduct him to their monarch when the venerable man said
7871-107225-0022	train-other-500	Go and announce to Alexander that it is in vain he seeks Paradise his efforts will be perfectly fruitless for the way of Paradise is the way of humility a way
7871-107225-0023	train-other-500	of which he knows nothing Take this stone and give it to Alexander and say to him From this stone learn what you must think of yourself
7871-107225-0024	train-other-500	Now this stone was of great value and excessively heavy outweighing and excelling in value all other gems but when reduced to powder it was as light as a tuft of hay
none	none	 and as worthless By which token the mysterious old man meant that Alexander alive was the greatest of monarchs but Alexander dead would be a thing of nought That strangest of mediA val preachers Meffreth who got into trouble by denying the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin in his second sermon for the Third Sunday in Advent discusses the locality of the terrestrial Paradise and claims saint Basil and saint Ambrose as his authorities for stating that it is situated on the top of a very lofty mountain in Eastern Asia so lofty indeed is the mountain that the waters of the four rivers fall in cascade down to a lake at its foot with such a roar that the natives who live on the shores of the lake are stone deaf Meffreth also explains the escape of Paradise from submergence at the Deluge on the same grounds as does the Master of Sentences lib two dist seventeen c five by the mountain being so very high that the waters which rose over Ararat were only able to wash the base of the mountain of Paradise The Hereford map of the thirteenth century represents the terrestrial Paradise as a circular island near India cut off from the continent not only by the sea but also by a battlemented wall with a gateway to the west Rupert of Duytz regards it as having been situated in Armenia Radulphus Highden in the thirteenth century relying on the authority of saint Basil and saint Isidore of Seville places Eden in an inaccessible region of Oriental Asia and this was also the opinion of Philostorgus Hugo de saint Victor 
7871-107225-0025	train-other-500	in his book De Situ Terrarum expresses himself thus
7871-107225-0026	train-other-500	Paradise is a spot in the Orient productive of all kind of woods and pomiferous trees It contains the Tree of Life there is neither cold nor heat there but perpetual equable temperature
7871-107225-0027	train-other-500	It contains a fountain which flows forth in four rivers
none	none	 Rabanus Maurus with more discretion says 
7871-107225-0028	train-other-500	Many folk want to make out that the site of Paradise is in the east of the earth though cut off by the longest intervening space of ocean or earth from all regions which man now inhabits Consequently the waters of the Deluge
7871-107225-0029	train-other-500	which covered the highest points of the surface of our orb were unable to reach it However whether it be there or whether it be anywhere else God knows but that there was such a spot once and that it was on earth that is certain

none	none	 Otia Imperalia 
7871-107225-0031	train-other-500	and many others hold the same views as to the site of Paradise that were entertained by Hugo de saint Victor
none	none	 Jourdain de SA verac monk and traveller in the beginning of the fourteenth century places the terrestrial Paradise in the Third India that is to say in trans Gangic India Leonardo Dati 
7871-107225-0032	train-other-500	a Florentine poet of the fifteenth century composed a geographical treatise in verse entitled Della Sfera and it is in Asia that he locates the garden
none	none	 Asia e le prima parte dove l huomo Sendo innocente stava in Paradiso 
7871-107225-0033	train-other-500	But perhaps the most remarkable account of the terrestrial Paradise ever furnished
none	none	 is that of the Eireks Saga VA dfArla an Icelandic narrative of the fourteenth century giving the adventures of a certain Norwegian named Eirek who had vowed whilst a heathen 
7871-107225-0035	train-other-500	that he would explore the fabulous Deathless Land of pagan Scandinavian mythology
none	none	 The romance is possibly a Christian recension of an ancient heathen myth and Paradise has taken the place in it of GlA sisvellir According to the majority of the MSS 
7871-107225-0036	train-other-500	the story purports to be nothing more than a religious novel but one audacious copyist has ventured to assert that it is all fact
none	none	 and that the details are taken down from the lips of those who heard them from Eirek himself The account is briefly this Eirek was a son of Thrand 
7871-107225-0037	train-other-500	king of Drontheim and having taken upon him a vow to explore the Deathless Land he went to Denmark where he picked up a friend of the same name as himself They then went to Constantinople and called upon the Emperor
7871-107225-0038	train-other-500	who held a long conversation with them
none	none	 which is duly reported 
7871-107225-0039	train-other-500	relative to the truths of Christianity
none	none	 and the site of the Deathless Land which he assures them is nothing more 
7871-107225-0040	train-other-500	nor less than Paradise The world said the monarch who had not forgotten his geography since he left school is precisely one hundred eighty thousand stages round about one million English miles
none	none	 and it is not propped up on posts not a bit it is supported by the power of God and the distance between earth and heaven is one hundred thousand forty five miles another MS reads nine thousand three hundred eighty two miles the difference is immaterial 
7871-107225-0042	train-other-500	and round about the earth is a big sea called Ocean And what s to the south of the earth asked Eirek O there is the end of the world and that is India
7871-107225-0043	train-other-500	And pray where am I to find the Deathless Land That lies Paradise I suppose you mean well it lies slightly east of India Having obtained this information the two Eireks started
7871-107225-0044	train-other-500	furnished with letters from the Greek Emperor They traversed Syria and took ship
none	none	 probably at Balsora 
7871-107225-0045	train-other-500	then reaching India they proceeded on their journey on horseback till they came to a dense forest the gloom of which was so great through the interlacing of the boughs that even by day the stars could be observed twinkling
7871-107225-0046	train-other-500	as though they were seen from the bottom of a well On emerging from the forest the two Eireks came upon a strait separating them from a beautiful land which was unmistakably Paradise
none	none	 and the Danish Eirek 
7871-107225-0047	train-other-500	intent on displaying his scriptural knowledge pronounced the strait to be the River Pison This was crossed by a stone bridge guarded by a dragon The Danish Eirek deterred by the prospect of an encounter with this monster
none	none	 refused to advance and even endeavored to persuade his friend to give up the attempt to enter Paradise as hopeless after that they had come within sight of the favored land But the Norseman deliberately walked 
7871-107225-0048	train-other-500	sword in hand into the maw of the dragon and next moment to his infinite surprise and delight found himself liberated from the gloom of the monster s interior and safely placed in Paradise
7871-107225-0049	train-other-500	The land was most beautiful and the grass as gorgeous as purple it was studded with flowers and was traversed by honey rills The land was extensive and level so that there was not to be seen mountain or hill
7871-107225-0050	train-other-500	and the sun shone cloudless without night and darkness the calm of the air was great and there was but a feeble murmur of wind and that which there was breathed redolent with the odor of blossoms
7871-107225-0051	train-other-500	After a short walk Eirek observed what certainly must have been a remarkable object namely a tower or steeple self suspended in the air without any support whatever
7871-107225-0052	train-other-500	though access might be had to it by means of a slender ladder By this Eirek ascended into a loft of the tower and found there an excellent cold collation prepared for him After having partaken of this he went to sleep
7871-107225-0053	train-other-500	and in vision beheld and conversed with his guardian angel who promised to conduct him back to his fatherland but to come for him again and fetch him away from it forever
none	none	 at the expiration of the tenth year after his return to Dronheim Eirek then retraced his steps to India unmolested by the dragon which did not affect any surprise at having to disgorge him 
7871-107225-0054	train-other-500	and indeed which seems to have been notwithstanding his looks but a harmless and passive dragon
none	none	 After a tedious journey of seven years 
7871-107225-0055	train-other-500	Eirek reached his native land where he related his adventures
none	none	 to the confusion of the heathen 
7871-107225-0056	train-other-500	and to the delight and edification of the faithful
none	none	 And in the tenth year and at break of day as Eirek went to prayer God s Spirit caught him away and he was never seen again in this world so here ends all we have to say of him thirty eight 
7871-107225-0057	train-other-500	The saga of which I have given the merest outline is certainly striking
none	none	 and contains some beautiful passages It follows the commonly received opinion which identified Paradise with Ceylon and indeed an earlier Icelandic work the Rymbegla indicates the locality of the terrestrial Paradise as being near India for it speaks of the Ganges as taking its rise in the mountains of Eden It is not unlikely that the curious history of Eirek if not a Christianized version of a heathen myth may contain the tradition of a real expedition to India by one of the hardy adventurers who overran Europe explored the north of Russia harrowed the shores of Africa and discovered America Later than the fifteenth century we find no theories propounded concerning the terrestrial Paradise though there are many treatises on the presumed situation of the ancient Eden At Madrid

address on receipt of the price by the Publishers ROBERTS BROTHERS Boston Memoirs and Correspondence of Madame RA C camier Translated and Edited by MISS LUYSTER one vol sixteenmo with a finely engraved Portrait Price two dollars The diversified contents of this volume can hardly fail to gain for it a wide perusal It has the interest in a greater or less degree of history and romance of truth stranger than fiction of personal sketches of the curious phases of an exceptional social life of singular admixtures of piety and folly of greatness and profligacy fidelity and intrigue all mingling or revealed in connection with the prolonged career of one who was in certain respects the most remarkable woman of her time Boston Transcript With nothing like the talents which immortalized the author of Corinne Madame RA C camier won herself a place of not less social influence among the men and women of her day We must clearly look elsewhere than either to intellect wealth beauty or all three combined for the secret of that witchery which was so distinctive of her There was something we are led to infer in her constitutional temperament which even beyond her delicate and indefinable tact may afford the real clew to much of her mysterious ascendency Love seems to have existed in her as a yearning of the soul almost entirely free from those elements of passion which are grounded in the difference of the sexes There was in it not so much of the desire which centres in a single object as of the emotion which seeks to diffuse itself over the very widest sphere of objects It could thus be warm and deep while pure and inaccessible to evil Sainte Beuve s remark that she had carried the art of friendship to perfection helps us here to give the true key to her character A warm and constant friend she never admitted never showed herself a lover Satisfied with the arrangement which gave her from an early age nothing more than the name and status of a wife she could let her natural affection range with freedom and security wherever it met with a response that left intact her dignity and self respect Such coquetry as she showed arose rather from an instinctive desire to please and attract than from anything approaching to a vicious instinct or a silly desire to swell the list of her conquests What seemed to begin in flirtation never went to the point of danger and men who at first sight loved her passionately usually ended by becoming her true friends The London Saturday Review Mailed post paid to any address by the Publishers ROBERTS
