none	none	Your letter of the fourth just to hand How glad your letters make me how glad I am to have you to tell little things to I intended to write you as soon as I came back from Green River to tell you of a girl I saw there but there was a heap to do and I kept putting it off I have described the desert so often that I am afraid I will tire you so I will leave that out and tell you that we arrived in town rather late The help at the hotel were having their supper in the regular dining room as all the guests were out They cheerfully left their own meal to place ours on the table One of them interested me especially She was a small person I couldn t decide whether she was a child or a woman I kept thinking her homely and then when she spoke I forgot everything but the music of her voice it was so restful so rich and mellow in tone and she seemed so small for such a splendid voice Somehow I kept expecting her to squeak like a mouse but every word she spoke charmed me Before the meal was over it came out that she was the dish washer All the rest of the help had finished their work for the day but she of course had to wash what dishes we had been using The rest went their ways and as our own tardiness had belated her I offered to help her to carry out the dishes It was the work of only a moment to dry them so I did that She was so small that she had to stand on a box in order to be comfortable while she washed the cups and plates The sink and drain board were made for real folks I have to use this box to stand on or else the water runs back down my sleeves she told me My room was upstairs she helped me up with the children She said her name was Connie Willis that she was the only one of her ma s first man s children but ma married again after pa died and there were a lot of the second batch When the mother died she left a baby only a few hours old As Connie was older than the other children she took charge of the household and of the tiny little baby I just wish you could have seen her face light up when she spoke of little Lennie Lennie is eight years old now and she is just as smart as the smartest and as pretty as a doll All the Ford children are pretty and smart too I am the only homely child ma had It would do you good just to look at any of the rest specially Lennie It certainly did me good to listen to Connie her brave patience was so inspiring As long as I was in town she came every day when her work was finished to talk to me about Lennie For herself she had no ambition Her clothes were clean but they were odds and ends that had served their day for other possessors her shoes were not mates and one was larger than the other She said I thought it was a streak of luck when I found the cook always wore out her right shoe first and the dining room girl the left because you see I could have their old ones and that would save two dollars toward what I am saving up for But it wasn t so very lucky after all except for the fun because the cook wears low heels and has a much larger foot than the dining room girl who wears high heels But I chopped the long heel off with the cleaver and these shoes have saved me enough to buy Lennie a pair of patent leather slippers to wear on the Fourth of July I thought that a foolish ambition but succeeding conversations made me ashamed of the thought I asked her if Lennie s father couldn t take care of her Oh she said Pa Ford is a good man He has a good heart but there s so many of them that it is all he can do to rustle what must be had Why she told me in a burst of confidence I ve been saving up for a tombstone for ma for twelve years but I have to help pa once in a while and I sometimes think I never will get enough money saved It is kind of hard on three dollars a week and then I m kind of extravagant at times I have wanted a doll a beautiful one all my days Last Christmas I got it for Lennie And then I like to carry out other folks wishes sometimes That is what I am fixing to do now Ma always wanted to see me dressed up real pretty just once but we were always too poor and now I m too old But I can fix Lennie and this Fourth of July I am going to put all the beauty on her that ma would have liked to see on me They always celebrate that day at Manila Utah where pa lives I ll go out and take the things Then if ma is where she can see she ll see one of her girls dressed for once But aren t you mistaken when you say you have been saving for your mother s tombstone for twelve years She s only been dead eight Why no I m not You see at first it wasn t a tombstone but a marble top dresser Ma had always wanted one so badly for she always thought that housekeeping would be so much easier if she had just one pretty thing to keep house toward If I had not been so selfish she could have had the dresser before she died I had fifteen dollars enough to buy it but when I came to look in the catalogue to choose one I found that for fifteen dollars more I could get a whole set I thought how proud ma would be of a new bedstead and wash stand so I set in to earn that much more But before I could get that saved up ma just got tired of living waiting and doing without She never caused any trouble while she lived and she died the same way They sent for me to come home from the place where I was at work I had just got home and I was standing by the bed holding ma s hand when she smiled up at me she handed me Lennie and then turned over and sighed so contented That was all there was to it She was done with hard times Pa Ford wanted to buy her coffin on credit to go in debt for it but I hated for ma to have to go on that way even after she was dead so I persuaded him to use what money he had to buy the coffin and I put in all I had too So the coffin she lies in is her own We don t owe for that Then I stayed at home and kept house and cared for Lennie until she was four years old I have been washing dishes in this hotel ever since That is Connie s story After she told me I went to the landlady and suggested that we help a little with Lennie s finery but she told me to keep out I doubt if Connie would accept any help from us and if she did every cent we put in would take that much from her pleasure There have not been many happy days in her life but the Fourth of July will be one if we keep out So I kept out I was delighted when missus Pearson invited me to accompany her to Manila to witness the bucking contest on the Fourth Manila is a pretty little town situated in Lucerne Valley All the houses in town are the homes of ranchers whose farms may be seen from any doorstep in Manila The valley lies between a high wall of red sandstone and the hogback that is what the foothills are called The wall of sandstone is many miles in length The valley presents a beautiful picture as you go eastward at this time of the year the alfalfa is so green Each farm joins another Each has a cabin in which the rancher lives while they irrigate and make hay When that is finished they move into their houses in town Beyond the hogback rise huge mountains rugged canyons and noisy mountain streams great forests of pine help to make up the picture Looking toward the east we could see where mighty Green River cuts its way through walls of granite The road lies close up against the sandstone and cedar hills and along the canal that carries the water to all the farms in the valley I enjoyed every moment It was all so beautiful the red rock the green fields the warm brown sand of the road and bare places the mighty mountains the rugged cedars and sage brush spicing the warm air the blue distance and the fleecy clouds Oh I wish I could paint it for you In the foreground there should be some cows being driven home by a barefooted boy with a gun on his shoulder and a limp brown rabbit in his hand But I shall have to leave that to your imagination and move on to the Fourth On that day every one turns out even from the very farthest outlying ranches they come and every one dressed in his best No matter what privation is suffered all the rest of the time on this day every one is dressed to kill Every one has a little money with which to buy gaudy boxes of candy every girl has a chew of gum Among the children friendship is proved by invitations to share lemons They cordially invite each other to come get a suck o my lemon I just love to watch them Old and young are alike whatever may trouble them at other times is forgotten and every one dances eats candy sucks lemons laughs and makes merry on the Fourth I didn t care much for their contests I was busy watching the faces Soon I saw one I knew Connie was making her way toward me I wondered how I could ever have thought her plain Pride lighted every feature She led by the hand the most beautiful child I have ever seen She is a few weeks younger than Jerrine one but much smaller She had such an elusive beauty that I cannot describe it One not acquainted with her story might have thought her dress out of taste out among the sand dunes and sage brush in the hot sun but I knew and I felt the thrill of sheer blue silk dainty patent leather slippers and big blue hat just loaded with pink rose buds Footnote one The author s daughter aged eight This is my Lennie said Connie proudly I saw all the Ford family before I left the weak faced discouraged looking father and the really beautiful girls Connie was neat in a pretty little dress cheap but becoming and her shoes were mates Lennie was the center of family pride She represented all their longings Before I left Connie whispered to me that she would very soon have money enough to pay for her mother s tombstone Then I will have had everything I ever wanted I guess I won t have anything else to live for then I guess I will have to get to wanting something for Lennie On our way home even the mosquito bites didn t annoy me I was too full of Connie s happiness All my happiness lacked was your presence If I had had you beside me to share the joy and beauty I could have asked for nothing more I kept saying How missus Coney would enjoy this All I can do is to kind of hash it over for you I hope you like hash With much love to you ELINORE II THE START IN CAMP ON THE DESERT August twenty four nineteen fourteen DEAR missus CONEY At last we are off I am powerfully glad I shall have to enjoy this trip for us both 
3934-102413-0001	train-other-500	You see how greedy I am for new experiences I have never been on a prolonged hunt before so I am looking forward to a heap of fun I hardly know what to do about writing but shall try to write every two days
3934-102413-0002	train-other-500	I want you to have as much of this trip as I can put on paper so we will begin at the start To begin with we were all to meet at Green River to start the twentieth
3934-102413-0003	train-other-500	but a professor coming from somewhere in the East delayed us a day and also some of the party changed their plans that reduced our number but not our enthusiasm
3934-102413-0004	train-other-500	A few days before we left the ranch I telephoned missus Louderer and tried to persuade her to go along but she replied For why should I go Vat Iss it to freeze I can sleep out on some rocks here
3934-102413-0005	train-other-500	and with a stick I can beat the sage bush which will give me the smell you will smell of the outside And for the game I can have a beef kill which iss better to eat as elk I love missus Louderer dearly
3934-102413-0006	train-other-500	but she is absolutely devoid of imagination and her matter of factness is mighty trying sometimes However she sent me a bottle of goose grease to ward off colds from the kinder
3934-102413-0007	train-other-500	I tried missus O Shaughnessy but she was plumb aggravating and non committal and it seemed when we got to Green River that I would be the only woman in the party
3934-102413-0008	train-other-500	Besides all the others were strangers to me except young mister Haynes who was organizing the hunt Really the prospect didn t seem so joyous The afternoon before we were to start I went with mister Stewart and mister Haynes to meet the train
3934-102413-0009	train-other-500	We were expecting the professor But the only passenger who got off was a slight gray eyed girl She looked about her uncertainly for a moment and then went into the depot while we returned to the hotel
3934-102413-0010	train-other-500	Just as I started up the steps my eyes were gladdened by the sight of missus O Shaughnessy in her buckboard trotting merrily up the street She waved her hand to us and drove up
3934-102413-0011	train-other-500	Clyde took her team to the livery barn and she came up to my room with me It s going with you I am she began Ye ll need somebody to keep yez straight and to sew up the holes ye ll be shooting into each other
none	none	 After she had tidied up a bit 
3934-102413-0012	train-other-500	we went down to supper We were all seated at one table and there was yet an empty place
3934-102413-0013	train-other-500	but soon the girl we had seen get off the train came and seated herself in it Can any of you tell me how to get to Kendall Wyoming she asked I didn t know nor did Clyde
3934-102413-0014	train-other-500	but missus O Shaughnessy knew so she answered Kendall is in the forest reserve up north It is two hundred miles from here and half of the distance is across desert but they have an automobile route as far as Pinedale
3934-102413-0015	train-other-500	you could get that far on the auto stage After that I suppose you could get some one to take you on Thank you said the girl My name is Elizabeth Hull
3934-102413-0016	train-other-500	I am alone in the world and I am not expected at Kendall so I am obliged to ask and to take care of myself missus O Shaughnessy at once mentioned her own name and introduced the rest of us
3934-102413-0017	train-other-500	After supper Miss Hull and missus O Shaughnessy had a long talk I was not much surprised when missus O Shaughnessy came in to tell me that she was going to take the girl along Because she said Kendall is on our way
3934-102413-0018	train-other-500	and it s glad I am to help a lone girl Did you notice the freckles of her Sure her forbears hailed from Killarney So early next morning we were astir
3934-102413-0019	train-other-500	We had outfitted in Green River so the wagons were already loaded I had rather dreaded the professor I had pictured to myself a very dignified bespectacled person and I mentally stood in awe of his great learning
3934-102413-0020	train-other-500	Imagine my surprise when a boyish laughing young man introduced himself as Professor Glenholdt He was so jolly so unaffected
3934-102413-0021	train-other-500	and so altogether likable that my fear vanished and I enjoyed the prospect of his company mister Haynes and his friend mister Struble on their wagon led the way then we followed
3934-102413-0022	train-other-500	and after us came missus O Shaughnessy and Miss Hull brought up the rear with the professor riding horseback beside first one wagon and then another So we set out
3934-102413-0023	train-other-500	There was a great jangling and banging for our tin camp stoves kept the noise going Neither the children nor I can ride under cover on a wagon we get so sick
3934-102413-0024	train-other-500	so there we were perched high up on great rolls of bedding and a tent I reckon we looked funny to the onlookers looking on as we clattered down the street but we were off and that meant a heap
3934-102413-0025	train-other-500	All the morning our way lay up the beautiful river past the great red cliffs and through tiny green parks but just before noon the road wound itself up on to the mesa
3934-102413-0026	train-other-500	which is really the beginning of the desert We crowded into the shadow of the wagons to eat our midday meal but we could not stop long because it was twenty eight miles to where we could get water for the horses
3934-102413-0027	train-other-500	when we should camp that night So we wasted no time Shortly after noon we could see white clouds of alkali dust ahead By and by we came up with the dust raisers
3934-102413-0028	train-other-500	The children and I had got into the buckboard with missus O Shaughnessy and Miss Hull so as to ride easier and be able to gossip and we had driven ahead of the wagons so as to avoid the stinging dust
none	none	 The sun was just scorching when we overtook the funniest layout I have seen since Cora Belle two drove up to our door the first time In a wobbly old buckboard sat a young couple completely engrossed by each other 
3934-102413-0029	train-other-500	That he was a Westerner we knew by his cowboy hat and boots that she was an Easterner by her not knowing how to dress for the ride across the desert
3934-102413-0030	train-other-500	She wore a foolish little chiffon hat which the alkali dust had ruined and all the rest of her clothes matched
3934-102413-0031	train-other-500	But over them the enterprising young man had raised one of those big old sunshades that had lettering on them It kept wobbling about in the socket he had improvised one minute we could see Tea
none	none	 then a rut in the road would swing Coffee around 
3934-102413-0032	train-other-500	Their sunshade kept revolving about that way and sometimes their heads revolved a little bit too
none	none	 We could hear a word occasionally and knew they were having a great deal of fun at our expense but we were amused ourselves so we didn t care They would drive along slowly until we almost reached them then they would whip up and raise such a dust that we were almost choked Footnote two The story of Cora Belle is told in Letters of a Woman Homesteader missus O Shaughnessy determined to drive ahead so she trotted up alongside but she could not get ahead The young people were giggling missus O Shaughnessy doesn t like to be the joke all the time Suddenly she leaned over toward them and said 
3934-102413-0033	train-other-500	Will ye tell me something Oh yes they would Then she said which of you are Tea and which Coffee Their answer was to drive up faster and stir up a powerful lot of dust
3934-102413-0034	train-other-500	They kept pretty well ahead after that but at sundown we came up with them at the well where we were to camp This well had been sunk by the county for the convenience of travelers
3934-102413-0035	train-other-500	and we were mighty thankful to find it It came out that our young couple were bride and groom They had never seen each other until the night before having met through a matrimonial paper
3934-102413-0036	train-other-500	They had met in Green River and were married that morning and the young husband was taking her away up to Pinedale to his ranch They must have been ideally happy for they had forgotten their mess box and had only a light lunch
3934-102413-0037	train-other-500	They had only their lap robe for bedding They were in a predicament but the girl s chief concern was lest Honey bug should let the wolves get her Though it is scorching hot on the desert by day the nights are keenly cool
3934-102413-0038	train-other-500	and I was wondering how they would manage with only their lap robe when missus O Shaughnessy who cannot hold malice made a round of the camp getting a blanket here and a coat there until she had enough to make them comfortable
3934-102413-0039	train-other-500	Then she invited them to take their meals with us until they could get to where they could help themselves I think we all enjoyed camp that night for we were all tired We were in a shallow little canyon
3934-102413-0040	train-other-500	not a tree not even a bush except sage brush Luckily there was plenty of that so we had roaring fires We sat around the fire talking as the blue shadows faded into gray dusk and the big stars came out
3934-102413-0041	train-other-500	The newly weds were as the bride put it so full of happiness they had nothing to put it in Certainly their spirits overflowed They were eager to talk of themselves and we didn t mind listening
3934-102413-0042	train-other-500	They are mister and missus Tom Burney She is the oldest of a large family of children and has had to work out ever since she was big enough to get a job
3934-102413-0043	train-other-500	The people she had worked for rather frowned upon any matrimonial ventures and as no provision was made for help entertaining company she had never had a beau
none	none	 One day she got hold of a matrimonial paper and saw mister Burney s ad 
3934-102413-0044	train-other-500	She answered and they corresponded for several months We were just in time to catch it as mister Haynes who is a confirmed bachelor disgustedly remarked Personally I am glad
3934-102413-0045	train-other-500	I like them much better than I thought I should when they were raising so much dust so unnecessarily I must close this letter as I see the men are about ready to start
3934-102413-0046	train-other-500	The children are standing the trip well except that Robert is a little sun blistered Did I tell you we left Junior with his grandmother Even though I have the other three my heart is hungry for my big boy
none	none	 who is only a baby too He is such a precious little man I wish you could see him With a heart very full of love for you

many of us ashamed In the very center of the desert is a little settlement called Eden Valley Imagination must have had a heap to do with its name but one thing is certain the serpent will find the crawling rather bad if he attempts to enter this Eden for the sand is hot the alkali and the cactus are there so it must be a serpentless Eden The settlers have made a long canal and bring their water many miles They say the soil is splendid and they don t have much stone but it is such a flat place I wonder how they get the water to run when they irrigate We saw many deserted homes Hope s skeletons they are with their yawning doors and windows like eyeless sockets Some of the houses which looked as if they were deserted held families We camped near one such missus O Shaughnessy and I went up to the house to buy some eggs A hopeless looking woman came to the door The hot winds and the alkali dust had tanned her skin and bleached her hair both were a gray brown Her eyes were blue but were so tired looking that I could hardly see for the tears No she said we ain t got no eggs We ain t got no chickens You see this ground is sandy and last year the wind blowed awful hard and all the grain blowed out so we didn t have no chance to raise chickens We had no feed and no money to buy feed so we had to kill our chickens to save their lives We et em They would have starved anyway Then we tried for some vegetables Well she said they ain t much to look at maybe you ll not want em Our garden ain t much this year Pa has had to work out all the time The kids and me put in some seed all we had with a hoe We ain t got no horse our team died last winter We didn t have much feed and it was shore a hard winter We hated to see old Nick and Fanny die They were just like ones of the family We drove em clean from Missouri too But they died and what hurt me most was pa lowed it would be a turrible waste not to skin em I begged him not to Land knows the pore old things was entitled to their hides they got so little else but pa said it didn t make no difference to them whether they had any hide or not and that the skins would sell for enough to get the kids some shoes And they did A Jew junk man came through and give pa three dollars for the two hides and that paid for a pair each for Johnny and Eller Pa hated as bad as we did to lose our faithful old friends and all the winter long we grieved the kids and me Every time the coyotes yelped we knew they were gathering to gnaw poor old Nick and Fan s bones And pa to keep from crying himself when the kids and me would be sobbin would scold us My goodness he would say the horses are dead and they don t know nothin about cold and hunger They don t know nothin about sore shoulders and hard pulls now so why don t you shut up and let them and me rest in peace But that was only pa s way of hidin the tears When spring came the kids and me gathered all the bones and hair we could find of our good old team and buried em where you see that green spot That s grass We scooped all the trash out of the mangers and spread it over the grave and the timothy and the redtop seed in the trash came up and growed I d liked to have put some flowers there but we had no seed She wiped her face on her apron and gathered an armful of cabbage it had not headed but was the best she had missus O Shaughnessy seemed possessed she bought stuff she knew she would have to throw away but she didn t offer one word of sympathy I felt plumb out of patience with her for usually she can say the most comforting things Why don t you leave this place Why not go away somewhere else where it will not be so hard to start I asked Oh cause pa s heart is just set on making a go of it here and we would be just as pore anywhere else We have tried a heap of times to start a home and we ve worked hard but we were never so pore before We have been here three years and we can prove up soon then maybe we can go away and work somewhere enough to get a team anyway Pa has already worked out his water right he s got water for all his land paid for if we only had a team to plough with But we ll get it Pa s been workin all summer in the hay and he ought to have a little stake saved Then the sheep men will be bringin in their herds soon s frost comes and pa lows to get a job herdin Anyway we got to stick We ain t got no way to get away and all we got is right here Every last dollar we had has went into improvin this place If pore old hard worked pa can stand it the kids and me can We ain t seen pa for two months not sence hayin began but we work all we can to shorten the days and we sure do miss pore old Nick and Fan We gathered up as much of the vegetables as we could carry missus O Shaughnessy paid and we started homeward promising to send for the rest of the beets and potatoes On the way we met two children and knew them at once for Johnny and Eller They had pails and were carrying water from the stream and pouring it on the green spot that covered Nick and Fan We promised them each a dime if they would bring the vegetables we had left Their little faces shone and we had to hurry all we could to get supper ready before they came for we were determined they should eat supper with us We told the men before the little tykes came So mister Struble let Johnny shoot his gun and both youngsters rode Chub and Antifat to water They were bright little folks and their outlook upon life is not so flat and colorless as their mother s is A day holds a world of chance for them They were saving their money they told us to buy some house plants for ma Johnny had a dollar which a sheep man had given him for taking care of a sore footed dog Ella had a dime which a man had given her for filling his water bag They both hoped to pull wool off dead sheep and make some more money that way They had quite made up their minds about what they wanted to get it must be house plants for ma but still they both wished they could get some little thing for pa They were not pert or forward in any way but they answered readily and we all drew them out even the newly weds After supper the men took their guns and went out to shoot sage hens Johnny went with mister Haynes and mister Struble Miss Hull walked back with Ella and we sent missus Sanders a few cans of fruit missus O Shaughnessy and I washed the dishes We were talking of the Sanders family missus O Shaughnessy was disgusted with me because I wept You think it is a soft heart you have but it is only your head that is soft Of course they are having a hard time What of it The very root of independence is hard times That s the way America was founded that is why it stands so firmly Hard times is what makes sound characters And them kids are getting a new hold on character that was very near run to seed in the parents Johnny will be tax assessor yet I ll bet you and you just watch that Eller It won t surprise me a bit to see her county superintendent of schools The parents most likely never would make anything but having just only a pa and a ma and getting the very hard licks them kids are getting now is what is going to make them something more than a pa and a ma missus O Shaughnessy is very wise but sometimes she seems absolutely heartless The men didn t bring back much game each had left a share with missus Sanders Next morning we were astir early We pulled out of camp just as the first level rays of the sun shot across the desolate flat country We crossed the flat little stream with its soft sandy banks A willow here and there along the bank and the blue distant mountains and some lonesome buttes were all there was to break the monotony Yet we saw some prosperous looking places with many haystacks I looked back once toward the Sanders cabin The blue smoke was just beginning to curl upward from the stove pipe The green spot looked vividly green against the dim prospect Poor pa and poor ma Even if they could be nothing more I wish at least that they need not have given up Nick and Fan mister Haynes told us at breakfast that we would camp only one more night on the desert I am so glad of that The newly weds will leave us in two more days I m rather sorry they are much nicer than I thought they would be They have invited us to stay with them on our way back Well I must stop I wish I could put some of this clean morning air inside your apartments With much love E R S IV CRAZY OLAF AND OTHERS IN CAMP August thirty one nineteen fourteen DEAR missus CONEY We are across the desert and camped for a few days fishing on a shady bowery little stream 
3934-102415-0001	train-other-500	We have had two frosty nights and there are trembling golden groves on every hand Four men joined us at Newfork and the bachelors have gone on
3934-102415-0002	train-other-500	but mister Stewart wanted to rest the beasties and we all wanted to fish so we camped for a day or two The twenty eighth was the warmest day we have had the most disagreeable in every way
3934-102415-0003	train-other-500	Not a breath of air stirred except an occasional whirlwind which was hot and threw sand and dust over us We could see the heat glimmering and not a tree nor a green spot The mountains looked no nearer
3934-102415-0004	train-other-500	I am afraid we all rather wished we were at home
3934-102415-0005	train-other-500	Water was getting very scarce so the men wanted to reach by noon a long low valley they knew of for sometimes water could be found in a buried river bed there and they hoped to find enough for the horses
3934-102415-0006	train-other-500	But a little after noon we came to the spot and only dry glistening sand met our eyes The men emptied the water bags for the horses they all had a little water
3934-102415-0007	train-other-500	We had to be saving so none of us washed our dust grimed faces We were sitting in the scant shadow of the wagons eating our dinner when we were startled to see a tall bare headed man
3934-102415-0008	train-other-500	come racing down the draw His clothes and shoes were in tatters there were great blisters on his arms and shoulders where the sun had burned him his eyes were swollen and red and his lips were cracked and bloody
3934-102415-0009	train-other-500	His hair was so white and so dusty that altogether he was a pitiful looking object He greeted us pleasantly and said that his name was Olaf Swanson and that he was a sheep herder that he had seen us and had come to ask for a little smoking
3934-102415-0010	train-other-500	By that he meant tobacco missus O Shaughnessy was eyeing him very closely She asked him when he had eaten That morning he said She asked him what he had eaten
3934-102415-0011	train-other-500	he told her cactus balls and a little rabbit I saw her exchange glances with Professor Glenholdt and she left her dinner to get out her war bag She called Olaf aside and gently dressed his blisters with listerine
3934-102415-0012	train-other-500	after she had helped him to clean his mouth she said to him Now Olaf sit by me and eat show me how much you can eat Then tell me what you mean by saying you are a sheep herder
3934-102415-0013	train-other-500	don t you think we know there will be no sheep on the desert before there is snow to make water for them I am what I say I am he said I am not herding now because sorrow has drove me to dig wells
3934-102415-0014	train-other-500	It is sorrow for horses Have you not seen their bones every mile or so along this road Them s markers Every pile of bones marks where man s most faithful friend has laid down at last
3934-102415-0015	train-other-500	most of em died in the harness and for want of water I killed a horse once I was trying to have a good time I had been out with sheep for months and hadn t seen any one but my pardner
3934-102415-0016	train-other-500	We planned to have a rippin good time when we took the sheep in off the summer range and drew our pay You don t know how people hungry a man gets livin out So my pardner and me layed out to have one spree
3934-102415-0017	train-other-500	We had a neat little bunch of money but when we got to town we felt lost as sheep We didn t know nobody but the bartender We kept taking a drink now and then just so as to have him to talk to
3934-102415-0018	train-other-500	Finally he told us there was going to be a dance that night so we asked around and found we could get tickets for two dollars each Sam said he d like to go We bought tickets
3934-102415-0019	train-other-500	Somehow or another they knew us for sheep herders and every once in a while somebody would baa baa at us We had a couple of dances but after that we couldn t get a pardner
3934-102415-0020	train-other-500	After midnight things begun to get pretty noisy Sam and me was settin wonderin if we were havin a good time when a fellow stepped on Sam s foot and said baa
3934-102415-0021	train-other-500	I rose up and was goin to smash him but Sam collared me and said Let s get away from here Olaf before trouble breaks out
none	none	 It sounded as if every man in the house and some of the women were baa ing 
3934-102415-0022	train-other-500	We were pretty near the door when a man put his hand to his nose and baa ed I knocked him down and before you could bat your eye everybody was fightin We couldn t get out so we backed into a corner
3934-102415-0023	train-other-500	and every man my fist hit rested on the floor till somebody helped him away
none	none	 A fellow hit me on the head with a chair and I didn t know how I finished or got out The first thing I remember after that was feeling the greasewood thorns tearing my flesh and my clothes next day 
3934-102415-0024	train-other-500	We were away out on the desert not far from North Pilot butte Poor Sam couldn t speak I got him off poor old Pinto and took off the saddle for a pillow for him I hung the saddle blanket on a greasewood
3934-102415-0025	train-other-500	so as to shade his face then I got on my own poor horse poor old Billy and started to hunt help I rode and rode I was tryin to find some outfit
3934-102415-0026	train-other-500	When Billy lagged I beat him on You see I was thinking of Sam
none	none	 After a while the horse staggered 
3934-102415-0027	train-other-500	stepped into a badger hole I thought But he kept staggerin I fell off on one side just as he pitched forward He tried and tried to get up I stayed till he died then I kept walking
3934-102415-0028	train-other-500	I don t know what became of Sam I don t know what became of me but I do know I am going to dig wells all over this desert until every thirsty horse can have water All the time he had been eating just pickles
3934-102415-0029	train-other-500	when he finished his story he ate faster By now we all knew he was demented The men tried to coax him to go on with us so that they could turn him over to the authorities but he said he must be digging
3934-102415-0030	train-other-500	At last it was decided to send some one back for him mister Struble was unwilling to leave him but the man would not be persuaded Suddenly he gathered up his smoking and some food
3934-102415-0031	train-other-500	and ran back up the draw We had to go on of course All that afternoon our road lay along the buried river I don t mean dry river
3934-102415-0032	train-other-500	Sand had blown into the river until the water was buried Water was only a few feet down and the banks were clearly defined Sometimes we came to a small dirty puddle but it was so alkaline that nothing could drink it
3934-102415-0033	train-other-500	The story we had heard had saddened us all and we were sorry for our horses Poor little Elizabeth Hull wept She said the West was so big and bare and she was so alone and so sad she just had to cry
3934-102415-0034	train-other-500	About sundown we came to a ranch and were made welcome by one Timothy Hobbs owner of the place The dwelling and the stables were a collection of low brown houses made of logs and daubed with mud
3934-102415-0035	train-other-500	Fields of shocked grain made a very prosperous looking background A belled cow led a bunch of sleek cattle home over the sand dunes
none	none	 A well in the yard afforded plenty of clear cold water which was raised by a windmill 
3934-102415-0036	train-other-500	The cattle came and drank at the trough the bell making a pleasant sound in the twilight The men told mister Hobbs about the man we saw Oh yes he said that is Crazy Olaf
3934-102415-0037	train-other-500	He has been that way for twenty years Spends his time digging wells but he never gets any water and the sand caves in almost as fast as he can get it out Then he launched upon a recital of how he got sweet water
3934-102415-0038	train-other-500	by piping past the alkali strata I kept hoping he would tell how Olaf was kept and who was responsible for him but he never told He invited us to prepare our supper in his kitchen
3934-102415-0039	train-other-500	and as it was late and wood was scarce we were glad to accept He bustled about helping us adding such dainties as fresh milk butter and eggs to our menu
3934-102415-0040	train-other-500	He is a rather stout little man with merry gray eyes and brown hair beginning to gray He wore a red shirt and blue overalls and he wiped his butcher s knife impartially on the legs of his overalls or his towel
3934-102415-0041	train-other-500	just whichever was handiest as he hurried about cutting our bacon and opening cans for us missus O Shaughnessy and he got on famously After supper while she and Elizabeth washed the dishes
3934-102415-0042	train-other-500	she asked him why he didn t get married and have some one to look after him and his cabin I don t have time he answered I came West eighteen years ago to make a start and a home for Jennie and me
3934-102415-0043	train-other-500	but I can t find time to go back and get her In the summer I have to hustle to make the hay and grain and I have to stay and feed the stock all the rest of the time You write her once in a while don t you asked missus O Shaughnessy
3934-102415-0044	train-other-500	Yes he said I wrote her two years ago come April then I was so busy I didn t go to town till I went for my year s supplies I went to the post office and sure enough there was a letter for me
3934-102415-0045	train-other-500	been waitin for me for six months You see the postmaster knows me and never would send a letter back I set down there right in the office and answered it I told her how it was
3934-102415-0046	train-other-500	told her I was coming after her soon as I could find time You see she refuses to come to me cause I am so far from the railroad and she is afraid of Indians and wild animals
3934-102415-0047	train-other-500	Have you got your answer asked Elizabeth No he said I ain t had time yet to go but I kind of wish somebody would think to bring the mail Not many people pass here
3934-102415-0048	train-other-500	only when the open season takes hunters to the mountains When you people come back will you stop and ask for the mail for me
none	none	 We promised In the purple and amber light of a new day we were about and soon were on the road By nightfall we had bidden the desert a glad farewell and had camped on a large stream among trees How glad we were to see so much water and such big cottonwoods mister and missus Burney were within a day s drive of home so they left us This camp is at Newfork and our party has four new members a doctor a moving picture man and two geological fellows They have gone on but we will join them soon Just across the creek from us is the cabin of a new settler missus O Shaughnessy and I slept together last night only we couldn t sleep for the continual whining cry of a sick baby at the cabin So after a while we rose and dressed and crossed over to see if we could be of any help We found a woefully distressed young couple Their first child about a year old was very sick They didn t know what to do for it and she was afraid to stay alone while he went for help They were powerfully glad to see us and the young father left at once to get Grandma Mortimer a neighborhood godsend such as most Western communities have one of We busied ourselves relieving the young mother as much as we could She wouldn t leave the baby and lie down The child is teething and had convulsions We put it into a hot bath and held the convulsions in check until missus Mortimer came She bustled in and took hold in a way to insure confidence She had not been there long before she had both parents in bed saving themselves for to morrow and was gently rubbing the hot little body of the baby She kept giving it warm tea she had made of herbs until soon the threatening jerks were over the peevish whining ceased and the child slept peacefully on Grandma s lap I watched her fascinated There was never a bit of faltering no indecision everything she did seemed exactly what she ought to do How did you learn it all I asked her How can you know just what to do and then have the courage to do it I should be afraid of doing the wrong thing Why she said that is easy Just do the very best you can and trust God for the rest After all it is God who saves the baby not us and not our efforts but we can help He lets us do that Lots of times the good we do goes beyond any medicine Never be afraid to help your best I have been doing that for forty years and I am going to keep it up till I die Then she told us story after story told us how her different ambitions had boosted her along had made her swim when she just wanted to float I was married when I was sixteen and of course my first ambition was to own a home for Dave My man was poor He had a horse and his folks gave him another My father gave me a heifer and mother fitted me out with a bed That was counted a pretty good start then but we would have married even if we hadn t had one thing Being young we were over hopeful We both took to work like a duck to water Some years it looked as if we were going to see every dream come true Another time and we would be poorer than at first One year the hail destroyed everything another time the flood carried away all we had When little Dave was eleven years old he had learned to plough Every one of us was working to our limit that year I ploughed and hoed both and big Dave really hardly took time to sleep You see his idea was that we must do better by our children than we had been done by and Fanny our eldest was thirteen Big Dave thought all girls married at sixteen because his mother did and so did I so that spring he said In just three years Fanny will be leaving us and we must do right by her I wanted powerfully bad that you should have a blue silk wedding dress mother but of course it couldn t be had and you looked as pretty as a rose in your pink lawn But I ve always wanted you to have a blue silk As you can t have it let us get it for Fanny and of course we must have everything else according And so we worked mighty hard Little Dave begged to be allowed to plough Every other boy in the neighborhood did some of them younger than he but somehow I didn t want him to One of our neighbors had been sick a lot that year and his crops were about ruined It was laying by time and we had finished laying by our crops all but about half a day s ploughing in the corn That morning at breakfast big Dave said he would take the horses and go over to Henry Boles s and plough that day to help out said he could finish ours any time and it didn t matter much if it didn t get ploughed He told the children to lay off that day and go fishing and berrying So he went to harness his team and little Dave went to help him Fanny and I went to milk and all the time I could hear little Dave begging his father to let him finish the ploughing His father said he could if I said so I will never forget his eager little face as he began on me He had a heap of freckles I remember noticing them that morning he was barefooted and I remember that one toe was skinned Big Dave was lighting his pipe and till to day I remember how he looked as he held the match to his pipe drew a puff of smoke and said Say yes mother So I said yes and little Dave ran to open the gate for his father As big Dave rode through the gate our boy caught him by the leg and said I just love you daddy Big Dave bent down and kissed him and said You re a man son How proud that made the little fellow Parents should praise their children more the little things work hard for a few words of praise and many of them never get their pay Well the little fellow would have no help to harness his mule so Fanny and I went to the house and Fanny said We ought to cook an extra good dinner to celebrate Davie s first ploughing I ll go down in the pasture and gather some blackberries if you will make a cobbler She was gone all morning About ten o clock I took a pail of fresh water down to the field I knew Davie would be thirsty and I was uneasy about him but he was all right He pushed his ragged old hat back and wiped the sweat from his brow just as his father would have done I petted him a little but he was so mannish he didn t want me to pet him any more After he drank he took up his lines again and said Just watch me mother see how I can plough I told him that we were going to have chicken and dumplings for dinner and that he must sit in his father s place and help us to berry cobbler As he had only a few more rows to plough I went back telling myself how foolish I had been to be afraid Twelve o clock came but not Davie I sent Fanny to the spring for the buttermilk and waited a while thinking little Dave had not finished as soon as he had expected I went to the field Little Dave lay on his face in the furrow I gathered him up in my arms he was yet alive he put one weak little arm around my neck and said Oh mammy I m hurt The mule kicked me in the stomach I don t know how I got to the house with him I stumbled over clods and weeds through the hot sunshine I sank down on the porch in the shade with the precious little form clasped tightly to me He smiled and tried to speak but the blood gurgled up into his throat and my little boy was gone I would have died of grief if I hadn t had to work so hard Big Dave got too warm at work that day and when Fanny went for him and told him about little Dave he ran all the way home he was crazy with grief and forgot the horses The trouble and the heat and the overwork brought on a fever I had no time for tears for three months and by that time my heart was hardened against my Maker I got deeper in the rut of work but I had given up my ambition for a home of my own all I wanted to do was to work so hard that I could not think of the little grave on which the leaves were falling I wanted too to save enough money to mark the precious spot and then I wanted to leave But first one thing and then another took every dollar we made for three years One morning big Dave looked so worn out and pale that I said I am going to get out of here I am not going to stay here and bury you Dave Sunrise to morrow will see us on the road West We have worked for eighteen years as hard as we knew how and have given up my boy besides and now we can t even afford to mark his grave decently It is time we left Big Dave went back to bed and I went out and sold what we had It was so little that it didn t take long to sell it That was years ago We came West The country was really wild then there was a great deal of lawlessness We didn t get settled down for several years we hired to a man who had a contract to put up hay for the government and we worked for him for a long time Indians were thick as fleas on a dog then some were camped near us once and among them was a Mexican woman who could jabber a little English Once when I was feeling particularly resentful and sorrowful I told her about my little Dave and it was her jabbered words that showed me the way to peace I wept for hours but peace had come and has stayed Ambition came again but a different kind I wanted the same peace to come to all hearts that came so late to mine and I wanted to help bring it I took the only course I knew I have gone to others help every time there has been a chance After Fanny married and Dave died I had an ambition to save up four hundred dollars with which to buy an entrance into an old ladies home Just before I got the full amount saved up I found that young Eddie Carwell wanted to enter the ministry and needed help to go to college I had just enough so I gave it to him Another time I had almost enough when Charlie Rucker got into trouble over some mortgage business so I used what I had that time to help him Now I ve given up the old ladies home idea and am saving up for the blue silk dress Dave would have liked me to have I guess I ll die some day and I want it to be buried in I like to think I m going to my two Daves then and it won t be hard especially if I have the blue silk on Just then a sleepy little bird twittered outside and the baby stirred a little The first faint light of dawn was just creeping up the valley I rose and said I must get back to camp missus O Shaughnessy and I had both wept with missus Mortimer over little Dave We have all given up our first born little man child so we felt near each other We told missus Mortimer that we had passed under the rod also I kissed her toilworn old hands and missus O Shaughnessy dropped a kiss on her old gray head as we passed out into the rose and gold morning We felt that we were leaving a sanctified presence and we are both of us better and humbler women because we met a woman who has buried her sorrow beneath faith and endeavor This doesn t seem much like a letter does it When I started on this trip I resolved that you should have just as much of the trip as I could give you I didn t know we would be so long getting to the hunting ground and I felt you would like to know of the people we meet Perhaps my next letter will not be so tame The hunting season opens to morrow but we are several days travel from the elk yet Elizabeth behaves queerly She doesn t want to go on stay here or go back I am perfectly mystified So far she has not told us a thing and we don t know to whom she is going or anything about it She is a likable little lady and I sincerely hope she knows what she is doing It is bedtime and I must stop writing We go on to morrow With affectionate regards ELINORE RUPERT STEWART V DANYUL AND HIS MOTHER IN CAMP ON THE GROS VENTRE September six nineteen fourteen MY DEAR FRIEND I have neglected you for almost a week but when you read this letter and learn why I feel sure you will forgive me To begin with we bade missus Mortimer good bye and started out to find better fishing than the pretty little stream we were on afforded us Our way lay up Green River and we were getting nearer our final camp ground all the time but we were in no hurry to begin hunting so we were just loitering along There were a great many little lakes along the valley and thousands of duck mister Stewart was driving but as he wanted to shoot ducks I took the lines and drove along There is so much that is beautiful and I was trying so hard to see it all that I took the wrong road but none of us noticed it at first and then we didn t think it worth while to turn back The road we were on had lain along the foothills but when I first thought I had missed the right road we were coming down into a grassy valley mister Stewart came across a marshy stretch of meadow and climbed up on the wagon The ground was more level and on every side were marshes and pools the willows grew higher here so that we couldn t see far ahead missus O Shaughnessy was behind and she called out Say I believe we are off the road Elizabeth said she had noticed a road winding off on our right so we agreed that I must have taken the wrong one but as we couldn t turn in the willows we had to go on Soon we reached higher drier ground and passed through a yellow grove of quaking asp A man came along with an axe on his shoulder and mister Stewart asked him about the road Yes he said you are off the main road but on a better You ll cross the same stream you were going to camp on right at my ranch It is just a little way across here and it s almost sundown so I will show you the way He strode along ahead We drove through an avenue of great dark pines and across a log bridge that spanned a noisy brawling stream The man opened a set of bars and we drove into a big clean corral Comfortable sheds and stables lined one side and big stacks of hay were conveniently placed He began to help unharness the teams saying that they might just as well run in his meadow as he was through haying then the horses would be safe while we fished He insisted on our stopping in his cabin which we found to be a comfortable two room affair with a veranda the whole length The biggest pines overshadowed the house just behind it was a garden in which some late vegetables were still growing The air was rather frosty and some worried hens were trying hard to cover some chirping half feathered chicks It was such a homey place that we felt welcome and perfectly comfortable at once The inside of the house will not be hard to describe It was clean as could be but with a typical bachelor s cleanliness there was no dirt but a great deal of disorder Across the head of the iron bed was hung a miscellany of socks neckties and suspenders A discouraging assortment of boots shoes and leggings protruded from beneath the bed Some calendars ornamented the wall and upon a table stood a smoky lamp and some tobacco and a smelly pipe On a rack over the door lay a rifle Pretty soon our host came bustling in and exclaimed The kitchen is more pleasant than this room and there s a fire there too Then catching sight of his lamp he picked it up hurriedly and said Jest as shore as I leave anything undone that shore somebody comes and sees how slouchy I am Come on into the kitchen where you can warm and I ll clean this lamp One of the cows was sick this morning I hurried over things so as to doctor her and I forgot the lamp I smoke and the lamp smokes to keep me company The kitchen would have delighted the heart of any one Two great windows one in the east and one in the south gave plenty of sunlight A shining new range and a fine assortment of vessels which were not all yet in their place were in one corner There was a slow ticking clock up on a high shelf near the door stood a homemade wash stand with a tin basin and above it hung a long narrow mirror On the back of the door was a towel rack The floor was made of white pine and was spotlessly clean In the center of the room stood the table with a cover of red oilcloth Some chairs were placed about the table but our host quickly hauled them out for us He opened his storeroom and told us to dish in dirty face and help ourselves to anything we wanted because we were to be his somebody come for that night then he hurried out to help with the teams again He was so friendly and so likeable that we didn t feel a bit backward about dishin in and it was not long before we had a smoking supper on the table While we were at supper he said I wonder now if any of you women can make aprons and bonnets I don t mean them dinky little things like they make now but rale wearin things like they used to make I was afraid of another advertisement romance and didn t reply but missus O Shaughnessy said Indade we can none better Then he answered I want a blue chambray bonnet and a bunch of aprons made for my mother She is on the way here from Pennsylvania I ain t seen her for fifteen years I left home longer n that ago but I remember everything just how everything looked and I d like to have things inside the house as nearly like home as I can anyway I didn t know how long we could stop there so I still made no promises but missus O Shaughnessy could easily answer every question for a dozen women Have you the cloth she asked Yes he said he had had it for a long time but he had not had it sewn because he had not been sure mother could come What s your name asked missus O Shaughnessy He hesitated a moment then said Daniel Holt I wondered why he hesitated but forgot all about it when Clyde said we would stop there for a few days if we wanted to help mister Holt missus O Shaughnessy s mind was already made up Elizabeth said she would be glad to help and I was not long in deciding when Daniel said I ll take it as a rale friendly favor if you women could help because mother ain t had what could rightly be called a home since I left home She s crippled too and I want to do all I can I know she d just like to have some aprons and a sunbonnet His eyes had such a pathetic appealing look that I was ashamed and we at once began planning our work Daniel helped with the dishes and as soon as they were done brought out his cloth He had a heap of it a bolt of checked gingham enough blue chambray for half a dozen bonnets and a great many remnants which he said he had bought from peddlers from time to time missus O Shaughnessy selected what she said we would begin on and dampened it so as to shrink it by morning We then spread our beds and made ready for an early start next day Next morning we ate breakfast by the light of the lamp that smoked for the sake of companionship and then started to cut out our work Daniel and mister Stewart went fishing and we packed their lunch so as to have them out of the way all day I undertook the making of the bonnet because I knew how and because I can remember the kind my mother wore I reckoned Daniel s mother would have worn about the same style missus O Shaughnessy and Elizabeth can both cross stitch so they went out to Daniel s granary and ripped up some grain bags in order to get the thread with which they were sewed to work one apron in cross stitch But when we were ready to sew we were dismayed for there was no machine missus O Shaughnessy however was of the opinion that some one in the country must have a sewing machine so she saddled a horse and went out she said to beat the brush She was hardly out of sight before a man rode up and said there had been a telephone message saying that missus Holt had arrived in Rock Springs and was on her way as far as Newfork in an automobile That threw Elizabeth and myself into a panic We posted the messenger off on a hunt for Daniel Elizabeth soon got over her flurry and went at her cross stitching I hardly knew what to do but acting from force of habit I reckon I began cleaning A powerfully good way to reason out things sometimes is to work and just then I had to work I began on the storeroom which was well lighted and which was also used as a pantry As soon as I began straightening up I began to wonder where the mother would sleep By arranging things in the storeroom a little differently I was able to make room for a bed and a trunk I decided on putting Daniel there so then I began work in earnest Elizabeth laid down her work and helped me We tacked white cheesecloth over the wall and although the floor was clean we scrubbed it to freshen it We polished the window until it sparkled We were right in the middle of our work when missus O Shaughnessy came and Daniel with her They were all excitement but missus O Shaughnessy is a real general and soon marshaled her forces Daniel had to go to Newfork after his mother that would take three days missus O Shaughnessy pointed out to him the need of a few pieces of furniture so he took a wagon and team which he got a neighbor to drive while he took another team and a buggy for his mother Newfork is a day s drive beyond Pinedale and the necessary furniture could be had in Pinedale so the neighbor went along and brought back a new bed a rocker and some rugs But of course he had to stay overnight I was for keeping right on house cleaning but as missus O Shaughnessy had arranged for us all to come and sew that afternoon at a near by house we took our sewing and clambered into the buckboard and set out We found missus Bonham a pleasant little woman whose husband had earned her pretty new machine by chewing tobacco I reckon you think that is a mighty funny method of earning anything but some tobacco has tags which are redeemable and the machine was one of the premiums missus Bonham just beamed with pride as she rolled out her machine I never had a machine before she explained I just went to the neighbors when I had to sew So of course I wanted a machine awfully bad So Frank jest chawed and chawed and I saved every tag till we got enough and last year we got the machine Frank is chawin out a clock now but that won t take him so long as the machine did Well the chawed out machine did splendidly and we turned out some good work that afternoon I completed the blue bonnet which was to be used as best and made a splint bonnet missus O Shaughnessy and Elizabeth did well on their aprons We took turns about at the machine and not a minute was wasted missus Bonham showed us some crochet lace which she said she hoped to sell and right at once missus O Shaughnessy s fertile mind begin to hatch plans She would make missus Holt a Sunday apron she said and she bought the lace to trim it with I thought missus Holt must be an old fashioned lady who liked pillow shams missus Bonham had a pretty pair she was willing to sell On one was worked Good Morning on the other Good Night it was done with red cotton The shams had a dainty edge of homemade lace Elizabeth would not be outdone she purchased a star quilt pieced in red and white At sundown we went home We were all tired but as soon as supper was over we went to work again We took down the bed and set it up in Dan s new quarters and we made such headway on what had been his bedroom that we knew we could finish in a little while next day The next morning as soon as we had breakfasted missus O Shaughnessy and Elizabeth went back to sew taking with them a lot of white cheesecloth for lining for the bedroom we were preparing for missus Holt mister Stewart had had fine luck fishing but he said he felt plumb left out with so much bustling about and he not helping He is very handy with a saw and hammer and he contrived what we called a chist of drawers for Daniel s room The chist had only one drawer into that we put all the gloves ties handkerchiefs and suspenders and on the shelves below we put his shoes and boots Then I made a blue curtain for the chist and one for the window and the room looked plumb nice I can tell you I liked the chist so well that I asked mister Stewart to make something of the kind for missus Holt s room He said there wouldn t be time but he went to work on it Promptly at noon missus O Shaughnessy and Elizabeth came with the lining for the room We worked like beavers and had the room sweet and ready by mid afternoon when the man came from Pinedale with the new furniture In just a little while we had the room in perfect order the bed nicely made with soft new blankets for sheets the pretty star quilt on and the nice clean pillows protected by the shams They could buy no rugs but a weaver of rag carpets in Pinedale had some pieces of carpet which Daniel sent back to us They were really better and greatly more in keeping We were very proud of the pretty white and red room when we were through Only the kitchen was left but we decided we could clean that early next day so we sat down to sew and to plan the next day s dinner We could hear mister Stewart out in the barn hammering and sawing on the chist While we were debating whether to have fried chicken or trout for dinner two little girls both on one horse rode up They entered shyly and after carefully explaining to us that they had heard that a wagon load of women were buying everything they could see had run mister Holt off and were living in his house they told us they had come to sell us some blueing When they got two dollars worth sold the blueing company would send them a big doll so please would we buy a lot We didn t think we could use any blueing but we hated to disappoint the little things We talked along and presently they told us of their mother s flowers Daniel had told us his mother always had a red flower in her kitchen window When the little girls assured us their mother had a red geranium in bloom missus O Shaughnessy set out to get it and about dark she returned with a beautiful plant just beginning to bloom We were all as happy as children we had all worked very hard too mister Stewart said we deserved no sympathy because we cleaned a perfectly clean house but anyway we felt much better for having gone over it The chist was finished early next morning It would have looked better perhaps if it had had a little paint but as we had no paint and were short of time we persuaded ourselves it looked beautiful with only its clean pretty curtain We didn t make many changes in the kitchen All we did was to take down the mirror and turn it lengthways above the mantel shelf over the fireplace We put the new rocker in the bright sunny corner where it would be easier for dim old eyes to see to read or sew We set the geranium on the broad clean sill of the window and I think you would have agreed with us that it was a cozy cheerful home to come to after fifteen years of lonely homelessness We couldn t get the dinner question settled so we dished in dirty face each cooked what she thought best Like Samantha Ann Allen we had everything good and plenty of it Elizabeth took a real interest and worked well She is the dearest girl and would be a precious daughter to some mother She has not yet told us anything about herself All we know is she taught school somewhere in the East She was a little surprised at the way we took possession of a stranger s home but she enjoyed it as much as we It is so nice to be doing something for some one again something real homey and family like she remarked as she laid the table for dinner We had dinner almost ready when we heard the wheels crossing the mossy log bridge We raced to let down the bars Beside Daniel sat a dear dumpy little woman her head very much bundled up with a lot of old black veils Daniel drove through the corral into the yard and right up to the door He helped her out so gently She kept admonishing him Careful Danyul careful He handed out her crutch and helped her into the kitchen where she sank panting into the rocker It is my leg she explained it has been that way ever since Danyul was a baby Then she pleaded Careful careful to Elizabeth who was tenderly unwrapping her I wouldn t have anything happen to this brown alapacky for anything it is my very best and I ve had it ever since before I went to the pore farm but I wanted to look nice for Danyul comin to his home for the first time an all We had the happiest dinner party I ever remember It would be powerfully hard for me to say which was happier Danyul or his mother They just beamed upon each other She was proud of her boy and his pleasant home Danyul says he s got a little red heifer for me and he s got ten cows of his own Now ain t that fine It is a pity we can t have a few apple trees a little orchard We d live like kings we would that We explained to her how we got our fruit by parcel post and Danyul said he would order his winter supply of apples at once As soon as dinner was over Danyul had to mend a fence so as to keep his cattle in their own pasture mister Stewart went to help and we women were left alone We improved the time well missus Holt would not lie down and rest as we tried to persuade her to but hobbled about admiring everything She was delighted with the big clean cellar and its orderly bins in which Danyul was beginning to store his vegetables She was as pleased as a child with her room and almost wept when we told her which were welcoming presents from us She was particularly delighted with her red flower and missus O Shaughnessy will be happy for days remembering it was she who gave it I shall be happy longer than that remembering how tickled she was with her bonnets She wanted to wipe the dishes so she and I did up the dishes while missus O Shaughnessy and Elizabeth put some finishing stitches in on their aprons She sat on the highest seat we could find and as she deftly handled the dishes she told us this I should think you would wonder why Danyul ain t got me out of the porehouse before now I ve been there more n ten years but Danyul didn t know it till a month ago Charlotte Nash wrote him Neither Danyul nor me are any master hand at writin and then I didn t want him to know anyhow When Danyul got into trouble I signed over the little farm his pa left us to pay the lawyer person to defend him Danyul had enough trouble so he went to the penitentiary without finding out I was homeless I should think you would be put out to know Danyul has been to the pen but he has He always said to me that he never done what he was accused of so I am not going to tell you what it was Danyul was always a good boy honest and good to me and a hard worker I ain t got no call to doubt him when he says he s innocent Well I fought his case the best I could but he got ten years Then the lawyer person claimed the home an all so I went out to work but bein crippled I found it hard When Danyul had been gone four years I had saved enough to buy my brown alapacky and go to see him He looked pale and sad afraid even to speak to his own mother I went back to work as broke up as Danyul and that winter I come down with such a long spell of sickness that they sent me to the pore farm I always wrote to Danyul on his birthday and I couldn t bear to let him know where I was Soon s his time was out he come here he couldn t bear the scorn that he d get at home so he come out to this big free West and took the chance it offers Once he wrote and asked me if I would like to live West He said if I did after he got a start I must sell out and come to him Bless his heart all that time I was going to my meals just when I was told to and eatin just what I was helped to going to bed and getting up at some one else s word Oh it was bitter but I didn t want Danyul to taste it so when I didn t come he thought I didn t want to give up the old home and didn t say no more about it Charlotte was on the pore farm too until her cousin died and she got left a home and enough to live on Sometimes she would come out to the farm and take me back with her for a little visit She was good that way I never would tell her about Danyul but this summer I was helpin her dry apples and somehow she jist coaxed the secret out She wrote to Danyul and he wrote to me and here I am Danyul and me are so happy that we are goin to send a ticket back to the farm for Maggie Harper She ain t got no home and will be glad to help me and get a rale home missus O Shaughnessy and Elizabeth debated what more was needed to make the kitchen a bit more homey missus O Shaughnessy said a red cushion for the rocker and Elizabeth said a white cat to lie on the hearth missus Holt said Yes I do need em both only it must be an old stray tabby cat This house is going to be the shelter of the homeless Well I can t tell you any more about the Holts because we left next morning Danyul came across the bridge to bid us good bye He said he could never thank us enough but it is we who should be and are thankful We got a little glow of happiness from their great blaze We are all so glad to know that everything is secure and bright for the Holts in the future That stop is the cause of my missing two letters to you but this letter is as long as half a dozen letters should be You know I never could get along with few words I ll try to do better next time But I can t imagine how I shall get the letters mailed We are miles and miles and miles away in the mountains it is two days ride to a post office so maybe I will not get letters to you as often as I planned Sincerely yours ELINORE RUPERT STEWART VI ELIZABETH S ROMANCE 
7511_102419_000003_000000	train-clean-100	CAMP CLOUDCREST September twelve nineteen fourteen 
none	none	DEAR missus CONEY 
7511_102419_000005_000000	train-clean-100	I find I can t write to you as often as I at first intended but I ve a chance to day so I will not let it pass unused 
7511_102419_000005_000001	train-clean-100	We are in the last camp right on the hunting ground in the midst of the fray We have said good bye to dear Elizabeth and I must tell you about her because she really comes first 
7511_102419_000006_000000	train-clean-100	To begin with the morning we left the Holts Elizabeth suggested that we three women ride in the buckboard so I seated myself on a roll of bedding in the back part 
none	none	At first none of us talked we just absorbed the wonderful green gold beauty of the morning 
7511_102419_000006_000002	train-clean-100	The sky was clear blue with a few fleecy clouds drifting lazily past 
7511_102419_000006_000003	train-clean-100	The mountains on one side were crested great crags and piles of rock crowned them as far as we could see timber grew only about halfway up 
none	none	The trunks of the quaking aspens shone silvery in the early sunlight and their leaves were shimmering gold 
7511_102419_000006_000005	train-clean-100	And the stately pines kept whispering and murmuring it almost seemed as if they were chiding the quaking aspens for being frivolous 
none	none	On the other side of the road lay the river bordered by willows and grassy flats There were many small lakes and the ducks and geese were noisily enjoying themselves among the rushes and water grasses Beyond the river rose the forest covered mountains hill upon hill Elizabeth dressed with especial care that morning and very pretty she looked in her neat shepherd s plaid suit and natty little white canvas hat Very soon she said I hope neither of you will misunderstand me when I tell you that if my hopes are realized I will not ride with you much longer I never saw such a country as the West it is so big and so beautiful and I never saw such people You are just like your country you have fed me cared for me and befriended me a stranger and never asked me a word 
7511_102419_000008_000000	train-clean-100	missus O Shaughnessy said Tut tut tis nothing at all we ve done Tis a comfort you ve been hasn t she missus Stewart 
7511_102419_000009_000000	train-clean-100	I could heartily agree and Elizabeth went on The way I have been received and the way we all treated missus Holt will be the greatest help to me in becoming what I hope to become a real Westerner 
none	none	I might have lived a long time in the West and not have understood many things if I had not fallen into your hands 
7511_102419_000009_000002	train-clean-100	Years ago before I was through school I was to have been married but I lost my mother just then and was left the care of my paralytic father 
none	none	If I had married then I should have had to take father from his familiar surroundings because Wallace came West in the forestry service 
7511_102419_000009_000004	train-clean-100	I felt that it wouldn t be right 
7511_102419_000009_000005	train-clean-100	Poor father couldn t speak but his eyes told me how grateful he was to stay 
7511_102419_000009_000006	train-clean-100	We had our little home and father had his pension and I was able to get a small school near us 
7511_102419_000009_000007	train-clean-100	I could take care of father and teach also 
7511_102419_000009_000008	train-clean-100	We were very comfortably situated and in time became really happy 
7511_102419_000009_000009	train-clean-100	Although I seldom heard from Wallace his letters were well worth waiting for and I knew he was doing well 
7511_102419_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 Eighteen months ago father died gently went to sleep 
7511_102419_000010_000001	train-clean-100	I waited six months and then wrote to Wallace but received no reply 
7511_102419_000010_000002	train-clean-100	I have written him three times and have had no word 
7511_102419_000010_000003	train-clean-100	I could bear it no longer and have come to see what has become of him 
7511_102419_000010_000004	train-clean-100	If he is dead may I stay on with one of you and perhaps get a school 
7511_102419_000010_000005	train-clean-100	I want to live here always 
7511_102419_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 But darlint said missus O Shaughnessy supposin it s married your man is 
7511_102419_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 Wallace may have changed his mind about me but he would not marry without telling me 
7511_102419_000012_000001	train-clean-100	If he is alive he is honorable 
none	none	Then I asked Why didn t you ask about him at Pinedale or any of these places we have passed If he is stationed in the Bridges reserve they would be sure to know of him at any of these little places
7511_102419_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 I just didn t have the courage to 
7511_102419_000014_000001	train-clean-100	I should never have told you what I have only I think I owe it to you and it was easier because of the Holts 
7511_102419_000014_000002	train-clean-100	I am so glad we met them 
none	none	So we drove along talking together we each assured the girl of our entire willingness to have her as a member of the family 
7511_102419_000015_000001	train-clean-100	After a while I got on to the wagon with mister Stewart and told him Elizabeth s story so that he could inquire about the man 
7511_102419_000015_000002	train-clean-100	Soon we came to the crossing on Green River 
7511_102419_000015_000003	train-clean-100	Just beyond the ford we could see the game warden s cabin with the stars and stripes fluttering gayly in the fresh morning breeze 
none	none	We drove into the roaring dashing water and we held our breath until we emerged on the other side mister Sorenson is a very capable and conscientious game warden and a very genial gentleman 
7511_102419_000016_000001	train-clean-100	He rode down to meet us to inspect our license and to tell us about our privileges and our duties as good woodsmen 
7511_102419_000016_000002	train-clean-100	He also issues licenses in case hunters have neglected to secure them before coming 
7511_102419_000016_000003	train-clean-100	missus O Shaughnessy had refused to get a license when we did 
7511_102419_000016_000004	train-clean-100	She said she was not going to hunt she told us we could give her a small piece of ilk and that would do so we were rather surprised when she purchased two licenses one a special which would entitle her to a bull elk 
none	none	As we were starting mister Stewart asked the game warden Can you tell me if Wallace White is still stationed here Oh yes mister Sorenson said Wallace s place is only a few miles up the river and can be plainly seen from the road We drove on 
7511_102419_000017_000001	train-clean-100	Happiness had taken a new clutch upon my heart 
7511_102419_000017_000002	train-clean-100	I looked back expecting to see Elizabeth all smiles but if you will believe me the foolish girl was sobbing as if her heart was broken 
7511_102419_000017_000003	train-clean-100	missus O Shaughnessy drew her head down upon her shoulder and was trying to quiet her 
none	none	The road along there was very rough 
7511_102419_000017_000005	train-clean-100	Staying on the wagon occupied all my attention for a while 
7511_102419_000017_000006	train-clean-100	Several miles were passed when we came in sight of a beautiful cabin half hidden in a grove of pines beyond the river 
7511_102419_000017_000007	train-clean-100	mister Stewart said we might as well noon as soon as we came to a good place and then he would ride across and see mister White 
7511_102419_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Just as we rounded the hill a horseman came toward us 
7511_102419_000018_000001	train-clean-100	A splendid fellow he was manly strength and grace showing in every line 
7511_102419_000018_000002	train-clean-100	The road was narrow against the hillside and he had to ride quite close so I saw his handsome face plainly 
none	none	As soon as he saw Elizabeth he sprang from his saddle and said Liz beth Liz beth what you doin here She held her hands to him and said Oh just riding with friends Then to missus O Shaughnessy she said This is my Wallace 
7511_102419_000020_000000	train-clean-100	mister Stewart is the queerest man instead of letting me enjoy the tableau he solemnly drove on saying he would not want any one gawking at him if he were the happy man 
7511_102419_000020_000001	train-clean-100	Anyway he couldn t urge Chub fast enough to prevent my seeing and hearing what I ve told you Besides that I saw that Elizabeth s hat was on awry her hair in disorder and her eyes red 
7511_102419_000020_000002	train-clean-100	It was disappointing after she had been so careful to look nicely 
none	none	missus O Shaughnessy came trotting along and we stopped for dinner 
7511_102419_000021_000001	train-clean-100	We had just got the coffee boiling when the lovers came up Elizabeth in the saddle learning to ride and he walking beside her holding her hand 
7511_102419_000021_000002	train-clean-100	How happy they were 
7511_102419_000021_000003	train-clean-100	The rest of us were mighty near as foolish as they 
7511_102419_000021_000004	train-clean-100	They were going to start immediately after dinner on horseback for the county seat to be married 
7511_102419_000021_000005	train-clean-100	After we had eaten Elizabeth selected a few things from her trunk and mister Stewart and mister White drove the buckboard across the river to leave the trunk in its new home 
7511_102419_000021_000006	train-clean-100	While they were gone we helped Elizabeth to dress 
none	none	All the while missus O Shaughnessy was admonishing her to name her first girul Mary Ellen or she said if yer first girul happens to be a b y it s Sheridan ye ll be callin him which was me name before I was married to me man God rest his soul 
7511_102419_000022_000000	train-clean-100	Dear Elizabeth she was glad to get away I suspect 
7511_102419_000022_000001	train-clean-100	She and her Wallace made a fine couple as they rode away in the golden September afternoon 
none	none	I believe she is one happy bride that the sun shone on if the omen has failed everywhere else 
7511_102419_000023_000000	train-clean-100	Well we felt powerfully reduced in numbers but about three o clock that afternoon we came upon mister Struble and mister Haynes waiting beside the road for us 
7511_102419_000023_000001	train-clean-100	They had come to pilot us into camp for there would be no road soon 
7511_102419_000024_000000	train-clean-100	Such a way as we came over 
7511_102419_000024_000001	train-clean-100	Such jolting and sliding 
7511_102419_000024_000002	train-clean-100	I begged to get off and walk but as the whole way was carpeted by strawberry vines and there were late berries to tempt me to loiter I had to stay on the wagon 
none	none	I had no idea a wagon could be got across such places 
7511_102419_000025_000000	train-clean-100	mister Struble drove for missus O Shaughnessy and I could hear her imploring all the saints to preserve us from instant death 
7511_102419_000025_000001	train-clean-100	I kept shutting my eyes trying not to see the terrifying places and opening them again to see the beauty spread everywhere until mister Stewart said It must make you nervous to ride over mountain roads 
none	none	Don t bat your eyes so fast and you ll see more So then I stiffened my back and kept my eyes open and I did see more 
7511_102419_000026_000000	train-clean-100	It had been decided to go as far as we could with the wagons and then set camp from there the hunters would ride horseback as far up as they could and then climb 
none	none	It was almost sundown when we reached camp All the hunters were in and such a yowling as they set up Look who s here See who s come they yelled 
7511_102419_000026_000004	train-clean-100	They went to work setting up tents and unloading wagons with a hearty good will 
7511_102419_000027_000000	train-clean-100	We are camped just on the edge of the pines 
7511_102419_000027_000001	train-clean-100	Back of us rises a big pine clad mountain our tents are set under some big trees on a small plateau and right below us is a valley in which grass grows knee high and little streams come from every way 
7511_102419_000027_000002	train-clean-100	Trout scurry up stream whenever we go near 
7511_102419_000027_000003	train-clean-100	We call the valley Paradise Valley because it is the horses paradise 
none	none	And as in the early morning we can often see clouds rolling along the valley we call our camp Cloudcrest 
7511_102419_000027_000005	train-clean-100	We have a beautiful place it is well sheltered there is plenty of wood water and feed and looking eastward down the valley snow covered crag topped mountains delight the eye 
none	none	The air is so bracing that we all feel equal to anything 
7511_102419_000028_000001	train-clean-100	mister Struble has already killed a fine spike elk for camp eating 
7511_102419_000028_000002	train-clean-100	We camped in a bunch and we have camp stoves so that in case of rain or snow we can stay indoors 
7511_102419_000028_000003	train-clean-100	Just now we have a huge camp fire around which we sit in the evening telling stories singing and eating nuts of the pinon pine 
7511_102419_000028_000004	train-clean-100	Then too the whole country is filled with those tiny little strawberries 
7511_102419_000028_000005	train-clean-100	We have to gather all day to get as much as we can eat but they are delicious 
7511_102419_000028_000006	train-clean-100	Yesterday we had pie made of wild currants there are a powerful lot of them here 
none	none	There is also a little blueberry that the men say is the Rocky Mountain huckleberry The grouse are feeding on them 
7511_102419_000028_000008	train-clean-100	Altogether this is one of the most delightful places imaginable 
7511_102419_000028_000009	train-clean-100	The men are not very anxious to begin hunting 
none	none	A little delay means cooler weather for the meat 
7511_102419_000028_000011	train-clean-100	It is cool up here but going back across the desert it will be warm for a while yet 
7511_102419_000028_000012	train-clean-100	Still when they see elk every day it is a great temptation to try a shot 
none	none	One of the students told me Professor Glenholdt was here to get the tip end bone of the tail of a brontosaurus 
7511_102419_000029_000001	train-clean-100	I don t know what that is but if it is a fossil he won t get it for the soil is too deep 
7511_102419_000029_000002	train-clean-100	The students are jolly likable fellows but they can talk of nothing but strata and formation 
7511_102419_000029_000003	train-clean-100	I heard one of them say he would be glad when some one killed a bear as he had heard they were fine eating having strata of fat alternating with strata of lean 
7511_102419_000029_000004	train-clean-100	mister Haynes is a quiet fellow just interested in hunting 
7511_102419_000029_000005	train-clean-100	mister Struble is the big man of the party he is tall and strong and we find him very pleasant company Then there is doctor Teschall he is a quiet fellow with an unexpected smile 
7511_102419_000029_000006	train-clean-100	He is so reserved that I felt that he was kind of out of place among the rest until I caught his cordial smile 
7511_102419_000029_000007	train-clean-100	He is so slight that I don t see how he will stand the hard climbing not to mention carrying the heavy gun 
7511_102419_000029_000008	train-clean-100	They are using the largest caliber sporting guns murderous looking things 
7511_102419_000029_000009	train-clean-100	That is all except mister Harkrudder the picture man 
7511_102419_000029_000010	train-clean-100	He looks to be about forty years old but whoops and laughs like he was about ten 
none	none	I don t need to tell you of the good mon do I 
7511_102419_000030_000001	train-clean-100	He is just the kind quiet good mon that he has always been since I have known him 
none	none	A young lady from a neighboring camp came over and said she had called to see our tout ensemble Well I ve given you it they us or we We didn t need a guide as mister Haynes and mister Struble are old timers We were to have had a cook but when we reached Pinedale where we were to have picked him up he told mister Haynes he was too tam seek in de bel so we had to come without him but that is really no inconvenience since we are all very good cooks and are all willing to help 
7511_102419_000031_000001	train-clean-100	I don t think I shall be able to tell you of any great exploits I make with the gun 
7511_102419_000031_000002	train-clean-100	I fired one that mister Stewart carries and it almost kicked my shoulder off 
none	none	I am mystified about missus O Shaughnessy s license 
7511_102419_000031_000004	train-clean-100	I know she would not shoot one of those big guns for a dozen elk besides that she is very tender hearted and will never harm anything herself although she likes to join our hunts 
7511_102419_000032_000000	train-clean-100	I think you must be tired of this letter so I am going to say good night my friend 
none	none	E R S VII THE HUNT 
7511_102420_000004_000000	train-clean-100	CAMP CLOUDCREST October six nineteen fourteen 
none	none	DEAR missus CONEY It seems so odd to be writing you and getting no answers missus O Shaughnessy just now asked me what I have against you that I write you so much 
7511_102420_000006_000002	train-clean-100	I haven t one thing 
none	none	I told her I owed you more love than I could ever pay in a lifetime and she said writing such long letters is a mighty poor way to show it 
7511_102420_000006_000004	train-clean-100	I have been neglecting you shamefully I think 
none	none	One of the main reasons I came on this hunt was to take the trip for you and to tell you things that you would most enjoy 
7511_102420_000006_000006	train-clean-100	So I will spend this snowy day in writing to you 
7511_102420_000007_000000	train-clean-100	On the night of September thirty there was the most awful thunderstorm I ever witnessed flash after flash of the most blinding lightning followed by deafening peals of thunder and as it echoed from mountain to mountain the uproar was terrifying 
7511_102420_000007_000001	train-clean-100	I have always loved a storm the beat of hail and rain and the roar of wind always appeal to me but there was neither wind nor rain just flash and roar 
7511_102420_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Before the echo died away among the hills another booming report would seem to shiver the atmosphere and set all our tinware jangling 
7511_102420_000007_000003	train-clean-100	We are camped so near the great pines that I will confess I was powerfully afraid Had the lightning struck one of the big pines there would not have been one of us left 
none	none	I could hear missus O Shaughnessy murmuring her prayers when there was a lull 
7511_102420_000007_000005	train-clean-100	We had gone to bed but I couldn t remain there so I sat on the wagon seat with Jerrine beside me Something struck the guy ropes of the tent and I was so frightened I was too weak to cry out 
7511_102420_000007_000006	train-clean-100	I thought the big tree must have fallen In the lulls of the storm I could hear the men s voices high and excited 
7511_102420_000007_000007	train-clean-100	They too were up 
7511_102420_000007_000008	train-clean-100	It seemed to me that the storm lasted for hours but at last it moved off up the valley the flashes grew to be a mere glimmer and the thunder mere rumbling 
none	none	The pines began to moan and soon a little breeze whistled by So we lay down again 
7511_102420_000007_000011	train-clean-100	Next morning the horses could not be found the storm had frightened them and they had tried to go home 
7511_102420_000007_000012	train-clean-100	The men had to find them and as it took most of the day we had to put off our hunt 
7511_102420_000008_000000	train-clean-100	We were up and about next morning in the first faint gray light 
7511_102420_000008_000001	train-clean-100	While the men fed grain to the horses and saddled them we prepared a hasty breakfast 
7511_102420_000008_000002	train-clean-100	We were off before it was more than light enough for us to see the trail 
7511_102420_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Dawn in the mountains how I wish I could describe it to you 
7511_102420_000009_000001	train-clean-100	If I could only make you feel the keen bracing air the exhilarating climb if I could only paint its beauties what a picture you should have 
7511_102420_000009_000002	train-clean-100	Here the colors are very different from those of the desert 
7511_102420_000009_000003	train-clean-100	I suppose the forest makes it so 
7511_102420_000009_000004	train-clean-100	The shadows are mellow like the colors in an old picture greenish amber light and a blue gray sky Far ahead of us we could see the red rim rock of a mountain above timber line 
7511_102420_000009_000005	train-clean-100	The first rays of the sun turned the jagged peaks into golden points of a crown 
7511_102420_000009_000006	train-clean-100	In Oklahoma at that hour of the day the woods would be alive with song birds even at this season but here there are no song birds and only the snapping of twigs as our horses climbed the frosty trail broke the silence 
7511_102420_000009_000007	train-clean-100	We had been cautioned not to talk but neither missus O Shaughnessy nor I wanted to 
7511_102420_000009_000008	train-clean-100	Afterwards when we compared notes we found that we both had the same thought we both felt ashamed to be out to deal death to one of the Maker s beautiful creatures and we were planning how we might avoid it 
7511_102420_000010_000000	train-clean-100	The sun was well up when we reached the little park where we picketed our horses 
7511_102420_000010_000001	train-clean-100	Then came a long hard climb 
none	none	It is hard climbing at the best and when there is a big gun to carry it is very hard 
7511_102420_000010_000003	train-clean-100	Then too we had to keep up with the men and we didn t find that easy to do 
7511_102420_000010_000004	train-clean-100	At last we reached the top and sat down on some boulders to rest a few minutes before we started down to the hunting ground which lay in a cuplike valley far below us 
none	none	We could hear the roar of the Gros Ventre as it tumbled grumblingly over its rocky bed 
7511_102420_000011_000001	train-clean-100	To our right rose mile after mile of red cliffs As the last of the quaking asp leaves have fallen there were no golden groves 
7511_102420_000011_000002	train-clean-100	In their places stood silvery patches against the red background of the cliffs 
7511_102420_000011_000003	train-clean-100	High overhead a triangle of wild geese harrowed the blue sky 
7511_102420_000012_000000	train-clean-100	I was plumb out of breath but men who are most gallant elsewhere are absolutely heartless on a hunt 
7511_102420_000012_000001	train-clean-100	I was scarcely through panting before we began to descend 
7511_102420_000012_000002	train-clean-100	We received instructions as to how we should move so as to keep out of range of each other s guns then mister Haynes and myself started one way and mister Struble and missus O Shaughnessy the other 
7511_102420_000012_000003	train-clean-100	We were to meet where the valley terminated in a broad pass 
7511_102420_000012_000004	train-clean-100	We felt sure we could get a chance at what elk there might be in the valley 
7511_102420_000012_000005	train-clean-100	We were following fresh tracks and a little of the hunter s enthusiasm seized me 
7511_102420_000013_000000	train-clean-100	We had not followed them far when three cows and a spike came running out of the pines a little ahead of us 
7511_102420_000013_000001	train-clean-100	Instantly mister Haynes s gun flew to his shoulder and a deafening report jarred our ears 
7511_102420_000013_000002	train-clean-100	He ran forward but I stood still fascinated by what I saw 
none	none	Our side of the valley was bounded by a rim of rock Over the rim was a sheer wall of rock for two hundred feet to where the Gros Ventre was angrily roaring below on the other side of the stream rose the red cliffs with their jagged crags 
7511_102420_000013_000005	train-clean-100	At the report of the gun two huge blocks of stone almost as large as a house detached themselves and fell 
7511_102420_000013_000006	train-clean-100	At the same instant one of the quaking asp groves began to move slowly 
none	none	I couldn t believe my eyes 
7511_102420_000013_000008	train-clean-100	I shut them a moment but when I looked the grove was moving faster 
7511_102420_000013_000009	train-clean-100	It slid swiftly and I could plainly hear the rattle of stones falling against stones until with a muffled roar the whole hillside fell into the stream 
7511_102420_000014_000000	train-clean-100	mister Haynes came running back 
none	none	What is the matter 
7511_102420_000014_000002	train-clean-100	Are you hurt 
none	none	Why didn t you shoot he asked 
7511_102420_000015_000000	train-clean-100	I waved my hand weakly toward where the great mound of tangled trees and earth blocked the water 
7511_102420_000015_000001	train-clean-100	 Why he said that is only a landslide not an earthquake 
none	none	You are as white as a ghost 
7511_102420_000015_000003	train-clean-100	Come on up here and see my fine elk 
7511_102420_000016_000000	train-clean-100	I sat on a log watching him dress his elk 
7511_102420_000016_000001	train-clean-100	We have found it best not to remove the skin but the elk have to be quartered so as to load them on to a horse 
7511_102420_000016_000002	train-clean-100	missus O Shaughnessy and mister Struble came out of the woods just then 
7511_102420_000016_000003	train-clean-100	They had seen a big bunch of elk headed by a splendid bull but got no shot and the elk went out of the pass 
7511_102420_000016_000004	train-clean-100	They had heard our shot and came across to see what luck 
none	none	What iver is the matter with ye asked missus O Shaughnessy 
7511_102420_000017_000001	train-clean-100	mister Haynes told her 
7511_102420_000017_000002	train-clean-100	They had heard the noise but had thought it thunder mister Haynes told me that if I would chirk up he would give me his elk teeth 
7511_102420_000017_000003	train-clean-100	Though I don t admire them they are considered valuable however his elk was a cow and they don t have as nice teeth as do bulls 
7511_102420_000018_000000	train-clean-100	We had lunch and the men covered the elk with pine boughs to keep the camp robbers from pecking it full of holes 
7511_102420_000018_000001	train-clean-100	Next day the men would come with the horses and pack it in to camp 
7511_102420_000018_000002	train-clean-100	We all felt refreshed so we started on the trail of those that got away 
7511_102420_000019_000000	train-clean-100	For a while walking was easy and we made pretty good time then we had a rocky hill to get over 
7511_102420_000019_000001	train-clean-100	We had to use care when we got into the timber there were marshy places which tried us sorely and windfall so thick that we could hardly get through 
7511_102420_000019_000002	train-clean-100	We were obliged to pick our way carefully to avoid noise and we were all together not having come to a place where it seemed better to separate 
7511_102420_000019_000003	train-clean-100	We had about resolved to go to our horses when we heard a volley of shots 
none	none	That is somebody bunch shooting said mister Struble They are in Brewster Lake Park by the sound 
7511_102420_000020_000002	train-clean-100	That means that the elk will pass here in a short time and we may get a shot 
7511_102420_000020_000003	train-clean-100	The elk will be here long before the men since the men have no horses so let s hurry and get placed along the only place they can get out 
7511_102420_000020_000004	train-clean-100	We ll get our limit 
none	none	We hastily secreted ourselves along the narrow gorge through which the elk must pass 
7511_102420_000021_000001	train-clean-100	We were all on one side and mister Haynes said to me Rest your gun on that rock and aim at the first rib back of the shoulder 
7511_102420_000021_000002	train-clean-100	If you shoot haphazard you may cripple an elk and let it get away to die in misery 
7511_102420_000021_000003	train-clean-100	So make sure when you fire 
7511_102420_000022_000000	train-clean-100	It didn t seem a minute before we heard the beat of their hoofs and a queer panting noise that I can t describe 
none	none	First came a beautiful thing with his head held high his great antlers seemed to lie half his length on his back his eyes were startled and his shining black mane seemed to bristle 
7511_102420_000022_000002	train-clean-100	I heard the report of guns and he tumbled in a confused heap 
7511_102420_000022_000003	train-clean-100	He tried to rise but others coming leaped over him and knocked him down 
7511_102420_000022_000004	train-clean-100	Some more shots and those behind turned and went back the way they had come 
none	none	mister Haynes shouted to me Shoot shoot why don t you shoot 
7511_102420_000024_000000	train-clean-100	So I fired my Krag but next I found myself picking myself up and wondering who had struck me and for what 
7511_102420_000024_000001	train-clean-100	I was so dizzy I could scarcely move but I got down to where the others were excitedly admiring the two dead elk that they said were the victims of missus O Shaughnessy s gun 
none	none	She was as excited and delighted as if she had never declared she would not kill anything Sure it s many a meal they ll make for little hungry mouths she said She was rubbing her shoulder ruefully I don t want to fire any more big guns 
7511_102420_000024_000006	train-clean-100	I thought old Goliar had hit me a biff with a blackthorn shilaley she remarked 
none	none	mister Haynes turned to me and said You are a dandy hunter you didn t shoot at all until after the elk were gone and the way you held your gun it is a wonder it didn t knock your head off instead of just smashing your jaw 
7511_102420_000026_000000	train-clean-100	The men worked as fast as they could at the elk and we helped as much as we could but it was dark before we reached camp 
7511_102420_000026_000001	train-clean-100	Supper was ready but I went to bed at once 
none	none	They all thought it was because I was so disappointed but it was because I was so stiff and sore I could hardly move and so tired I couldn t sleep Next morning my jaw and neck were so swollen that I hated any one to see me and my head ached for two days 
7511_102420_000026_000004	train-clean-100	It has been snowing for a long time but Clyde says he will take me hunting when it stops 
none	none	I don t want to go but reckon I will have to because I don t want to come so far and buy a license to kill an elk and go back empty handed and partly to get a rest from mister Murry s everlasting accordion 
7511_102420_000027_000000	train-clean-100	mister Murry is an old time acquaintance of missus O Shaughnessy s 
none	none	He has a ranch down on the river somewhere 
7511_102420_000027_000002	train-clean-100	missus O Shaughnessy has not seen him for years didn t know he lived up here 
7511_102420_000027_000003	train-clean-100	He had seen the game warden from whom she had procured her license and so hunted up our camp 
none	none	He is an odd looking individual with sad eyes and a drooping mouth which gives his face a most hopeless reproachful expression 
7511_102420_000027_000005	train-clean-100	His nose however seems to upset the original plan for it is long and thin and bent slightly to one side 
7511_102420_000027_000006	train-clean-100	His neck is long and his Adam s apple seems uncertain as to where it belongs 
7511_102420_000027_000007	train-clean-100	At supper Jerrine watched it as if fascinated until I sent her from the table and went out to speak to her about gazing 
7511_102420_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Why mamma she said I had to look he has swallowed something that won t go either up or down and I m fraid he ll choke 
7511_102420_000029_000000	train-clean-100	Although I can t brag about mister Murry s appearance I can about his taste for he admires missus O Shaughnessy 
none	none	It seems that in years gone by he has made attempts to marry her 
7511_102420_000030_000000	train-clean-100	As he got up from supper the first night he was with us he said Mary Ellen I have a real treat and surprise for you 
7511_102420_000030_000001	train-clean-100	Just wait a few minutes an I ll bet you ll be happy 
none	none	We took our accustomed places around the fire while mister Murry hobbled his cayuse and took an odd looking bundle from his saddle 
7511_102420_000031_000001	train-clean-100	He seated himself and took from the bundle an accordion 
none	none	He set it upon his knee and began pulling and pushing on it 
7511_102420_000031_000003	train-clean-100	He did what mister Struble said was doling a doleful tune 
7511_102420_000031_000004	train-clean-100	Every one took it good naturedly but he kept doling the doleful until little by little the circle thinned 
7511_102420_000032_000000	train-clean-100	Our tent is as comfortable as can be 
7511_102420_000032_000001	train-clean-100	Now that it is snowing we sit around the stoves and we should have fine times if Professor Glenholdt could have a chance to talk but we have to listen to Run Nigger Run and The Old Gray Hoss Come A tearin Out The Wilderness I ll sing them to you when I come to Denver 
none	none	With much love to you ELINORE RUPERT STEWART VIII THE SEVENTH MAN CLOUDCREST October ten nineteen fourteen DEAR missus CONEY I wonder what you would do if you were here But I reckon I had better not anticipate and so I will begin at the beginning On the morning of the eighth we held a council The physician and the two students had gone All had their limit of elk except mister Haynes and myself Our licenses also entitled each of us to a deer a mountain sheep and a bear We had plenty of food but it had snowed about a foot and I was beginning to want to get out while the going was good Two other outfits had gone out The doctor and the students hired them to haul out their game So we decided to stay on a week longer That morning missus O Shaughnessy and I melted snow and washed the clothes It was delightful to have nice soft water and we enjoyed our work it was almost noon before we thought to begin dinner I suppose you would say lunch but with us it is dinner None of the men had gone out that day mister Harkrudder was busy with his films and didn t come with the rest when dinner was ready When he did come he was excited he laid a picture on the table and said Do any of you recognize this It looked like a flash light of our camping ground It was a little blurry but some of the objects were quite clear Our tent was a white blotch except for the outlines the wagons showed plainly I didn t think much of it as a picture so I paid scant attention missus O Shaughnessy gave it close scrutiny presently she said Oh yis I see what it is It s a puzzle picture and ye find the man Here he is hidin beyont the pine next the tent Exactly said Harkrudder but I had not expected just this I am working out some ideas of my own in photography and this picture is one of the experiments I tried the night of the storm The result doesn t prove my experiment either way Where were you Stewart during the storm Where should I be I bided i the bed the Stewart said Well said Harkrudder I know where each of the other fellows was and none of them was in this direction Now who is the seventh man I looked again and sure enough there was a man in a crouching position outlined against the tent wall We were all excited for it was ten minutes past one when Harkrudder was out and we couldn t think why any one would be prowling about our camp at that time of the night As mister Stewart and I had planned a long beautiful ride we set out after dinner leaving the rest yet at the table eating and conjecturing about the stranger within our picture I had hoped we would come to ground level enough for a sharp invigorating canter but our way was too rough It was a joy to be out in the great silent forest The snow made riding a little venturesome because the horses slipped a great deal but Chub is dependable even though he is lazy Clyde bestrode mister Haynes s Old Blue We were headed for the cascades on Clear Creek to see the wonderful ice caverns that the flying spray is forming We had almost reached the cascades and were crossing a little bowl like valley when an elk calf leaped out of the snow and ran a few yards It paused and finally came irresolutely back toward us A few steps farther we saw great red splotches on the snow and the body of a cow elk Around it were the tracks of the faithful little calf It would stay by its mother until starvation or wild animals put an end to its suffering The cow was shot in half a dozen places none of them in a fatal spot it had bled to death That said mister Stewart angrily comes o bunch shooting The authorities should revoke the license of a man found guilty of bunch shooting We rode on in silence each a little saddened by what we had seen But this was not all We had begun to descend the mountain side to Clear Creek when we came upon the beaten trail of a herd of elk We followed it as offering perhaps the safest descent It didn t take us far Around the spur of the mountain the herd had stampeded tracks were everywhere Lying in the trail were a spike and an old bull with a broken antler Chub shied but Old Blue doesn t scare so mister Stewart rode up quite close Around the heads were tell tale tracks We didn t dismount but we knew that the two upper teeth or tushes were missing and that the hated tooth hunter was at work The tracks in the snow showed there had been two men An adult elk averages five hundred pounds of splendid meat here before us therefore lay a thousand pounds of food thrown to waste just to enable a contemptible tooth hunter to obtain four teeth Tooth hunting is against the law but this is a case where you must catch before hanging Well we saw the cascades and after resting a little we started homeward through the heavy woods where we were compelled to go more slowly We had dismounted and were gathering some pinon cones from a fallen tree when almost without a sound a band of elk came trailing down a little draw where a spring trickled We watched them file along evidently making for lower ground on which to bed Chub snorted and a large cow stopped and looked curiously in our direction Those behind passed leisurely around her We knew she had no calf because she was light in color cows suckling calves are of a darker shade A loud report seemed to rend the forest and the beauty dropped The rest disappeared so suddenly that if the fine specimen that lay before me had not been proof it would almost have seemed a dream I had shot the cow elk my license called for We took off the head and removed the entrails then covered our game with pine boughs to which we tied a red bandanna so as to make it easy to find next day when the men would come back with a saw to divide it down the back and pack it in There is an imposing row of game hanging in the pines back of our tent Supper was ready when we got in mister Haynes had been out also and was very joyful he got his elk this afternoon We can start home day after to morrow It will take the men all to morrow to get in the game I shall be glad to start I am getting homesick and I have not had a letter or even a card since I have been here We are hungry for war news and besides it is snowing again Our clothes didn t get dry either they are frozen to the bush we hung them on Perhaps they will be snowed under by morning I can t complain though for it is warm and pleasant in our tent The little camp stove is glowing missus O Shaughnessy is showing Jerrine how to make pigs of potatoes Calvin and Robert are asleep The men have all gone to the bachelors tent to form their plans all save mister Murry who is serenading missus O Shaughnessy He is playing Nelly Gray and somehow I don t want to laugh at him as I usually do I can only feel sorry for him I can hardly write because my heart is yearning for my little Junior boy at home on the ranch with his grandmother Dear little Mother Stewart I feel very tender toward her Junior is the pride of her heart She would not allow us to bring him on this trip so she is at the ranch taking care of my brown eyed boy Every one is so good so kind and I can do so little to repay It makes me feel very unworthy You ll think I have the blues but I haven t I just feel humble and chastened When mister Murry pauses I can hear the soft spat spat of the falling snow on the tent I will be powerfully glad when we set our faces homeward Good night dear friend Angels guard you ELINORE STEWART IX AN INDIAN CAMP CLOUDCREST October thirteen nineteen fourteen DEAR DEAR missus CONEY This is the very last letter you will receive dated from this camp We are leaving a few days earlier than we intended and I am pretty badly on the fence I want to laugh and really I can hardly keep back the tears We are leaving sooner than we meant for rather a good reason We haven t one bite to eat except elk meat After the men had brought into camp the elk we killed the other afternoon they began to plan a sheep hunt As sheep do not stay in the woods the men had to go miles away and above timber line They decided to take a pack horse and stay all night I didn t want mister Stewart to go because the climbing is very dangerous No accidents have happened this year but last season a man fell from the crags and was killed so I tried to keep the good mon at home But he would not be persuaded The love of chase has entered his blood and it looks to me as if it had chased reason plumb out of his head I know exactly how Samantha felt when Josiah would go to the pleasure exertion The bald spot on the Stewart s head doesn t seem to remind him of years gone by he is as joyous as a boy It was finally decided to take missus O Shaughnessy and the children and myself to a neighboring camp about two miles away as we didn t like to risk being frightened by a possible intruder Sorenson the game warden was in camp to inspect our game on the twelfth and he told us he was on the trail of tooth hunters and had routed them out on the night of the storm but what they could have been doing in our camp was as much a mystery to him as to us Well when we were ready to go mister Murry and the Stewart escorted us It was a cloudy afternoon and often great flakes of snow fell gently softly The snow was already about eighteen inches deep and it made sheep hunting slippery and dangerous work On our way we came upon an Indian camp They were all huddled about a tiny fire scattered about were their wikiups made of sticks and pine boughs The Indians were sullen and angry The game warden had ordered them back to Fort Washakie where they belonged Their squaws had jerked their elk You may not know what jerked means so I will explain it means dried cured They had all they were allowed but for some reason they didn t want to go Sorenson suspects them of being in with the tooth hunters and he is narrowing the circle At the camp where we were to stay we found missus Kavanaugh laid up with a sore throat but she made us welcome It would be a mighty funny camper who wouldn t As soon as the men from the Kavanaugh camp heard our men s plans they were eager to go along So it ended in us three women being left alone We said we were not afraid and we tried not to feel so but after dark we all felt a little timorous missus Kavanaugh was afraid of the Indians but I was afraid they would bring Clyde back dead from a fall We were camped in an old cabin built by the ranger The Kavanaughs were short of groceries We cooked our big elk steaks on sticks before an open fire and we roasted potatoes in the ashes When our fear wore away we had a fine time After a while we lay down on fragrant beds of pine We awoke late The fire was dead upon the hearth and outside the snow was piling up missus O Shaughnessy made a rousing fire and managed to jolly us until we had a really happy breakfast hour About three in the afternoon all the men came trooping in cold wet and hungry After filling them with venison hot potatoes and coffee we started to our own camp The men were rather depressed because they had come back empty handed The Indians were gone and the snow lay thick over the place where their fire had been they had left in the night When we came to camp mister Struble started to build a fire but no matches were to be had Next the men went to feed grain to their tired horses but the oats were gone mister Murry sought in vain for his beloved accordion mister Harkrudder was furious when he found his grinding machine was gone missus O Shaughnessy made a dash for the grub box It was empty We were dumbfounded Each of us kept searching and researching and knowing all the while we would find nothing mister Struble is a most cheerful individual and as missus O Shaughnessy says is a mighty good fellow even if he is Dutch The Indians have stolen us out he said but after all they have left us our tents and harness all our meat and the road home so what matter if we are a little inconvenienced as to grub Haynes may cry for sugar but that won t hurt the rest any I ll saddle and ride over to Scotty s and get enough to last us out We knew the Kavanaughs could not help us any but we grew cheerful in anticipating help from Scotty who was from Green River and was camped a few miles away We wanted mister Struble to wait until morning but he said no it would make breakfast late so he rode off in the dark At two o clock this morning he came in almost frozen with two small cans of milk and two yeast cakes As soon as it was light enough to see the men were at work loading the game and breaking camp As they are ready now to take down this tent I will have to finish this letter somewhere else X THE TOOTH HUNTERS AT SORENSON S CABIN ON GREEN RIVER Well we re here warmed and fed and in much better trim bodily and mentally We had mishap after mishap coming First the Hutton horse being a bronco had to act up when he was hitched up We had almost more game than we could haul but at last we got started after the bronco had reared and pitched as much as he wanted to There are a great many springs one every few feet in these mountains and the snow hid the pitfalls and made the ground soft so that the wheels cut in and pulling was hard Then too our horses had had nothing to eat for two days the snow being so deep they couldn t get at the grass hobbled as they were We had got perhaps a mile from camp when the leading wagon with four horses driven by mister Haynes suddenly stopped The wheels had sunk into the soft banks of a small ditch like spring branch mister Stewart had to stay on our wagon to hold the bronco but all the rest even missus O Shaughnessy gathered around and tried to help They hitched on a snap team but not a trace tightened They didn t want to unload the game in the snow The men lifted and pried on the wheels Still the horses wouldn t budge mister Haynes is no disciple of Job but he tried manfully to restrain himself Turning to Glenholdt who was offering advice he said You get out I know what the trouble is these horses used to belong to a freighter and are used to being cussed It s the greatest nuisance in the world for a man to go out where there s a bunch of women If these women weren t along I d make these horses get out of there missus O Shaughnessy said Don t lay your poor driving to the women If you drive by cussin then cuss We will stop up our ears She threw her apron over her head I held my fingers in Jerrine s ears and she stopped my ears else I might be able to tell you what he said It was something violent I know I could tell by the expression of his face He had only been doing it a second when those horses walked right out with the wagon as nicely as you please missus O Shaughnessy said to mister Haynes It s a poor cusser you are Sure it s no wonder you hesitated to begin If Danny O Shaughnessy couldn t have sworn better I d have had to hilp him We got along pretty well after that mister Haynes kept some distance ahead but occasionally a bit of cussin came back to us and we knew he was using freighter tactics The game warden lives in a tiny little cabin The door is so low that I had to stoop to get in It was quite dark when we got here last night but missus Sorenson acted as if she was glad to see us I didn t think we could all get in A row of bunks is built along one side of the cabin A long tarpaulin covers the bed and we all got upon this and sat while our hostess prepared our supper If one of us had stirred we would have been in her way so there we sat as thick as thieves When supper was ready six got off their perch and ate when they were through six more were made happy mister Sorenson had caught the tooth hunters On the wall hung their deadly guns with silencers on them to muffle the report He showed us the teeth he had found in their possession The warden and his deputy had searched the men and their effects and found no teeth He had no evidence against them except their unlawful guns but he knew he had the right men At last he found their contract to furnish two hundred pair of teeth It is a trick of such hunters to thrust a knife into the meat of the game they have and so to make pockets in which they hide the teeth but these fellows had no such pockets They jeered at the warden and threatened to kill him but he kept searching and presently found the teeth in a pail of lard He told us all about it as we sat an eager crowd on his bed A warden takes his life in his hands when he goes after such fellows but Sorenson is not afraid to do it The cabin walls are covered with pen and ink drawings the work of the warden s gifted children Vina the pretty eighteen year old daughter and Laurence the sixteen year old son They never had a lesson in drawing in their lives but their pictures portray Western life exactly The snow is not so deep here as it was at camp but it is too deep for the horses to get grass The men were able to get a little grain from the warden so we will pull out in the morning and try to make it to where we can get groceries We are quite close to where Elizabeth lives but we should have to cross the river and it was dark before we passed her home I should like to see her but won t get a chance to missus Sorenson says she is very happy In all this round of exposure the kiddies are as well as can be Cold camping and elk meat agree with them We are in a tent for the night and it is so cold the ink is freezing but the kiddies are snuggled under their blankets as warm as toast We are to start early in the morning Good night dear friend I am glad I can take this trip for you You d freeze ELINORE STEWART XI BUDDY AND BABY GIRL IN CAMP October sixteen nineteen fourteen DEAR missus CONEY The day we left the game warden s was damp and lowering It didn t seem it could have one good thing to its credit but there were several things to be thankful for One of them was that you were safe at home in your warm dry apartment We had hardly passed the great Block buttes when the biggest wettest flakes of snow began to pelt into our faces I really like a storm and the kiddies would have enjoyed the snow but we had to keep the wagon sheet tied down to keep the bedding dry and the kiddies get sick under cover All the pleasure I might have had was taken away by the fact that we were making a forced drive We had to go The game warden had no more than enough food for his family and no horse feed Also the snow was almost as deep there as it had been higher up so the horses could not graze We made it to Cora that day Here at last was plenty of hay and grain we restocked our mess boxes and felt better toward the world Next day we came on here to Newfork where we are resting our teams before we start across the desert which begins just across the creek we are camped on We have added two to our party I know you will be interested to know how it happened and I can picture the astonishment of our neighbors when we reach home for our newcomers are to be members of missus O Shaughnessy s family We had all been sorry we could not visit Elizabeth or Danyul and his mother We felt almost as if we were sneaking past them but we consoled ourselves with promises to see the Burneys and Grandma Mortimer Yesterday the children and I were riding with missus O Shaughnessy in the buckboard We were trotting merrily along the lane that leads to Newfork thankful in our hearts to be out of the snow for there is no snow here Just ahead of us two little boys were riding along on their ponies There was a wire fence on both sides of the lane and almost at the end of the lane an old cow had her head between the wires and was nibbling the tall dead grass The larger of the two boys said That s old Pendry s cow and she shan t eat a blade of grass off Dad s meadow He rode up to the cow and began beating her with his quirt That frightened the cow and as she jerked her head up the top wire caught her across the top of her neck she jerked and lunged to free herself and was cruelly cut by the barbs on the wire Then he began beating his pony The small boy said You re a coward an a fool Billy Polk The cow wasn t hurtin nothin an you re just tryin to show off beatin that pony Said the other boy Shut up you beggar or I ll beat you an I ll take them breeches you got on off you an you can go without any they re mine My ma give em to you The little fellow s face was scarlet as much of it as we could see for the freckles and his eyes were blazing as he replied You ain t man enough I dare you to strike me or to tech my clothes Both boys were riding bareback The small boy slid off his pony s back the other rode up to him and raised his quirt but the little one seized him by the leg and in a jiffy they were in the road fighting like cats I asked missus O Shaughnessy to drive on but she said If you are in a hurry you can try walkin I m goin to referee this scrap It looked for a minute as if the small boy would get a severe beating but by some trick he hurled the other headlong into the green slimy water that edged the road then seizing the quirt and the opportunity at the same time he belabored Billy without mercy as that individual climbed up the slippery embankment blubbering and whipped Still sobbing he climbed upon his patient pony which stood waiting and galloped off down the lane The other pony followed and the little conqueror was left afoot missus O Shaughnessy was beaming with delight Sure twas a fine fight a sight worth coming all this way to see Ah but you re the b y Tis a dollar I d be givin ye only me purse is in me stockin Oh the boy said quickly don t let that stop you I ll look off another way I don t know if she would have given him the money for just then some men came into the lane with some cattle and we had to start The boy got up on the back end of the buckboard and we drove on We could hear our wagons rumbling along and knew they would soon catch up Where is your home b y asked missus O Shaughnessy Oh just wherever Aunt Hettie has work he said She is at mister Tom s now so I m there too me and Baby Girl Where are your folks missus O Shaughnessy went on Ma s dead an pa s gone to Alasky I don t know where my brothers are Baby Girl an me are with Aunt Het an that s all there are of us He grinned cheerfully in spite of the fact that one eye was fast closing and he bore numerous bumps and scratches on his face and head Just then one of the men with the cattle galloped up and shouted Hello It was mister Burney Where d you get that kid I guess I ll have to get the sheriff after you for kidnapping Bud And what have you been doing to him anyway missus O Shaughnessy entered delightedly into a recital of the mixup and it turned out that mister Tom and mister Burney were one It was like meeting an old friend he seemed as pleased as we and insisted on our going up to his ranch he said the missus would feel slighted if we passed her by So we turned into another lane and presently drew up before the ranch house The missus came dancing out to meet us and right welcome she made us feel mister Burney went back to bring the rest but they were already setting up the tents and had supper almost ready However we stayed and had supper with the Burneys They are powerfully happy and talked eagerly of themselves and their prospects It s just grand to have a home of your own and some one to do for I just love to mend for Tommy but I always hated to mend before said the missus You bet mister Burney answered it is sure fine to know there s somebody at home with a pretty pink dress on waitin for a fellow when he comes in from a long day in the saddle And so they kept up their thoughtless chatter but every word was as a stab to poor Aunt Hettie She had Baby Girl on her lap and was giving the children their supper but I noticed that she ate nothing It was easy to see that she was not strong Baby Girl is four years old and is the fattest little thing She has very dark blue eyes with long black lashes and the shortest most turned up little nose She is so plump and rosy that even the faded old blue denim dress could not hide her loveliness missus O Shaughnessy could not keep her eyes off the children What is the little girl s name she asked Caroline Agnes Lucia Lavina Ida Eunice was the astonishing reply missus O Shaughnessy gasped My goodness she exclaimed is that all Oh no Aunt Hettie went on placidly you see her mother couldn t call her all the names so she just used the first letters They spell Callie so that is what she called her But I don t like the name I call her Baby Girl I asked her how she ever came to name her that way and she said My sister wanted a girl but there were six boys before this little one came Each time she hoped it would be a girl and accordingly selected a name for a girl So there were six names saved up and as there wasn t much else to give her my sister gave them all to the baby After supper the Burneys rode down to camp with us We had the same camping ground that we had when we came up The cabin across the creek where we met Grandma Mortimer is silent and deserted the young couple have moved away with their baby missus O Shaughnessy kept talking about the fight and mister Burney gave us the history of the children Their mother he began has been dead about eighteen months She really died with a broken heart Baby Girl was only a few weeks old when the father went to Alaska and I guess he s dead He was to a been back in three years and no one has ever heard a word from him His name was Bolton he was a good fellow only he went bughouse over the gold fields and just fretted till he got away sold everything for a grub stake left his wife and seven kids almost homeless But they managed some way till the mother died With her last breath she asked that the two youngest be kept together she knew the oldest ones would have to be separated She never did give up looking for Bolton and she wanted him to have the babies Her sister Hettie has worked around here for years her and Rob Langley have been going to marry ever since I can remember but always there has something cropped up And now that Hettie has got to take care of the kids I guess they won t never marry she won t burden him with them It is hard for her to support them too Work is scarce and she can t get it lots of times because of the kids The Burneys soon went home and the rest of us went to bed all except missus O Shaughnessy who was so cranky and snappy that we left her by the fire It seemed hours after when I awoke She was still sitting by the fire she was absently marking in the ashes with a stick I happened to be the first one up next morning and as I stirred up the fire I saw Baby written in the ashes We had breakfasted and the men had gone their ways when missus O Shaughnessy said to me It is a blessed old soul missus Mortimer is Do you mind any good lesson that she taught us in the cabin beyont I did not remember She said The pangs of motherhood make us mothers not only of our own but of every child that needs mothering especially if our own little children need us no longer Fill their little places with ones who do need us Them s her very words and it s sweet truth it is Both my Katie and Sheridan have been grown and gone these many years and my heart has ached for childher and there s none but Cora Belle I am goin to get them childher this day What do you think about it I thought so well of it that in about two minutes we were harnessing the horses and were off to lay the plan before Hettie in record breaking time Poor Hettie she wept quietly while the advantages of the scheme were being pointed out She said I love the children dearly but I am not sure I can always feed and clothe them that has worried me a lot I am almost sure Bolton is dead I ll miss the little things but I am glad to know they are well provided for You can take them Now said missus O Shaughnessy you go on an marry your man if he is a decent sort Do it right away before something else happens It is an illigant wedding present I ll be sendin you You must come to see the childher often What s the b y s name We never did name him you see we had kind of run out of boys names We just called him Buddy I can find a name for him said missus O Shaughnessy Is there a Joseph in the family Hettie said no Well then he is named Joseph Bolton O Shaughnessy and I ll have them both baptized as soon as we get to Green River So in the morning we start with two new members missus O Shaughnessy is very happy I am so glad myself that I can hardly express myself We are all happy except mister Murry he has at last given up hopes and gone mister Haynes growls a little about having to travel along with a rolling nursery but he is just bluffing I am longing to see Junior We have not heard one word since we left them and I am so homesick for mother and my boy And you best of friends when shall I see your beloved face To morrow night we shall camp at Ten Trees and we shall be one day nearer home With much love ELINORE RUPERT STEWART XII A STAMPEDE IN CAMP ON THE DESERT October nineteen MY DEAR DEAR FRIEND It is with a chastened humble heart that I begin this letter I have stood face to face with tragedy and romance and to me one is as touching as the other but you will know better when I tell you what I mean We all bustled about to get started from Newfork Now that we had started all were homesick Just ahead of us was a drove of two thousand steers being driven to the railroad to be shipped I advise you to keep ahead of such drives when you take such a trip because the trampling of so many feet makes a road almost impassable What had been snow in the mountains had been rain on the desert and we found the going decidedly bad A rise of a hill would give us now and then a glimpse of a slow moving dark colored mass of heaving forms and the desert breezes brought to our ears the mournful lowing of the poor creatures Sometimes too we could hear a snatch of the cowboys songs It was all very beautiful and I would have enjoyed it hugely except that my desire to be home far outran the wagon and I felt like a prisoner with clogs We nooned at the cabin of Timothy Hobbs but no one was at home he at last had gone back East for Jennie About mid afternoon the boss of the cow outfit came up on a splendid horse He was a pleasant fellow and he made a handsome picture with his big hat his great chaps and his jangling spurs as he rode along beside our wagons talking He told us that a crazy duffer had gone about over the desert for years digging wells but at last he struck water A few miles ahead was a well flowing like an artesian well There would be plenty of water for every one even the cattle Next morning we could start ahead of the herds and so the roads would be a little better It was quite early when we made camp in the same long draw where we saw Olaf There was a great change Where had been dry burning sand was now a clear little stream that formed shallow pools where the sand had blown away so that harder soil could form a bottom less greedy than the sand Off to our left the uneasy herd was being held in a wide flat valley They were grazing on the dry sparse herbage of the desert Quite near the well the mess wagon had stopped and the cook was already preparing supper Beyond a few yards away a freighter s long outfit was stopped in the road Did you ever see the kind of freight outfit that is used to bring the great loads across the desert Then I ll tell you about the one we camped near Freight wagons are not made precisely like others they are very much larger and stronger Several of these are coupled together then as many teams as is necessary are hitched on making a long unbroken string of wagons The horses are arranged in the same manner as the wagons Great chains are used to pull the wagons and when a camp is made the whole affair is stopped in the middle of the road and the harness is dropped right where the horse that bore it stood Many freighters have what they call a coaster hitched to the last wagon The coaster is almost like other wagons but it is a home on wheels it is built and furnished as sheep wagons are This freighter had one and as we drove past I was surprised to see the form of a woman and a small boy We camped quite near them For an hour we were very busy preparing supper and arranging for the night As we sat at supper I thought I had never known so quiet and peaceful an hour The sun hung like a great red ball in the hazy west Purple shadows were already gathering A gentle wind rippled past across the dun sands and through the gray green sage The chain parts of the hobbles and halters made a clinking sound as the horses fed about Presently we heard a rumbling just like distant thunder The cowboys sprang into their saddles we heard a shot and then we knew the terrible truth the steers had stampeded For me the next few minutes were an eternity of frightful confusion missus O Shaughnessy and I found ourselves with the children upon our largest wagon that was absolutely all the protection to be had It would have gone down like a house of cards if that heaving sea of destruction had turned our way I was scared witless missus O Shaughnessy knelt among the children praying with white lips I stood up watching the terrible scene The men hastily set the horses free There was no time to mount them and ride to safety with so many little children and as there was nothing to tie them to but the wagons we had to let them go so as to have the wagons left for shelter This is why cowboys are such well loved figures of romance and in mentioning them romance is fact Greater love hath no man than this that he lay down his life for his brother They knew nothing about us only that we were defenseless They rode boldly on their stanch little horses flanking the frenzied steers shooting a leader here and there as they got a chance If an animal stumbled it went down to its death for hundreds of pounding hoofs would trample it to pulp So it would have been with the boys if their horses had stepped into a badger hole or anything of the kind had happened So the tide was turned or the steers kept of themselves I don t know which on up the valley instead of coming up our draw The danger was past Presently the cowboys came straggling back missus O Shaughnessy ran to meet them So when two on one horse came with a third riding close beside helping to hold an injured man on we knew some one was hurt missus O Shaughnessy was as usual ready and able to help But the freighter s daughter was as quick and had a mattress ready beside the coaster by the time the cowboys came up with the wounded man Gently the men helped their comrade to the mattress and gently missus O Shaughnessy and the girl began their work I quieted the children and put them to bed The men were busy rounding up the horses The cowboys kept talking together in low tones and coming and going in twos and threes They acted so queerly that I wondered if some one else was not hurt I asked the boss if any more of his men were hurt He said no none of his men were I knew none of our men or the freighter were harmed so I dismissed fear and went to missus O Shaughnessy Poor boy she said he has a broken thigh and he s hurt inside His belly is knocked into a cocked hat We will pull him through A man has already gone back to Newfork to get an automobile They will take him to Rock Springs to the hospital in the morning missus O Shaughnessy and the girl were doing all that could be done they sent me back to care for the children To keep warm I crawled under the blankets but not to sleep It didn t seem to me that I could ever sleep again I could hear the men talking in subdued tones The boss was dispatching men to different places Presently I saw some men take a lantern and move off toward the valley I could see the light twinkling in and out among the sage brush They stopped I could see forms pass before the light I wondered what could be the matter The horses were all safe even Boy mister Haynes s dog was safe shivering and whining on his master s blankets I could plainly hear the hiccoughs of the wounded man the click cluck click cluck kept on with maddening persistence but at last his nurses forced enough hot water down him to cause vomiting The blood clots came and the poor fellow fell asleep A lantern was hung upon the wagon and the two women went into the coaster to make some coffee It was three o clock in the morning when the men of our outfit came back They put on their heavy coats and were seeing to their horses I asked Clyde what was the matter Hush he said lie still It is Olaf But I want to help I said You can t help It s all over he replied as he started again to where the lantern was gleaming like a star fallen among the sage I tucked the children in a little more snugly then went over to the coaster Won t you come to bed and rest I asked missus O Shaughnessy No I ll not Are me children covered and warm Yes I answered What are them fellys pow wowing about down in the sage Olaf is dead I said Who says God is not merciful Now all the poor felly s troubles are done with Twas him that caused the stampede mayhap God send him peace I am glad He will never be hungry nor cold any more Yes said the girl speaking slowly I am glad too He almost lived in this draw We saw him every trip and he did suffer Dad left a little for him to eat and whatever he could to wear every trip The sheep herders helped him too But he suffered All the home he had was an old thrown away sheep wagon down beyond the last ridge toward the valley I ve seen him every two weeks for ten years It s a wonder he has not been killed before I wonder said missus O Shaughnessy if he has any family Where will they bury him He has no people If they will listen to Dad they will lay him here on the desert He would want it so After breakfast missus O Shaughnessy lay down for a little rest When the wounded man awoke the girl gave him a little coffee You re awful good to me he said I d like to have you around all the time The girl smiled gravely Ain t you got nobody to take care of you No What is your name Amy Winters Now you must hush Talkin might make you worse I m not so tur ble bad off Where do you live In the coaster somewhere on the road between Pinedale and Rock Springs Dad is a freighter Huh Do you like to live that way No I want a house and a garden awful bad but Dad can t do nothin but freight and we ve got Jessie to raise We ain t got no ma Do women have to change their names when they marry I don t know Reckon they do though Why Cause my name is Tod Winters I know where there is a dandy little place up on the Gros Ventre where a cabin would look mighty good to me if there was some one to keep it for me Oh say she interrupted that is a awful pretty handkerchief you ve got around your neck Just then the automobile came up frightening our horses I heard no more but the awful pretty handkerchief was missing when the hero left for the hospital They used some lumber from a load the freighter had and walled up a grave for Olaf They had no tools but axes and a shovel we had along By noon Olaf was buried Glenholdt set a slab of sandstone at the head With his knife he had dug out these words Olaf The friend of horses We camped last night at Ten Trees To night we are at Eden Valley The mystery of missus O Shaughnessy s sudden change about the license is explained She unloaded an elk at the Sanders cabin Twas two I aimed to bring you but me own family has increased by twins whilst I ve been gone so one ilk will have to do you So now dear friend I am a little nearer you In one more week I shall be home Sincerely thankfully yours E R S XIII NEARING HOME AT THE WELL IN THE DESERT October twenty one DEAR FRIEND We shall reach Green River City to night We will rest the teams one day then start home It will take us two days from Green River to reach home so this is the last letter on the road When we made camp here last night we saw some one coming on horseback along the canyon rim on the opposite side The form seemed familiar and the horse looked like one I had seen but I dared not believe my eyes Clyde who was helping to draw water from the eighty foot well without a pulley thought I was bereft as I ran from the camp toward the advancing rider But although I thought what I saw must be a mirage still I knew missus Louderer on Bismarck Out of breath from my run I grasped her fat ankle and panted till I could speak Haf they run you out of camp you iss so bad she asked me by way of greeting Then more kindly Your boy iss all right the mutter also I am come though to find you It iss time you are home with the kinder Haf you any goose grease left I had all she had given me At camp joy knew no bounds Never was one more welcome than our beloved neighbor Her astonishment knew no bounds either when her big blue eyes rested upon missus O Shaughnessy s twins Frau O Shaughnessy she said severely what have you here You iss robbed an orphan asylum How haf you come by these missus O Shaughnessy is so full of life and good spirits and so delighted to talk about her childher that she gave a very animated recital of how she became a happy mother In turn missus Louderer told how she grew more and more alarmed by our long absence but decided not to alarm the neighbors so she had made a search party out of mineself and had fared forth to learn our fate We had a merry supper even Haynes became cheerful and there was no lagging next morning when we started for home When people go on elk hunts they are very likely to return in tatters so I am going to leave it to your imagination to picture our appearance when we drove up to the rear of the hotel about sundown Our friend missus Hutton came running to meet us I was ashamed to go into her house but she leaned up against the house and laughed until tears came What chased you she gasped You must have been run through some of those barbed wire things that they are putting up to stop the German army missus Hutton is a little lady who bolsters up self respect and makes light of trying situations so she shooed us in and I sneaked into my room and waited until Clyde could run down to the store and purchase me a dress I feel quite clean and respectable now sitting up here in my room writing this to you I will soon be at home now Until then good bye E R S XIV THE MEMORY BED October twenty five DEAR DEAR FRIEND Can you guess how happy I am Be it ever so humble there is no place like home It is so good to sit in my creaky old rocker to hold Junior to feel his dear weight to look at my brave little mother I do not like the in law She is mother to me Under the east window of our dining room we have a flower bed We call it our memory bed because Clyde s first wife had it made and kept pansies growing there We poured the water of my little lost boy s last bath onto the memory bed I keep pansies growing in one side of the bed in memory of her who loved them In the other end I plant sweet alyssum in memory of my baby A few pansies and a tuft of sweet alyssum smiled a welcome though all the rest of my flowers were dead We have a hop vine at the window and it has protected the flowers in the memory bed How happy I have been looking over the place Some young calves have come while we were gone a whole squirming nest full of little pigs My chickens have outgrown my knowledge There is no snow here at all Our experiences on our trip seem almost unreal but the wagon load of meat to be attended to is a reminder of realities I have had a fine trip I have experienced about all the human emotions I had not expected to encounter so many people or to get the little inside glimpses that I ve had but wherever there are human beings there are the little histories I have come home realizing anew how happy I am how much I have been spared and how many of life s blessings are mine Poor missus Louderer childless and alone openly envying missus O Shaughnessy her babies In my bedroom there is a row of four little brown heads asleep on their pillows Four precious kiddies all my own And not the least of my blessings you to tell my happiness to Has my trip interested you dear friend I hope you liked it It will lose a little of its charm for me if you find it uninteresting I will write you again soon Your happy friend E R S THE END TRANSCRIBER S NOTES Minor changes
