A SHROPSHIRE LAD Produced by Albert Imrie A SHROPSHIRE LAD By A E Housman Introduction by William Stanley Braithwaite nineteen nineteen INTRODUCTION The method of the poems in A Shropshire Lad illustrates better than any theory how poetry may assume the attire of reality and yet in speech of the simplest become in spirit the sheer quality of loveliness For in these unobtrusive pages there is nothing shunned which makes the spectacle of life parade its dark and painful its ironic and cynical burdens as well as those images with happy and exquisite aspects With a broader and deeper background of experience and environment which by some divine special privilege belongs to the poetic imagination it is easier to set apart and contrast these opposing words and sympathies in a poet but here we find them evoked in a restricted locale an English county where the rich cool tranquil landscape gives a solid texture to the human show What I think impresses one thrills like ecstatic half smothered strains of music floating from unperceived instruments in mister Housman s poems is the encounter his spirit constantly endures with life It is this encounter what you feel in the Greeks and as in the Greeks it is a spiritual waging of miraculous forces There is too in mister Housman s poems the singularly Grecian Quality of a clean and fragrant mental and emotional temper vibrating equally whether the theme dealt with is ruin or defeat or some great tragic crisis of spirit or with moods and ardours of pure enjoyment and simplicities of feeling Scarcely has any modern book of poems shown so sure a touch of genius in this respect the magic in a continuous glow saturating the substance of every picture and motive with its own peculiar essence What has been called the cynical bitterness of mister Housman s poems is really nothing more than his ability to etch in sharp tones the actualities of experience The poet himself is never cynical his joyousness is all too apparent in the very manner and intensity of expression The lads of Ludlow are so human to him the hawthorn and broom on the Severn shores are so fragrant with associations he cannot help but compose under a kind of imaginative wizardry of exultation even when the immediate subject is grim or grotesque In many of these brief tense poems the reader confronts a mask as it were with appalling and distorted lineaments but behind it the poet smiles perhaps sardonically but smiles nevertheless In the real countenance there are no tears or grievances but a quizzical humorous expression which shows when one has torn the subterfuge away that here is a spirit whom life may menace with its contradictions and fatalities but never dupe with its circumstance and mystery All this quite points to and partly explains the charm of the poems in A Shropshire Lad The fastidious care with which each poem is built out of the simplest of technical elements the precise tone and color of language employed to articulate impulse and mood and the reproduction of objective substances for a clear visualization of character and scene all tend by a sure and unfaltering composition to present a lyric art unique in English poetry of the last twenty five years I dare say I have scarcely touched upon the secret of mister Housman s book For some it may radiate from the Shropshire life he so finely etches for others in the vivid artistic simplicity and unity of values through which Shropshire lads and landscapes are presented It must be however in the miraculous fusing of the two Whatever that secret is the charm of it never fails after all these years to keep the poems preserved with a freshness and vitality which are the qualities of enduring genius WILLIAM STANLEY BRAITHWAITE A SHROPSHIRE LAD I eighteen eighty seven From Clee to heaven the beacon burns The shires have seen it plain From north and south the sign returns And beacons burn again Look left look right the hills are bright The dales are light between Because tis fifty years to night That God has saved the Queen Now when the flame they watch not towers About the soil they trod Lads we ll remember friends of ours Who shared the work with God To skies that knit their heartstrings right To fields that bred them brave The saviours come not home to night Themselves they could not save It dawns in Asia tombstones show And Shropshire names are read And the Nile spills his overflow Beside the Severn s dead We pledge in peace by farm and town The Queen they served in war And fire the beacons up and down The land they perished for God Save the Queen we living sing From height to height tis heard And with the rest your voices ring Lads of the Fifty third Oh God will save her fear you not Be you the men you ve been Get you the sons your fathers got And God will Save the Queen II Loveliest of trees the cherry now Is hung with bloom along the bough And stands about the woodland ride Wearing white for Eastertide Now of my threescore years and ten Twenty will not come again And take from seventy springs a score It only leaves me fifty more And since to look at things in bloom Fifty springs are little room About the woodlands I will go To see the cherry hung with snow III THE RECRUIT Leave your home behind lad And reach your friends your hand And go and luck go with you While Ludlow tower shall stand Oh come you home of Sunday When Ludlow streets are still And Ludlow bells are calling To farm and lane and mill Or come you home of Monday When Ludlow market hums And Ludlow chimes are playing The conquering hero comes Come you home a hero Or come not home at all The lads you leave will mind you Till Ludlow tower shall fall And you will list the bugle That blows in lands of morn And make the foes of England Be sorry you were born And you till trump of doomsday On lands of morn may lie And make the hearts of comrades Be heavy where you die Leave your home behind you Your friends by field and town Oh town and field will mind you Till Ludlow tower is down IV REVEILLE Wake the silver dusk returning Up the beach of darkness brims And the ship of sunrise burning Strands upon the eastern rims Wake the vaulted shadow shatters Trampled to the floor it spanned And the tent of night in tatters Straws the sky pavilioned land Up lad up tis late for lying Hear the drums of morning play Hark the empty highways crying Who ll beyond the hills away Towns and countries woo together Forelands beacon belfries call Never lad that trod on leather Lived to feast his heart with all Up lad thews that lie and cumber Sunlit pallets never thrive Morns abed and daylight slumber Were not meant for man alive Clay lies still but blood s a rover Breath s a ware that will not keep Up lad when the journey s over There ll be time enough to sleep V Oh see how thick the goldcup flowers Are lying in field and lane With dandelions to tell the hours That never are told again Oh may I squire you round the meads And pick you posies gay Twill do no harm to take my arm You may young man you may Ah spring was sent for lass and lad Tis now the blood runs gold And man and maid had best be glad Before the world is old What flowers to day may flower to morrow But never as good as new Suppose I wound my arm right round Tis true young man tis true Some lads there are tis shame to say That only court to thieve And once they bear the bloom away Tis little enough they leave Then keep your heart for men like me And safe from trustless chaps My love is true and all for you Perhaps young man perhaps Oh look in my eyes then can you doubt Why tis a mile from town How green the grass is all about We might as well sit down Ah life what is it but a flower Why must true lovers sigh Be kind have pity my own my pretty Good bye young man good bye VI When the lad for longing sighs Mute and dull of cheer and pale If at death s own door he lies Maiden you can heal his ail Lovers ills are all to buy The wan look the hollow tone The hung head the sunken eye You can have them for your own Buy them buy them eve and morn Lovers ills are all to sell Then you can lie down forlorn But the lover will be well VII When smoke stood up from Ludlow And mist blew off from Teme And blithe afield to ploughing Against the morning beam I strode beside my team The blackbird in the coppice Looked out to see me stride And hearkened as I whistled The tramping team beside And fluted and replied Lie down lie down young yeoman What use to rise and rise Rise man a thousand mornings Yet down at last he lies And then the man is wise I heard the tune he sang me And spied his yellow bill I picked a stone and aimed it And threw it with a will Then the bird was still Then my soul within me Took up the blackbird s strain And still beside the horses Along the dewy lane It Sang the song again Lie down lie down young yeoman The sun moves always west The road one treads to labour Will lead one home to rest And that will be the best VIII Farewell to barn and stack and tree Farewell to Severn shore Terence look your last at me For I come home no more The sun burns on the half mown hill By now the blood is dried And Maurice amongst the hay lies still And my knife is in his side My mother thinks us long away Tis time the field were mown She had two sons at rising day To night she ll be alone And here s a bloody hand to shake And oh man here s good bye We ll sweat no more on scythe and rake My bloody hands and I I wish you strength to bring you pride And a love to keep you clean And I wish you luck come Lammastide At racing on the green Long for me the rick will wait And long will wait the fold And long will stand the empty plate And dinner will be cold IX On moonlit heath and lonesome bank The sheep beside me graze And yon the gallows used to clank Fast by the four cross ways A careless shepherd once would keep The flocks by moonlight there one And high amongst the glimmering sheep The dead man stood on air They hang us now in Shrewsbury jail The whistles blow forlorn And trains all night groan on the rail To men that die at morn There sleeps in Shrewsbury jail to night Or wakes as may betide A better lad if things went right Than most that sleep outside And naked to the hangman s noose The morning clocks will ring A neck God made for other use Than strangling in a string And sharp the link of life will snap And dead on air will stand Heels that held up as straight a chap As treads upon the land So here I ll watch the night and wait To see the morning shine When he will hear the stroke of eight And not the stroke of nine And wish my friend as sound a sleep As lads I did not know That shepherded the moonlit sheep A hundred years ago one Hanging in chains was called keeping sheep by moonlight X MARCH The sun at noon to higher air Unharnessing the silver Pair That late before his chariot swam Rides on the gold wool of the Ram So braver notes the storm cock sings To start the rusted wheel of things And brutes in field and brutes in pen Leap that the world goes round again The boys are up the woods with day To fetch the daffodils away And home at noonday from the hills They bring no dearth of daffodils Afield for palms the girls repair And sure enough the palms are there And each will find by hedge or pond Her waving silver tufted wand In farm and field through all the shire The eye beholds the heart s desire Ah let not only mine be vain For lovers should be loved again XI On your midnight pallet lying Listen and undo the door Lads that waste the light in sighing In the dark should sigh no more Night should ease a lover s sorrow Therefore since I go to morrow Pity me before In the land to which I travel The far dwelling let me say Once if here the couch is gravel In a kinder bed I lay And the breast the darnel smothers Rested once upon another s When it was not clay XII When I watch the living meet And the moving pageant file Warm and breathing through the street Where I lodge a little while If the heats of hate and lust In the house of flesh are strong Let me mind the house of dust Where my sojourn shall be long In the nation that is not Nothing stands that stood before There revenges are forgot And the hater hates no more Lovers lying two and two Ask not whom they sleep beside And the bridegroom all night through Never turns him to the bride XIII When I was one and twenty I heard a wise man say Give crowns and pounds and guineas But not your heart away Give pearls away and rubies But keep your fancy free But I was one and twenty No use to talk to me When I was one and twenty I heard him say again The heart out of the bosom Was never given in vain Tis paid with sighs a plenty And sold for endless rue And I am two and twenty And oh tis true tis true XIV There pass the careless people That call their souls their own Here by the road I loiter How idle and alone Ah past the plunge of plummet In seas I cannot sound My heart and soul and senses World without end are drowned His folly has not fellow Beneath the blue of day That gives to man or woman His heart and soul away There flowers no balm to sain him From east of earth to west That s lost for everlasting The heart out of his breast Here by the labouring highway With empty hands I stroll Sea deep till doomsday morning Lie lost my heart and soul XV Look not in my eyes for fear They mirror true the sight I see And there you find your face too clear And love it and be lost like me One the long nights through must lie Spent in star defeated sighs But why should you as well as I Perish gaze not in my eyes A Grecian lad as I hear tell One that many loved in vain Looked into a forest well And never looked away again There when the turf in springtime flowers With downward eye and gazes sad Stands amid the glancing showers A jonquil not a Grecian lad XVI It nods and curtseys and recovers When the wind blows above The nettle on the graves of lovers That hanged themselves for love The nettle nods the wind blows over The man he does not move The lover of the grave the lover That hanged himself for love XVII Twice a week the winter thorough Here stood I to keep the goal Football then was fighting sorrow For the young man s soul Now in May time to the wicket Out I march with bat and pad See the son of grief at cricket Trying to be glad Try I will no harm in trying Wonder tis how little mirth Keeps the bones of man from lying On the bed of earth XVIII Oh when I was in love with you Then I was clean and brave And miles around the wonder grew How well did I behave And now the fancy passes by And nothing will remain And miles around they ll say that I Am quite myself again XIX TO AN ATHLETE DYING YOUNG The time you won your town the race We chaired you through the market place Man and boy stood cheering by And home we brought you shoulder high To day the road all runners come Shoulder high we bring you home And set you at your threshold down Townsman of a stiller town Smart lad to slip betimes away From fields where glory does not stay And early though the laurel grows It withers quicker than the rose Eyes the shady night has shut Cannot see the record cut And silence sounds no worse than cheers After earth has stopped the ears Now you will not swell the rout Of lads that wore their honours out Runners whom renown outran And the name died before the man So set before its echoes fade The fleet foot on the sill of shade And hold to the low lintel up The still defended challenge cup And round that early laurelled head Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead And find unwithered on its curls The garland briefer than a girl s XX Oh fair enough are sky and plain But I know fairer far Those are as beautiful again That in the water are The pools and rivers wash so clean The trees and clouds and air The like on earth was never seen And oh that I were there These are the thoughts I often think As I stand gazing down In act upon the cressy brink To strip and dive and drown But in the golden sanded brooks And azure meres I spy A silly lad that longs and looks And wishes he were I XXI BREDON HILL one In summertime on Bredon The bells they sound so clear Round both the shires they ring them In steeples far and near A happy noise to hear Here of a Sunday morning My love and I would lie And see the coloured counties And hear the larks so high About us in the sky The bells would ring to call her In valleys miles away Come all to church good people Good people come and pray But here my love would stay And I would turn and answer Among the springing thyme Oh peal upon our wedding And we will hear the chime And come to church in time But when the snows at Christmas On Bredon top were strown My love rose up so early And stole out unbeknown And went to church alone They tolled the one bell only Groom there was none to see The mourners followed after And so to church went she And would not wait for me The bells they sound on Bredon And still the steeples hum Come all to church good people Oh noisy bells be dumb I hear you I will come one Pronounced Breedon XXII The street sounds to the soldiers tread And out we troop to see A single redcoat turns his head He turns and looks at me My man from sky to sky s so far We never crossed before Such leagues apart the world s ends are We re like to meet no more What thoughts at heart have you and I We cannot stop to tell But dead or living drunk or dry Soldier I wish you well XXIII The lads in their hundreds to Ludlow come in for the fair There s men from the barn and the forge and the mill and the fold The lads for the girls and the lads for the liquor are there And there with the rest are the lads that will never be old There s chaps from the town and the field and the till and the cart And many to count are the stalwart and many the brave And many the handsome of face and the handsome of heart And few that will carry their looks or their truth to the grave I wish one could know them I wish there were tokens to tell The fortunate fellows that now you can never discern And then one could talk with them friendly and wish them farewell And watch them depart on the way that they will not return But now you may stare as you like and there s nothing to scan And brushing your elbow unguessed at and not to be told They carry back bright to the coiner the mintage of man The lads that will die in their glory and never be old XXIV Say lad have you things to do Quick then while your day s at prime Quick and if tis work for two Here am I man now s your time Send me now and I shall go Call me I shall hear you call Use me ere they lay me low Where a man s no use at all Ere the wholesome flesh decay And the willing nerve be numb And the lips lack breath to say No my lad I cannot come XXV This time of year a twelvemonth past When Fred and I would meet We needs must jangle till at last We fought and I was beat So then the summer fields about Till rainy days began Rose Harland on her Sundays out Walked with the better man The better man she walks with still Though now tis not with Fred A lad that lives and has his will Is worth a dozen dead Fred keeps the house all kinds of weather And clay s the house he keeps When Rose and I walk out together Stock still lies Fred and sleeps XXVI Along the fields as we came by A year ago my love and I The aspen over stile and stone Was talking to itself alone Oh who are these that kiss and pass A country lover and his lass Two lovers looking to be wed And time shall put them both to bed But she shall lie with earth above And he beside another love And sure enough beneath the tree There walks another love with me And overhead the aspen heaves Its rainy sounding silver leaves And I spell nothing in their stir But now perhaps they speak to her And plain for her to understand They talk about a time at hand When I shall sleep with clover clad And she beside another lad XXVII Is my team ploughing That I was used to drive And hear the harness jingle When I was man alive Ay the horses trample The harness jingles now No change though you lie under The land you used to plough Is football playing Along the river shore With lads to chase the leather Now I stand up no more Ay the ball is flying The lads play heart and soul The goal stands up the keeper Stands up to keep the goal Is my girl happy That I thought hard to leave And has she tired of weeping As she lies down at eve Ay she lies down lightly She lies not down to weep Your girl is well contented Be still my lad and sleep Is my friend hearty Now I am thin and pine And has he found to sleep in A better bed than mine Yes lad I lie easy I lie as lads would choose I cheer a dead man s sweetheart Never ask me whose XXVIII THE WELSH MARCHES High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam Islanded in Severn stream The bridges from the steepled crest Cross the water east and west The flag of morn in conqueror s state Enters at the English gate The vanquished eve as night prevails Bleeds upon the road to Wales Ages since the vanquished bled Round my mother s marriage bed There the ravens feasted far About the open house of war When Severn down to Buildwas ran Coloured with the death of man Couched upon her brother s grave The Saxon got me on the slave The sound of fight is silent long That began the ancient wrong Long the voice of tears is still That wept of old the endless ill In my heart it has not died The war that sleeps on Severn side They cease not fighting east and west On the marches of my breast Here the truceless armies yet Trample rolled in blood and sweat They kill and kill and never die And I think that each is I None will part us none undo The knot that makes one flesh of two Sick with hatred sick with pain Strangling When shall we be slain When shall I be dead and rid Of the wrong my father did How long how long till spade and hearse Put to sleep my mother s curse XXIX THE LENT LILY Tis spring come out to ramble The hilly brakes around For under thorn and bramble About the hollow ground The primroses are found And there s the windflower chilly With all the winds at play And there s the Lenten lily That has not long to stay And dies on Easter day And since till girls go maying You find the primrose still And find the windflower playing With every wind at will But not the daffodil Bring baskets now and sally Upon the spring s array And bear from hill and valley The daffodil away That dies on Easter day XXX Others I am not the first Have willed more mischief than they durst If in the breathless night I too Shiver now tis nothing new More than I if truth were told Have stood and sweated hot and cold And through their reins in ice and fire Fear contended with desire Agued once like me were they But I like them shall win my way Lastly to the bed of mould Where there s neither heat nor cold But from my grave across my brow Plays no wind of healing now And fire and ice within me fight Beneath the suffocating night XXXI On Wenlock Edge the wood s in trouble His forest fleece the Wrekin heaves The gale it plies the saplings double And thick on Severn snow the leaves Twould blow like this through holt and hanger When Uricon the city stood Tis the old wind in the old anger But then it threshed another wood Then twas before my time the Roman At yonder heaving hill would stare The blood that warms an English yeoman The thoughts that hurt him they were there There like the wind through woods in riot Through him the gale of life blew high The tree of man was never quiet Then twas the Roman now tis I The gale it plies the saplings double It blows so hard twill soon be gone To day the Roman and his trouble Are ashes under Uricon XXXII From far from eve and morning And yon twelve winded sky The stuff of life to knit me Blew hither here am I Now for a breath I tarry Nor yet disperse apart Take my hand quick and tell me What have you in your heart Speak now and I will answer How shall I help you say Ere to the wind s twelve quarters I take my endless way XXXIII If truth in hearts that perish Could move the powers on high I think the love I bear you Should make you not to die Sure sure if stedfast meaning If single thought could save The world might end to morrow You should not see the grave This long and sure set liking This boundless will to please Oh you should live for ever If there were help in these But now since all is idle To this lost heart be kind Ere to a town you journey Where friends are ill to find XXXIV THE NEW MISTRESS Oh sick I am to see you will you never let me be You may be good for something but you are not good for me Oh go where you are wanted for you are not wanted here And that was all the farewell when I parted from my dear I will go where I am wanted to a lady born and bred Who will dress me free for nothing in a uniform of red She will not be sick to see me if I only keep it clean I will go where I am wanted for a soldier of the Queen I will go where I am wanted for the sergeant does not mind He may be sick to see me but he treats me very kind He gives me beer and breakfast and a ribbon for my cap And I never knew a sweetheart spend her money on a chap I will go where I am wanted where there s room for one or two And the men are none too many for the work there is to do Where the standing line wears thinner and the dropping dead lie thick And the enemies of England they shall see me and be sick XXXV
