none	none	During such singing the fire blazes up The walls are rich in art My rod is new and trig There is work but there is no worry I am rich rich I have the Singing Mouse And so strange so wondrous so real are the things it sings so bewitching is the song so sweeter than that of any siren s so broad and fine are the countries so strong and true are the friendships so brave and kind are the men I meet so beautiful the whole world of the Singing Mouse that when it is over and in a chill I start up I scarce can bear the shrinking in of the walls and the grayness of the once red fire and my gold turned to earthenware and my pictures turned to splotches In my hand everything I touch feels awkward A pen a pen to talk of that If one could use it while in the land of the Singing Mouse then it might do I think the pens there are not of wood and iron stiff things of torture to reader and writer I have a notion though I have not examined the pens there that they are made from plumes of an angel s wing and that if they chose they could talk and say things which would make you and me ashamed and afraid Pens such as these we do not have Illustration Illustration The Burden of A Song Illustration THE BURDEN OF A SONG 
5013-31085-0000	train-other-500	The Singing Mouse came out Quaintly and sweetly and with wondrous clearness it began an old old song I first heard long ago And as it sang
5013-31085-0001	train-other-500	back with red electric thrill came the fine blood of youth and beat in pulse with the song When all the world is young lad And all the trees are green
5013-31085-0002	train-other-500	And every goose a swan lad And every lass a queen Then hey for boot and saddle lad And round the world away Young blood must have its course lad
5013-31085-0003	train-other-500	And every dog his day And young blood began its course anew Booted and spurred into the saddle again Face toward the West And off
none	none	 for round the world away There are green fields in Thrace sighs the gladiator as he dies And here were green fields in the land before us Only these were the inimitable and illimitable fields of Nature Sheets and waves and billows 
5013-31085-0004	train-other-500	and tumbles of green oceans unswum continents untracked of thousandfold green Then on beyond the gray the gray brown

5013-31085-0009	train-other-500	God bless them Nay brother God has blessed them blessed them with unbounded calm with boundless strength with unspeakable peace You can
5013-31085-0010	train-other-500	take your troubles to the mountains If you are Pueblo Aztec you can select some big mountain and pray to it as its top shows the red sentience of the on coming day
5013-31085-0011	train-other-500	You can take your troubles to the sea but the sea has troubles of its own and frets There is commerce on the sea and the people who live near it are fretful greedy grasping
5013-31085-0012	train-other-500	The mountains have no troubles they have no commerce The dwellers of the mountains are calm and unfretted And on the broad shoulders of the mountains

5013-31085-0020	train-other-500	now by some impulse of the dog which hasn t had any day It is winter now I remember Singing Mouse and I am walking by the shore of the great Inland Seas
5013-31085-0021	train-other-500	There is snow on the ground The trees look black in contrast as you gaze up from the beach against the high bank It is cold It is dark
5012_31089_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 look 
5012_31097_000016_000005	train-clean-360	look 
none	none	black in contrast as you gaze up from the beach against the high bank It is cold It is dark There is a shiver in the air 
5013-31085-0022	train-other-500	There are icicles in the sky Something is flying through the trees but silent as if it came out of a grave I have been walking I know
5013-31085-0023	train-other-500	I have walked a million miles and I m tired My legs are stiff and my legging has frozen fast to my overshoe I remember that And so
5013-31085-0024	train-other-500	I sit down right here you know and look out over the lake just over there you see The ice reaches out from the shore into the lake a long way
5013-31085-0025	train-other-500	and it is covered with snow and looks white I can follow that white glimmer in a long long curve to the right twenty miles or more maybe Yes
5013-31085-0026	train-other-500	it is cold But ah what is that out there and what is it doing It is setting all the long white curves of ice afire
none	none	 It is throwing down hammered silver in a broad path 
5013-31085-0027	train-other-500	out there on the water Those are not ripples That is silver There will be angels walking on that pathway before long That is not the moon coming up over the lake It is the swinging open
none	none	 by some careless angel s mischance 
5013-31085-0028	train-other-500	of the door of the White City of Rest How old how sore a man climbed up the steep bank There were white fields
5013-31085-0029	train-other-500	In the distance a dog barked Away across the fields a bright and cheery light shone out from a window and as the moon rose higher it showed the house which held the light
5013-31085-0030	train-other-500	It was not a large house but it seemed to be a home Home what is that I wondered
none	none	 and I remember 
5013-31085-0031	train-other-500	that I pulled at the frozen legging and moved with pain the limbs grown tired and sore And as one looked at that twinkling comfortable light how plainly the rest of the old song
5013-31085-0032	train-other-500	came back When all the world is old lad And all the trees are brown And all the sports are stale lad And all the wheels run down
5013-31085-0033	train-other-500	Creep home and take your place there The sick and maimed among God grant you find one face there You loved when
none	none	 you were young 
5013-31085-0034	train-other-500	The light in the little house went out I think it was a happy home May yours be so
none	none	 always Illustration Illustration The Little River Illustration THE LITTLE RIVER The Singing Mouse came out and sat upon my knee It fixed its small red eye upon me and lifted its tiny paws so thin the fire shone through them And it sang Like the voice of some night wandering bird of melody hid high in the upper realms of darkness came faint sweet notes falling softly down It was as if from the deep air above and from the wide air around there were dropping and drifting small links of silken steel gentle but strong so that one were helpless even had one wished to move To listen was also to see There were low rolling hills covered and crowned with a thick growth of hazel thickets and short oaks Between these hills ran long strips of green strung on tiny bands of silver And as these bands moved and thickened and braided themselves together I seemed to see a procession of the trees The cottonwoods halted in their march The box elders and maples and water elms and walnuts and such big trees swept grandly in with waving banners and wound on and on in long procession even down to two blue distant hills set at the edge of the world unpassed guardians of a land of dreams Ah well a day I look back at those two hills now and the land of dreams lies still beyond them it is true but it is now upon the side whence I first gazed It is back there where one can not go again back there along that crystal murmuring mystery of the little stream one knew when one was young Illustration Ah little river little river but I am coming back again Once more I push away the long grass and the swinging boughs and look into your face Again I dabble my bare feet and scoop up my straw hat full and watch the tiny streams run down Again I stand bare and small and trembling wondering if I can swim across And listen little river again at the same old place I shall cut me the willow wand and down the long slope to the certain place I knew I am going to hurry running the last quarter of a mile in sheer expectation but forgetting not the binding on of the tough linen line And now I cast my gaudy float on that same swinging wimpling dimpling eddy and let it swim in beneath the bank And No Can it be Have I here now again plainly in my hands the strange and wonderful creature the gift of the little stream Is this its form utterly lovable Is this its coat wrought of cloth of gold and silver Are these diamonds its eyes Oh little river little river give me back this gift to keep for ever Why take such things from us All I have I will give to you if you will but give back to me to have by me all the time this little fish from the pool beneath the boughs I have hunted well for him believe me hard and faithfully in many a place but he is no longer there I find him no longer even in the remotest spots I search But this is he This in my hands here in actual sight is my first my glorious iridescent radiant prize Pray you behold the glittering But along this little river there were other things when the leaves grew brown In those low easy hills strange creatures dwelt Birds of brown plumage and wondrous soul startling burst of wing Large gray creatures a foot long or longer with light tread on the leaves and long ears that went a peak when you whistled to them Were ever such beings before in any land For the pursuit of these it seems one must have boots with copper toes made waterproof by abundant tallow There must be a vast game bag a world too large for a boyish form and strange things to eat therein such as one sees no longer for on a chase calling for such daring do it may be needful that one walk far across the hills along the little river almost to the Delectable Mountains themselves Again I see it all Again I follow through the hills that same tall tireless figure with the grave and kindly face Again I wonder at the uncomprehended skill which brought whirling down ten out of the dozen of those brown lightning balls Again I rejoice beyond all count or measure over the first leporine murder committed by myself the same furthered by means of a rest on a forked tree It seems to me I groan secretly again at the weight of that great gun before the night has come I almost wince again at the pulling off of those copper toed boots at night there by the kitchen stove after the chase is done But ah how happy I am again holding up for the gaze of a kind pair of eyes this great gray creature with the lopping ears Now as we walk by the banks of this magic river I would that it might be always as it was in the earliest days I like best to think myself mistaken when I suspect a greater stoop in this once familiar form which knew these hills and woods so well It can not be that the quick eye has grown less bright 
5029_31091_000025_000004	train-clean-360	Yet why 
none	none	was the last mallard missed And tell me is not the old dog ranging as widely as once he did Can it be that he keeps closer at heel Does he look up once in a while mournfully with a dimmer eye at an eye becoming also dimmer does he walk more slowly by a step now not so fast Does he look up My God is there melancholy in a dog s eye too Illustration Illustration What the Waters Said Illustration WHAT THE WATERS SAID The fire was flickering fitfully and painting ghostly shadows on the wall It was winter and late in winter indeed the season was now at length drawing near to the end of winter and approaching that dear time of spring which beyond doubt will be the eventful front and closing of the circle in the land where winter will not come I had drawn the little pine table close to the heap of failing embers and aided by what light the sulky candle gave was bending over and trying to arrange a patch on my old hunting coat It was an old old hunting coat far gone in the sere and yellow leaf It was old fashioned now though once of proper cut and comeliness It was disfigured stained and worn The pockets were torn down The bindings were worn out It was quite willing to be left alone now hung by upon a forgotten nail and subject to no further requisition Nevertheless if its owner wished it could still do a day or two I knew that and something in the sturdy texture of its oft tried nature excited more than half my admiration and all my love Walpurgis on the ceiling gray coming on in the embers symptoms of death in the candle a blotch of tallow on the Shakespeare and the coat not half done It must have been about then I think that the thin edged sweetness of the Singing Mouse s voice pierced keenly through the air I was right glad when the little creature came and sat on my knee and in its affectionate way began to nibble at my finger tips It sat erect its thin paws waving with a tiny measured swing and in its mystic voice so infinitely small so sweet and yet so majestically strong began a song which no pen can transcribe Knowing that the awakening must come but unwilling to lose a moment of the dream I who with one finger could have crushed the little thing sat prizing it more and more as more and more its voice swept and swelled and rang rang till the fire burst high in noble pyramids of flame rang till the candle flashed in a thousand crystals swelled till the walls fell silently apart and showed that all this time I had been sitting ignorant of but yet within a grand and stately hall whose polished sides bore speaking canvas and noble marbles swept up and around till every stately niche and every tapestried corner and every lofty dome rang gently back in mellow music all for the Singing Mouse and me Small wizard it was fell cunning of ye so to paint upon the wall this picture of the old mill dam How naturally the wooded hill slopes back beyond the mill And how with the same old sleepy curves the river winds on back How green the trees how very green Ah Singing Mouse they do not mix that color now And nowhere do wide bottom lands wave and sing in such seemly grace so decked with yellow flowers with odd sweet william and the small wild rose And nowhere now on earth I know is there any stream to murmur so sweetly and so comfortably to say such words to any dreaming boy to babble of a work well done of conscience clear and of a success and happiness to come All that was in the river If I listen very hard and imagine very high and very deep I can almost pretend to hear them now those old words heard when I was young The voices are there I doubt not and there are other boys God keep them boys always and may they dream not backward but ahead This lazy pool beneath the far wing of the dam how smooth it looks Yet well we know the sunken log upon its farther side We have festooned it full oft with a big hook and hempen line And from that pool how many fatuous fishes have we not hauled forth Here we came often when we were boys and once did not certain bold souls sleep here all night curled up along the bank waking the next morning each with a sore throat tis true but with heart full proud at such high deed of valor And there is the long wooden bridge What a feat of engineering that bridge once seemed to our untraveled souls Behold it now as it was then lying in the level rays of the rising moon a brilliant causeway leading over into a land of mystery to glory perhaps perhaps to failure forgetfulness oblivion and rest And there I declare at the other end of this great roadway swimming up I declare in the same old way is the great round moon whose light served us when we stayed late at the dam in the summer evenings And the shadows of the bridge timbers are just as long and black and the ripples over the rocks at the middle span are just as beautiful and white And here right at our feet again the moon is playing its old tricks of painting faces in the water There are too many faces in the water Singing Mouse and I beg you cease repeating the words about the Corpus Delicti You would make one shudder Let us look no more at the faces in the water Illustration But still you bide by the waters tonight wizard for here is a picture of the sea It is the sea and it is talking as it always does There are some who think the sea speaks only of sorrow but this is not wholly true If you will listen thoughtfully enough you will find that it is not all of troubles that the sea is whispering Nor does it speak always of restlessness and change Some find a stimulus beside the sea and say it brings forgetfulness Rather let us call it exaltation Much more than of a petty excitement fit to blot a man s momentary woes it speaks in a sterner and a stronger note It throbs with the pulse of a further shore It speaks of a quiet tide making out to the Fortunate Islands and tells of a way of following gales and of a new Atlantis somewhere on beyond How dear this dream of a different land this story of Atlantis pathetically sought Certainly Atlantis is there out beyond somewhere in the sea and truly there are those who have discovered it and those who still may do so I know it Singing Mouse for I can read it written in the hollow of this tiny shell of pink you have found here by the shore borne across to us we may not doubt by an understanding tide from a place happily attained by those who wrote the message and sought to let us know Long time upon the mast our brown sail flapped Our keel plowed bitter salt and everywhere The ominous sky in sullen mystery wrapped What side we looked on either here or there The welcome sight of land long sadly sought And that Atlantis hid within the sea The land with all our hope and promise fraught We saw not yet nor wist where it might be But as we sailed as manful as we might And counted not the sail more fit than oar Lo o er the wave there burst a vision bright Of wood and winding stream and easy shore Then by the lofty light which shone above We knew at last our voyage sad was o er And we hard by the haven for which we strove And soon all past the need to wander more Then as our craft made safely on the strand And we all well our weary brown sail furled We gazed as strangers might at that fair land And hardly knew if it might be our world Till One took gently every weary hand And led us on to where still waters be And whispered softly Lo it hath been planned That thou at last this pleasant place shouldst see And as those dreaming so awakened we And looked with eyes unhurt on that fair sky And whispered hand in hand and eye to eye Tis our Atlantis risen from the sea Tis our Atlantis from the bitten sea Tis our Atlantis come again oh friend to thee and me Illustration Lake Belle Marie Illustration LAKE BELLE MARIE Lake Belle Marie lies far away Beyond the forest the mountains are white Beyond the mountains the sky rises blue high up into the infinite Unknown I do not know where the Singing Mouse lives No man can tell what journeys it may make such times as it is absent from the room that holds the pine table and the book and the candle and the open fire But last night when the faint shrill sweetness of its little voice grew apart from the lonely silence of the room and I turned and saw the Singing Mouse sitting on the corner of the book the light of the candle shining pink through its tiny paws almost the first word it said was of the far off Lake of Belle Marie Do you see it asked the Singing Mouse You mean The moon there through the window Do you see the moon and the stars Do you know where they are shining to night Do you see them there deep in the water Do you know where that is Do you know the water I know It is Lake Belle Marie And all I could do was to sit speechless For the fire was gone and the wall was open and the room was not a room The voice of the Singing Mouse shrill and sweet droned on a thousand miles away in smallness but every word a crystal of regret and joy A thousand feet deep or more or bottomless lies Lake Belle Marie for no man has ever fathomed it But no matter how deep the moon lies to night at the bottom and you can see it shining there deep down in the blue The stars are smaller so they stay up and sparkle on the surface The forest is very black to night is it not and the shadow of the pines on the point looks like a mass of actual substance Wait Did you see that silver creature leap from the quiet water You may know the shadow is but a shadow for you can see the chasing ripples pass through it and break it up into a crinkled fabric of the night Do you see the pines waving away up there in their tops and do you hear them talking They are always talking To night they are saying 
5029_31091_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Hush 
none	none	Belle Marie slumber Belle Marie we will watch we will watch hush hush hush Didn t you ever know what the pines said They wish no one ever to come near Lake Belle Marie Well for you that you only sat and looked at the face of Belle Marie and cast no line nor fired untimely shot around such shores The pines would have been angry and would have crushed you You do not know how they live seeking only to keep Belle Marie from the world standing close and sturdy together and threatening any who approach It would break their hearts to have her hiding place found out You do not know how they love her The pines are old old old many of them but they told me that no footprint of man was ever seen upon those shores that no boat ever rested on that little sea neither did ever a treacherous line wrinkle even the smallest portion of its smoothest coves Believe me to have Belle Marie known would break the hearts of the pines They told me they lived all the time only that they might every night sing Belle Marie to sleep and every morning look upon her face innocent pure unknown and unknowing therefore good sincere and utterly trustworthy That is why the pines live That is what they are talking about In many places I know the hearts of the pines are broken and they grieve continually That is because there are too many people In this valley the pines do not grieve They only talk among themselves In the morning they will wave their hands quite gaily and will say Waken waken Belle Marie Sweet is the day sweet is the day God hath given given given That is what the pines say in the morning Illustration The white mountains yonder are very old How strong and quiet they are and how sure of themselves To be quiet and strong one needs to be old for small things do not matter then Do you know what the mountains think as they stand there shoulder to shoulder for they live only to shield and protect the forest here in the valley They told me they were thinking of the smallness and the quickness of the days Age unto age is what the mountains whisper AEon unto aeon Strong strong strong is Time And yet I knew these mighty pillars stood only to shield the forest which shielded Belle Marie So I stood upon the last mountain and looked upon the great blue of the sky and there again I saw the face of Lake Belle Marie and the circle was complete and I sought no more for I knew that from the abode of perfect unhurt nature it is but a step up to the perfect peace and rest of the land where lives that Time whose name the mountains voice in awe And now do you see what is happening on Lake Belle Marie Through the cleft in the forest the pink of the early day is showing and light shines through the spaces of the pines And down the pebbles of the beach knee deep into the shining flood steps a noble creature antlered beautiful admirable Do you see him drink and do you see him raise his head and look about with gentle and fearless eye This creature is of the place and no hand must harm him Let the thin blue smoke die down Attempt no foot farther on Disturb not this spot Return But before you go take one more look upon the Lake of Belle Marie So again I gazed upon the face of the lake which seemed innocent and sincere and trustworthy and deserving of the protection of the league of the pines and the army of the mountains and the canopy of the unshamed sky And then the voice of the Singing Mouse employed in some song whose language I do not yet fully understand faded and sank away and even as it passed the walls came back and the ashes lay gray upon the hearth Illustration Illustration The Skull and the Rose Illustration THE SKULL AND THE ROSE The Singing Mouse peeped out from the hollow orbit of the white skull which lies upon the table next to the volume of Shakespeare 
5012_31089_000006_000001	train-clean-360	It reached down a tiny pink paw and touched a leaf of the brave red rose which every day lies before the skull 
5012_31089_000006_000002	train-clean-360	It plucked the leaf which made a buckler for its small throbbing breast 
5012_31089_000006_000003	train-clean-360	It spoke 
none	none	The rose is bold and red said the Singing Mouse Blood is red A skull is white 
5012_31089_000007_000003	train-clean-360	The rose and the skull love one another They understand 
5012_31089_000017_000001	train-clean-360	They understand 
5012_31089_000007_000004	train-clean-360	We do not understand 
none	none	As I sat by the skull I saw a dream of the past go by It was as you see it now Do you see the waving grasses of the valleys Do you see the unmoving front of the white old mountains Do you see the red roses growing down among the grasses
5012_31089_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 It is peace upon the land 
none	none	I can see one who has seen the lands 
5012_31089_000010_000002	train-clean-360	He smiles but he is sad 
5012_31089_000010_000003	train-clean-360	He crosses the wide sea but cares not 
none	none	He travels upon rails of iron and he smiles but still is sad because he thinks and he who thinks must weep He leaves the ship and the iron rail and his road is narrower and slower for he travels now by wheels of wood He sees the valleys and his smile has more of peace His trail becomes narrower yet 
5012_31089_000010_000008	train-clean-360	He goes by saddle and the mountains hem him in but now he smiles the more 
5012_31097_000005_000008	train-clean-360	but now 
none	none	he smiles the more Now he must leave even the saddle and the trail is dim and hard 
5012_31089_000010_000010	train-clean-360	See the trail is gone 
none	none	Here where no foot has trod where the mountains close about where the trees whisper he sits and looks about him 
5012_31089_000010_000012	train-clean-360	Do you see the red rose on his breast 
5012_31089_000010_000013	train-clean-360	Always the rose is there 
5012_31089_000010_000014	train-clean-360	Do you see him look up at the mountains about him at the trees

none	none	Do you hear him sigh And what is this he whispers here at the end of the long and narrowing way I know not if this be the end or the beginning Ah what does this man mean who whispers to himself in riddles Look 
5012_31089_000011_000001	train-clean-360	It is the time of war 
5012_31089_000011_000002	train-clean-360	There is music

5012_31089_000012_000002	train-clean-360	It is he who said in the mountains that riddle of the end and the beginning who knew that to the heart of nature we must come for either the end or the beginning of this our life 
none	none	Do you see upon his breast the red rose 
5012_31089_000012_000004	train-clean-360	I think he rides to battle with the rose knowing what fate will come

5012_31089_000013_000012	train-clean-360	His face is white but still the smile is there and now it is calmer and more sweet though still he whispers I know not if it be the end or the beginning

5012_31089_000014_000004	train-clean-360	He sleeps 
none	none	It is all

none	none	Wondering at these words I scarce could tell when the Singing Mouse went away leaving me staring at the barren walls and at the white skull by my hand For a moment it nearly seemed to me the hollow eyes had light and spoke to me For a moment almost it seemed to me that the rose stirred deep down among its petals and that a wider perfume floated out upon the air Illustration Illustration The Man of the Mountain Illustration THE MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN Once there was a man said the Singing Mouse who loved to go into the mountains He would go alone far into the mountains and climb up to the tops of the tallest peaks Nothing pleased him so much as to climb to the top of some mountain where no other man had ever been No one ever knew what he said to the mountains or what the mountains said to him but that they understood each other very well was sure for he could go among the mountains where other men dared not go At the tops of the high mountains he would sit and look out over the country that lay beyond He would not say what he saw for he said he could not tell and that moreover the people would not understand it for they did not know the way the mountains thought One time this man climbed to the top of a very high mountain peak in a distant country This peak looked out over a wide land and the man knew that from its summit he could see many things The man was now growing old so when he got to the top of this mountain he sat down to rest When he sat down he put his chin in his hand and his arm upon his knee and so he looked out over the land seeing many things The sun came up but the man did not move but sat and thought The moon came but still he did not move He only looked and thought and smiled After many days it was seen that this man would not come down from the mountain The mountain made him part of itself and turned him into stone as he sat there with his chin in his hand He is there to day looking out over many things He never moves for he is now of stone I have seen that place myself Once I thought I heard this man whisper of the things he saw He sits there to day Illustration Illustration At the Place of the Oaks Illustration AT THE PLACE OF THE OAKS Do you know what the oak says asked the Singing Mouse as it sat upon my knee It had needed to nibble again at my fingers before it could waken me from the dream into which I had fallen gazing at the fading fire
5029_31091_000004_000002	train-clean-360	 Do you know what the oak says it repeated 
5029_31091_000004_000003	train-clean-360	 Do you hear it 
5029_31091_000004_000004	train-clean-360	Do you hear the talking of the leaves 
none	none	I know what the oak says said the Singing Mouse
5029_31091_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 When the wind is soft the oak says Peace 
5029_31091_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Peace When the breeze is sharp it sighs and says Pity 
none	none	Pity Pity And when the storm has fallen the oak sobs and cries Woe Woe Woe
5029_31091_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you see the oaks asked the Singing Mouse 
5029_31091_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you see the little lake 
5029_31091_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Do you know this place of the oaks 
5029_31091_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Behold it now It waved a tiny hand 
5029_31091_000007_000000	train-clean-360	I gazed at the naked cheerless wall seamed and rent with cracks along its sallow width 
none	none	And as I gazed the seams and scars blended and composed into the lines of a map of a noble country 
5029_31091_000007_000002	train-clean-360	And as I gazed more intently the map took on color and narrowed its semblance to that of a certain region 
5029_31091_000007_000003	train-clean-360	And as I gazed yet more eagerly the map faded quite away and there lay in its stead the smiling face of an enchanted land 
none	none	There was the little silver lake rippling on its shore of rushes Around rose the long curved hills swelling back from the shore The baby river babbled on at the mouth of the lake kissing its mother a continual farewell The small springs tinkled metallically cold into the silver of the lake The tender green of the gentle glades rolled softly back dividing the two hills in peaceful separation 
5029_31091_000008_000005	train-clean-360	And there were the oaks At the water s edge near the lesser spring the wild apple trees twisted but upon the hills and over the great glades stood the reserved mysterious oaks tall and strong 
none	none	Illustration 
5029_31091_000010_000000	train-clean-360	One oak a mighty one now resolved itself more prominently forth 
5029_31091_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Did I not know it well 
5029_31091_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Could one forget the tortured but noble soul of this oak 
none	none	Could one forget the strong arm of comfort it extended over this most precious spot of all the glade 
5029_31091_000010_000004	train-clean-360	One must suffer before one may comfort 
5029_31091_000010_000005	train-clean-360	The oak had suffered somewhere 
5029_31091_000015_000009	train-clean-360	We do not know all things 
none	none	But over this spot the great tree reached out sheltering hands and certainly from its hands dropped benedictions plenteously down Under the arm of the oak I saw a tiny house of white neat well ordered full of cheerfulness Through the wall of canvas for it now seemed to be after dusk there shone a faint pink gleam of light the soul of the white house its pure spirit of content As it shone it scarce seemed lit by mortal hand Near the small house of white and under the oak s protecting arm there burned a little flame of small compass save in the vast shadows it set dancing among the trees 
5029_31091_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Those who built this fire here so many times so many years each time first craved pardon of the green grass of that happy glade for they would not harm the grass 
none	none	But the grass said yea to all they asked this was sure for each year the tiny hearth spot was greener than any other spot because it remembered what the fire had said and done 
5029_31091_000012_000003	train-clean-360	And each year the oak dropped down food enough for the little fire 
5029_31091_000012_000004	train-clean-360	The oak took pay in the vast shadows the fire made for it 
5029_31091_000012_000005	train-clean-360	That was the way the oak saw the spirits of the Past and when it saw them it sighed but still it welcomed the shadows of the Past 
5029_31091_000012_000006	train-clean-360	So the fire and the grass and the oak and the shadows of the Past were friends and each year they met here 
5029_31091_000012_000007	train-clean-360	It had been thus for many years 
5029_31091_000012_000008	train-clean-360	Each year for many years the same hand had laid the little fire in the same place and so given back to the oak its Past 
5029_31091_000012_000009	train-clean-360	Now the Past is a very sad but tender thing 
5029_31091_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Near by the little fire I saw a small table formed of straight laid boughs and at either side of this were seats made cunningly in the workshop of the woods 
5029_31091_000013_000001	train-clean-360	There were two forms at this small table 
5029_31091_000013_000002	train-clean-360	I saw them both 
5029_31091_000013_000003	train-clean-360	One was gray and bowed somewhat stooped as the oaks are silvered as the oaks are in the winter days 
5029_31091_000013_000004	train-clean-360	The other was younger and more erect 
5029_31091_000013_000005	train-clean-360	Once the younger looked to the older for counsel but now it seemed to me the bowed figure turned to the one that had become more strong 
none	none	I saw the savory vapors rise 
5029_31091_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Even it seemed to me I could note a faint clear odor of innocent potency 
5029_31091_000014_000002	train-clean-360	I saw the table laid not with gleam of snow and silver but with plain vessels which nevertheless seemed now to have a radiance of their own I knew all this 
none	none	It was as though there actually lay at hand these pleasant scenes as though there actually arose the appealing fragrance of the evening meal 
5029_31091_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Now as I looked the gray figure bowed its head there under the arm of the oak and asked on the humble board the blessing of the God who made the oak and gave the fire and spread the pleasant waters on the land 
5029_31091_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Every mealtime every year for many years it had been thus 
5029_31091_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Ever the oak knew the gray figure would first bow and ask the blessing of God 
5029_31091_000015_000003	train-clean-360	And each time at the close the oak with rustling leaves pronounced distinct Amen 
5029_31091_000015_000004	train-clean-360	Let those jest who will 
none	none	I do not know 
5029_31091_000015_000006	train-clean-360	I think perhaps the oak knows or it would not thus for years have whispered reverently its distinct Amen 
5029_31091_000015_000007	train-clean-360	I will not scoff 
5029_31091_000015_000008	train-clean-360	It is perhaps we who are ignorant 
none	none	We do not know all things Illustration 
5029_31091_000017_000000	train-clean-360	I ask not what nor who were these two who had come each year to this place of the oaks but surely they were friends 
5029_31091_000017_000001	train-clean-360	In shadow I could hear them talk 
5029_31091_000017_000002	train-clean-360	In shadow I could see them smile 
5029_31091_000018_000000	train-clean-360	These friends sat by the little fire a time before they went to rest in the tiny house of white 
5029_31091_000018_000001	train-clean-360	After they had gone the fire did strange things 
5029_31091_000018_000002	train-clean-360	All men know that though you see the fire burned down when you go into the tent you will some time in the night see the walls lit up by a sudden flash or so now and then from the fire which was thought to be dead 
5029_31091_000019_000000	train-clean-360	That is the business of the fire and of the oaks and of the shadows 
5029_31091_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I know that the shadows dance strangely and hover and come near at hand in those late hours of the night but what then occurs I do not know 
none	none	These two friends never questioned this 
5029_31091_000019_000003	train-clean-360	They knew it was the secret of the night and gave the oak its own request in pay for its protection and consent 
5029_31091_000019_000004	train-clean-360	They gave the oak its union with the sacred Past 
5029_31091_000020_000000	train-clean-360	In the night I have heard the oak sob 
5029_31091_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Yet in the morning when the sun was silvering the wake of all the leaping fishes the oak was always gentle and it said Wake wake 
5029_31091_000020_000002	train-clean-360	God is wise Waken waken 
5029_31091_000020_000003	train-clean-360	God is good 
5029_31091_000021_000000	train-clean-360	As pure shining beads upon a thread of gold I saw this small dear picture reiterant and unchanged year after year always with the same calm and pure surroundings 
5029_31091_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Only as year added itself to year slipping forward on the golden string I saw the gray figure grow more gray more bowed more feeble 
5012_31097_000017_000005	train-clean-360	forward 
none	none	on the golden string I saw the gray figure grow more gray more bowed more feeble Alas it seemed to me I saw the silver coming upon the head of the younger man and his eyes growing weary as of one who looks at the earth too closely which it is not wise to do 
5029_31091_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Yet the years came to the oaks and to the grasses and to the friends 
5029_31091_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The grass dies every year but it is born again 
5029_31091_000022_000001	train-clean-360	The oak dies in centuries but it is born again 
5029_31091_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Man dies in three score years and ten but he too is born again 
none	none	As I looked I could see the passing of the years In all but the unaltering fire of friendship I could see change creeping on 
5029_31091_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Grayer grayer more bent more feeble is it not so Singing Mouse 
5029_31091_000023_000003	train-clean-360	And now this time what was this gentle warning that the oak tried to whisper softly down 
5029_31091_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Perhaps the grayer friend heard it as he sat musing by the fire 
5029_31091_000023_000005	train-clean-360	He rose and looked about him as one who had dreamed and was content 
5029_31091_000023_000006	train-clean-360	He looked up at the solemn stars unafraid and so murmured to himself 
none	none	Day unto day uttereth speech he said Night unto night showeth knowledge Day unto day Singing Mouse Day unto day Woe is me Singing Mouse and these are bitter tears for that which you have shown I see it all again the oaks the glade the tiny house of white the small pleasant fire 
5029_31091_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Here again is the little table and here is the evening meal 
5029_31091_000025_000002	train-clean-360	The table is still spread for two 
none	none	A double portion is served as was wont before Yet why For all is not the same 
5029_31091_000025_000006	train-clean-360	At this table there is but one form now 
5029_31091_000025_000007	train-clean-360	The younger man is there although now he has grown gray and stooped 
none	none	Year unto year day unto day the beads have slipped along the string Once young now old he keeps the camp alone Illustration But is he then alone Hush 
5029_31091_000027_000002	train-clean-360	The squirrels have grown still and even the oak is silent 
5029_31091_000027_000003	train-clean-360	What is that opposite across the table at the seat long years held only by the elder of these two 
none	none	Tell me Singing Mouse is it not true that I see there sitting as of old at the table the same sturdy form the same simple innocent and believing face It is the gray ghost of one grown gray in goodness 
5029_31091_000027_000006	train-clean-360	It is the shadow of a shadow the apparition of a soul 
5029_31091_000028_000000	train-clean-360	The one at the table pauses as was the wont before the beginning of a meal 
5029_31091_000028_000001	train-clean-360	He looks across the table to the shadow as if the shadow were his friend 
none	none	The shadow bows its head The living man bows also his head at the board The shadow moves its lips 
5029_31091_000028_000005	train-clean-360	Doubt not those words are heard this day 
none	none	See the sun rises through the trees 
5029_31091_000029_000001	train-clean-360	The glorious day sets on once more 
5029_31091_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Doubt not fear not sorrow not ye two 
none	none	Bow the head still ye two and let not my picture perish Whisper again the benediction of the years and let me hear once more the murmur of the oak s Amen Illustration Illustration The Birth of the Hours Illustration THE BIRTH OF THE HOURS Do you know the story of the Wedding of the Times said the Singing Mouse You know all life is a wedding The flowers love and the grasses and the trees and the circle of the wedding ring is the circle of life and the sign of eternity Death and life not life and then death is the order and the law The hours are born of parents as are the flowers The hours of the day are born of the wedding of Night and Morning It is the way of Life Come with me So with the Singing Mouse I went into a place where I was once long before I could see it very well It was in the deep woods far away Near by there were tall sweet grasses I could hear the faint tinkle of a falling stream Other than that it was silent in the deep woods Overhead the sky was clear and filled with stars The stars trembled and twinkled and shone radiantly fair So now all at once I knew they were the jewels on the veil of Night And the far shadows were the drapery of the Night and the greater light of the heavens was the star upon her coronal When I first looked forth the Night was a babe but as I gazed it grew The Night is full of change and charm Those who live within the walls do not see these things When I saw them I could not sleep for the Night in all her changes seemed to speak The Night grew older drawing about her her more ornate garb of witchery Across her bosom fell a wondrous tissue trembling with exuberance of unprismed light These were the gems in thousands of the skies all fair against the blackness of the robes of Night and I knew that the blackness of the one was as lovely as the radiance of the other Nor could one separate one from the other for there arose a thin mist of light so that one saw form or features only dimly as through a cloth of silver lace such as the spiders weave upon a morning The Night grew on changing at every moment for change is the law There were small frowns of clouds which were replaced by smiles of light Did never you hear the laughter of the Night It is a strange thing Not all men have heard it The Singing Mouse told me of this Now as I lay and looked at this glorious apparition there came still another change and one most wonderful In the heart of the Night there came a tremulous exultation Upon the face of the Night appeared a roseate tinge of joyous perturbation So then I knew the lover of the Night was coming and knew too whence we have derived the signs of love as among human beings we see it indicated I saw the flush upon the cheek of Night flame slowly and faintly up until it touched her very forehead This is the way of Love But the Night went on for this is the way of Life Love and Life these are ever and for ever We mock at them and understand them not but they are ever and for ever And now the Night I know not whether startled or in joy whether ashamed of her dark garb or unconscious of it in the proud sureness of her beauty dropped loose a portion of the shadows of her robe and stood forth radiant clad with the dazzling beauty of her stars Then she raised her hand and laid it on her heart And so the Morning came and took her in his arms and kissed her on the brow So here was Love again And of this wedding there were born the hours Illustration Illustration The Stone that Had no Thought THE STONE THAT HAD NO THOUGHT Once said the Singing Mouse while many men hurried into the city as each day they do they saw many other men standing about a place where a large building was growing There were those who raised stones on long arms of steel and swung them about high up into the wall Others remained upon the earth to place these stones upon the long arms of steel Now a stone had fallen and beneath it lay what had been a man and around this many stood The long arm reached out after stones and so this stone again was taken and raised into the air That which had been a man lay broken never again to rise and smile and walk Near to it stood a woman not weeping being still too sad for weeping Above her arose the stone once more heavy and without thought It rose above the woman and above this that had been a man and as it swung high and slow above her the woman looked up at it as though to ask of it mercy But the stone passed slowly on heavy and without thought It is in the wall to day heavy and without thought Some say that is a temple others that there is a God in it But no God replies And the stone is in the wall heavy without thought Illustration Illustration The Tear and the Smile Illustration THE TEAR AND THE SMILE The Singing Mouse came and sat near by Undoubtedly the room was dingy to the last degree The dust lay thick upon the corner of the table It crusted the window ledge and hung upon the sallow wall What was the use things being as they were to disturb the dust Let it lie in all its bitterness And let the charred ends of the fagots roll out upon the floor And let the fire die down to ashes Dust to dust Ashes to ashes It was very fit But the Singing Mouse came and sat near by I could hear it patter among the dead leaves of the flowers that lay upon the table I turned my head and saw it sitting close by my fallen hand Its tiny paws were waving I could see its breast for which a rose leaf would have been a giant buckler pulsing and beating above its throbbing heart Its eyes were shining A rhythm came into the swing of the pink tinted paws And then so high and thin and sweet that at first I looked above to trace the sound there came the singing of the Singing Mouse Dreams fell upon my eyes I heard that sweet sound of the woods the tinkle of falling water which is so full of change now keen clear and metallically musical now soft slurred and full of sleep I could not see the little stream but knew it ran down there beneath the talking pines But very well one could see the hill where the small white house had stood among the trees The white house was gone now though the grass pressed down by the blankets had not yet fully arisen The smoke of the camp fire still wavered up It followed one with long out reaching arms of vapor With its fingers it beckoned and begged for its old companions yet a while Did never one look back at the smoke of the camp fire that one leaves Always the heart of the fire will stir at this time of parting A little blaze will burst out among the embers and the smoke will reach out and beckon one to stay It is very hard to leave such a fire Certainly there must be strange things of which we know but little Surely there was a figure in the wreath of smoke I could see the drapery shape itself about a form I could see the outstretched arms I could see the face the gravely smiling lips There are many things in the land of the Singing Mouse murmured my small magician It is only there that one sees clearly So I looked and listened to the figure which was in the smoke of the little fire Believe me said the figure in the smoke the ashes and the dust are not so bitter as you think them The tears rain on them and they go back into the earth and are born again Look around you as here you may look unhindered by any confining walls Do you not see the flowers smiling bravely Yet every blossom is a tear Do you not see the strong forest trees Yet every tree grows on the ashes of the past We know not what you mean by grief With us all things point to Hope I have swum above a thousand forests Ask this forest the youngest of them all whether it whispers of dread and of grief Rather it whispers of wonder and of joy Come to it and it may tell you of its comfort Turn your eyes up to the blue sky and put your hands out upon this grass which is but dust renewed and at your eyes and at your fingers you shall drink peace and knowledge The shape of a room and of a grave is square and cruel but the shape of the earth and of the great sky is that of the perpetual circle and it is kind Come to these Come to me I will wave my hands above you and you shall sleep When you awaken the flowers will be blooming and upon the lid of each you shall see the tear but upon the lips of each shall rest a smile So now the figure in the smoke waved and nodded and smiled and beckoned until I said to the Singing Mouse it seemed scarce like things we ordinarily know Lie down and sleep said the Singing Mouse So I lay down and slept And when I awoke there were some small flowers not far away and when I looked I saw it was as had been said Each flower had a tiny tear hidden away beneath its lid but upon the lips of each there rested a brave smile And from among the flowers there arose a sweet odor This said the Singing Mouse when it saw me note the fragrance this is a Memory It belongs to you See how soft and sweet it is Illustration Illustration How the Mountains Ate up the Plains Illustration HOW THE MOUNTAINS ATE UP THE PLAINS I once knew a man said the Singing Mouse who had seen the mountains in the winter time when they were covered deep in snow It is the belief of most men that the mountains are then asleep but this man said that they are not asleep but that they have only drawn over their heads the white council robes for then they are sitting in council Now the mountains are very old and wise This man told me he heard strange sounds coming from under the council robes of the mountains then voices not distinctly heard but wonderful and strong and of a sort to make one fear This man told me that once he heard the mountains tell of a time when they ate up the plains Once man was a dweller of the plains sang the mountains in a great song there man dug and strove Never he lifted up the eye but at his feet at his feet there he still gazed down The clouds bore not up his gaze neither did the hills comfort him Things false of no worth these man sought and prized Though we whispered to him still he made deaf his ear Then we the mountains we the strong the just the wise we rose we set together our shoulders and so marched on Thus we ate up the plain Now we stand where once man was for man lifted not up his eyes Therefore now let man look up let him not make small his gaze We the strong we the just the wise we shall eat up the plain For on our brows sits the light about our heads is the calm That which is high shall in the days prevail We the strong the just the wise this we have said This man told me that he could not hear all the song that the mountains chanted nor all they whispered among themselves But he thought they said that they had swallowed up and consumed one race of beings who became fixed only upon the winning of what they called wealth and had crushed out this wealth and burned up their precious things This may be true for to day men visit the mountains to dig there for wealth and this which they call gold is found much scattered as though it had been crumbled and burned and blown wide over the earth upon the four winds For these reasons this man thought that the mountains had once eaten up the plains and that perhaps at some time they might do this again Illustration Illustration The Savage and its Heart Illustration THE SAVAGE AND ITS HEART Once said the Singing Mouse I knew a man who found a little dog starved beneath a building where it had been left He took it and fed it and each time he held out his hand to give it food it bit his hand knowing not that he was its friend Many times he fed it and always it bit his hand It was a long time before it learned that the man was its friend It was but a savage He fed it patiently and so after a time the dog bit him no more having learned that he was its friend When it had ceased to be savage it loved him The man gave it neither blow nor unkindness and fed it knowing that he was older and more wise and that in time it might love him So at last it did and this may often happen for those who wait large and kind and patient and so often friends are made Illustration Illustration The Beast Terrible Illustration THE BEAST TERRIBLE The little room was resplendent one night with a fire which flamed and flickered gloriously It set in motion many shadows which had their home in the corners of the walls and bade them cease their sullenness and come forth to dance in the riot of the hour 
5012_31097_000004_000002	train-clean-360	And so each shadow found its partner in a ray of firelight and there they danced 
5012_31097_000004_000003	train-clean-360	They danced about the tangled front of the big bison s head which hung upon the wall 
5012_31097_000004_000004	train-clean-360	They crossed the grinning skull of the gray wolf 
none	none	They softened the eyes of the antelope s head and made dark lines behind the long tined antlers of the elk and of the deer 
5012_31097_000004_000006	train-clean-360	They brought forth to view in alternate eclipse and definition the great grim bear s head which hung above the mantel 
5012_31097_000004_000007	train-clean-360	Every trophy gathered in years of the chase once perhaps prized now perhaps forgotten was brought into evidence nor could one escape noting each one and giving to each for this one night more the story which belonged to it 
5012_31097_000004_000008	train-clean-360	I sat and looked upon them all and so there passed a panorama of the years 
5012_31097_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 There thought I is the stag which once fell far in the pine woods of the North 
5012_31097_000005_000001	train-clean-360	This antelope takes me back to the hard white Plains 
5012_31097_000005_000002	train-clean-360	These huge antlers could grow only amid the forests of the Rockies 
5012_31097_000005_000003	train-clean-360	That wolf how many of the hounds he mangled I remember and the giant bear it was a good fight he made perhaps dangerous had the old rifle there been less sure Yes yes of course I could recall each incident 
5012_31097_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Of course they all were thrilling exciting delightful glorious all those things 
5012_31097_000005_000005	train-clean-360	Of course the heart must have leaped in those days 
5012_31097_000005_000006	train-clean-360	The blood must have surged in those moments 
5012_31097_000005_000007	train-clean-360	The pulse must have grown hard the mouth must have been dry with the ardor of the chase at those times 
none	none	But now 
5012_31097_000005_000009	train-clean-360	But why 
5012_31097_000005_000010	train-clean-360	Does the heart leap to night do the veins fill with the rush of the blood tumultuous in the joy of stimulus or danger 
5012_31097_000005_000011	train-clean-360	Why does not the old eagerness come back 
5012_31097_000005_000012	train-clean-360	Which of these trophies is the one to bring this back again 
none	none	To which of these grim silent heads belongs the keenest story
5012_31097_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 I know said the Singing Mouse which unknown to me had come and placed itself upon the table 
5012_31097_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 I know And it climbed upon my arm which lay across the table 
none	none	The fire shone fair upon its little form so that in silhouette its outline was delicate and keen as an image cut from the fiery heart of a noble opal stone And what is it that you know I asked
5012_31097_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Maker of dreams tell me what you know to night 
none	none	The Singing Mouse balanced and moved itself in harmony with the beat of the fire s rays 
5012_31097_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I looked at it so closely that a dream came upon my eyes so that the voice of the Singing Mouse sounded far away and faint though it was still clear and resonant in its own peculiar way and very fine and sweet 
5012_31097_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I will tell you which trophy you most prize it said 
none	none	I will show you your Iliad of the chase Do you not remember do you not see this the most eventful hunting of all your life 
5012_31097_000010_000000	train-clean-360	And so I gazed where the Singing Mouse pointed quite beyond the dusty walls and there I saw as it had said 
5012_31097_000010_000001	train-clean-360	I heard not the thunder of the hoofs of buffalo nor the faint crack of the twig beneath the panther s foot 
5012_31097_000010_000002	train-clean-360	I saw not the lurching gallop of the long jawed wolf nor the high elastic bounding of the deer 
5012_31097_000010_000003	train-clean-360	The level swinging speed of the antelope the slinking of the lynx the crashing flight of the wapiti no it was none of these that came to mind nor did the mountains nor the plains nor the wilderness of the pines 
5012_31097_000010_000004	train-clean-360	But when the Singing Mouse whispered Do you see I murmured in reply I see it all again 
5012_31097_000011_000000	train-clean-360	I saw the small low hills well covered with short oaks and hazel bushes which rolled on away from the village far out almost to the Delectable Mountains which are well known to be upon the edge of the world 
5012_31097_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Through these low hills a winding road led on a road whose end no man had ever reached but which went to places where no doubt many wonders were perhaps even to the Delectable Mountains for so a wise man once had said his words harkened to with awe 
5012_31097_000011_000002	train-clean-360	This was a pleasant road lined with brave sumacs with bushes of the wild blackberry and with small hazel trees which soon would offer fruit for the regular harvest of the fall this same to be spread for drying on the woodshed roof 
5012_31097_000011_000003	train-clean-360	It was perhaps wise curiosity as to the crop of nuts which had brought thus far from home these two figures an enormous distance perhaps at least a mile beyond what heretofore had been the utmost limit of their wanderings 
5012_31097_000011_000004	train-clean-360	It was not perhaps safe to venture so far 
5012_31097_000011_000005	train-clean-360	There were known to be strange creatures in these woods one knew not what 
5012_31097_000011_000006	train-clean-360	It was therefore well that the younger boy should clasp tightly the hand of the older him who bore with such confidence the bow and arrows potent weapons of those days gone by 
none	none	Illustration It was half with fear and half with curiosity that these two wandered on along this mysterious road through this wild and unknown wilderness so far from any habitation of mankind The zeal of the explorer held them fast 
5012_31097_000013_000002	train-clean-360	They scarce dared fare farther on but yet would not turn back 
none	none	The noises of the woods thrilled them 
5012_31097_000013_000004	train-clean-360	The sudden clanging note of the jay near by caused them to stop heart in mouth for the moment 
5012_31097_000013_000005	train-clean-360	Strange rustlings in the leaves made them cross the road and step more quickly 
5012_31097_000013_000006	train-clean-360	Yet the cawing of a crow across the woods seemed friendly and a small brown bird which hopped ahead along the road was intimate and kind and thus touched the founts of bravery in the two venturous hearts 
5012_31097_000013_000007	train-clean-360	Certainly they would go on It was no matter about the sun 
5012_31097_000013_000008	train-clean-360	This was the valley of Ajalon perhaps of which one had heard in the class at Sabbath school And surely this was a good droning yellow bodied bee where did the bees go to when they rose up straight into the air 
5012_31097_000013_000009	train-clean-360	And this little mouse what became of it in winter 
5012_31097_000013_000010	train-clean-360	And ah 
5012_31097_000013_000011	train-clean-360	What was that that awful burst of sound 
5012_31097_000013_000012	train-clean-360	Clutch closer little brother though both be pale 
5012_31097_000013_000013	train-clean-360	How should either of you yet know the thunderous flight of the wild grouse this great bird which whirled away through the brown leaves of the oaks 
5012_31097_000013_000014	train-clean-360	Father must be asked about this tremendous startling bird 
5012_31097_000013_000015	train-clean-360	Meantime the heart having begun to beat again let the two adventurers press yet a little farther on 
5012_31097_000014_000000	train-clean-360	And so with fears and tremblings with doubts and joys through briers and flowers through hindrances and recompenses along this crooked winding unknown road which led on out into the Unknown they wandered as in life we all are wandering to day

none	none	Illustration Illustration The Passing of Men Illustration THE PASSING OF MEN One night the moon was shining brightly upon the curtain which had been drawn tight across the window Within the room the light was dim so that there could be seen clearly the pictures which the moon was drawing on the curtain figures which marched advanced receded One might almost have thought these the shadows of some moving boughs had one not known the ways the moon has at certain times It chanced that high up in the curtain there was a tiny hole and through this opening the moonlight streamed falling upon the table in a small silvery ellipse of a size which one might cover ten times with one s hand It was natural that in this little well of pale and dreamlike radiance the Singing Mouse should find it fit to manifest itself I knew not when it came but as I looked the spot had found a tenant The small transparent paws of the Singing Mouse displayed no shadow as they waved and swung across this pencil of the pale mysterious light Yet its eyes shone opaline and brilliant as it sat so that I could hardly gaze without a shiver of surprise akin to fear fascinated as though I looked upon a thing unreal Thus surrounded almost one might say thus penetrated by the translucent shaft of radiance which came through the window the Singing Mouse told me of the figures on the curtain which now began to have more distinct semblances Do you see the figures there said the Singing Mouse Do you see the marching men Have you never heard the hoofs ring on the roof when the wind blows high Have you not seen their ranks sweep swift across the sky when storms arise Have you never seen them marching through the long aisles of the wood at night These are the warriors of the past Now earth has always loved the warriors I looked and indeed it was the truth There was a panorama on the curtain History had unrolled her scroll The warriors of the nations and the times were passing I saw the men of Babylon and those who came out of Egypt Dark were these of hair and visage and their arms were the ancient bow and spear And there were those who rode light and cast back their rapid archery These faded and in their stead marched men close knit in solid phalanx with long spears offering impenetrable front In turn these passed away and there came men with haughty brow who bore short spears and swords Near by these were wild huge men of yellow hair whose shields were leather and whose swords were broad and long And as I gazed at all of these my blood thrilling strangely at the sight the figures blended and formed into a splendid procession of a martial day gone by I saw them a long stream of mounted men who rode in helmet and cuirass and bore each aloft a long beamed spear In front rode one whose mien was high and stern and who might well have been commander High aloft he tossed his great sword as he rode and sang the time a song of war and as he sang the thousands of deep throats behind him made chorus terrible but stirring in its chesty melody for ictus to the song each warrior smiting sword on shield in a mighty unison whose high sonorous note thrilled like the voice of actual war Steady the strong eyes gleamed out and onward as they rode From the steel clad breast of each there shone forward a glancing ray of light as though it came direct from the heart untamed even by a thousand years of death My heart leaped to see them ride so straight and stern and fearless so goodly so glorious to look upon Came the rattle of chain the clang of arms the jangle of belt and spur and still the brave procession passed in tens in hundreds in thousands in a long wave of stately men whose eyes shone each in all the bold delight of war Stooped front hooked hand and avaricious eye these were as absent as the glow of gold or silver It was the glorious age of steel Illustration Still on they passed always arising the hoarse swell of the fighters chorus I heard the rumble of the many hoofs thrilling even the impassive earth The spear points shone The harness rattled The pennants fluttered stiffly in the breeze And then afar I heard a sweet compelling melody the invitation of the bugle that dearest mistress of the heart of man My blood leaped I started up I started forward The sweep of the ranks drew me on and in irresistibly I would have raised my voice I sought to stay if for but one instant this army of brave men this panorama of exalted war this incomparable pageant of a day gone by It was the Singing Mouse that checked me for I heard it sigh Alas And yet again the scene was changed Across the view streamed yet a long line of warriors The hair of these did not float yellow from beneath loosened casque nor indeed did these know aught of armor nor did they march with banners beckoning nor to the wooing of the trumpet s voice The skins of these were red and their hair was raven black Arms they had and horses though rude the one and ill caparisoned the other Leather and wood and flint and sinew served them for material Ill armed they were but as they rode with naked breasts and painted faces and tall feathers nodding in their plaited hair out of the eye of each there shone the soul of the fighting man the warrior beloved since ever earth began Not less than the men of Babylon were these nor than they of the ancient bow and spear nor than they of the steel clad breast and as I saw them naked clad only in the armor of a man s fearlessness the word of commendation was as ready as that of pity They are late Singing Mouse said I late in the day of war Yes said the Singing Mouse with sadness they are late and they must pass away But they are warriors of proof as much as any of those who have passed Did you not see the melancholy of each face as it looked forward Their fate was known yet they rode forward to meet it fearlessly as brave as any fighting men of all the years In time they too shall have their story and with the other warriors of the earth shall march again upon the page of history As I looked the figures of these men grew dimmer The tinkling of beaded garments and the shuffling of the ponies hoofs became less and less distinct and the dust cloud of their traveling became fainter and fainter and finally faded and melted away The curtain was bare I heard the sighing of the wind Illustration

5013-31099-0000	train-other-500	THE HOUSE OF TRUTH One morning I lay upon my bed in the little room which I call my home Now among the eaves which rise opposite to my window there are many sparrows
5013-31099-0001	train-other-500	which have also made their homes In the morning before the sun has arisen
none	none	 and at the time when the dawn is making the city gray and leaden in color 
5013-31099-0002	train-other-500	instead of somber and black these sparrows begin to chatter and chirp and sing in discordant notes and by this I know the day has come
5013-31099-0003	train-other-500	Upon this morning it seemed to me the sparrows chattered with an unusual commotion and as I listened I heard from another window near mine the voice of grief and lamentation
5013-31099-0004	train-other-500	Then I knew that one who had long been sick had passed away As the gray morning came on this spirit this spark of life had gone out from its accustomed place As the day came on
5013-31099-0005	train-other-500	the sounds of lamentation arose The friends of that one wept So I asked the sparrows and the sun and the gray sky why these friends wept What is grief
none	none	 I asked of them 
5013-31099-0006	train-other-500	Why should these weep What has happened when one dies Where has the spark of life gone Did it fall to these sodden pavements for ever done
none	none	 or did it go on up 
5013-31099-0007	train-other-500	to meet the kiss of the rising sun And the sparrows which fall to the ground answered not The sun rose calm and passionless but dumb The sky folded in large but inscrutable
5013-31099-0008	train-other-500	None the less arose the voice of lamentation and of woe I ask you Singing Mouse said I one night as we sat alone what is the Truth How do we reach it
5013-31099-0009	train-other-500	How shall we know it Tell me of this spark that has gone out Tell me what is life and where does it go There are many words Tell me what is the Truth
5013-31099-0010	train-other-500	The Singing Mouse gazed at me in its way of pity so I knew I had asked that which could not be Yet even as I saw this look appear it changed and vanished
5013-31099-0011	train-other-500	And as the Singing Mouse waved its tiny paw I forbore reflection and looked only on the scene which now was spread before me It seemed a picture of actual colors
5013-31099-0012	train-other-500	and I could see it plainly I saw a youth who stood with one older and of austere garb By the vestments of this older man
none	none	 I knew he was of those who teach people in spiritual things 
5013-31099-0013	train-other-500	To him the young man had come in anguish of heart Then the older man of priestly garb taught the young man in the teachings that had come down to him But the youth bowed his head in trouble
5013-31099-0014	train-other-500	nor was the cloud cleared upon his heart I heard him murmur Alas what is the Truth So I saw this same youth pass on in various stages of this picture
5013-31099-0015	train-other-500	and before him I saw drawn as though in another picture
none	none	 a panorama of the edifices and institutions of the religions of all lands 
5013-31099-0016	train-other-500	But the years passed and the panorama of beliefs swept by and no one could tell this man
none	none	 what was the Truth Illustration Yet 
5013-31099-0017	train-other-500	after this young man had ceased to query and had closed his books he one day entered alone into one of the great edifices built for the sake of that which he could not understand In the picture I could see all this
5013-31099-0018	train-other-500	I saw the young man cast himself face down among the cushions of a seat and there he lay and listened to the music This too I could hear
5013-31099-0019	train-other-500	I could hear the peal of the organ arise like voices of the spirits going up up whispering appealing promising assuring Then for I could see and hear with him there came to that young man
5013-31099-0020	train-other-500	when he ceased to seek the very exaltation he had longed to know Ah yes Singing Mouse I said it was very beautiful But music is not final Music is not the Truth
5013-31099-0021	train-other-500	Tell me of these things The Singing Mouse again seemed to hesitate It may be said the Singing Mouse slowly that the Truth will never be found between the covers of any book no matter how wise
none	none	 It may be that it never will be found by any who search for it always within walls built by human hands 
5013-31099-0022	train-other-500	It may be that no man can convey to another that which is the Truth to him It may be that the Truth can never be grasped never be weighed or formulated
5013-31099-0023	train-other-500	The ways of Nature are always the same but Nature does not ask exactness of form Why then shall we ask exactness of faith
5013-31099-0024	train-other-500	The true faith is nothing final not more than are final the carved stones of the church which offers it so strenuously The stones crumble and decay
none	none	 but new churches rise 
5013-31099-0025	train-other-500	New faiths will rise But were not all well At these things I wondered and over them I thought for a time but yet I did not understand all that the Singing Mouse had said
5013-31099-0026	train-other-500	As if it knew my thought the Singing Mouse said to me Your vision is too narrow You seek the great truths in small places and wonder that you do not find them Come with me
5013-31099-0027	train-other-500	The Singing Mouse waved its hand
none	none	 as was its wont 
5013-31099-0028	train-other-500	and as in a dream and as though I were now the young man whom we had lately seen
none	none	 I was transported by what means I could not tell into a place far distant At first it seemed to me there was a figure in vestments speaking I scarce knew of what Again there was a church or a cathedral I could see the rafters as I lay I could hear the solemn and exalted peal of the organ 
5013-31099-0029	train-other-500	I could hear voices that sang up and up thrilling compelling The sense of the confinement of the building ceased Insensibly I seemed to see the hewn stones of the walls
5013-31099-0030	train-other-500	assume their primeval and untouched state beneath the grasses of the hills I could feel the rafters vanishing and going back into the bodies of the oaks
none	none	 in which they originally grew 
5013-31099-0031	train-other-500	The voice of the organ remained with me but it might have been the roll of the waves upon the shore I was in the Temple In the Temple one needs not seek for names
5013-31099-0032	train-other-500	It was night I lay upon a bank of sweet smelling grasses and about me were the great oaks The organ or the waves spoke on I looked up up
5013-31099-0033	train-other-500	into the great circle of the sky so far so blue so kind in its bending over so pitying it seemed to me yet so high in its up reaching
5013-31099-0034	train-other-500	I looked upon the glorious pageant of the stars That star thought I shone over the grave of some ancestor of mine back back in the unmirrored past some father of some father of mine
5013-31099-0035	train-other-500	He is gone like a fly He is dust I may be lying on his grave Soon like a fly I too shall be dead gone turned into dust
5013-31099-0036	train-other-500	But the star will still shine on Small as that father s dust may be that dust still lives It is about me This grass these trees may hold it
5013-31099-0037	train-other-500	He has lived again in the cycle of natural forces My dust when I am dead will in turn make part of this world one of an unknown sea of stars
5013-31099-0038	train-other-500	Small then as I am I am kin to that star The stars go on Nature goes on Then shall man shall I
5013-31099-0039	train-other-500	Ah said the Singing Mouse its voice sounding I knew not whence from this place can you see So now I thought I began to see what I had not seen before
5013-31099-0040	train-other-500	And since this was in the land of the Singing Mouse I sought to find no name for what I saw nor tried to measure it What one man sees is not what another sees
5013-31099-0041	train-other-500	Shall one claim wisdom beyond his neighbor Are not the stars his also and the trees his to talk with him Are not the doors always open
5013-31099-0042	train-other-500	Does not the music of the organ ever roll do not the voices always rise Had it not been for the Singing Mouse
none	none	 I should not have thought these things Illustration Illustration Where the City Went Illustration WHERE THE CITY WENT One day there was a white frost that fell upon the city lasting for many hours so that a strange thing happened at which men wondered very much The city put aside its colors of black and brown and gray and dressed itself in silvery white No stone nor brick was seen except in this silvern frosty color All the spires were glittering in silver and all the columns bore traceries as though the hands of spirits had labored long and delicately and had seen their tender fretwork frozen softly but for ever into silver The gross city had put aside corporeal things and for once its spirit shone fair and radiant so that men said no such thing had ever been before That evening the frost still remained and as the night came on a mist fell upon the city From the windows men looked out and lo the beautiful city so made spiritual was vanishing One by one the great buildings the tall spires the lofty columns had faded into a white dream dimmer fainter less and less perceptible seen through a gentle envelope of whitening haze This thing was of a sort almost to make one tremble as he looked upon it for the city which had been silver had turned to mist and the mist seemed fair to turn into a dream There are those who say it did become a dream and afterward descended For wanderers in desert countries tell that at times they have seen some far city of dreams alluringly beautiful but evanescent intangible unattainable trembling and floating upon the wavering air Now when I saw the city thus fade away and disappear I sat down at my table and as many men did that night I wondered much at what I had seen For surely the soul of the city had arisen Then the Singing Mouse came and gazed into my face What you have seen is true said the Singing Mouse There is no city now It has gone You have seen it disappear Its soul has arisen This does not often happen yet it can be for even the city has a soul if you can find it But if I say the city has gone I mean only that it has left the place where once it was That which once was is always corporate or not corporate We err only when we ask to see all with our eyes to balance all within our hands Come with me and I will show you where the city went So now the Singing Mouse waved its hands and I saw though I knew not where I looked I saw a country where the trees grew big and where the wild fowl came It was where the trees had never been felled nor had the stones ever been hewn The sky was blue and the water was blue except where it played and laughed and there it was white There was a small house of a sort one has never seen for none in the cities is like it The blue smoke curling from the chimney named it none the less a home I hardly knew what time or place we had come upon for the Singing Mouse whose voice seemed high and exalted spoke as though much was in the past This is a Home said the Singing Mouse Once there were no homes In those days there was only one fire and it was red By this man sat He sought not to see Once a man sat at night and looked up at the heavens seeking to know what the stars were saying He besought the stars praying to them and asking them to listen to the voice of the water and to the voice of the oaks and to the whispers of the grasses and to tell him why the fire of earth was red while the fire of the stars was white Now while this man besought the stars to him a strange thing happened As he looked up he saw falling from the heavens above him a ray of the white light of the stars It fell near to him and lay shining like a jewel in the grass To this the man ran at once gladly and took up the white light and put it in his bosom that the winds might not harm it Always this man kept the white light in his bosom after that And by its light he saw many things which till that time men had never known This man found that this new light with the red light that had been known filled all his house with a great radiance so that small strifes were not so many and so that life became plain and sweet This then that you see is that Home This that you see around you it continued slowly the large trees and the green grass and the blue sky and the smiling waters all this is wealth wealth not corporate wealth valuable wealth that belongs to every man ever born upon the earth and which can not of right ever be taken away from him Shorn of that he is poor indeed though not so poor as he who shore him Unshorn of this he is rich In our land our hearts ache to see these terms misused and that called wealth which is so far from worth the having But here where I have brought you you shall see humanity undwarfed and you shall see peace and largeness in the life which you once thought small and sordid Illustration Then as I looked there stepped from the house a man or one whom I took to be a man This man stood in the cool fresh morning and gazed at the sun now rising above the tops of the great trees He smiled gently and taking in each hand a little water from a tiny stream that flowed near by he raised his hands and still smiling offered tribute of the water to the sun I saw the water falling down from his hands in a small stream of silver drops shining brightly It was the way of the land the Singing Mouse said for they thought that as the water came from the sky and returned to it so did man and the thoughts of man and the fruits of his progress never to be destroyed At all this I looked almost in fear for the thought came that perhaps this was not Man as we knew him but the successor of Man Where is this land I asked of the Singing Mouse and what is this time upon which we have come The Singing Mouse looked at the green trees and at the kind sun and at the blue sky and the pleasant waters and it said to me slowly There was once a city where these trees now stand Illustration The Bell and the Shadows Illustration THE BELL AND THE SHADOWS 
5013-31101-0000	train-other-500	Melody unformulate music immaterial such was the voice of the Singing Mouse faint small and clear
5013-31101-0001	train-other-500	a piping of fifes so fine a touching of strings so delicate that it seemed to come from instruments of beryl and of diamond a phantom music
5013-31101-0002	train-other-500	impossible to fetter with staff or bar and past the hope of compassing in words It was the last night of the year and the bell upon the church near by
5013-31101-0003	train-other-500	had made many strokes the last time it had been heard many heavy strokes which throbbed sullenly mournfully on the air The presence of passing Time was at hand
none	none	 The year soon would join the years gone by 
5013-31101-0004	train-other-500	Regret remorse despair abandonment the hopelessness of humanity was it the breath of these which arose and burdened heavily the note of the chronicling bell
none	none	 Where were the chimes of joy 
5013-31101-0005	train-other-500	These shadows that you see are not upon the wall said the Singing Mouse They are very much beyond the windows If only we will look out from our windows
5013-31101-0006	train-other-500	there are always great pictures waiting for us pictures in pearl and opal in liquid argent in crimson and gold But always there must be the shadows
5013-31101-0007	train-other-500	Without these there can be no picture anywhere Have you not seen what the shadows do Have you not seen them trooping through the oak forest in the evening through the pine forest in open day
5013-31101-0008	train-other-500	across the prairies under the moon at night legions of them armies of them Have you never seen them march across the grass lands in the daytime cohort after cohort
5013-31101-0009	train-other-500	hurrying to the call of the unseen trumpets In the woods have you never heard strange sounds
none	none	 when you put your ear to the ground 
5013-31101-0010	train-other-500	sounds untraceable to any animate life Have you never heard vague voices in the trees Have you not heard distant mysterious noises in the forest
5013-31101-0011	train-other-500	whose cause you could never learn seek no matter how you might These were the voices of the shadows the people who live there
5013-31101-0012	train-other-500	Who else should it be to whisper and sing to you and make you happy when you are there Without these people what would be the woods the prairies the waters the sky
5013-31101-0013	train-other-500	the world Without the shadows too what would be our lives Thoughts thoughts and remembrances what have we that is sweeter than these
5013-31101-0014	train-other-500	Have you never seen the smile upon the lips of those who have died They say they are looking upon the Future Perhaps
none	none	 they look also upon the Past 
5013-31101-0015	train-other-500	and therefore smile in happiness seeing again Youth and Hope and Faith and Trust which are tender and beautiful things Life
5013-31101-0016	train-other-500	has no actuality of its own and in material sense is only a continual change But the shadows of thought and of remembrance do not change It is only the shadows
5013-31101-0017	train-other-500	that are real As I pondered upon this there passed by many pleasant pictures upon the wall after the way the Singing Mouse had many pictures of days gone by which made me think
5013-31101-0018	train-other-500	that perhaps what the Singing Mouse had said was true I could see the boy sitting idle and a dream watching the shadows drifting across the clover fields
5013-31101-0019	train-other-500	where the big bees came I saw the youth wandering in the woods where the squirrels lived loitering and looking peering into corners full of the secrets of the wild creatures unraveling the delicious mysteries
none	none	 which Nature ever offers to those not yet grown old 
5013-31101-0020	train-other-500	It was a comfortable picture full of the brilliant greens of springtime the mellow tints of summer the red and russet of autumn days the blue and white of winter
5013-31101-0021	train-other-500	I could hear also sounds intimately associated with the scenes before me the bleat of little lambs the low of cattle
none	none	 the neighing of a distant horse 
5013-31101-0022	train-other-500	And then both sound and scene progressed and once more as the woods and hills grew bolder and more wild I could hear clearly the rifle s thin report
5013-31101-0023	train-other-500	could note the whisper of the secret loving paddle the slipping of the snow shoe on the snow the clatter of the hoofs of horses the baying of the bell mouthed hounds
5013-31101-0024	train-other-500	The delights of it all came back again and in this varied phantom chase among the keen joys of the past I saw as plainly and exultantly as ever in my life
5013-31101-0025	train-other-500	the panorama of the brown woods and the gray plains and the purple hills saw it distinctly with all the old vibrant joy of youth line for line
5013-31101-0026	train-other-500	sound for sound shadow for shadow joy for joy And then the Singing Mouse without wish of mine
5013-31101-0027	train-other-500	caused these scenes to change into others of more quiet sort which told not of the fields but of the home In the shadows of evening
5013-31101-0028	train-other-500	I seemed to see a pleasant place well surrounded by trees and flowers the leaves of which were stirred softly in the breath of a faint summer breeze strong enough
5013-31101-0029	train-other-500	only to carry aloft in its hands the odor of the blooming rose This picture faded slowly There were shadows in the spaces between the trees
none	none	 There were shadows in the dark growing vine which draped a column 
5013-31101-0030	train-other-500	One could only guess if he caught sight of garb or of the outline of a form among the shadows He could only guess too whether he heard music faint as the breeze
5013-31101-0031	train-other-500	faint as the incense of the flowers He could only guess if he had seen the image of the House Beautiful that temple known as Home Thoughts
5013-31101-0032	train-other-500	said the Singing Mouse softly Thoughts and remembrances These are the things that live for ever It is only the shadows that are real
5013-31101-0033	train-other-500	The solemn note of the bell struck in It counted twelve The new year had come The chimes of joy arose But still
5013-31101-0034	train-other-500	the faint music from the Past had not died away and still the shadows waved and beckoned on the wall strong and beautiful and enduring and not
5013-31101-0035	train-other-500	like the fading of a dream So then I knew that what the Singing Mouse had said was true and that it is indeed
none	none	 only the shadows that are real Illustration Illustration Of the Greatest Sorrow Illustration OF THE GREATEST SORROW A thousand times in the night I reach out it seems to me and touch her hair as it lies spread and dark A thousand times in the night I gaze upon her face her eyes shielded her lips gently closed and curved A thousand times in the night it seems to me I bend above her and whisper I love you And she though asleep and myriads of miles away among the stars hears me always and stirs just faintly and still sleeping whispers through lips that barely part I know It is perhaps that thing called Love which causes me to do this because I always whisper I love you though no word quite is wide and deep and soft and kind enough to say what is in the soul at certain times Now in lives there are ways Some have few sorrows and many things of fortune taken lightly the things wished coming easily Again others gain only by pain and suffering and long effort and hard denyings As it is decreed by chance the way with most is to gain all things hardly and to know always denial and always to have longing That is the way with most Of these things I spoke with the Singing Mouse and told of many things that came as sorrows and griefs and denials saying that since this was decreed by chance there was naught that a man ought not to receive without murmur and the Singing Mouse said that this was true that many things were denied and that many knew great sorrows This was the reason we came to speak of sorrows I named very many sorrows that I had known and many that friends of mine had known some of these far greater than my own as is most often the case when one comes to see deeply into these things All sorrows said the Singing Mouse come to us and we must bear them though some are very hard to bear as when friends do not know we love them and think us ill formed and crooked small and mean when in truth in soul we are tall and comely large and strong Or when we are thought to have done a bad action when in truth we have done a good one or when hunger and thirst come and we have little comforts or when sickness and weakness come to us when we wish our strength or when those die whom we have loved All all these sorrows and very many others come to us and each sorrow must be borne for that is the way of life What I asked of the Singing Mouse is the greatest sorrow That said the Singing Mouse is a thing hard to tell for each man thinks that the sorrow that he has is the greatest sorrow for him or for the world though perhaps in truth it is not large What to you asked the Singing Mouse is the greatest sorrow of those which have not yet come to you A thousand times in the night Singing Mouse said I I reach out and touch her hair as it lies spread and dark I whisper to her though she be myriads of miles away among the stars and she hears and she answers This is because of that thing called Love Now this sorrow has not yet come to me that when I reach out my hand in the night I shall not touch her hair that when I bend to kiss her sleeping she shall not be there any more that when I whisper to her she may no longer answer to me seeing that this thing called Love can be no more between us That said I to the Singing Mouse I could not endure Indeed at the thought of this so sharp an agony came to me that I arose and cried out loud I can not endure it I can not endure it I cried although this sorrow had not yet come to me Ah said the Singing Mouse how idle and weak is the human mind in the country where you live Have you not said but now that though she be myriads of miles away among the stars she answers you when you whisper Does she not hear Do not her lips move in speech as you whisper That is true said I And will she always hear She will always hear said the Singing Mouse So this sorrow will not come as you fear And shall I reach out and touch her hair as it lies spread and dark This I asked of the Singing Mouse You shall touch it spread and dark and fragrant as when you were young said the Singing Mouse if so you wish So then it seemed that perhaps all sorrows even very great ones are a part of life Although I know that if I could no longer know the fragrance of her hair or hear the whisper of her answer then that sorrow would be more than I could bear Illustration Illustration The Shoes of the Princess Illustration THE SHOES OF THE PRINCESS Once I was in a place where there were those who had opened many tombs and had taken from the tombs that had been in Egypt and were very old many things that had been placed there for silence and repose thousands of years ago There were grave clothes and grave caskets the one embroidered the other graven and the colors of both were as they were thousands of years ago There were signs over which men pondered not knowing their own writing and their own thoughts and their own fate There were also a sad thing to see the bodies of those that had died long ago that had lain down for rest and silence and of these some were called kings and some were called queens and others princesses and all had once been young and some had once been beautiful For here after thousands of years was praise of their beauty and love and care for it So I pondered very long and sadly But most I looked at two little golden shoes These little shoes had once been the shoes of one who lay here a princess dead thousands of years and once very beautiful as these carven symbols told They were small and dainty and threaded with fine gold and laced across with care about the feet of her who was once a woman and a princess and owner of much beauty and who was in her life beloved and in her death mourned as these graven symbols said A thousand years this love reached out its arms to her to day although for a thousand years Death had enfolded her in his grasp that does not yield She who had lain down for rest and silence was still here withal at rest in her grave garb and silent in her sleep but those who had done these things had removed the grave clothing so that these small shoes could be seen still upon the feet of the princess that had slept a thousand years enfolded in love For a price these might have sold the shoes of the princess for there were those cruel enough to strip her of that which she had worn when she lay down to be alone But this I could not do I did not carry away the shoes in my hands but in some way it seemed to me that I took them for that night as I sat at the little table in my room with the dim light falling as is its wont at those hours I saw upon the table before me these same shoes of the princess of thousands of years ago small and golden things to make one weep so sad their story disturbed thus after they had been placed away for silence I gazed at them for a time and presently I saw appear upon the table beside them the form of the Singing Mouse as tall perhaps as the fronts of these golden shoes See said the Singing Mouse here are her shoes those of the princess who has been resting They crossed the paved floors of palaces They knew the steps of a throne They were made by love for love and given in love to rest and silence She was as one you have known as many whom others know now Tell me is she not beautiful I saw standing before me the figure of the princess tall and slender and very beautiful And now the grave garments were not seen for her robe was of silk new and soft and shapely like to herself and her arms were round and soft and her eyes were full and dark and her hair was as deep shadows A band of gold was about her brow and her cheek was red and tender in its bloom Her neck was white and round and her hands were white and her slender fingers curved slightly as her arms hung down by her sides Her feet were small and straight and all all of her was beautiful and she was a princess Illustration Now as I gazed I saw the face and saw that it was one I knew and had known long so then I knew that the princess who was placed away for rest and silence had never died for did she not stand here before me and had I not long known her thus Ah beautiful I took up these small golden shoes in my hands and held them out to her Take these little shoes I said wrought as cunning as man may know Place them upon thy feet for me and may never thorn assail thee in all thy going Wear them and tread the steps of thrones years and years ages and ages Princess beloved See they are wrought in love Now I saw upon the lips of the princess who had lain down thousands of years ago but who lives in a place I know to day a smile very faint and far away So as the Singing Mouse told me it was to be seen that she did not die Even as she faded away from the wall against which she stood I knew though I wept that the princess was not dead and would not die She was beautiful she was beloved and these things have not died Ah beautiful I said to the Singing Mouse But alas for a princess there should be a palace and here is none Look about you said the Singing Mouse See for the time this is a palace I looked about me and it was as the Singing Mouse said For the time my room was a palace I saw standing there again the princess upon her feet small golden shoes What is this I asked And who am I But as I turned I saw that the Singing Mouse was gone But this I knew and so may you know that love does not die and here was proof of it Illustration Illustration Of White Moths Illustration OF WHITE MOTHS Once said the Singing Mouse I was at the side of a little stream Grasses grew all about and small plants and flowers Beyond the shores of the little stream arose a forest wide and dark into which the eye could reach but a little way As I stood near the little stream there arose from the grass and flowers two small moths soft and dainty beautiful and very white covered also with a white dust or powder which was so light that did they but receive a touch they must lose some of this soft white powder and so be injured so gentle and tender were they These two moths soft and white and silent arose in the air and circled one about the other rising for a time then falling but ever circling one about the other It seemed that perhaps they spoke one to the other but if that were true it was in speech so small that not even I could hear it They passed over the tops of the grasses and flowers up and up until they reached the tops of the trees where they seemed very small I do not know why these moths no longer cared for the grasses and flowers But I saw them circling cross over the little stream high in the air and then pass on directly into the wide dark forest For a moment they appeared a small spot of white against the black shadows of the forest across the stream then they went on straight into the shadows until I could no longer see this small spot of white they made It is in this way said the Singing Mouse that human souls pass through life To me who can see them they look small and delicate and white and they circle one about another and they pass on into the deep forest Illustration Illustration The House of Dreams Illustration THE HOUSE OF DREAMS Upon what couch I asked the Singing Mouse may one have the most noble dreams The Singing Mouse sat for a time and looked at me with its bright eye and it seemed to me that the walls opened and widened I saw that I was within a great palace whose walls were hung in tapestries and whose doors were of golden panelings and whose windows were of curious crystals and whose furnishings were rich and wonderful and around whose stately limits swam wide gardens of strange flowers full of deep perfumes I heard soft voices of birds and the music also of gentle human voices singing and tenderly played instruments of silken and silvern strings It seemed to me that I lay upon a great couch of thrice piled down and touched hands with delights in all manners that one could think But alas I did not dream as I lay upon this couch Then I saw these walls fade away in turn and in their stead arose a vast cathedral of the woods A music was in the trees and a solemn mountain stood as orator to the sky for me My couch was that of the earth and the leaves and my jewels were upon the grasses all about I touched hands with delights and so I dreamed and was very happy and content Again the place changed and I lay in my own small room with naked walls and little cheer or comfort as you may see The couch was hard and narrow and that which covered it over was worn and threadbare and by no means cloth of woven silk and golden tracery But it seemed to me that upon the walls were pictures And here and there were shadows of things which I had wished many things very sweet and precious Upon this couch as upon that of the earth it seemed to me that I dreamed There were once some leaves and grasses in this couch said the Singing Mouse and that is why you dreamed Around this manner of resting place often arises the House of Dreams and not as many have supposed about the couch of down and silken tapestries Always near a House of Dreams must be a mountain or a sea and trees and grasses with the sky also and the stars which are the candles of our dream houses See you had not noticed it but there is a star in your candle I looked and it was as the Singing Mouse had said A star was at the candle top By its light I could dream nobly and many things seemed true which have not yet come true when the star in the candle does not shine But they are true in the land of the Singing Mouse In that country it is not palaces alone that are Houses of Dreams I know this thing is true Wherefore all ye who have come hither let your hope and your joy be strong and by no means despair for better than despair are hope and joy Illustration Erratum we will watch hush hush hush single close quote missing in text END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SINGING MOUSE STORIES This file should be named twenty one
