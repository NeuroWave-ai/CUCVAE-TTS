none	none	terms Psmith s father had Psmith s gift of getting on well with people On this Saturday as Mike buckled on his pads mister Smith bounded up full of advice and encouragement My boy he said we rely on you These others he indicated with a disparaging wave of the hand the rest of the team who were visible through the window of the changing room are all very well Decent club bats Good for a few on a billiard table But you re our hope on a wicket like this I have studied cricket all my life till that summer it is improbable that mister Smith had ever handled a bat and I know a first class batsman when I see one I ve seen your brothers play Pooh you re better than any of them That century of yours against the Green Jackets was a wonderful innings wonderful Now look here my boy I want you to be careful We ve a lot of runs to make so we mustn t take any risks Hit plenty of boundaries of course but be careful Careful Dash it there s a youngster trying to climb up the elm He ll break his neck It s young Giles my keeper s boy Hi Hi there He scudded out to avert the tragedy leaving Mike to digest his expert advice on the art of batting on bad wickets Possibly it was the excellence of this advice which induced Mike to play what was to date the best innings of his life There are moments when the batsman feels an almost super human fitness This came to Mike now The sun had begun to shine strongly It made the wicket more difficult but it added a cheerful touch to the scene Mike felt calm and masterful The bowling had no terrors for him He scored nine off his first over and seven off his second half way through which he lost his partner He was to undergo a similar bereavement several times that afternoon and at frequent intervals However simple the bowling might seem to him it had enough sting in it to worry the rest of the team considerably Batsmen came and went at the other end with such rapidity that it seemed hardly worth while their troubling to come in at all Every now and then one would give promise of better things by lifting the slow bowler into the pavilion or over the boundary but it always happened that a similar stroke a few balls later ended in an easy catch At five o clock the Ilsworth score was eighty one for seven wickets last man nought Mike not out fifty nine As most of the house team including Mike were dispersing to their homes or were due for visits at other houses that night stumps were to be drawn at six It was obvious that they could not hope to win Number nine on the list who was Bagley the ground man went in with instructions to play for a draw and minute advice from mister Smith as to how he was to do it Mike had now begun to score rapidly and it was not to be expected that he could change his game but Bagley a dried up little man of the type which bowls for five hours on a hot August day without exhibiting any symptoms of fatigue put a much bound bat stolidly in front of every ball he received and the Hall s prospects of saving the game grew brighter At a quarter to six the professional left caught at very silly point for eight The score was a hundred and fifteen of which Mike had made eighty five A lengthy young man with yellow hair who had done some good fast bowling for the Hall during the week was the next man in In previous matches he had hit furiously at everything and against the Green Jackets had knocked up forty in twenty minutes while Mike was putting the finishing touches to his century Now however with his host s warning ringing in his ears he adopted the unspectacular or Bagley style of play His manner of dealing with the ball was that of one playing croquet He patted it gingerly back to the bowler when it was straight and left it icily alone when it was off the wicket Mike still in the brilliant vein clumped a half volley past point to the boundary and with highly scientific late cuts and glides brought his score to ninety eight With Mike s score at this the total at a hundred and thirty and the hands of the clock at five minutes to six the yellow haired croquet exponent fell as Bagley had fallen a victim to silly point the ball being the last of the over mister Smith who always went in last for his side and who so far had not received a single ball during the week was down the pavilion steps and half way to the wicket before the retiring batsman had taken half a dozen steps Last over said the wicket keeper to Mike Any idea how many you ve got You must be near your century I should think Ninety eight said Mike He always counted his runs By Jove as near as that This is something like a finish Mike left the first ball alone and the second They were too wide of the off stump to be hit at safely Then he felt a thrill as the third ball left the bowler s hand It was a long hop He faced square to pull it And at that moment mister John Bickersdyke walked into his life across the bowling screen He crossed the bowler s arm just before the ball pitched Mike lost sight of it for a fraction of a second and hit wildly The next moment his leg stump was askew and the Hall had lost the match I m sorry he said to mister Smith Some silly idiot walked across the screen just as the ball was bowled What shouted mister Smith Who was the fool who walked behind the bowler s arm he yelled appealingly to Space Here he comes whoever he is said Mike A short stout man in a straw hat and a flannel suit was walking towards them As he came nearer Mike saw that he had a hard thin lipped mouth half hidden by a rather ragged moustache and that behind a pair of gold spectacles were two pale and slightly protruding e

none	none	which like his mouth looked hard How are you Smith he said Hullo Bickersdyke There was a slight internal struggle and then mister Smith ceased to be the cricketer and became the host He chatted amiably to the new comer You lost the game I suppose said mister Bickersdyke The cricketer in mister Smith came to the top again blended now however with the host He was annoyed but restrained in his annoyance I say Bickersdyke you know my dear fellow he said complainingly you shouldn t have walked across the screen You put Jackson off and made him get bowled The screen That curious white object said Mike It is not put up merely as an ornament There s a sort of rough idea of giving the batsman a chance of seeing the ball as well It s a great help to him when people come charging across it just as the bowler bowls mister Bickersdyke turned a slightly deeper shade of purple and was about to reply when what sporting reporters call the veritable ovation began Quite a large crowd had been watching the game and they expressed their approval of Mike s performance There is only one thing for a batsman to do on these occasions Mike ran into the pavilion leaving mister Bickersdyke standing two Mike Hears Bad News It seemed to Mike when he got home that there was a touch of gloom in the air His sisters were as glad to see him as ever There was a good deal of rejoicing going on among the female Jacksons because Joe had scored his first double century in first class cricket Double centuries are too common nowadays for the papers to take much notice of them but still it is not everybody who can make them and the occasion was one to be marked Mike had read the news in the evening paper in the train and had sent his brother a wire from the station congratulating him He had wondered whether he himself would ever achieve the feat in first class cricket He did not see why he should not He looked forward through a long vista of years of county cricket He had a birth qualification for the county in which mister Smith had settled and he had played for it once already at the beginning of the holidays His debut had not been sensational but it had been promising The fact that two members of the team had made centuries and a third seventy odd had rather eclipsed his own twenty nine not out but it had been a faultless innings and nearly all the papers had said that here was yet another Jackson evidently well up to the family standard who was bound to do big things in the future The touch of gloom was contributed by his brother Bob to a certain extent and by his father more noticeably Bob looked slightly thoughtful mister Jackson seemed thoroughly worried Mike approached Bob on the subject in the billiard room after dinner Bob was practising cannons in rather a listless way What s up Bob asked Mike Bob laid down his cue I m hanged if I know said Bob Something seems to be Father s worried about something He looked as if he d got the hump rather at dinner I only got here this afternoon about three hours before you did I had a bit of a talk with him before dinner I can t make out what s up He seemed awfully keen on my finding something to do now I ve come down from Oxford Wanted to know whether I couldn t get a tutoring job or a mastership at some school next term I said I d have a shot I don t see what all the hurry s about though I was hoping he d give me a bit of travelling on the Continent somewhere before I started in Rough luck said Mike I wonder why it is Jolly good about Joe wasn t it Let s have fifty up shall we Bob s remarks had given Mike no hint of impending disaster It seemed strange of course that his father who had always been so easy going should have developed a hustling Get On or Get Out spirit and be urging Bob to Do It Now but it never occurred to him that there could be any serious reason for it After all fellows had to start working some time or other Probably his father had merely pointed this out to Bob and Bob had made too much of it Half way through the game mister Jackson entered the room and stood watching in silence Want a game father asked Mike No thanks Mike What is it A hundred up Fifty Oh then you ll be finished in a moment When you are I wish you d just look into the study for a moment Mike I want to have a talk with you Rum said Mike as the door closed I wonder what s up For a wonder his conscience was free It was not as if a bad school report might have arrived in his absence His Sedleigh report had come at the beginning of the holidays and had been on the whole fairly decent nothing startling either way mister Downing perhaps through remorse at having harried Mike to such an extent during the Sammy episode had exercised a studied moderation in his remarks He had let Mike down far more easily than he really deserved So it could not be a report that was worrying mister Jackson And there was nothing else on his conscience Bob made a break of sixteen and ran out Mike replaced his cue and walked to the study His father was sitting at the table Except for the very important fact that this time he felt that he could plead Not Guilty on every possible charge Mike was struck by the resemblance in the general arrangement of the scene to that painful ten minutes at the end of the previous holidays when his father had announced his intention of taking him away from Wrykyn and sending him to Sedleigh The resemblance was increased by the fact that as Mike entered mister Jackson was kicking at the waste paper basket a thing which with him was an infallible sign of mental unrest Sit down Mike said mister Jackson How did you get on during the week Topping Only once out under double figures And then I was run out Got a century against the Green Jackets seventy one against the Incogs and today I made ninety eight on a beast of a wicket and only got out because some silly goat of a chap He broke off mister Jackson did not seem to be attending 
318_124224_000056_000001	train-clean-360	There was a silence 
none	none	Then mister Jackson spoke with an obvious effort Look here Mike we ve always understood one another haven t we Of course we have You know I wouldn t do anything to prevent you having a good time if I could help it I took you away from Wrykyn I know but that was a special case It was necessary But I understand perfectly how keen you are to go to Cambridge and I wouldn t stand in the way for a minute if I could help it Mike looked at him blankly This could only mean one thing He was not to go to the Varsity But why What had happened When he had left for the Smith s cricket week his name had been down for King s and the whole thing settled What could have happened since then But I can t help it continued mister Jackson Aren t I going up to Cambridge father stammered Mike I m afraid not Mike I d manage it if I possibly could I m just as anxious to see you get your Blue as you are to get it But it s kinder to be quite frank I can t afford to send you to Cambridge I won t go into details which you would not understand but I ve lost a very large sum of money since I saw you last So large that we shall have to economize in every way I shall let this house and take a much smaller one And you and Bob I m afraid will have to start earning your living I know it s a terrible disappointment to you old chap Oh that s all right said Mike thickly There seemed to be something sticking in his throat preventing him from speaking If there was any possible way No it s all right father really I don t mind a bit It s awfully rough luck on you losing all that There was another silence The clock ticked away energetically on the mantelpiece as if glad to make itself heard at last Outside a plaintive snuffle made itself heard John the bull dog Mike s inseparable companion who had followed him to the study was getting tired of waiting on the mat Mike got up and opened the door John lumbered in The movement broke the tension Thanks Mike said mister Jackson as Mike started to leave the room you re a sportsman three The New Era Begins Details of what were in store for him were given to Mike next morning During his absence at Ilsworth a vacancy had been got for him in that flourishing institution the New Asiatic Bank and he was to enter upon his duties whatever they might be on the Tuesday of the following week It was short notice but banks have a habit of swallowing their victims rather abruptly Mike remembered the case of Wyatt who had had just about the same amount of time in which to get used to the prospect of Commerce On the Monday morning a letter arrived from Psmith Psmith was still perturbed Commerce he wrote continues to boom My pater referred to Comrade Bickersdyke last night as a Merchant Prince Comrade B and I do not get on well together Purely for his own good I drew him aside yesterday and explained to him at great length the frightfulness of walking across the bowling screen He seemed restive but I was firm We parted rather with the Distant Stare than the Friendly Smile But I shall persevere In many ways the casual observer would say that he was hopeless He is a poor performer at Bridge as I was compelled to hint to him on Saturday night His eyes have no animated sparkle of intelligence And the cut of his clothes jars my sensitive soul to its foundations I don t wish to speak ill of a man behind his back but I must confide in you as my Boyhood s Friend that he wore a made up tie at dinner But no more of a painful subject I am working away at him with a brave smile Sometimes I think that I am succeeding Then he seems to slip back again However concluded the letter ending on an optimistic note I think that I shall make a man of him yet some day Mike re read this letter in the train that took him to London By this time Psmith would know that his was not the only case in which Commerce was booming Mike had written to him by return telling him of the disaster which had befallen the house of Jackson Mike wished he could have told him in person for Psmith had a way of treating unpleasant situations as if he were merely playing at them for his own amusement Psmith s attitude towards the slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune was to regard them with a bland smile as if they were part of an entertainment got up for his express benefit Arriving at Paddington Mike stood on the platform waiting for his box to emerge from the luggage van with mixed feelings of gloom and excitement The gloom was in the larger quantities perhaps but the excitement was there too It was the first time in his life that he had been entirely dependent on himself He had crossed the Rubicon The occasion was too serious for him to feel the same helplessly furious feeling with which he had embarked on life at Sedleigh It was possible to look on Sedleigh with quite a personal enmity London was too big to be angry with It took no notice of him It did not care whether he was glad to be there or sorry and there was no means of making it care That is the peculiarity of London There is a sort of cold unfriendliness about it A city like New York makes the new arrival feel at home in half an hour but London is a specialist in what Psmith in his letter had called the Distant Stare You have to buy London s good will Mike drove across the Park to Victoria feeling very empty and small He had settled on Dulwich as the spot to get lodgings partly because knowing nothing about London he was under the impression that rooms anywhere inside the four mile radius were very expensive but principally because there was a school at Dulwich and it would be a comfort being near a school He might get a game of fives there sometimes he thought on a Saturday afternoon and in the summer occasional cricket Wandering at a venture up the asphalt passage which leads from Dulwich station in the direction of the College he came out into Acacia Road There is something about Acacia Road which inevitably suggests furnished apartments A child could tell at a glance that it was bristling with bed sitting rooms Mike knocked at the first door over which a card hung There is probably no more depressing experience in the world than the process of engaging furnished apartments Those who let furnished apartments seem to take no joy in the act Like Pooh Bah they do it but it revolts them In answer to Mike s knock a female person opened the door In appearance she resembled a pantomime dame inclining towards the restrained melancholy of mister Wilkie Bard rather than the joyous abandon of mister George Robey Her voice she had modelled on the gramophone Her most recent occupation seemed to have been something with a good deal of yellow soap in it As a matter of fact there are no secrets between our readers and ourselves she had been washing a shirt A useful occupation and an honourable but one that tends to produce a certain homeliness in the appearance She wiped a pair of steaming hands on her apron and regarded Mike with an eye which would have been markedly expressionless in a boiled fish Was there anything she asked Mike felt that he was in for it now He had not sufficient ease of manner to back gracefully away and disappear so he said that there was something In point of fact he wanted a bed sitting room Orkup stays said the pantomime dame Which Mike interpreted to mean would he walk upstairs The procession moved up a dark flight of stairs until it came to a door The pantomime dame opened this and shuffled through Mike stood in the doorway and looked in It was a repulsive room One of those characterless rooms which are only found in furnished apartments To Mike used to the comforts of his bedroom at home and the cheerful simplicity of a school dormitory it seemed about the most dismal spot he had ever struck A sort of Sargasso Sea among bedrooms He looked round in silence Then he said

318_124224_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes 
none	none	There did not seem much else to say It s a nice room said the pantomime dame Which was a black lie It was not a nice room It never had been a nice room And it did not seem at all probable that it ever would be a nice room But it looked cheap That was the great thing Nobody could have the assurance to charge much for a room like that A landlady with a conscience might even have gone to the length of paying people some small sum by way of compensation to them for sleeping in it About what queried Mike Cheapness was the great consideration He understood that his salary at the bank would be about four pounds ten a month to begin with and his father was allowing him five pounds a month One does not do things en prince on a hundred and fourteen pounds a year The pantomime dame became slightly more animated Prefacing her remarks by a repetition of her statement that it was a nice room she went on to say that she could do it at seven and sixpence per week for him giving him to understand presumably that if the Shah of Persia or mister Carnegie ever applied for a night s rest they would sigh in vain for such easy terms And that included lights Coals were to be looked on as an extra Sixpence a scuttle Attendance was thrown in Having stated these terms she dribbled a piece of fluff under the bed after the manner of a professional Association footballer and relapsed into her former moody silence Mike said he thought that would be all right The pantomime dame exhibited no pleasure Bout meals she said You ll be wanting breakfast Bacon aigs an that I suppose Mike said he supposed so That ll be extra she said And dinner A chop or a nice steak Mike bowed before this original flight of fancy A chop or a nice steak seemed to be about what he might want That ll be extra said the pantomime dame in her best Wilkie Bard manner Mike said yes he supposed so After which having put down seven and sixpence one week s rent in advance he was presented with a grubby receipt and an enormous latchkey and the seance was at an end Mike wandered out of the house A few steps took him to the railings that bounded the College grounds It was late August and the evenings had begun to close in The cricket field looked very cool and spacious in the dim light with the school buildings looming vague and shadowy through the slight mist The little gate by the railway bridge was not locked He went in and walked slowly across the turf towards the big clump of trees which marked the division between the cricket and football fields It was all very pleasant and soothing after the pantomime dame and her stuffy bed sitting room He sat down on a bench beside the second eleven telegraph board and looked across the ground at the pavilion For the first time that day he began to feel really home sick Up till now the excitement of a strange venture had borne him up but the cricket field and the pavilion reminded him so sharply of Wrykyn They brought home to him with a cutting distinctness the absolute finality of his break with the old order of things Summers would come and go matches would be played on this ground with all the glory of big scores and keen finishes but he was done He was a jolly good bat at school Top of the Wrykyn averages two years But didn t do anything after he left Went into the city or something That was what they would say of him if they didn t quite forget him The clock on the tower over the senior block chimed quarter after quarter but Mike sat on thinking It was quite late when he got up and began to walk back to Acacia Road He felt cold and stiff and very miserable four First Steps in a Business Career The City received Mike with the same aloofness with which the more western portion of London had welcomed him on the previous day Nobody seemed to look at him He was permitted to alight at saint Paul s and make his way up Queen Victoria Street without any demonstration He followed the human stream till he reached the Mansion House and eventually found himself at the massive building of the New Asiatic Bank Limited The difficulty now was to know how to make an effective entrance There was the bank and here was he How had he better set about breaking it to the authorities that he had positively arrived and was ready to start earning his four pound ten per mensem Inside the bank seemed to be in a state of some confusion Men were moving about in an apparently irresolute manner Nobody seemed actually to be working As a matter of fact the business of a bank does not start very early in the morning Mike had arrived before things had really begun to move As he stood near the doorway one or two panting figures rushed up the steps and flung themselves at a large book which stood on the counter near the door Mike was to come to know this book well In it if you were an employe of the New Asiatic Bank you had to inscribe your name every morning It was removed at ten sharp to the accountant s room and if you reached the bank a certain number of times in the year too late to sign bang went your bonus After a while things began to settle down The stir and confusion gradually ceased All down the length of the bank figures could be seen seated on stools and writing hieroglyphics in large letters A benevolent looking man with spectacles and a straggling grey beard crossed the gangway close to where Mike was standing Mike put the thing to him as man to man Could you tell me he said what I m supposed to do I ve just joined the bank The benevolent man stopped and looked at him with a pair of mild blue eyes I think perhaps that your best plan would be to see the manager he said Yes I should certainly do that He will tell you what work you have to do If you will permit me I will show you the way It s awfully good of you said Mike He felt very grateful After his experience of London it was a pleasant change to find someone who really seemed to care what happened to him His heart warmed to the benevolent man It feels strange to you perhaps at first mister Jackson mister Jackson My name is Waller I have been in the City some time but I can still recall my first day But one shakes down One shakes down quite quickly Here is the manager s room If you go in he will tell you what to do Thanks awfully said Mike Not at all He ambled off on the quest which Mike had interrupted turning as he went to bestow a mild smile of encouragement on the new arrival There was something about mister Waller which reminded Mike pleasantly of the White Knight in Alice through the Looking glass Mike knocked at the managerial door and went in Two men were sitting at the table The one facing the door was writing when 
318_124224_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Mike went 
none	none	in He continued to write all the time he was in the room Conversation between other people in his presence had apparently no interest for him nor was it able to disturb him in any way The other man was talking into a telephone Mike waited till he had finished Then he coughed The man turned round Mike had thought as he looked at his back and heard his voice that something about his appearance or his way of speaking was familiar He was right The man in the chair was mister Bickersdyke the cross screen pedestrian These reunions are very awkward Mike was frankly unequal to the situation Psmith in his place would have opened the conversation and relaxed the tension with some remark on the weather or the state of the crops Mike merely stood wrapped in silence as in a garment That the recognition was mutual was evident from mister Bickersdyke s look But apart from this he gave no sign of having already had the pleasure of making Mike s acquaintance He merely stared at him as if he were a blot on the arrangement of the furniture and said Well The most difficult parts to play in real life as well as on the stage are those in which no business is arranged for the performer It was all very well for mister Bickersdyke He had been discovered sitting But Mike had had to enter and he wished now that there was something he could do instead of merely standing and speaking I ve come was the best speech he could think of It was not a good speech It was too sinister He felt that even as he said it It was the sort of thing Mephistopheles would have said to Faust by way of opening conversation And he was not sure either whether he ought not to have added Sir Apparently such subtleties of address were not necessary for mister Bickersdyke did not start up and shout This language to me or anything of that kind He merely said Oh And who are you Jackson said Mike It was irritating this assumption on mister Bickersdyke s part that they had never met before Jackson Ah yes You have joined the staff Mike rather liked this way of putting it It lent a certain dignity to the proceedings making him feel like some important person for whose services there had been strenuous competition He seemed to see the bank s directors being reassured by the chairman I am happy to say gentlemen that our profits for the past year are three million six two two one two pounds cheers and impressively that we have finally succeeded in inducing mister Mike Jackson sensation to er in fact to join the staff Frantic cheers in which the chairman joined Yes he said mister Bickersdyke pressed a bell on the table beside him and picking up a pen began to write Of Mike he took no further notice leaving that toy of Fate standing stranded in the middle of the room After a few moments one of the men in fancy dress whom Mike had seen hanging about the gangway and whom he afterwards found to be messengers appeared mister Bickersdyke looked up Ask mister Bannister to step this way he said The messenger disappeared and presently the door opened again to admit a shock headed youth with paper cuff protectors round his wrists This is mister Jackson a new member of the staff He will take your place in the postage department You will go into the cash department under mister Waller Kindly show him what he has to do Mike followed mister Bannister out On the other side of the door the shock headed one became communicative Whew he said mopping his brow That s the sort of thing which gives me the pip When William came and said old Bick wanted to see me I said to him William my boy my number is up This is the sack I made certain that Rossiter had run me in for something He s been waiting for a chance to do it for weeks only I ve been as good as gold and haven t given it him I pity you going into the postage There s one thing though If you can stick it for about a month you ll get through all right Men are always leaving for the East and then you get shunted on into another department and the next new man goes into the postage That s the best of this place It s not like one of those banks where you stay in London all your life You only have three years here and then you get your orders and go to one of the branches in the East where you re the dickens of a big pot straight away with a big screw and a dozen native Johnnies under you Bit of all right that I shan t get my orders for another two and a half years and more worse luck Still it s something to look forward to Who s Rossiter asked Mike The head of the postage department Fussy little brute Won t leave you alone Always trying to catch you on the hop There s one thing though The work in the postage is pretty simple You can t make many mistakes if you re careful It s mostly entering letters and stamping them They turned in at the door in the counter and arrived at a desk which ran parallel to the gangway There was a high rack running along it on which were several ledgers Tall green shaded electric lamps gave it rather a cosy look As they reached the desk a little man with short black whiskers buzzed out from behind a glass screen where there was another desk Where have you been Bannister where have you been You must not leave your work in this way There are several letters waiting to be entered Where have you been mister Bickersdyke sent for me said Bannister with the calm triumph of one who trumps an ace Oh Ah Oh Yes very well I see But get to work get to work Who is this This is a new man He s taking my place I ve been moved on to the cash Oh Ah Is your name Smith asked mister Rossiter turning to Mike Mike corrected the rash guess and gave his name It struck him as a curious coincidence that he should be asked if his name were Smith of all others Not that it is an uncommon name mister Bickersdyke told me to expect a mister Smith Well well perhaps there are two new men mister Bickersdyke knows we are short handed in this department But come along Bannister come along Show Jackson what he has to do We must get on There is no time to waste He buzzed back to his lair Bannister grinned at Mike He was a cheerful youth His normal expression was a grin That s a sample of Rossiter he said You d think from the fuss he s made that the business of the place was at a standstill till we got to work Perfect rot There s never anything to do here till after lunch except checking the stamps and petty cash and I ve done that ages ago There are three letters You may as well enter them It all looks like work But you ll find the best way is to wait till you get a couple of dozen or so and then work them off in a batch But if you see Rossiter about then start stamping something or writing something or he ll run you in for neglecting your job He s a nut I m jolly glad I m under old Waller now He s the pick of the bunch The other heads of departments are all nuts and Bickersdyke s the nuttiest of the lot Now look here This is all you ve got to do I ll just show you and then you can manage for yourself I shall have to be shunting off to my own work in a minute five The Other Man As Bannister had said the work in the postage department was not intricate There was nothing much to do except enter and stamp letters and at intervals take them down to the post office at the end of the street The nature of the work gave Mike plenty of time for reflection His thoughts became gloomy again All this was very far removed from the life to which he had looked forward There are some people who take naturally to a life of commerce Mike was not of these To him the restraint of the business was irksome He had been used to an open air life and a life in its way of excitement He gathered that he would not be free till five o clock and that on the following day he would come at ten and go at five and the same every day except Saturdays and Sundays all the year round with a ten days holiday The monotony of the prospect appalled him He was not old enough to know what a narcotic is Habit and that one can become attached to and interested in the most unpromising jobs He worked away dismally at his letters till he had finished them Then there was nothing to do except sit and wait for more He looked through the letters he had stamped and re read the addresses Some of them were directed to people living in the country one to a house which he knew quite well near to his own home in Shropshire It made him home sick conjuring up visions of shady gardens and country sounds and smells and the silver Severn gleaming in the distance through the trees About now if he were not in this dismal place he would be lying in the shade in the garden with a book or wandering down to the river to boat or bathe That envelope addressed to the man in Shropshire gave him the worst moment he had experienced that day The time crept slowly on to one o clock At two minutes past Mike awoke from a day dream to find mister Waller standing by his side The cashier had his hat on I wonder said mister Waller if you would care to come out to lunch I generally go about this time and mister Rossiter I know does not go out till two I thought perhaps that being unused to the City you might have some difficulty in finding your way about It s awfully good of you said Mike I should like to The other led the way through the streets and down obscure alleys till they came to a chop house Here one could have the doubtful pleasure of seeing one s chop in its various stages of evolution mister Waller ordered lunch with the care of one to whom lunch is no slight matter Few workers in the City do regard lunch as a trivial affair It is the keynote of their day It is an oasis in a desert of ink and ledgers Conversation in city office deals in the morning with what one is going to have for lunch and in the afternoon with what one has had for lunch At intervals during the meal mister Waller talked Mike was content to listen There was something soothing about the grey bearded one What sort of a man is Bickersdyke asked Mike A very able man A very able man indeed I m afraid he s not popular in the office A little inclined perhaps to be hard on mistakes I can remember the time when he was quite different He and I were fellow clerks in Morton and Blatherwick s He got on better than I did A great fellow for getting on They say he is to be the Unionist candidate for Kenningford when the time comes A great worker but perhaps not quite the sort of man to be generally popular in an office He s a blighter was Mike s verdict mister Waller made no comment Mike was to learn later that the manager and the cashier despite the fact that they had been together in less prosperous days or possibly because of it were not on very good terms mister Bickersdyke was a man of strong prejudices and he disliked the cashier whom he looked down upon as one who had climbed to a lower rung of the ladder than he himself had reached As the hands of the chop house clock reached a quarter to two mister Waller rose and led the way back to the office where they parted for their respective desks Gratitude for any good turn done to him was a leading characteristic of Mike s nature and he felt genuinely grateful to the cashier for troubling to seek him out and be friendly to him His three quarters of an hour absence had led to the accumulation of a small pile of letters on his desk He sat down and began to work them off The addresses continued to exercise a fascination for him He was miles away from the office speculating on what sort of a man J B Garside esquire was and whether he had a good time at his house in Worcestershire when somebody tapped him on the shoulder He looked up Standing by his side immaculately dressed as ever with his eye glass fixed and a gentle smile on his face was Psmith Mike stared Commerce said Psmith as he drew off his lavender gloves has claimed me for her own Comrade of old I too have joined this blighted institution As he spoke there was a whirring noise in the immediate neighbourhood and mister Rossiter buzzed out from his den with the esprit and animation of a clock work toy Who s here said Psmith with interest removing his eye glass polishing it and replacing it in his eye mister Jackson exclaimed mister Rossiter I really must ask you to be good enough to come in from your lunch at the proper time It was fully seven minutes to two when you returned and That little more sighed Psmith and how much is it Who are you snapped mister Rossiter turning on him I shall be delighted Comrade Rossiter said Mike aside Comrade Rossiter I shall be delighted to furnish you with particulars of my family history As follows Soon after the Norman Conquest a certain Sieur de Psmith grew tired of work a family failing alas and settled down in this country to live peacefully for the remainder of his life on what he could extract from the local peasantry He may be described as the founder of the family which ultimately culminated in Me Passing on mister Rossiter refused to pass on What are you doing here What have you come for Work said Psmith with simple dignity I am now a member of the staff of this bank Its interests are my interests Psmith the individual ceases to exist and there springs into being Psmith the cog in the wheel of the New Asiatic Bank Psmith the link in the bank s chain Psmith the Worker I shall not spare myself he proceeded earnestly I shall toil with all the accumulated energy of one who up till now has only known what work is like from hearsay Whose is that form sitting on the steps of the bank in the morning waiting eagerly for the place to open It is the form of Psmith the Worker Whose is that haggard drawn face which bends over a ledger long after the other toilers have sped blithely westwards to dine at Lyons Popular Cafe It is the face of Psmith the Worker I began mister Rossiter I tell you continued Psmith waving aside the interruption and tapping the head of the department rhythmically in the region of the second waistcoat button with a long finger I tell you Comrade Rossiter that you have got hold of a good man You and I together not forgetting Comrade Jackson the pet of the Smart Set will toil early and late till we boost up this Postage Department into a shining model of what a Postage Department should be What that is at present I do not 
806_124221_000036_000002	train-clean-360	exactly 
none	none	know However Excursion trains will be run from distant shires to see this Postage Department American visitors to London will do it before going on to the Tower And now he broke off with a crisp businesslike intonation I must ask you to excuse me Much as I have enjoyed this little chat I fear it must now cease The time has come to work Our trade rivals are getting ahead of us The whisper goes round Rossiter and Psmith are talking not working and other firms prepare to pinch our business Let me Work Two minutes later mister Rossiter was sitting at his desk with a dazed expression while Psmith perched gracefully on a stool entered figures in a ledger six Psmith Explains For the space of about twenty five minutes Psmith sat in silence concentrated on his ledger the picture of the model bank clerk Then he flung down his pen slid from his stool with a satisfied sigh and dusted his waistcoat A commercial crisis he said has passed The job of work which Comrade Rossiter indicated for me has been completed with masterly skill The period of anxiety is over The bank ceases to totter Are you busy Comrade Jackson or shall we chat awhile Mike was not busy He had worked off the last batch of letters and there was nothing to do but to wait for the next or happy thought to take the present batch down to the post and so get out into the sunshine and fresh air for a short time I rather think I ll nip down to the post office said he You couldn t come too I suppose On the contrary said Psmith I could and will A stroll will just restore those tissues which the gruelling work of the last half hour has wasted away It is a fearful strain this commercial toil Let us trickle towards the post office I will leave my hat and gloves as a guarantee of good faith The cry will go round Psmith has gone Some rival institution has kidnapped him Then they will see my hat he built up a foundation of ledgers planted a long ruler in the middle and hung his hat on it my gloves he stuck two pens into the desk and hung a lavender glove on each and they will sink back swooning with relief The awful suspense will be over They will say No he has not gone permanently Psmith will return When the fields are white with daisies he ll return And now Comrade Jackson lead me to this picturesque little post office of yours of which I have heard so much Mike picked up the long basket into which he had thrown the letters after entering the addresses in his ledger and they moved off down the aisle No movement came from mister Rossiter s lair Its energetic occupant was hard at work They could just see part of his hunched up back I wish Comrade Downing could see us now said Psmith He always set us down as mere idlers Triflers Butterflies It would be a wholesome corrective for him to watch us perspiring like this in the cause of Commerce You haven t told me yet what on earth you re doing here said Mike I thought you were going to the Varsity Why the dickens are you in a bank Your pater hasn t lost his money has he No There is still a tolerable supply of doubloons in the old oak chest Mine is a painful story It always is said Mike You are very right Comrade Jackson I am the victim of Fate Ah so you put the little chaps in there do you he said as Mike reaching the post office began to bundle the letters into the box You seem to have grasped your duties with admirable promptitude It is the same with me I fancy we are both born men of Commerce In a few years we shall be pinching Comrade Bickersdyke s job And talking of Comrade B brings me back to my painful story But I shall never have time to tell it to you during our walk back Let us drift aside into this tea shop We can order a buckwheat cake or a butter nut or something equally succulent and carefully refraining from consuming these dainties I will tell you all Right O said Mike When last I saw you resumed Psmith hanging Mike s basket on the hat stand and ordering two portions of porridge you may remember that a serious crisis in my affairs had arrived My father inflamed with the idea of Commerce had invited Comrade Bickersdyke When did you know he was a manager here asked Mike At an early date I have my spies everywhere However my pater invited Comrade Bickersdyke to our house for the weekend Things turned out rather unfortunately Comrade B resented my purely altruistic efforts to improve him mentally and morally Indeed on one occasion he went so far as to call me an impudent young cub and to add that he wished he had me under him in his bank where he asserted he would knock some of the nonsense out of me All very painful I tell you Comrade Jackson for the moment it reduced my delicately vibrating ganglions to a mere frazzle Recovering myself I made a few blithe remarks and we then parted I cannot say that we parted friends but at any rate I bore him no ill will I was still determined to make him a credit to me My feelings towards him were those of some kindly father to his prodigal son But he if I may say so was fairly on the hop And when my pater after dinner the same night played into his hands by mentioning that he thought I ought to plunge into a career of commerce Comrade B was I gather all over him Offered to make a vacancy for me in the bank and to take me on at once My pater feeling that this was the real hustle which he admired so much had me in stated his case and said in effect How do we go I intimated that Comrade Bickersdyke was my greatest chum on earth So the thing was fixed up and here I am But you are not getting on with your porridge Comrade Jackson Perhaps you don t care for porridge Would you like a finnan haddock instead Or a piece of shortbread You have only to say the word It seems to me said Mike gloomily that we are in for a pretty rotten time of it in this bally bank If Bickersdyke s got his knife into us he can make it jolly warm for us He s got his knife into me all right about that walking across the screen business True said Psmith to a certain extent It is an undoubted fact that Comrade Bickersdyke will have a jolly good try at making life a nuisance to us but on the other hand I propose so far as in me lies to make things moderately unrestful for him here and there But you can t objected Mike What I mean to say is it isn t like a school If you wanted to score off a master at school you could always rag and so on But here you can t How can you rag a man who s sitting all day in a room of his own while you re sweating away at a desk at the other end of the building You put the case with admirable clearness Comrade Jackson said Psmith approvingly At the hard headed common sense business you sneak the biscuit every time with ridiculous ease But you do not know all I do not propose to do a thing in the bank except work I shall be a model as far as work goes I shall be flawless I shall bound to do Comrade Rossiter s bidding like a highly trained performing dog It is outside the bank when I have staggered away dazed with toil that I shall resume my attention to the education of Comrade Bickersdyke But dash it all how can you You won t see him He ll go off home or to his club or Psmith tapped him earnestly on the chest There Comrade
318_124224_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Jackson he said 
none	none	you have hit the bull s eye rung the bell and gathered in the cigar or cocoanut according to choice He will go off to his club And I shall do precisely the same How do you mean It is this way My father as you may have noticed during your stay at our stately home of England is a man of a warm impulsive character He does not always do things as other people would do them He has his own methods Thus he has sent me into the City to do the hard working bank clerk act but at the same time he is allowing me just as large an allowance as he would have given me if I had gone to the Varsity Moreover while I was still at Eton he put my name up for his clubs the Senior Conservative among others My pater belongs to four clubs altogether and in course of time when my name comes up for election I shall do the same Meanwhile I belong to one the Senior Conservative It is a bigger club than the others and your name comes up for election sooner About the middle of last month a great yell of joy made the West End of London shake like a jelly The three thousand members of the Senior Conservative had just learned that I had been elected Psmith paused and ate some porridge I wonder why they call this porridge he observed with mild interest It would be far more manly and straightforward of them to give it its real name To resume I have gleaned from casual chit chat with my father that Comrade Bickersdyke also infests the Senior Conservative You might think that that would make me seeing how particular I am about whom I mix with avoid the club Error I shall go there every day If Comrade Bickersdyke wishes to emend any little traits in my character of which he may disapprove he shall never say that I did not give him the opportunity I shall mix freely with Comrade Bickersdyke at the Senior Conservative Club I shall be his constant companion I shall in short haunt the man By these strenuous means I shall as it were get a bit of my own back And now said Psmith rising it might be as well perhaps to return to the bank and resume our commercial duties I don t know how long you are supposed to be allowed for your little trips to and from the post office but seeing that the distance is about thirty yards I should say at a venture not more than half an hour Which is exactly the space of time which has flitted by since we started out on this important expedition Your devotion to porridge Comrade Jackson has led to our spending about twenty five minutes in this hostelry Great Scott said Mike there ll be a row Some slight temporary breeze perhaps said Psmith Annoying to men of culture and refinement but not lasting My only fear is lest we may have worried Comrade Rossiter at all I regard Comrade Rossiter as an elder brother and would not cause him a moment s heart burning for worlds However we shall soon know he added as they passed into the bank and walked up the aisle for there is Comrade Rossiter waiting to receive us in person The little head of the Postage Department was moving restlessly about in the neighbourhood of Psmith s and Mike s desk Am I mistaken said Psmith to Mike or is there the merest suspicion of a worried look on our chief s face It seems to me that there is the slightest soupcon of shadow about that broad calm brow seven Going into Winter Quarters There was mister Rossiter had discovered Psmith s and Mike s absence about five minutes after they had left the building Ever since then he had been popping out of his lair at intervals of three minutes to see whether they had returned Constant disappointment in this respect had rendered him decidedly jumpy When Psmith and Mike reached the desk he was a kind of human soda water bottle He fizzed over with questions reproofs and warnings What does it mean What does it mean he cried Where have you been Where have you been Poetry said Psmith approvingly You have been absent from your places for over half an hour Why Why Why Where have you been Where have you been I cannot have this It is preposterous Where have you been Suppose mister Bickersdyke had happened to come round here I should not have known what to say to him Never an easy man to chat with Comrade Bickersdyke agreed Psmith You must thoroughly understand that you are expected to remain in your places during business hours Of course said Psmith that makes it a little hard for Comrade Jackson to post letters does it not Have you been posting letters We have said Psmith You have wronged us Seeing our absent places you jumped rashly to the conclusion that we were merely gadding about in pursuit of pleasure Error All the while we were furthering the bank s best interests by posting letters You had no business to leave your place Jackson is on the posting desk You are very right said Psmith and
806_124221_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 it shall not occur again 
none	none	It was only because it was the first day Comrade Jackson is not used to the stir and bustle of the City His nerve failed him He shrank from going to the post office alone So I volunteered to accompany him And concluded Psmith impressively we won safely through Every letter has been posted That need not have taken you half an hour True And the actual work did not It was carried through swiftly and surely But the nerve strain had left us shaken Before resuming our more ordinary duties we had to refresh A brief breathing space a little coffee and porridge and here we are fit for work once more If it occurs again I shall report the matter to mister Bickersdyke And rightly so said Psmith earnestly Quite rightly so Discipline discipline That is the cry There must be no shirking of painful duties Sentiment must play no part in business Rossiter the man may sympathise but Rossiter the Departmental head must be adamant mister Rossiter pondered over this for a moment then went off on a side issue What is the meaning of this foolery he asked pointing to Psmith s gloves and hat Suppose mister Bickersdyke had come round and seen them what should I have said You would have given him a message of cheer You would have said All is well Psmith has not left us He will come back And Comrade Bickersdyke relieved would have You do not seem very busy mister Smith Both Psmith and mister Rossiter were startled mister Rossiter jumped as if somebody had run a gimlet into him and even Psmith started slightly They had not heard mister Bickersdyke approaching Mike who had been stolidly entering addresses in his ledger during the latter part of the conversation was also taken by surprise Psmith was the first to recover mister Rossiter was still too confused for speech but Psmith took the situation in hand Apparently no he said swiftly removing his hat from the ruler In reality yes mister Rossiter and I were just scheming out a line of work for me as you came up If you had arrived a moment later you would have found me toiling H m I hope I should We do not encourage idling in this bank Assuredly not said Psmith warmly Most assuredly not I would not have it otherwise I am a worker A bee not a drone A Lusitania not a limpet Perhaps I have not yet that grip on my duties which I shall soon acquire but it is coming It is coming I see daylight H m I have only your word for it He turned to mister Rossiter who had now recovered himself and was as nearly calm as it was in his nature to be Do you find mister Smith s work satisfactory mister Rossiter Psmith waited resignedly for an outburst of complaint respecting the small matter that had been under discussion between the head of the department and himself but to his surprise it did not come Oh ah quite quite mister Bickersdyke I think he will very soon pick things up mister Bickersdyke turned away He was a conscientious bank manager and one can only suppose that mister Rossiter s tribute to the earnestness of one of his employes was gratifying to him But for that one would have said that he was disappointed Oh mister Bickersdyke said Psmith The manager stopped Father sent his kind regards to you said Psmith benevolently mister Bickersdyke walked off without comment An uncommonly cheery companionable feller murmured Psmith as he turned to his work The first day anywhere if one spends it in a sedentary fashion always seemed unending and Mike felt as if he had been sitting at his desk for weeks when the hour for departure came A bank s day ends gradually reluctantly as it were At about five there is a sort of stir not unlike the stir in a theatre when the curtain is on the point of falling Ledgers are closed with a bang Men stand about and talk for a moment or two before going to the basement for their hats and coats Then at irregular intervals forms pass down the central aisle and out through the swing doors There is an air of relaxation over the place though some departments are still working as hard as ever under a blaze of electric light Somebody begins to sing and an instant chorus of protests and maledictions rises from all sides Gradually however the electric lights go out The procession down the centre aisle becomes more regular and eventually the place is left to darkness and the night watchman The postage department was one of the last to be freed from duty This was due to the inconsiderateness of the other departments which omitted to disgorge their letters till the last moment Mike as he grew familiar with the work and began to understand it used to prowl round the other departments during the afternoon and wrest letters from them usually receiving with them much abuse for being a nuisance and not leaving honest workers alone Today however he had to sit on till nearly six waiting for the final batch of correspondence Psmith who had waited patiently with him though his own work was finished accompanied him down to the post office and back again to the bank to return the letter basket and they left the office together By the way said Psmith what with the strenuous labours of the bank and the disturbing interviews with the powers that be I have omitted to ask you where you are digging Wherever it is of course you must clear out It is imperative in this crisis that we should be together I have acquired a quite snug little flat in Clement s Inn There is a spare bedroom It shall be yours My dear chap said Mike it s all rot I can t sponge on you You pain me Comrade Jackson I was not suggesting such a thing We are business men hard headed young bankers I make you a business proposition I offer you the post of confidential secretary and adviser to me in exchange for a comfortable home The duties will be light You will be required to refuse invitations to dinner from crowned heads and to listen attentively to my views on Life Apart from this there is little to do So that s settled It isn t said Mike I You will enter upon your duties tonight Where are you suspended at present Dulwich But look here A little more and you ll get the sack I tell you the thing is settled Now let us hail yon taximeter cab and desire the stern faced aristocrat on the box to drive us to Dulwich We will then collect a few of your things in a bag have the rest off by train come back in the taxi and go and bite a chop at the Carlton This is a momentous day in our careers Comrade Jackson We must buoy ourselves up Mike made no further objections The thought of that bed sitting room in Acacia Road and the pantomime dame rose up and killed them After all Psmith was not like any ordinary person There would be no question of charity Psmith had invited him to the flat in exactly the same spirit as he had invited him to his house for the cricket week You know said Psmith after a silence as they flitted through the streets in the taximeter one lives and learns Were you so wrapped up in your work this afternoon that you did not hear my very entertaining little chat with Comrade Bickersdyke or did it happen to come under your notice It did Then I wonder if you were struck by the singular conduct of Comrade Rossiter I thought it rather decent of him not to give you away to that blighter Bickersdyke Admirably put It was precisely that that struck me He had his opening all ready made for him but he refrained from depositing me in the soup I tell you Comrade Jackson my rugged old heart was touched I said to myself There must be good in Comrade Rossiter after all I must cultivate him I shall make it my business to be kind to our Departmental head He deserves the utmost consideration His action shone like a good deed in a wicked world Which it was of course From today onwards I take Comrade Rossiter under my wing We seem to be getting into a tolerably benighted quarter Are we anywhere near Through Darkest Dulwich in a Taximeter The cab arrived at Dulwich station and Mike stood up to direct the driver They whirred down Acacia Road Mike stopped the cab and got out A brief and somewhat embarrassing interview with the pantomime dame during which Mike was separated from a week s rent in lieu of notice and he was in the cab again bound for Clement s Inn His feelings that night differed considerably from the frame of mind in which he had gone to bed the night before It was partly a very excellent dinner and partly the fact that Psmith s flat though at present in some disorder was obviously going to be extremely comfortable that worked the change But principally it was due to his having found an ally The gnawing loneliness had gone He did not look forward to a career of Commerce with any greater pleasure than before but there was no doubt that with Psmith it would be easier to get through the time after office hours If all went well in the bank he might find that he had not drawn such a bad ticket after all eight The Friendly Native The first principle of warfare said Psmith at breakfast next morning doling out bacon and eggs with the air of a medieval monarch distributing largesse is to collect a gang to rope in allies to secure the cooperation of some friendly native You may remember that at Sedleigh it was partly the sympathetic cooperation of that record blitherer Comrade Jellicoe which enabled us to nip the pro Spiller movement in the bud It is the same in the present crisis What Comrade Jellicoe was to us at Sedleigh Comrade Rossiter must be in the City We must make an ally of that man Once I know that he and I are as brothers and that he will look with a lenient and benevolent eye on any little shortcomings in my work I shall be able to devote my attention whole heartedly to the moral reformation of Comrade Bickersdyke that man of blood I look on Comrade Bickersdyke as a bargee of the most pronounced type and anything I can do towards making him a decent member of Society shall be done freely and ungrudgingly A trifle more tea Comrade Jackson No thanks said Mike I ve done By Jove Smith this flat of yours is all right Not bad assented Psmith not bad Free from squalor to a great extent I have a number of little objects of vertu coming down shortly from the old homestead Pictures and so on It will be by no means un snug when they are up Meanwhile I can rough it We are old campaigners we Psmiths Give us a roof a few comfortable chairs a sofa or two half a dozen cushions and decent meals and we do not repine Reverting once more to Comrade Rossiter Yes what about him said Mike You ll have a pretty tough job turning him into a friendly native I should think How do you mean to start Psmith regarded him with a benevolent eye There is but one way he said Do you remember the case of Comrade Outwood at Sedleigh How did we corral him and become to him practically as long lost sons We got round him by joining the Archaeological Society Precisely said Psmith Every man has his hobby The thing is to find it out In the case of comrade Rossiter I should say that it would be either postage stamps dried seaweed or Hall Caine I shall endeavour to find out today A few casual questions and the thing is done Shall we be putting in an appearance at the busy hive now If we are to continue in the running for the bonus stakes it would be well to start soon Mike s first duty at the bank that morning was to check the stamps and petty cash While he was engaged on this task he heard Psmith conversing affably with mister Rossiter Good morning said Psmith Morning replied his chief doing sleight of hand tricks with a bundle of letters which lay on his desk Get on with your work Psmith We have a lot before us Undoubtedly I am all impatience I should say that in an institution like this dealing as it does with distant portions of the globe a philatelist would have excellent opportunities of increasing his collection With me stamp collecting has always been a positive craze I I have no time for nonsense of that sort myself said mister Rossiter I should advise you if you mean to get on to devote more time to your work and less to stamps I will start at once Dried seaweed again Get on with your work Smith Psmith retired to his desk This he said to Mike is undoubtedly something in the nature of a set back I have drawn blank The papers bring out posters Psmith Baffled I must try again Meanwhile to work Work the hobby of the philosopher and the poor man s friend The morning dragged slowly on without incident At twelve o clock Mike had to go out and buy stamps which he subsequently punched in the punching machine in the basement a not very exhilarating job in which he was assisted by one of the bank messengers who discoursed learnedly on roses during the seance Roses were his hobby Mike began to see that Psmith had reason in his assumption that the way to every man s heart was through his hobby Mike made a firm friend of William the messenger by displaying an interest and a certain knowledge of roses At the same time the conversation had the bad effect of leading to an acute relapse in the matter of homesickness The rose garden at home had been one of Mike s favourite haunts on a summer afternoon The contrast between it and the basement of the new Asiatic Bank the atmosphere of which was far from being roselike was too much for his feelings He emerged from the depths with his punched stamps filled with bitterness against Fate He found Psmith still baffled Hall Caine said Psmith regretfully has also proved a frost I wandered round to Comrade Rossiter s desk just now with a rather brainy excursus on The Eternal City and was received with the Impatient Frown rather than the Glad Eye He was in the middle of adding up a rather tricky column of figures and my remarks caused him to drop a stitch So far from winning the man over I have gone back There now exists between Comrade Rossiter and myself a certain coldness Further investigations will be postponed till after lunch The postage department received visitors during the morning Members of other departments came with letters among them Bannister mister Rossiter was away in the manager s room at the time How are you getting on said Bannister to Mike Oh all right said Mike Had any trouble with Rossiter yet No not much He hasn t run you in to Bickersdyke No Pardon my interrupting a conversation between old college chums said Psmith courteously but I happened to overhear as I toiled at my desk the name of Comrade Rossiter Bannister looked somewhat startled Mike introduced them This is Smith he said Chap I was at school with This is Bannister Smith who used to be on here till I came In this department asked Psmith Yes Then Comrade Bannister you are the very man I have been looking for Your knowledge will be invaluable to us I have no doubt that during your stay in this excellently managed department you had many opportunities of observing Comrade Rossiter I should jolly well think I had said Bannister with a laugh He saw to that He was always popping out and cursing me about something Comrade Rossiter s manners are a little restive agreed Psmith What used you to talk to him about What used I to talk to him about Exactly In those interviews to which you have alluded how did you amuse entertain Comrade Rossiter I didn t He used to do all the talking there was Psmith straightened his tie and clicked his tongue disappointed This is unfortunate he said smoothing his hair You see Comrade Bannister it is this way In the course of my professional duties I find myself continually coming into contact with Comrade Rossiter I bet you do said Bannister On these occasions I am frequently at a loss for entertaining conversation He has no difficulty as apparently happened in your case in keeping up his end of the dialogue The subject of my shortcomings provides him with ample material for speech I on the other hand am dumb I have nothing to say I should think that was a bit of a change for you wasn t it Perhaps so said Psmith perhaps so On the other hand however restful it may be to myself it does not enable me to secure Comrade Rossiter s interest and win his esteem What Smith wants to know said Mike is whether Rossiter has any hobby of any kind He thinks if he has he might work it to keep in with him Psmith who had been listening with an air of pleased interest much as a father would listen to his child prattling for the benefit of a visitor confirmed this statement Comrade Jackson he said has put the matter with his usual admirable clearness That is the thing in a nutshell Has Comrade Rossiter any hobby that you know of Spillikins brass rubbing the Near Eastern Question or anything like that I have tried him with postage stamps which you d think as head of a postage department he ought to be interested in and dried seaweed Hall Caine but I have the honour to report total failure The man seems to have no pleasures What does he do with himself when the day s toil is ended That giant brain must occupy itself somehow I don t know said Bannister unless it s football I saw him once watching Chelsea I was rather surprised Football said Psmith thoughtfully football By no means a scaly idea I rather fancy Comrade Bannister that you have whanged the nail on the head Is he strong on any particular team I mean have you ever heard him in the intervals of business worries stamping on his desk and yelling Buck up Cottagers or Lay em out Pensioners or anything like that One moment Psmith held up his hand I will get my Sherlock Holmes system to work What was the other team in the modern gladiatorial contest at which you saw Comrade Rossiter Manchester United And Comrade Rossiter I should say was a Manchester man I believe he is Then I am prepared to bet a small sum that he is nuts on Manchester United My dear Holmes how Elementary my dear fellow quite elementary But here comes the lad in person mister Rossiter turned in from the central aisle through the counter door and observing the conversational group at the postage desk came bounding up Bannister moved off Really Smith said mister Rossiter you always seem to be talking I have overlooked the matter once as I did not wish to get you into trouble so soon after joining but really it cannot go on I must take notice of it Psmith held up his hand The fault was mine he said with manly frankness Entirely mine Bannister came in a purely professional spirit to deposit a letter with Comrade Jackson I engaged him in conversation on the subject of the Football League and I was just trying to correct his view that Newcastle United were the best team playing when you arrived It is perfectly absurd said mister Rossiter that you should waste the bank s time in this way The bank pays you to work not to talk about professional football

none	none	just so murmured Psmith There is too much talking in this department I fear you are right It is nonsense My own view said Psmith was that Manchester United were by far the finest team before the public Get on with your work Smith mister Rossiter stumped off to his desk where he sat as one in thought Smith he said at the end of five minutes Psmith slid from his stool and made his way deferentially towards him Bannister s a fool snapped mister Rossiter So I thought said Psmith A perfect fool He always was Psmith shook his head sorrowfully as who should say Exit Bannister There is no team playing today to touch Manchester United Precisely what I said to Comrade Bannister Of course You know something about it The study of League football said Psmith has been my relaxation for years But we have no time to discuss it now Assuredly not sir Work before everything Some other time when We are less busy Precisely Psmith moved back to his seat I fear he said to Mike as he resumed work that as far as Comrade Rossiter s friendship and esteem are concerned I have to a certain extent landed Comrade Bannister in the bouillon but it was in a good cause I fancy we have won through Half an hour s thoughtful perusal of the Footballers Who s Who just to find out some elementary facts about Manchester United and I rather think the friendly Native is corralled And now once more to work Work the hobby of the hustler and the deadbeat s dread nine The Haunting of mister Bickersdyke Anything in the nature of a rash and hasty move was wholly foreign to Psmith s tactics He had the patience which is the chief quality of the successful general He was content to secure his base before making any offensive movement It was a fortnight before he turned his attention to the education of mister Bickersdyke During that fortnight he conversed attractively in the intervals of work on the subject of League football in general and Manchester United in particular The subject is not hard to master if one sets oneself earnestly to it and Psmith spared no pains The football editions of the evening papers are not reticent about those who play the game and Psmith drank in every detail with the thoroughness of the conscientious student By the end of the fortnight he knew what was the favourite breakfast food of J Turnbull what Sandy Turnbull wore next his skin and who in the opinion of Meredith was England s leading politician These facts imparted to and discussed with mister Rossiter made the progress of the entente cordiale rapid It was on the eighth day that mister Rossiter consented to lunch with the Old Etonian On the tenth he played the host By the end of the fortnight the flapping of the white wings of Peace over the Postage Department was setting up a positive draught Mike who had been introduced by Psmith as a distant relative of Moger the goalkeeper was included in the great peace So that now said Psmith reflectively polishing his eye glass I think that we may consider ourselves free to attend to Comrade Bickersdyke Our bright little Mancunian friend would no more run us in now than if we were the brothers Turnbull We are as inside forwards to him The club to which Psmith and mister Bickersdyke belonged was celebrated for the steadfastness of its political views the excellence of its cuisine and the curiously Gorgonzolaesque marble of its main staircase It takes all sorts to make a world It took about four thousand of all sorts to make the Senior Conservative Club To be absolutely accurate there were three thousand seven hundred and eighteen members To mister Bickersdyke for the next week it seemed as if there was only one There was nothing crude or overdone about Psmith s methods The ordinary man having conceived the idea of haunting a fellow clubman might have seized the first opportunity of engaging him in conversation Not so Psmith The first time he met mister Bickersdyke in the club was on the stairs after dinner one night The great man having received practical proof of the excellence of cuisine referred to above was coming down the main staircase at peace with all men when he was aware of a tall young man in the faultless evening dress of which the female novelist is so fond who was regarding him with a fixed stare through an eye glass The tall young man having caught his eye smiled faintly nodded in a friendly but patronizing manner and passed on up the staircase to the library mister Bickersdyke sped on in search of a waiter As Psmith sat in the library with a novel the waiter entered and approached him Beg pardon sir he said Are you a member of this club Psmith fumbled in his pocket and produced his eye glass through which he examined the waiter button by button I am Psmith he said simply A member sir The member said Psmith Surely you participated in the general rejoicings which ensued when it was announced that I had been elected But perhaps you were too busy working to pay any attention If so I respect you 
806_124221_000030_000002	train-clean-360	I also 
none	none	am a worker A toiler not a flatfish A sizzler not a squab Yes I am a member Will you tell mister Bickersdyke that I am sorry but I have been elected and have paid my entrance fee and subscription Thank you sir The waiter went downstairs and found mister Bickersdyke in the lower smoking room The gentleman says he is sir H m said the bank manager Coffee and Benedictine and a cigar Yes sir On the following day mister Bickersdyke met Psmith in the club three times and on the day after that seven Each time the latter s smile was friendly but patronizing mister Bickersdyke began to grow restless On the fourth day Psmith made his first remark The manager was reading the evening paper in a corner when Psmith sinking gracefully into a chair beside him caused him to look up The rain keeps off said Psmith mister Bickersdyke looked as if he wished his employee would imitate the rain but he made no reply Psmith called a waiter Would you mind bringing me a small cup of coffee he said And for you he added to mister Bickersdyke Nothing growled the manager And nothing for mister Bickersdyke The waiter retired mister Bickersdyke became absorbed in his paper I see from my morning paper said Psmith affably that you are to address a meeting at the Kenningford Town Hall next week I shall come and hear you Our politics differ in some respects I fear I incline to the Socialist view but nevertheless I shall listen to your remarks with great interest great interest The paper rustled but no reply came from behind it I heard from father this morning resumed Psmith mister Bickersdyke lowered his paper and glared at him I don t wish to hear about your father he snapped An expression of surprise and pain came over Psmith s face What he cried You don t mean to say that there is any coolness between my father and you I am more grieved than I can say Knowing as I do what a genuine respect my father has for your great talents I can only think that there must have been some misunderstanding Perhaps if you would allow me to act as a mediator mister Bickersdyke put down his paper and walked out of the room Psmith found him a quarter of an hour later in the card room He sat down beside his table and began to observe the play with silent interest mister Bickersdyke never a great performer at the best of times was so unsettled by the scrutiny that in the deciding game of the rubber he revoked thereby presenting his opponents with the rubber by a very handsome majority of points Psmith clicked his tongue sympathetically Dignified reticence is not a leading characteristic of the bridge player s manner at the Senior Conservative Club on occasions like this mister Bickersdyke s partner did not bear his calamity with manly resignation He gave tongue on the instant What on earth s and Why on earth s flowed from his mouth like molten lava mister Bickersdyke sat and fermented in silence Psmith clicked his tongue sympathetically throughout mister Bickersdyke lost that control over himself which every member of a club should possess He turned on Psmith with a snort of frenzy How can I keep my attention fixed on the game when you sit staring at me like a like a I am sorry said Psmith gravely if my stare falls short in any way of your ideal of what a stare should be but I appeal to these gentlemen Could I have watched the game more quietly Of course not said the bereaved partner warmly Nobody could have any earthly objection to your behaviour It was absolute carelessness I should have thought that one might have expected one s partner at a club like this to exercise elementary But mister Bickersdyke had gone He had melted silently away like the driven snow Psmith took his place at the table A somewhat nervous excitable man mister Bickersdyke I should say he observed A somewhat dashed blanked idiot emended the bank manager s late partner Thank goodness he lost as much as I did That s some light consolation Psmith arrived at the flat to find Mike still out Mike had repaired to the Gaiety earlier in the evening to refresh his mind after the labours of the day When he returned Psmith was sitting in an armchair with his feet on the mantelpiece musing placidly on Life Well said Mike Well And how was the Gaiety Good show Jolly good What about Bickersdyke Psmith looked sad I cannot make Comrade Bickersdyke out he said You would think that a man would be glad to see the son of a personal friend On the contrary I may be wronging Comrade B but I should almost be inclined to say that my presence in the Senior Conservative Club tonight irritated him There was no bonhomie in his manner He seemed to me to be giving a spirited imitation of a man about to foam at the mouth I did my best to entertain him I chatted His only reply was to leave the room I followed him to the card room and watched his very remarkable and brainy tactics at bridge and he accused me of causing him to revoke A very curious personality that of Comrade Bickersdyke But let us dismiss him from our minds Rumours have reached me said Psmith that a very decent little supper may be obtained at a quaint old world eating house called the Savoy Will you accompany me thither on a tissue restoring expedition It would be rash not to probe these rumours to their foundation and ascertain their exact truth ten mister Bickersdyke Addresses His Constituents It was noted by the observant at the bank next morning that mister Bickersdyke had something on his mind William the messenger knew it when he found his respectful salute ignored Little Briggs the accountant knew it when his obsequious but cheerful Good morning was acknowledged only by a Morn which was almost an oath mister Bickersdyke passed up the aisle and into his room like an east wind He sat down at his table and pressed the bell Harold William s brother and company messenger entered with the air of one ready to duck if any missile should be thrown at him The reports of the manager s frame of mind had been circulated in the office and Harold felt somewhat apprehensive It was on an occasion very similar to this that George Barstead formerly in the employ of the New Asiatic Bank in the capacity of messenger had been rash enough to laugh at what he had taken for a joke of mister Bickersdyke s and had been instantly presented with the sack for gross impertinence Ask mister Smith began the manager Then he paused No never mind he added Harold remained in the doorway puzzled Don t stand there gaping at me man cried mister Bickersdyke Go away Harold retired and informed his brother William that in his Harold s opinion mister Bickersdyke was off his chump Off his onion said William soaring a trifle higher in poetic imagery Barmy was the terse verdict of Samuel Jakes the third messenger Always said so And with that the New Asiatic Bank staff of messengers dismissed mister Bickersdyke and proceeded to concentrate themselves on their duties which consisted principally of hanging about and discussing the prophecies of that modern seer Captain Coe What had made mister Bickersdyke change his mind so abruptly was the sudden realization of the fact that he had no case against Psmith In his capacity of manager of the bank he could not take official notice of Psmith s behaviour outside office hours especially as Psmith had done nothing but stare at him It would be impossible to make anybody understand the true inwardness of Psmith s stare Theoretically mister Bickersdyke had the power to dismiss any subordinate of his whom he did not consider satisfactory but it was a power that had to be exercised with discretion The manager was accountable for his actions to the Board of Directors If he dismissed Psmith Psmith would certainly bring an action against the bank for wrongful dismissal and on the evidence he would infallibly win it mister Bickersdyke did not welcome the prospect of having to
318_124224_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 explain 
none	none	to the Directors that he had let the shareholders of the bank in for a fine of whatever a discriminating jury cared to decide upon simply because he had been stared at while playing bridge His only hope was to catch Psmith doing his work badly He touched the bell again and sent for mister Rossiter The messenger found the head of the Postage Department in conversation with Psmith Manchester United had been beaten by one goal to nil on the previous afternoon and Psmith was informing mister Rossiter that the referee was a robber who had evidently been financially interested in the result of the game The way he himself looked at it said Psmith was that the thing had been a moral victory for the United mister Rossiter said yes he thought so too And it was at this moment that mister Bickersdyke sent for him to ask whether Psmith s work was satisfactory The head of the Postage Department gave his opinion without hesitation Psmith s work was about the hottest proposition he had ever struck Psmith s work well it stood alone You couldn t compare it with anything There are no degrees in perfection Psmith s work was perfect and there was an end to it He put it differently but that was the gist of what he said mister Bickersdyke observed he was glad to hear it and smashed a nib by stabbing the desk with it It was on the evening following this that the bank manager was due to address a meeting at the Kenningford Town Hall He was looking forward to the event with mixed feelings He had stood for Parliament once before several years back in the North He had been defeated by a couple of thousand votes and he hoped that the episode had been forgotten Not merely because his defeat had been heavy There was another reason On that occasion he had stood as a Liberal He was standing for Kenningford as a Unionist Of course a man is at perfect liberty to change his views if he wishes to do so but the process is apt to give his opponents a chance of catching him to use the inspired language of the music halls on the bend mister Bickersdyke was rather afraid that the light hearted electors of Kenningford might avail themselves of this chance Kenningford S E is undoubtedly by way of being a tough sort of place Its inhabitants incline to a robust type of humour which finds a verbal vent in catch phrases and expends itself physically in smashing shop windows and kicking policemen He feared that the meeting at the Town Hall might possibly be a trifle rowdy All political meetings are very much alike Somebody gets up and introduces the speaker of the evening and then the speaker of the evening says at great length what he thinks of the scandalous manner in which the Government is behaving or the iniquitous goings on of the Opposition From time to time confederates in the audience rise and ask carefully rehearsed questions and are answered fully and satisfactorily by the orator When a genuine heckler interrupts the orator either ignores him or says haughtily that he can find him arguments but cannot find him brains Or occasionally when the question is an easy one he answers it A quietly conducted political meeting is one of England s most delightful indoor games When the meeting is rowdy the audience has more fun but the speaker a good deal less mister Bickersdyke s introducer was an elderly Scotch peer an excellent man for the purpose in every respect except that he possessed a very strong accent The audience welcomed that accent uproariously The electors of Kenningford who really had any definite opinions on politics were fairly equally divided There were about as many earnest Liberals as there were earnest Unionists But besides these there was a strong contingent who did not care which side won These looked on elections as Heaven sent opportunities for making a great deal of noise They attended meetings in order to extract amusement from them and they voted if they voted at all quite irresponsibly A funny story at the expense of one candidate told on the morning of the polling was quite likely to send these brave fellows off in dozens filling in their papers for the victim s opponent There was a solid block of these gay spirits at the back of the hall They received the Scotch peer with huge delight He reminded them of Harry Lauder and they said so They addressed him affectionately as Arry throughout his speech which was rather long They implored him to be a pal and sing The Saftest of the Family Or failing that I love a lassie Finding they could not induce him to do this they did it themselves They sang it several times When the peer having finished his remarks on the subject of mister Bickersdyke at length sat down they cheered for seven minutes and demanded an encore The meeting was in excellent spirits when mister Bickersdyke rose to address it The effort of doing justice to the last speaker had left the free and independent electors at the back of the hall slightly limp The bank manager s opening remarks were received without any demonstration mister Bickersdyke spoke well He had a penetrating if harsh voice and he said what he had to say forcibly Little by little the audience came under his spell When at the end of a well turned sentence he paused and took a sip of water there was a round of applause in which many of the admirers of mister Harry Lauder joined He resumed his speech The audience listened intently mister Bickersdyke having said some nasty things about Free Trade and the Alien Immigrant turned to the Needs of the Navy and the necessity of increasing the fleet at all costs This is no time for half measures he said We must do our utmost We must burn our boats Excuse me said a gentle voice mister Bickersdyke broke off In the centre of the hall a tall figure had risen mister Bickersdyke found himself looking at a gleaming eye glass which the speaker had just polished and inserted in his eye The ordinary heckler mister Bickersdyke would have taken in his stride He had got his audience and simply by continuing and ignoring the interruption he could have won through in safety But the sudden appearance of Psmith unnerved him He remained silent How asked Psmith do you propose to strengthen the Navy by burning boats The inanity of the question enraged even the pleasure seekers at the back Order Order cried the earnest contingent Sit down fice roared the pleasure seekers Psmith sat down with a patient smile mister Bickersdyke resumed his speech But the fire had gone out of it He had lost his audience A moment before he had grasped them and played on their minds or what passed for minds down Kenningford way as on a stringed instrument Now he had lost his hold He spoke on rapidly but he could not get into his stride The trivial interruption had broken the spell His words lacked grip The dead silence in which the first part of his speech had been received that silence which is a greater tribute to the speaker than any applause had given place to a restless medley of little noises here a cough there a scraping of a boot along the floor as its wearer moved uneasily in his seat in another place a whispered conversation The audience was bored mister Bickersdyke left the Navy and went on to more general topics But he was not interesting He quoted figures saw a moment later that he had not quoted them accurately and instead of carrying on boldly went back and corrected himself Gow up top said a voice at the back of the hall and there was a general laugh mister Bickersdyke galloped unsteadily on He condemned the Government He said they had betrayed their trust And then he told an anecdote The Government gentlemen he said achieves nothing worth achieving and every individual member of the Government takes all the credit for what is done to himself Their methods remind me gentlemen of an amusing experience I had while fishing one summer in the Lake District In a volume entitled Three Men in a Boat there is a story of how the author and a friend go into a riverside inn and see a very large trout in a glass case They make inquiries about it have men assure them one by one that the trout was caught by themselves In the end the trout turns out to be made of plaster of Paris mister Bickersdyke told that story as an experience of his own while fishing one summer in the Lake District It went well The meeting was amused mister Bickersdyke went on to draw a trenchant comparison between the lack of genuine merit in the trout and the lack of genuine merit in the achievements of His Majesty s Government There was applause When it had ceased Psmith rose to his feet again Excuse me he said eleven Misunderstood Mike had refused to accompany Psmith to the meeting that evening saying that he got too many chances in the ordinary way of business of hearing mister Bickersdyke speak without going out of his way to make more So Psmith had gone off to Kenningford alone and Mike feeling too lazy to sally out to any place of entertainment had remained at the flat with a novel He was deep in this when there was the sound of a key in the latch and shortly afterwards Psmith entered the room On Psmith s brow there was a look of pensive care and also a slight discoloration When he removed his overcoat Mike saw that his collar was burst and hanging loose and that he had no tie On his erstwhile speckless and gleaming shirt front were number of finger impressions of a boldness and clearness of outline which would have made a Bertillon expert leap with joy Hullo said Mike dropping his book Psmith nodded in silence went to his bedroom and returned with a looking glass Propping this up on a table he proceeded to examine himself with the utmost care He shuddered slightly as his eye fell on the finger marks and without a word he went into his bathroom again He emerged after an interval of ten minutes in sky blue pyjamas slippers and an Old Etonian blazer He lit a cigarette and sitting down stared pensively into the fire What the dickens have you been playing at demanded Mike Psmith heaved a sigh That he replied I could not say precisely At one moment it seemed to be Rugby football at another a jiu jitsu seance Later it bore a resemblance to a pantomime rally However whatever it was it was all very bright and interesting A distinct experience Have you been scrapping asked Mike What happened Was there a row There was said Psmith in a measure what might be described as a row At least when you find a perfect stranger attaching himself to your collar and pulling you begin to suspect that something of that kind is on the bill Did they do that Psmith nodded A merchant in a moth eaten bowler started warbling to a certain extent with me It was all very trying for a man of culture He was a man who had I should say discovered that alcohol was a food long before the doctors found it out A good chap possibly but a little boisterous in his manner Well well Psmith shook his head sadly He got you one on the forehead said Mike or somebody did Tell us what happened I wish the dickens I d come with you I d no notion there would be a rag of any sort What did happen Comrade Jackson said Psmith sorrowfully how sad it is in this life of ours to be consistently misunderstood You know of course how wrapped up I am in Comrade Bickersdyke s welfare You know that all my efforts are directed towards making a decent man of him that in short I am his truest friend Does he show by so much as a word that he appreciates my labours Not he I believe that man is beginning to dislike me Comrade Jackson What happened anyhow Never mind about Bickersdyke Perhaps it was mistaken zeal on my part Well I will tell you all Make a long arm for the shovel Comrade Jackson and pile on a few more coals I thank you Well all went quite smoothly for a while Comrade B in quite good form Got his second wind and was going strong for the tape when a regrettable incident occurred He informed the meeting that while up in the Lake country fishing he went to an inn and saw a remarkably large stuffed trout in a glass case He made inquiries and found that five separate and distinct people had caught Why dash it all said Mike that s a frightful chestnut Psmith nodded It certainly has appeared in print he said In fact I should have said it was rather a well known story I was so interested in Comrade Bickersdyke s statement that the thing had happened to himself that purely out of good will towards him I got up and told him that I thought it was my duty as a friend to let him know that a man named Jerome had pinched his story put it in a book and got money by it Money mark you that should by rights have been Comrade Bickersdyke s He didn t appear to care much about sifting the matter thoroughly In fact he seemed anxious to get on with his speech and slur the matter over But tactlessly perhaps I continued rather to harp on the thing I said that the book in which the story had appeared was published in eighteen eighty nine I asked him how long ago it was that he had been on his fishing tour because it was important to know in order to bring the charge home against Jerome Well after a bit I was amazed and pained too to hear Comrade Bickersdyke urging certain bravoes in the audience to turn me out If ever there was a case of biting the hand that fed him Well well By this time the meeting had begun to take sides to some extent What I might call my party the Earnest Investigators were whistling between their fingers stamping on the floor and shouting Chestnuts while the opposing party the bravoes seemed to be trying as I say to do jiu jitsu tricks with me It was a painful situation I know the cultivated man of affairs should have passed the thing off with a short careless laugh but owing to the above mentioned alcohol expert having got both hands under my collar short careless laughs were off I was compelled very reluctantly to conclude the interview by tapping the bright boy on the jaw He took the hint and sat down on the floor I thought no more of the matter and was making my way thoughtfully to the exit when a second man of wrath put the above on my forehead You can t ignore a thing like that I collected some of his waistcoat and one of his legs and hove him with some vim into the middle distance By this time a good many of the Earnest Investigators were beginning to join in and it was just there that the affair began to have certain points of resemblance to a pantomime rally Everybody seemed to be shouting a good deal and hitting everybody else It was no place for a man of delicate culture so I edged towards the door and drifted out There was a cab in the offing I boarded it And having kicked a vigorous politician in the stomach as he was endeavouring to climb in too I drove off home Psmith got up looked at his forehead once more in the glass sighed and sat down again All very disturbing he said Great Scott said Mike I wish I d come Why on earth didn t you tell me you were going to rag I think you might as well have done I wouldn t have missed it for worlds Psmith regarded him with raised eyebrows Rag he said Comrade Jackson I do not understand you You surely do not think that I had any other object in doing what I did than to serve Comrade Bickersdyke It s terrible how one s motives get distorted in this world of ours Well said Mike with a grin I know one person who ll jolly well distort your motives as you call it and that s Bickersdyke Psmith looked thoughtful True he said true There is that possibility I tell you Comrade Jackson once more that my bright young life is being slowly blighted by the frightful way in which that man misunderstands me It seems almost impossible to try to do him a good turn without having the action misconstrued What ll you say to him tomorrow I shall make no allusion to the painful affair If I happen to meet him in the ordinary course of business routine I shall pass some light pleasant remark on the weather let us say or the Bank rate and continue my duties How about if he sends for you and wants to do the light pleasant remark business on his own In that case I shall not thwart him If he invites me into his private room I shall be his guest and shall discuss to the best of my ability any topic which he may care to introduce There shall be no constraint between Comrade Bickersdyke and myself No I shouldn t think there would be I wish I could come and hear you I wish you could said Psmith courteously Still it doesn t matter much to you You don t care if you do get sacked Psmith rose In that way possibly as you say I am agreeably situated If the New Asiatic Bank does not require Psmith s services there are other spheres where a young man of spirit may carve a place for himself No what is worrying me Comrade Jackson is not the thought of the push It is the growing fear that Comrade Bickersdyke and I will never thoroughly understand and appreciate one another A deep gulf lies between us I do what I can do to bridge it over but he makes no response On his side of the gulf building operations appear to be at an entire standstill That is what is carving these lines of care on my forehead Comrade Jackson That is what is painting these purple circles beneath my eyes Quite inadvertently to be disturbing Comrade Bickersdyke annoying him preventing him from enjoying life How sad this is Life bulges with these tragedies Mike picked up the evening paper Don t let it keep you awake at night he said By the way did you see that Manchester United were playing this afternoon They won You d better sit down and sweat up some of the details You ll want them tomorrow You are very right Comrade Jackson said Psmith reseating himself So the Mancunians pushed the bulb into the meshes beyond the uprights no fewer than four times did they Bless the dear boys what spirits they do enjoy to be sure Comrade Jackson do not disturb me I must concentrate myself These are deep waters twelve In a Nutshell mister Bickersdyke sat in his private room at the New Asiatic Bank with a pile of newspapers before him At least the casual observer would have said that it was mister Bickersdyke In reality however it was an active volcano in the shape and clothes of the bank manager It was freely admitted in the office that morning that the manager had lowered all records with ease The staff had known him to be in a bad temper before frequently but his frame of mind on all previous occasions had been compared with his present frame of mind that of a rather exceptionally good natured lamb Within ten minutes of his arrival the entire office was on the jump The messengers were collected in a pallid group in the basement discussing the affair in whispers and endeavouring to restore their nerve with about sixpenn orth of the beverage known as unsweetened The heads of departments to a man had bowed before the storm Within the space of seven minutes and a quarter mister Bickersdyke had contrived to find some fault with each of them Inward Bills was out at an A B C shop snatching a hasty cup of coffee to pull him together again Outward Bills was sitting at his desk with the glazed stare of one who has been struck in the thorax by a thunderbolt mister Rossiter had been torn from Psmith in the middle of a highly technical discussion of the Manchester United match just as he was showing with the aid of a ball of paper how he had once seen Meredith centre to Sandy Turnbull in a Cup match and was now leaping about like a distracted grasshopper mister Waller head of the Cash Department had been summoned to the Presence and after listening meekly to a rush of criticism had retired to his desk with the air of a beaten spaniel Only one man of the many in the building seemed calm and happy Psmith Psmith had resumed the chat about Manchester United on mister Rossiter s return from the lion s den at the spot where it had been broken off but finding that the head of the Postage Department was in no mood for discussing football or any thing else he had postponed his remarks and placidly resumed his work mister Bickersdyke picked up a paper opened it and began searching the columns He had not far to look It was a slack season for the newspapers and his little trouble which might have received a paragraph in a busy week was set forth fully in three quarters of a column The column was headed Amusing Heckling mister Bickersdyke read a few lines and crumpled the paper up with a snort The next he examined was an organ of his own shade of political opinion It too gave him nearly a column headed Disgraceful Scene at Kenningford There was also a leaderette on the subject The leaderette said so exactly what mister Bickersdyke thought himself that for a moment he was soothed Then the thought of his grievance returned and he pressed the bell Send mister Smith to me he said William the messenger proceeded to inform Psmith of the summons Psmith s face lit up I am always glad to sweeten the monotony of toil with a chat with Little Clarence he said I shall be with him in a moment He cleaned his pen very carefully placed it beside his ledger flicked a little dust off his coatsleeve and made his way to the manager s room mister Bickersdyke received him with the ominous restraint of a tiger crouching for its spring Psmith stood beside the table with languid grace suggestive of some favoured confidential secretary waiting for instructions A ponderous silence brooded over the room for some moments Psmith broke it by remarking that the Bank Rate was unchanged He mentioned this fact as if it afforded him a personal gratification mister Bickersdyke spoke Well mister Smith he said You wished to see me about something sir inquired Psmith ingratiatingly You know perfectly well what I wished to see you about I want to hear your explanation of what occurred last night May I sit sir He dropped gracefully into a chair without waiting for permission and having hitched up the knees of his trousers beamed winningly at the manager A deplorable affair he said with a shake of his head Extremely deplorable We must not judge these rough uneducated men too harshly however In a time of excitement the emotions of the lower classes are easily stirred Where you or I would mister Bickersdyke interrupted I do not wish for any more buffoonery mister Smith Psmith raised a pained pair of eyebrows Buffoonery sir I cannot understand what made you act as you did last night unless you are perfectly mad as I am beginning to think But surely sir there was nothing remarkable in my behaviour When a merchant has attached himself to your collar can you do less than smite him on the other cheek I merely acted in self defence You saw for yourself You know what I am alluding to Your behaviour during my speech An excellent speech murmured Psmith courteously Well said mister Bickersdyke It was perhaps mistaken zeal on my part sir but you must remember that I acted purely from the best motives It seemed to me That is enough mister Smith I confess that I am absolutely at a loss to understand you It is too true sir sighed Psmith You seem continued mister Bickersdyke warming to his subject and turning gradually a richer shade of purple you seem to be determined to endeavour to annoy me No no from Psmith I can only assume that you are not in your right senses You follow me about in my club Our club sir murmured Psmith Be good enough not to interrupt me mister Smith You dog my footsteps in my club Purely accidental sir We happen to meet that is all You attend meetings at which I am speaking and behave in a perfectly imbecile manner Psmith moaned slightly It may seem humorous to you but I can assure you it is extremely bad policy on your part The New Asiatic Bank is no place for humour and I think Excuse me sir said Psmith The manager started at the familiar phrase The plum colour of his complexion deepened I entirely agree with you sir said Psmith that this bank is no place for humour Very well then You And I am never humorous in it I arrive punctually in the morning and I work steadily and earnestly till my labours are completed I think you will find on inquiry that mister Rossiter is satisfied with my work That is neither here nor Surely sir said Psmith you are wrong Surely your jurisdiction ceases after office hours Any little misunderstanding we may have at the close of the day s work cannot affect you officially You could not for instance dismiss me from the service of the bank if we were partners at bridge at the club and I happened to revoke I can dismiss you let me tell you mister Smith for studied insolence whether in the office or not I bow to superior knowledge said Psmith politely but I confess I doubt it And he added there is another point May I continue to some extent If you have anything to say say it Psmith flung one leg over the other and settled his collar It is perhaps a delicate matter he said but it is best to be frank We should have no secrets To put my point quite clearly I must go back a little to the time when you paid us that very welcome week end visit at our house in August If you hope to make capital out of the fact that I have been a guest of your father Not at all said Psmith deprecatingly Not at all You do not take me My point is this I do not wish to revive painful memories but it cannot be denied that there was here and there some slight bickering between us on that occasion The fault said Psmith magnanimously was possibly mine I may have been too exacting too capricious Perhaps so However the fact remains that you conceived the happy notion of getting me into this bank under the impression that once I was in you would be able to if I may use the expression give me beans You said as much to me if I remember I hate to say it but don t you think that if you give me the sack although my work is satisfactory to the head of my department you will be by way of admitting that you bit off rather more than you could chew I merely make the suggestion mister Bickersdyke half rose from his chair You Just so just so but to return to the main point don t you The whole painful affair reminds me of the story of Agesilaus and the Petulant Pterodactyl which as you have never heard I will now proceed to relate Agesilaus mister Bickersdyke made a curious clucking noise in his throat I am boring you said Psmith with ready tact Suffice it to say that Comrade Agesilaus interfered with the pterodactyl which was doing him no harm and the intelligent creature whose motto was Nemo me impune lacessit turned and bit him Bit him good and hard so that Agesilaus ever afterwards had a distaste for pterodactyls His reluctance to disturb them became quite a byword The Society papers of the period frequently commented upon it Let us draw the parallel Here mister Bickersdyke who had been clucking throughout this speech essayed to speak but Psmith hurried on You are Agesilaus he said I am the Petulant Pterodactyl You if I may say so butted in of your own free will and took me from a happy home simply in order that you might get me into this place under you and give me beans But curiously enough the major portion of that vegetable seems to be coming to you Of course you can administer the push if you like but as I say it will be by way of a confession that your scheme has sprung a leak Personally said Psmith as one friend to another I should advise you to stick it out You never know what may happen At any moment I may fall from my present high standard of industry and excellence and then you have me so to speak where the hair is crisp He paused mister Bickersdyke s eyes which even in their normal state protruded slightly now looked as if they might fall out at any moment His face had passed from the plum coloured stage to something beyond Every now and then he made the clucking noise but except for that he was silent Psmith having waited for some time for something in the shape of comment or criticism on his remarks now rose It has been a great treat to me this little chat he said affably but I fear that I must no longer allow purely social enjoyments to interfere with my commercial pursuits With your permission I will rejoin my department where my absence is doubtless already causing comment and possibly dismay But we shall be meeting at the club shortly I hope Good bye sir good bye He left the room and walked dreamily back to the Postage Department leaving the manager still staring glassily at nothing thirteen Mike is Moved On This episode may be said to have concluded the first act of the commercial drama in which Mike and Psmith had been cast for leading parts And as usually happens after the end of an act there was a lull for a while until things began to work up towards another climax Mike as day succeeded day began to grow accustomed to the life of the bank and to find that it had its pleasant side after all Whenever a number of people are working at the same thing even though that thing is not perhaps what they would have chosen as an object in life if left to themselves there is bound to exist an atmosphere of good fellowship something akin to though a hundred times weaker than the public school spirit Such a community lacks the main motive of the public school spirit which is pride in the school and its achievements Nobody can be proud of the achievements of a bank When the business of arranging a new Japanese loan was given to the New Asiatic Bank its employees did not stand on stools and cheer On the contrary they thought of the extra work it would involve and they cursed a good deal though there was no denying that it was a big thing for the bank not unlike winning the Ashburton would be to a school There is a cold impersonality about a bank A school is a living thing Setting aside this important difference there was a good deal of the public school about the New Asiatic Bank The heads of departments were not quite so autocratic as masters and one was treated more on a grown up scale as man to man but nevertheless there remained a distinct flavour of a school republic Most of the men in the bank with the exception of certain hard headed Scotch youths drafted in from other establishments in the City were old public school men Mike found two Old Wrykinians in the first week Neither was well known to him They had left in his second year in the team But it was pleasant to have them about and to feel that they had been educated at the right place As far as Mike s personal comfort went the presence of these two Wrykinians was very much for the good Both of them knew all about his cricket and they spread the news The New Asiatic Bank like most London banks was keen on sport and happened to possess a cricket team which could make a good game with most of the second rank clubs The disappearance to the East of two of the best bats of the previous season caused Mike s advent to be hailed with a good deal of enthusiasm Mike was a county man He had only played once for his county it was true but that did not matter He had passed the barrier which separates the second class bat from the first class and the bank welcomed him with awe County men did not come their way every day Mike did not like being in the bank considered in the light of a career But he bore no grudge against the inmates of the bank such as he had borne against the inmates of Sedleigh He had looked on the latter as bound up with the school and consequently enemies His fellow workers in the bank he regarded as companions in misfortune They were all in the same boat together There were men from Tonbridge Dulwich Bedford saint Paul s and a dozen other schools One or two of them he knew by repute from the pages of Wisden Bannister his cheerful predecessor in the Postage Department was the Bannister he recollected now who had played for Geddington against Wrykyn in his second year in the Wrykyn team Munroe the big man in the Fixed Deposits he remembered as leader of the Ripton pack Every day brought fresh discoveries of this sort and each made Mike more reconciled to his lot They were a pleasant set of fellows in the New Asiatic Bank and but for the dreary outlook which the future held for Mike unlike most of his follow workers was not attracted by the idea of a life in the East he would have been very fairly content The hostility of mister Bickersdyke was a slight drawback Psmith had developed a habit of taking Mike with him to the club of an evening and this did not do anything towards wiping out of the manager s mind the recollection of his former passage of arms with the Old Wrykinian The glass remaining Set Fair as far as mister Rossiter s approval was concerned Mike was enabled to keep off the managerial carpet to a great extent but twice when he posted letters without going through the preliminary formality of stamping them mister Bickersdyke had opportunities of which he availed himself But for these incidents life was fairly enjoyable Owing to Psmith s benevolent efforts the Postage Department became quite a happy family and ex occupants of the postage desk Bannister especially were amazed at the change that had come over mister Rossiter He no longer darted from his lair like a pouncing panther To report his subordinates to the manager seemed now to be a lost art with him The sight of Psmith and mister Rossiter proceeding high and disposedly to a mutual lunch became quite common and ceased to excite remark By kindness said Psmith to Mike after one of these expeditions By tact and kindness That is how it is done I do not despair of training Comrade Rossiter one of these days to jump through paper hoops So that altogether Mike s life in the bank had become very fairly pleasant Out of office hours he enjoyed himself hugely London was strange to him and with Psmith as a companion he extracted a vast deal of entertainment from it Psmith was not unacquainted with the West End and he proved an excellent guide At first Mike expostulated with unfailing regularity at the other s habit of paying for everything but Psmith waved aside all objections with languid firmness I need you Comrade Jackson he said when Mike lodged a protest on finding himself bound for the stalls for the second night in succession We must stick together As my confidential secretary and adviser your place is by my side Who knows but that between the acts tonight I may not be seized with some luminous thought Could I utter this to my next door neighbour or the programme girl Stand by me Comrade Jackson or we are undone So Mike stood by him By this time Mike had grown so used to his work that he could tell to within five minutes when a rush would come and he was able to spend a good deal of his time reading a surreptitious novel behind a pile of ledgers or down in the tea room The New Asiatic Bank supplied tea to its employees In quality it was bad and the bread and butter associated with it was worse But it had the merit of giving one an excuse for being away from one s desk There were large printed notices all over the tea room which was in the basement informing gentlemen that they were only allowed ten minutes for tea but one took just as long as one thought the head of one s department would stand from twenty five minutes to an hour and a quarter This state of things was too good to last Towards the beginning of the New Year a new man arrived and Mike was moved on to another department fourteen mister Waller Appears in a New Light 
806_124221_000001_000000	train-clean-360	The department into which Mike was sent was the Cash or to be more exact that section of it which was known as Paying Cashier 
806_124221_000001_000001	train-clean-360	The important task of shooting doubloons across the counter did not belong to Mike himself but to mister Waller 
806_124221_000001_000002	train-clean-360	Mike s work was less ostentatious and was performed with pen ink and ledgers in the background Occasionally when mister Waller was out at lunch Mike had to act as substitute for him and cash cheques but mister Waller always went out at a slack time when few customers came in and Mike seldom had any very startling sum to hand over 
806_124221_000002_000000	train-clean-360	He enjoyed being in the Cash Department 
806_124221_000002_000001	train-clean-360	He liked mister Waller 
806_124221_000002_000002	train-clean-360	The work was easy and when he did happen to make mistakes they were corrected patiently by the grey bearded one and not used as levers for boosting him into the presence of mister Bickersdyke as they might have been in some departments 
806_124221_000002_000003	train-clean-360	The cashier seemed to have taken a fancy to Mike and Mike as was usually the way with him when people went out of their way to be friendly was at his best 
806_124221_000002_000004	train-clean-360	Mike at his ease and unsuspicious of hostile intentions was a different person from Mike with his prickles out 
none	none	Psmith meanwhile was not enjoying himself 
806_124221_000003_000001	train-clean-360	It was an unheard of thing he said depriving a man of his confidential secretary without so much as asking his leave 
806_124221_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 It has caused me the greatest inconvenience he told Mike drifting round in a melancholy way to the Cash Department during a slack spell one afternoon 
806_124221_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 I miss you at every turn 
none	none	Your keen intelligence and ready sympathy were invaluable to me Now where am I 
806_124221_000004_000004	train-clean-360	In the cart 
806_124221_000004_000005	train-clean-360	I evolved a slightly bright thought on life just now 
806_124221_000004_000006	train-clean-360	There was nobody to tell it to except the new man 
none	none	I told it him and the fool gaped 
806_124221_000004_000008	train-clean-360	I tell you Comrade Jackson I feel like some lion that has been robbed of its cub 
none	none	I feel as Marshall would feel if they took Snelgrove away from him or as Peace might if he awoke one morning to find Plenty gone Comrade Rossiter does his best 
806_124221_000004_000011	train-clean-360	We still talk brokenly about Manchester United they got routed in the first round of the Cup yesterday and Comrade Rossiter is wearing black but it is not the same 
806_124221_000004_000012	train-clean-360	I try work but that is no good either 
806_124221_000004_000013	train-clean-360	From ledger to ledger they hurry me to stifle my regret 
806_124221_000004_000014	train-clean-360	And when they win a smile from me they think that I forget 
806_124221_000004_000015	train-clean-360	But I don t 
806_124221_000004_000016	train-clean-360	I am a broken man 
none	none	That new exhibit they ve got in your place is about as near to the Extreme Edge as anything I ve ever seen 
806_124221_000004_000018	train-clean-360	One of Nature s blighters 
none	none	Well well I must away 
806_124221_000004_000020	train-clean-360	Comrade Rossiter awaits me 
none	none	Mike s successor a youth of the name of Bristow was causing Psmith a great deal of pensive melancholy 
806_124221_000005_000001	train-clean-360	His worst defect which he could not help was that he was not Mike 
806_124221_000005_000002	train-clean-360	His others which he could were numerous 
806_124221_000005_000003	train-clean-360	His clothes were cut in a way that harrowed Psmith s sensitive soul every time he looked at them 
806_124221_000005_000004	train-clean-360	The fact that he wore detachable cuffs which he took off on beginning work and stacked in a glistening pile on the desk in front of him was no proof of innate viciousness of disposition but it prejudiced the Old Etonian against him 
806_124221_000005_000005	train-clean-360	It was part of Psmith s philosophy that a man who wore detachable cuffs had passed beyond the limit of human toleration 
none	none	In addition Bristow wore a small black moustache and a ring and that as Psmith informed Mike put the lid on it 
806_124221_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Mike would sometimes stroll round to the Postage Department to listen to the conversations between the two 
806_124221_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Bristow was always friendliness itself 
none	none	He habitually addressed Psmith as Smithy a fact which entertained Mike greatly but did not seem to amuse Psmith to any overwhelming extent On the other hand when as he generally did he called Mike Mister Cricketer the humour of the thing appeared to elude Mike though the mode of address always drew from Psmith a pale wan smile as of a broken heart made cheerful against its own inclination The net result of the coming of Bristow was that Psmith spent most of his time when not actually oppressed by a rush of work in the precincts of the Cash Department talking to Mike and mister Waller The latter did not seem to share the dislike common among the other heads of departments of seeing his subordinates receiving visitors Unless the work was really heavy in which case a mild remonstrance escaped him he offered no objection to Mike being at home to Psmith 
806_124221_000007_000003	train-clean-360	It was this tolerance which sometimes got him into trouble with mister Bickersdyke 
806_124221_000007_000004	train-clean-360	The manager did not often perambulate the office but he did occasionally and the interview which ensued upon his finding Hutchinson the underling in the Cash Department at that time with his stool tilted comfortably against the wall reading the sporting news from a pink paper to a friend from the Outward Bills Department who lay luxuriously on the floor beside him did not rank among mister Waller s pleasantest memories 
806_124221_000007_000005	train-clean-360	But mister Waller was too soft hearted to interfere with his assistants unless it was absolutely necessary 
806_124221_000007_000006	train-clean-360	The truth of the matter was that the New Asiatic Bank was over staffed 
806_124221_000007_000007	train-clean-360	There were too many men for the work 
806_124221_000007_000008	train-clean-360	The London branch of the bank was really only a nursery 
806_124221_000007_000009	train-clean-360	New men were constantly wanted in the Eastern branches so they had to be put into the London branch to learn the business whether there was any work for them to do or not 
806_124221_000008_000000	train-clean-360	It was after one of these visits of Psmith s that mister Waller displayed a new and unsuspected side to his character 
none	none	Psmith had come round in a state of some depression to discuss Bristow as usual Bristow it seemed had come to the bank that morning in a fancy waistcoat of so emphatic a colour scheme that Psmith stoutly refused to sit in the same department with it What with Comrades Bristow and Bickersdyke combined said Psmith plaintively the work is becoming too hard for me 
806_124221_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The whisper is beginning to circulate Psmith s number is up As a reformer he is merely among those present 
none	none	He is losing his dash But what can I do I cannot keep an eye on both of them at the same time 
806_124221_000009_000003	train-clean-360	The moment I concentrate myself on Comrade Bickersdyke for a brief spell and seem to be doing him a bit of good what happens 
806_124221_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Why Comrade Bristow sneaks off and buys a sort of woollen sunset 
806_124221_000009_000005	train-clean-360	I saw the thing unexpectedly 
806_124221_000009_000006	train-clean-360	I tell you I was shaken 
806_124221_000009_000007	train-clean-360	It is the suddenness of that waistcoat which hits you 
806_124221_000009_000008	train-clean-360	It s discouraging this sort of thing 
806_124221_000009_000009	train-clean-360	I try always to think well of my fellow man 
none	none	As an energetic Socialist I do my best to see the good that is in him but it s hard Comrade Bristow s the most striking argument against the equality of man I ve ever come across 
806_124221_000010_000000	train-clean-360	mister Waller intervened at this point 
806_124221_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I think you must really let Jackson go on with his work Smith he said 
806_124221_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 There seems to be too much talking 
none	none	My besetting sin said Psmith sadly
806_124221_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 Well well I will go back and do my best to face it but it s a tough job 
806_124221_000013_000000	train-clean-360	He tottered wearily away in the direction of the Postage Department 
806_124221_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Jackson said mister Waller will you kindly take my place for a few minutes 
none	none	I must go round and see the Inward Bills about something 
806_124221_000014_000002	train-clean-360	I shall be back very soon 
806_124221_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Mike was becoming accustomed to deputizing for the cashier for short spaces of time 
806_124221_000015_000001	train-clean-360	It generally happened that he had to do so once or twice a day 
806_124221_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Strictly speaking perhaps mister Waller was wrong to leave such an important task as the actual cashing of cheques to an inexperienced person of Mike s standing but the New Asiatic Bank differed from most banks in that there was not a great deal of cross counter work 
806_124221_000015_000003	train-clean-360	People came in fairly frequently to cash cheques of two or three pounds but it was rare that any very large dealings took place 
806_124221_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Having completed his business with the Inward Bills mister Waller made his way back by a circuitous route taking in the Postage desk 
none	none	He found Psmith with a pale set face inscribing figures in a ledger The Old Etonian greeted him with the faint smile of a persecuted saint who is determined to be cheerful even at the stake Comrade Bristow he said Hullo Smithy said the other turning Psmith sadly directed mister Waller s attention to the waistcoat which was certainly definite in its colouring Nothing said Psmith I only wanted to look at you Funny ass said Bristow resuming his work Psmith glanced at mister Waller as who should say See what I have to put up with 
806_124221_000022_000002	train-clean-360	And yet I do not give way 
806_124221_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh er Smith said mister Waller when you were talking to Jackson just now 
none	none	Say no more said Psmith It shall not occur again 
806_124221_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Why should I dislocate the work of your department in my efforts to win a sympathetic word 
806_124221_000024_000003	train-clean-360	I will bear Comrade Bristow like a man here 
806_124221_000024_000004	train-clean-360	After all there are worse things at the Zoo 
none	none	No no said mister Waller hastily I did not mean that 
806_124221_000025_000001	train-clean-360	By all means pay us a visit now and then if it does not interfere with your own work 
806_124221_000025_000002	train-clean-360	But I noticed just now that you spoke to Bristow as Comrade Bristow 
none	none	It is too true said Psmith I must correct myself of the habit 
806_124221_000026_000001	train-clean-360	He will be getting above himself 
806_124221_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 And when you were speaking to Jackson you spoke of yourself as a Socialist 
none	none	Socialism is the passion of my life said Psmith 
806_124221_000029_000000	train-clean-360	mister Waller s face grew animated 
806_124221_000029_000001	train-clean-360	He stammered in his eagerness 
806_124221_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I am delighted he said 
none	none	Really I am delighted I also A fellow worker in the Cause said Psmith Er exactly Psmith extended his hand gravely 
806_124221_000033_000001	train-clean-360	mister Waller shook it with enthusiasm 
806_124221_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I have never liked to speak of it to anybody in the office said mister Waller but I too am heart and soul in the movement 
none	none	Yours for the Revolution said Psmith Just so Just so Exactly I was wondering the fact is I am in the habit of speaking on Sundays in the open air and
806_124221_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Hyde Park 
none	none	No No 
806_124221_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Clapham Common 
none	none	It is er handier for me where I live 
806_124221_000038_000004	train-clean-360	Now as you are interested in the movement I was thinking that perhaps you might care to come and hear me speak next Sunday 
806_124221_000038_000005	train-clean-360	Of course if you have nothing better to do 
none	none	I should like to excessively said Psmith Excellent 
806_124221_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Bring Jackson with you and both of you come to supper afterwards if you will 
806_124221_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Thanks very much 
806_124221_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps you would speak yourself 
none	none	No said Psmith No I think not My Socialism is rather of the practical sort 
806_124221_000043_000003	train-clean-360	I seldom speak 
806_124221_000043_000004	train-clean-360	But it would be a treat to listen to you 
none	none	What er what type of oratory is yours Oh well said mister Waller pulling nervously at his beard of course I 
806_124221_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Well I am perhaps a little bitter 
806_124221_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes yes 
806_124221_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 A little mordant and ironical 
none	none	You would be agreed Psmith
806_124221_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 I shall look forward to Sunday with every fibre quivering 
806_124221_000047_000002	train-clean-360	And Comrade Jackson shall be at my side 
806_124221_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Excellent said mister Waller 
none	none	I will go and tell him now fifteen Stirring Times on the Common The first thing to do said Psmith is to ascertain that such a place as Clapham Common really exists One has heard of it of course but has its existence ever been proved I think not Having accomplished that we must then try to find out how to get to it I should say at a venture that it would necessitate a sea voyage On the other hand Comrade Waller who is a native of the spot seems to find no difficulty in rolling to the office every morning Therefore you follow me Jackson it must be in England In that case we will take a taximeter cab and go out into the unknown hand in hand trusting to luck I expect you could get there by tram said Mike Psmith suppressed a slight shudder I fear Comrade Jackson he said that the old noblesse oblige traditions of the Psmiths would not allow me to do that No We will stroll gently after a light lunch to Trafalgar Square and hail a taxi Beastly expensive But with what an object Can any expenditure be called excessive which enables us to hear Comrade Waller being mordant and ironical at the other end It s a rum business said Mike I hope the dickens he won t mix us up in it We should look frightful fools I may possibly say a few words said Psmith carelessly if the spirit moves me Who am I that I should deny people a simple pleasure Mike looked alarmed Look here he said I say if you are going to play the goat for goodness sake don t go lugging me into it I ve got heaps of troubles without that Psmith waved the objection aside You he said will be one of the large and I hope interested audience Nothing more But it is quite possible that the spirit may not move me I may not feel inspired to speak I am not one of those who love speaking for speaking s sake If I have no message for the many headed I shall remain silent Then I hope the dickens you won t have said Mike Of all things he hated most being conspicuous before a crowd except at cricket which was a different thing and he had an uneasy feeling that Psmith would rather like it than otherwise We shall see said Psmith absently Of course if in the vein I might do something big in the way of oratory I am a plain blunt man but I feel convinced that given the opportunity I should haul up my slacks to some effect But well we shall see We shall see And with this ghastly state of doubt Mike had to be content It was with feelings of apprehension that he accompanied Psmith from the flat to Trafalgar Square in search of a cab which should convey them to Clapham Common They were to meet mister Waller at the edge of the Common nearest the old town of Clapham On the journey down Psmith was inclined to be debonnaire Mike on the other hand was silent and apprehensive He knew enough of Psmith to know that if half an opportunity were offered him he would extract entertainment from this affair after his own fashion and then the odds were that he himself would be dragged into it Perhaps his scalp bristled at the mere idea he would even be let in for a speech This grisly thought had hardly come into his head when Psmith spoke I m not half sure he said thoughtfully I sha n t call on you for a speech Comrade Jackson Look here Psmith began Mike agitatedly I don t know I think your solid incisive style would rather go down with the masses 
318_124224_000105_000009	train-clean-360	However we shall see 
none	none	we shall see Mike reached the Common in a state of nervous collapse mister Waller was waiting for them by the railings near the pond The apostle of the Revolution was clad soberly in black except for a tie of vivid crimson His eyes shone with the light of enthusiasm vastly different from the mild glow of amiability which they exhibited for six days in every week The man was transformed Here you are he said Here you are Excellent You are in good time Comrades Wotherspoon and Prebble have already begun to speak I shall commence now that you have come This is the way Over by these trees They made their way towards a small clump of trees near which a fair sized crowd had already begun to collect Evidently listening to the speakers was one of Clapham s fashionable Sunday amusements mister Waller talked and gesticulated incessantly as he walked Psmith s demeanour was perhaps a shade patronizing but he displayed interest Mike proceeded to the meeting with the air of an about to be washed dog He was loathing the whole business with a heartiness worthy of a better cause Somehow he felt he was going to be made to look a fool before the afternoon was over But he registered a vow that nothing should drag him on to the small platform which had been erected for the benefit of the speaker As they drew nearer the voices of Comrades Wotherspoon and Prebble became more audible They had been audible all the time very much so but now they grew in volume Comrade Wotherspoon was a tall thin man with side whiskers and a high voice He scattered his aitches as a fountain its sprays in a strong wind He was very earnest Comrade Prebble was earnest too Perhaps even more so than Comrade Wotherspoon He was handicapped to some extent however by not having a palate This gave to his profoundest thoughts a certain weirdness as if they had been uttered in an unknown tongue The crowd was thickest round his platform The grown up section plainly regarded him as a comedian pure and simple and roared with happy laughter when he urged them to march upon Park Lane and loot the same without mercy or scruple The children were more doubtful Several had broken down and been led away in tears When mister Waller got up to speak on platform number three his audience consisted at first only of Psmith Mike and a fox terrier Gradually however he attracted others After wavering for a while the crowd finally decided that he was worth hearing He had a method of his own Lacking the natural gifts which marked Comrade Prebble out as an entertainer he made up for this by his activity Where his colleagues stood comparatively still mister Waller behaved with the vivacity generally supposed to belong only to peas on shovels and cats on hot bricks He crouched to denounce the House of Lords He bounded from side to side while dissecting the methods of the plutocrats During an impassioned onslaught on the monarchical system he stood on one leg and hopped This was more the sort of thing the crowd had come to see Comrade Wotherspoon found himself deserted and even Comrade Prebble s shortcomings in the way of palate were insufficient to keep his flock together The entire strength of the audience gathered in front of the third platform Mike separated from Psmith by the movement of the crowd listened with a growing depression That feeling which attacks a sensitive person sometimes at the theatre when somebody is making himself ridiculous on the stage the illogical feeling that it is he and not the actor who is floundering had come over him in a wave He liked mister Waller and it made his gorge rise to see him exposing himself to the jeers of a crowd The fact that mister Waller himself did not know that they were jeers but mistook them for applause made it no better Mike felt vaguely furious His indignation began to take a more personal shape when the speaker branching off from the main subject of Socialism began to touch on temperance There was no particular reason why mister Waller should have introduced the subject of temperance except that he happened to be an enthusiast He linked it on to his remarks on Socialism by attributing the lethargy of the masses to their fondness for alcohol and the crowd which had been inclined rather to pat itself on the back during the assaults on Rank and Property finding itself assailed in its turn resented it They were there to listen to speakers telling them that they were the finest fellows on earth not pointing out their little failings to them The feeling of the meeting became hostile The jeers grew more frequent and less good tempered Comrade Waller means well said a voice in Mike s ear but if he shoots it at them like this much more there ll be a bit of an imbroglio Look here Smith said Mike quickly can t we stop him These chaps are getting fed up and they look bargees enough to do anything They ll be going for him or something soon How can we switch off the flow I don t see The man is wound up He means to get it off his chest if it snows I feel we are by way of being in the soup once more Comrade Jackson We can only sit tight and look on The crowd was becoming more threatening every minute A group of young men of the loafer class who stood near Mike were especially fertile in comment Psmith s eyes were on the speaker but Mike was watching this group closely Suddenly he saw one of them a thick set youth wearing a cloth cap and no collar stoop When he rose again there was a stone in his hand The sight acted on Mike like a spur Vague rage against nobody in particular had been simmering in him for half an hour Now it concentrated itself on the cloth capped one mister Waller paused momentarily before renewing his harangue The man in the cloth cap raised his hand There was a swirl in the crowd and the first thing that Psmith saw as he turned was Mike seizing the would be marksman round the neck and hurling him to the ground after the manner of a forward at football tackling an opponent during a line out from touch There is one thing which will always distract the attention of a crowd from any speaker and that is a dispute between two of its units mister Waller s views on temperance were forgotten in an instant The audience surged round Mike and his opponent The latter had scrambled to his feet now and was looking round for his assailant That s im Bill cried eager voices indicating Mike E s the bloke wot it yer Bill said others more precise in detail Bill advanced on Mike in a sidelong crab like manner Oo re you I should like to know said Bill Mike rightly holding that this was merely a rhetorical question and that Bill had no real thirst for information as to his family history made no reply Or rather the reply he made was not verbal He waited till his questioner was within range and then hit him in the eye A reply far more satisfactory if not to Bill himself at any rate to the interested onlookers than any flow of words A contented sigh went up from the crowd Their Sunday afternoon was going to be spent just as they considered Sunday afternoons should be spent Give us your coat said Psmith briskly and try and get it over quick Don t go in for any fancy sparring Switch it on all you know from the start I ll keep a thoughtful eye open to see that none of his friends and relations join in Outwardly Psmith was unruffled but inwardly he was not feeling so composed An ordinary turn up before an impartial crowd which could be relied upon to preserve the etiquette of these matters was one thing As regards the actual little dispute with the cloth capped Bill he felt that he could rely on Mike to handle it satisfactorily But there was no knowing how long the crowd would be content to remain mere spectators There was no doubt which way its sympathies lay Bill now stripped of his coat and sketching out in a hoarse voice a scenario of what he intended to do knocking Mike down and stamping him into the mud was one of the milder feats he promised to perform for the entertainment of an indulgent audience was plainly the popular favourite Psmith though he did not show it was more than a little apprehensive Mike having more to occupy his mind in the immediate present was not anxious concerning the future He had the great advantage over Psmith of having lost his temper Psmith could look on the situation as a whole and count the risks and possibilities Mike could only see Bill shuffling towards him with his head down and shoulders bunched Gow it Bill said someone Pliy up the Arsenal urged a voice on the outskirts of the crowd A chorus of encouragement from kind friends in front Step up Bill And Bill stepped sixteen 
807-124223-0000	train-other-500	Further Developments Bill surname unknown was not one of your ultra scientific fighters He did not favour the American crouch and the artistic feint He had a style wholly his own
none	none	 It seemed to have been modelled partly on a tortoise 
807-124223-0001	train-other-500	and partly on a windmill His head he appeared to be trying to conceal between his shoulders and he whirled his arms alternately in circular sweeps Mike on the other hand stood upright and hit straight
807-124223-0002	train-other-500	with the result that he hurt his knuckles very much on his opponent s skull without seeming to disturb the latter to any great extent In the process he received one of the windmill swings on the left ear
none	none	 The crowd strong pro Billites 
807-124223-0003	train-other-500	raised a cheer This maddened Mike
none	none	 He assumed the offensive 
807-124223-0004	train-other-500	Bill satisfied for the moment with his success had stepped back and was indulging in some fancy sparring when Mike sprang upon him like a panther They clinched and Mike who had got the under grip hurled Bill forcibly against a stout man who looked like a publican
807-124223-0005	train-other-500	The two fell in a heap Bill underneath At the same time Bill s friends joined in The first intimation Mike had of this was a violent blow across the shoulders with a walking stick Even if he had been wearing his overcoat the blow would have hurt
807-124223-0006	train-other-500	As he was in his jacket it hurt more than anything he had ever experienced in his life He leapt up with a yell but Psmith was there before him Mike saw his assailant lift the stick again and then collapse as the old Etonian s right took him under the chin
807-124223-0007	train-other-500	He darted to Psmith s side This is no place for us observed the latter sadly Shift ho I think Come on They dashed simultaneously for the spot where the crowd was thinnest The ring which had formed round Mike and Bill had broken up as the result of the intervention
807-124223-0008	train-other-500	of Bill s allies and at the spot for which they ran only two men were standing And these had apparently made up their minds that neutrality was the best policy for they made no movement to stop them Psmith and Mike charged through the gap and raced for the road
807-124223-0009	train-other-500	The suddenness of the move gave them just the start they needed Mike looked over his shoulder The crowd to a man seemed to be following Bill excavated from beneath the publican led the field Lying a good second came a band of three
807-124223-0010	train-other-500	and after them the rest in a bunch They reached the road in this order Some fifty yards down the road was a stationary tram In the ordinary course of things it would probably have moved on long before Psmith and Mike could have got to it
807-124223-0011	train-other-500	but the conductor a man with sporting blood in him seeing what appeared to be the finish of some Marathon Race refrained from giving the signal and moved out into the road to observe events more clearly at the same time calling to the driver who joined him
none	none	 Passengers on the roof stood up to get a good view 
807-124223-0012	train-other-500	There was some cheering Psmith and Mike reached the tram ten yards to the good and if it had been ready to start then all would have been well But Bill and his friends had arrived while the driver and conductor were both out in the road
807-124223-0013	train-other-500	The affair now began to resemble the doings of Horatius on the bridge Psmith and Mike turned to bay on the platform at the foot of the tram steps
none	none	 Bill leading by three yards sprang on to it grabbed Mike and fell with him on to the road 
807-124223-0014	train-other-500	Psmith descending with a dignity somewhat lessened by the fact that his hat was on the side of his head was in time to engage the runners up
none	none	 Psmith as pugilist lacked something of the calm majesty which characterized him in the more peaceful moments of life 
807-124223-0015	train-other-500	but he was undoubtedly effective Nature had given him an enormous reach and a lightness on his feet remarkable in one of his size and at some time in his career he appeared to have learned how to use his hands The first of the three runners the walking stick manipulator
807-124223-0016	train-other-500	had the misfortune to charge straight into the old Etonian s left It was a well timed blow and the force of it added to the speed at which the victim was running sent him on to the pavement where he spun round and sat down In the subsequent proceedings he took no part
none	none	 The other two attacked Psmith simultaneously 
807-124223-0017	train-other-500	one on each side In doing so the one on the left tripped over Mike and Bill
none	none	 who were still in the process of sorting themselves out 
807-124223-0018	train-other-500	and fell leaving Psmith free to attend to the other He was a tall weedy youth His conspicuous features were a long nose and a light yellow waistcoat Psmith hit him on the former with his left and on the latter with his right The long youth emitted a gurgle and collided with Bill
none	none	 who had wrenched himself free from Mike and staggered to his feet 
807-124223-0019	train-other-500	Bill having received a second blow in the eye during the course of his interview on the road with Mike was not feeling himself Mistaking the other for an enemy he proceeded to smite him in the parts about the jaw He had just upset him when a stern official voice observed Ere now
807-124223-0020	train-other-500	what s all this There is no more unfailing corrective to a scene of strife than the What s all this of the London policeman Bill abandoned his intention of stamping on the prostrate one and the latter sitting up blinked and was silent What s all this asked the policeman again
807-124223-0021	train-other-500	Psmith adjusting his hat at the correct angle again undertook the explanations A distressing scene officer he said A case of that unbridled brawling which is alas but too common in our London streets
none	none	 These two possibly till now the closest friends 
807-124223-0022	train-other-500	fall out over some point probably of the most trivial nature and what happens They brawl They He it me said the long youth dabbing at his face with a handkerchief
none	none	 and pointing an accusing finger at Psmith 
807-124223-0023	train-other-500	who regarded him through his eyeglass with a look in which pity and censure were nicely blended Bill meanwhile circling round restlessly in the apparent hope of getting past the Law and having another encounter with Mike
807-124223-0024	train-other-500	expressed himself in a stream of language which drew stern reproof from the shocked constable You op it concluded the man in blue That s what you do You op it I should said Psmith kindly
none	none	 The officer is speaking in your best interests 
807-124223-0025	train-other-500	A man of taste and discernment he knows what is best His advice is good and should be followed The constable seemed to notice Psmith for the first time He turned and stared at him Psmith s praise had not had the effect of softening him His look was one of suspicion
807-124223-0026	train-other-500	And what might you have been up to he inquired coldly This man says you hit him Psmith waved the matter aside Purely in self defence he said purely in self defence What else could the man of spirit do
807-124223-0027	train-other-500	A mere tap to discourage an aggressive movement The policeman stood silent weighing matters in the balance He produced a notebook and sucked his pencil
none	none	 Then he called the conductor of the tram as a witness 
807-124223-0028	train-other-500	A brainy and admirable step said Psmith approvingly This rugged honest man all unused to verbal subtleties shall give us his plain account of what happened After which as I presume this tram little as I know of the habits of trams
807-124223-0029	train-other-500	has got to go somewhere today I would suggest that we all separated and moved on He took two half crowns from his pocket and began to clink them meditatively together A slight softening of the frigidity of the constable s manner became noticeable
807-124223-0030	train-other-500	There was a milder beam in the eyes which gazed into Psmith s Nor did the conductor seem altogether uninfluenced by the sight
none	none	 The conductor deposed that he had bin on the point of pushing on 
807-124223-0031	train-other-500	seeing as how he d hung abart long enough when he see d
none	none	 them two gents the long un with the heye glass Psmith bowed and t other un a legging of it dahn the road towards him with the other blokes pelting after em 
807-124223-0032	train-other-500	He added that when they reached the trem the two gents had got aboard and was then set upon by the blokes
none	none	 And after that he concluded well there was a bit of a scrap 
807-124223-0033	train-other-500	and that s how it was Lucidly and excellently put said Psmith
none	none	 That is just how it was 
807-124223-0034	train-other-500	Comrade Jackson I fancy we leave the court without a stain on our characters We win through Er constable we have given you a great deal of trouble Possibly Thank you sir There was a musical clinking Now then all of you you op it
none	none	 You re all bin poking your noses in ere long enough Pop off 
807-124223-0035	train-other-500	Get on with that tram conductor Psmith and Mike settled themselves in a seat on the roof
none	none	 When the conductor came along Psmith gave him half a crown 
807-124223-0036	train-other-500	and asked after his wife and the little ones at home The conductor thanked goodness that he was a bachelor punched the tickets and retired Subject for a historical picture said Psmith Wounded leaving the field after the Battle of Clapham Common
807-124223-0037	train-other-500	How are your injuries Comrade Jackson My back s hurting like blazes said Mike And my ear s all sore where that chap got me Anything the matter with you Physically said Psmith no Spiritually much Do you realize Comrade Jackson the thing that has happened
none	none	 I am riding in a tram I Psmith have paid a penny for a ticket on a tram 
807-124223-0038	train-other-500	If this should get about the clubs I tell you Comrade Jackson no such crisis has ever occurred before in the course of my career You can always get off you know said Mike He thinks of everything said Psmith admiringly You have touched the spot with an unerring finger
807-124223-0039	train-other-500	Let us descend I observe in the distance a cab That looks to me more the sort of thing we want
none	none	 Let us go and parley with the driver seventeen 
807-124223-0040	train-other-500	Sunday Supper The cab took them back to the flat at considerable expense and Psmith requested Mike to make tea a performance in which he himself was interested purely as a spectator
none	none	 He had views on the subject of tea making which he liked to expound from an armchair or sofa 
807-124223-0041	train-other-500	but he never got further than this Mike his back throbbing dully from the blow he had received and feeling more than a little sore all over prepared the Etna fetched the milk and finally produced the finished article Psmith sipped meditatively
807-124223-0042	train-other-500	How pleasant he said after strife is rest We shouldn t have appreciated this simple cup of tea had our sensibilities remained unstirred this afternoon
none	none	 We can now sit at our ease like warriors after the fray till the time comes for setting out to Comrade Waller s once more 
807-124223-0043	train-other-500	Mike looked up What You don t mean to say you re going to sweat out to Clapham again Undoubtedly Comrade Waller is expecting us to supper What absolute rot We can t fag back there Noblesse oblige
807-124223-0044	train-other-500	The cry has gone round the Waller household Jackson and Psmith are coming to supper and we cannot disappoint them now Already the fatted blanc mange has been killed and the table creaks beneath what s left of the midday beef
none	none	 We must be there besides don t you want to see how the poor man is 
807-124223-0045	train-other-500	Probably we shall find him in the act of emitting his last breath
none	none	 I expect he was lynched by the enthusiastic mob 
807-124223-0046	train-other-500	Not much grinned Mike They were too busy with us All right
none	none	 I ll come if you really want me to 
807-124223-0047	train-other-500	but it s awful rot One of the many things Mike could never understand in Psmith was his fondness for getting into atmospheres that were not his own He would go out of his way to do this Mike like most boys of his age
807-124223-0048	train-other-500	was never really happy and at his ease except in the presence of those of his own years and class Psmith on the contrary seemed to be bored by them and infinitely preferred talking to somebody who lived in quite another world Mike was not a snob
807-124223-0049	train-other-500	He simply had not the ability to be at his ease with people in another class from his own He did not know what to talk to them about unless they were cricket professionals
none	none	 With them he was never at a loss 
807-124223-0050	train-other-500	But Psmith was different He could get on with anyone He seemed to have the gift of entering into their minds and seeing things from their point of view As regarded mister Waller Mike liked him personally and was prepared as we have seen
807-124223-0051	train-other-500	to undertake considerable risks in his defence but he loathed with all his heart and soul the idea of supper at his house He knew that he would have nothing to say Whereas Psmith gave him the impression of looking forward to the thing as a treat
none	none	 The house where mister Waller lived was one of a row of semi detached villas on the north side of the Common 
807-124223-0052	train-other-500	The door was opened to them by their host himself So far from looking battered and emitting last breaths he appeared particularly spruce He had just returned from Church and was still wearing his gloves and tall hat He squeaked with surprise when he saw who were standing on the mat
none	none	 Why dear me dear me he said Here you are I have been wondering what had happened to you I was afraid that you might have been seriously hurt 
807-124223-0053	train-other-500	I was afraid those ruffians might have injured you
none	none	 When last I saw you you were being 
807-124223-0054	train-other-500	Chivvied interposed Psmith with dignified melancholy
none	none	 Do not let us try to wrap the fact up in pleasant words 
807-124223-0055	train-other-500	We were being chivvied We were legging it with the infuriated mob at our heels An ignominious position for a Shropshire Psmith but after all Napoleon did the same But what happened I could not see
807-124223-0056	train-other-500	I only know that quite suddenly the people seemed to stop listening to me and all gathered round you and Jackson And then I saw that Jackson was engaged in a fight with a young man Comrade Jackson I imagine having heard a great deal about all men being equal was anxious to test the theory
807-124223-0057	train-other-500	and see whether Comrade Bill was as good a man as he was The experiment was broken off prematurely but I personally should be inclined to say that Comrade Jackson had a shade the better of the exchanges
807-124223-0058	train-other-500	mister Waller looked with interest at Mike who shuffled and felt awkward He was hoping that Psmith would say nothing about the reason of his engaging Bill in combat
none	none	 He had an uneasy feeling that mister Waller s gratitude 
807-124223-0059	train-other-500	would be effusive and overpowering and he did not wish to pose as the brave young hero There are moments when one does not feel equal to the role Fortunately before mister Waller had time to ask any further questions the supper bell sounded and they went into the dining room
807-124223-0060	train-other-500	Sunday supper unless done on a large and informal scale is probably the most depressing meal in existence There is a chill discomfort in the round of beef an icy severity about the open jam tart The blancmange shivers miserably
none	none	 Spirituous liquor helps to counteract the influence of these things 
807-124223-0061	train-other-500	and so does exhilarating conversation Unfortunately at mister Waller s table there was neither The cashier s views on temperance were not merely for the platform they extended to the home And the company was not of the exhilarating sort
none	none	 Besides Psmith and Mike and their host 
807-124223-0062	train-other-500	there were four people present Comrade Prebble the orator a young man of the name of Richards mister Waller s niece
none	none	 answering to the name of Ada 
807-124223-0063	train-other-500	who was engaged to mister Richards and Edward
none	none	 Edward was mister Waller s son 
807-124223-0064	train-other-500	He was ten years old wore a very tight Eton suit and had the peculiarly loathsome expression which a snub nose sometimes gives to the young It would have been plain to the most casual observer that mister Waller was fond and proud of his son
807-124223-0065	train-other-500	The cashier was a widower and after five minutes acquaintance with Edward Mike felt strongly that missus Waller was the lucky one Edward sat next to Mike and showed a tendency to concentrate his conversation on him
807-124223-0066	train-other-500	Psmith at the opposite end of the table beamed in a fatherly manner upon the pair through his eyeglass Mike got on with small girls reasonably well He preferred them at a distance but if cornered by them could put up a fairly good show Small boys however filled him with a sort of frozen horror
807-124223-0067	train-other-500	It was his view that a boy should not be exhibited publicly until he reached an age when he might be in the running for some sort of colours at a public school Edward was one of those well informed small boys He opened on Mike with the first mouthful
none	none	 Do you know the principal exports of Marseilles he inquired 
807-124223-0068	train-other-500	What said Mike coldly Do you know the principal exports of Marseilles I do Oh said Mike Yes Do you know the capital of Madagascar Mike as crimson as the beef he was attacking said he did not I do
807-124223-0069	train-other-500	Oh said Mike Who was the first king You mustn t worry mister Jackson Teddy
none	none	 said mister Waller with a touch of pride in his voice 
807-124223-0070	train-other-500	as who should say There are not many boys of his age I can tell you who could worry you with questions like that
none	none	 No no he likes it said Psmith unnecessarily He likes it I always hold that much may be learned by casual chit chat 
807-124223-0071	train-other-500	across the dinner table I owe much of my own grasp of I bet you don t know what s the capital of Madagascar interrupted Mike rudely I do said Edward I can tell you the kings of Israel he added turning to Mike
none	none	 He seemed to have no curiosity as to the extent of Psmith s knowledge 
807-124223-0072	train-other-500	Mike s appeared to fascinate him Mike helped himself to beetroot in moody silence His mouth was full when Comrade Prebble asked him a question
none	none	 Comrade Prebble as has been pointed out in an earlier part of the narrative 
807-124223-0073	train-other-500	was a good chap but had no roof to his mouth I beg your pardon said Mike Comrade Prebble repeated his observation Mike looked helplessly at Psmith but Psmith s eyes were on his plate Mike felt he must venture on some answer No he said decidedly
807-124223-0074	train-other-500	Comrade Prebble seemed slightly taken aback There was an awkward pause Then mister Waller for whom his fellow Socialist s methods of conversation held no mysteries interpreted The mustard Prebble Yes yes Would you mind passing Prebble the mustard mister Jackson
807-124223-0075	train-other-500	Oh sorry gasped Mike and reaching out upset the water jug into the open jam tart Through the black mist which rose before his eyes as he leaped to his feet and stammered apologies came the dispassionate voice of Master Edward Waller
807-124223-0076	train-other-500	reminding him that mustard was first introduced into Peru by Cortez His host was all courtesy and consideration He passed the matter off genially
none	none	 But life can never be quite the same after you have upset a water jug into an open jam tart 
807-124223-0077	train-other-500	at the table of a comparative stranger Mike s nerve had gone He ate on but he was a broken man At the other end of the table it became gradually apparent that things were not going on altogether as they should have done There was a sort of bleakness in the atmosphere
807-124223-0078	train-other-500	Young mister Richards was looking like a stuffed fish and the face of mister Waller s niece was cold and set Why come come Ada said mister Waller breezily
none	none	 what s the matter You re eating nothing 
807-124223-0079	train-other-500	What s George been saying to you he added jocularly
none	none	 Thank you uncle Robert replied Ada precisely 
807-124223-0080	train-other-500	there s nothing the matter Nothing that mister Richards can say to me can upset me mister Richards echoed mister Waller in astonishment How was he to know that during the walk back from church the world had been transformed George had become mister Richards and all was over
807-124223-0081	train-other-500	I assure you Ada began that unfortunate young man Ada turned a frigid shoulder towards him Come come said mister Waller disturbed What s all this What s all this His niece burst into tears and left the room
none	none	 If there is anything more embarrassing to a guest than a family row 
807-124223-0082	train-other-500	we have yet to hear of it Mike scarlet to the extreme edges of his ears concentrated himself on his plate Comrade Prebble made a great many remarks which were probably illuminating if they could have been understood mister Waller looked astonished at mister Richards
807-124223-0083	train-other-500	mister Richards pink but dogged loosened his collar but said nothing Psmith leaning forward asked Master Edward Waller his opinion on the Licensing Bill We happened to have a word or two said mister Richards at length
807-124223-0084	train-other-500	on the way home from church on the subject of Women s Suffrage That fatal topic murmured Psmith In Australia began Master Edward Waller I was rayther well rayther facetious about it continued mister Richards Psmith clicked his tongue sympathetically
none	none	 In Australia said Edward 
807-124223-0085	train-other-500	I went talking on laughing and joking when all of a sudden she flew out at me
none	none	 How was I to know she was eart and soul in the movement You never told me he added accusingly to his host In Australia said Edward I ll go and try and get her round How was I to know mister Richards thrust back his chair and bounded from the room Now iawinyaw iear oiler said Comrade Prebble judicially but was interrupted 
807-124223-0086	train-other-500	How very disturbing said mister Waller
none	none	 I am so sorry that this should have happened Ada is such a touchy sensitive girl 
807-124223-0087	train-other-500	She In Australia said Edward in even tones they ve got Women s Suffrage already Did you know that he said to Mike Mike made no answer His eyes were fixed on his plate A bead of perspiration began to roll down his forehead
807-124223-0088	train-other-500	If his feelings could have been ascertained at that moment
none	none	 they would have been summed up in the words 
807-124223-0089	train-other-500	Death where is thy sting
none	none	 eighteen 
807-124223-0090	train-other-500	Psmith Makes a Discovery Women said Psmith helping himself to trifle and speaking with the air of one launched upon his special subject are one must recollect like
none	none	 like er well in fact just so 
807-124223-0091	train-other-500	Passing on lightly from that conclusion let us turn for a moment to the Rights of Property in connection with which Comrade Prebble and yourself had so much that was interesting to say this afternoon
none	none	 Perhaps you 
807-124223-0092	train-other-500	he bowed in Comrade Prebble s direction
none	none	 would resume for the benefit of Comrade Jackson a novice in the Cause 
807-124223-0093	train-other-500	but earnest your very lucid Comrade Prebble beamed and took the floor Mike began to realize that till now he had never known what boredom meant There had been moments in his life which had been less interesting than other moments
807-124223-0094	train-other-500	but nothing to touch this for agony Comrade Prebble s address streamed on like water rushing over a weir Every now and then there was a word or two which was recognizable but this happened so rarely that it amounted to little
807-124223-0095	train-other-500	Sometimes mister Waller would interject a remark but not often He seemed to be of the opinion that Comrade Prebble s was the master mind and that to add anything to his views would be in the nature of painting the lily and gilding the refined gold Mike himself said nothing
807-124223-0096	train-other-500	Psmith and Edward were equally silent The former sat like one in a trance thinking his own thoughts while Edward who prospecting on the sideboard
none	none	 had located a rich biscuit mine was too occupied for speech 
807-124223-0097	train-other-500	After about twenty minutes during which Mike s discomfort changed to a dull resignation mister Waller suggested a move to the drawing room where Ada he said would play some hymns The prospect did not dazzle Mike but any change he thought must be for the better
none	none	 He had sat staring at the ruin of the blancmange so long 
807-124223-0098	train-other-500	that it had begun to hypnotize him Also the move had the excellent result of eliminating the snub nosed Edward who was sent to bed His last words were in the form of a question addressed to Mike on the subject of the hypotenuse and the square upon the same
none	none	 A remarkably intelligent boy said Psmith You must let him come to tea 
807-124223-0099	train-other-500	at our flat one day I may not be in myself I have many duties which keep me away but Comrade Jackson is sure to be there and will be delighted to chat with him On the way upstairs Mike tried to get Psmith to himself for a moment to suggest the advisability of an early departure
807-124223-0100	train-other-500	but Psmith was in close conversation with his host Mike was left to Comrade Prebble who apparently had only touched the fringe of his subject in his lecture in the dining room When mister Waller had predicted hymns in the drawing room he had been too sanguine or too pessimistic
807-124223-0101	train-other-500	Of Ada when they arrived there were no signs It seemed that she had gone straight to bed Young mister Richards was sitting on the sofa moodily turning the leaves of a photograph album which contained portraits of Master Edward Waller in geometrically progressing degrees of repulsiveness
807-124223-0102	train-other-500	here in frocks looking like a gargoyle there in sailor suit looking like nothing on earth The inspection of these was obviously deepening mister Richards gloom but he proceeded doggedly with it Comrade Prebble backed the reluctant Mike into a corner
807-124223-0103	train-other-500	and like the Ancient Mariner held him with a glittering eye Psmith and mister Waller in the opposite corner were looking at something with their heads close together Mike definitely abandoned all hope of a rescue from Psmith and tried to buoy himself up with the reflection
807-124223-0104	train-other-500	that this could not last for ever Hours seemed to pass and then at last he heard Psmith s voice saying good bye to his host He sprang to his feet Comrade Prebble was in the middle of a sentence but this was no time for polished courtesy
807-124223-0105	train-other-500	He felt that he must get away and at once I fear Psmith was saying that we must tear ourselves away We have greatly enjoyed our evening You must look us up at our flat one day and bring Comrade Prebble If I am not in Comrade Jackson is certain to be
807-124223-0106	train-other-500	and he will be more than delighted to hear Comrade Prebble speak further on the subject of which he is such a master Comrade Prebble was understood to say that he would certainly come mister Waller beamed mister Richards still steeped in gloom shook hands in silence
807-124223-0107	train-other-500	Out in the road with the front door shut behind them Mike spoke his mind Look here Smith he said definitely
none	none	 if being your confidential secretary and adviser is going to let me in for any more of that sort of thing 
807-124223-0108	train-other-500	you can jolly well accept my resignation
none	none	 The orgy was not to your taste said Psmith sympathetically 
807-124223-0109	train-other-500	Mike laughed One of those short hollow bitter laughs I am at a loss Comrade Jackson said Psmith to understand your attitude You fed sumptuously You had fun with the crockery that knockabout act of yours with the water jug was alone worth the money
807-124223-0110	train-other-500	and you had the advantage of listening to the views of a master of his subject What more do you want What on earth did you land me with that man Prebble for Land you Why you courted his society I had practically to drag you away from him
807-124223-0111	train-other-500	When I got up to say good bye you were listening to him with bulging eyes
none	none	 I never saw such a picture of rapt attention 
807-124223-0112	train-other-500	Do you mean to tell me Comrade Jackson that your appearance belied you that you were not interested Well well How we misread our fellow creatures
none	none	 I think you might have come and lent a hand with Prebble 
807-124223-0113	train-other-500	It was a bit thick I was too absorbed with Comrade Waller We were talking of things of vital moment However the night is yet young We will take this cab wend our way to the West seek a cafe and cheer ourselves with light refreshments
807-124223-0114	train-other-500	Arrived at a cafe whose window appeared to be a sort of museum of every kind of German sausage they took possession of a vacant table and ordered coffee Mike soon found himself soothed by his bright surroundings and gradually his impressions of blancmange
807-124223-0115	train-other-500	Edward and Comrade Prebble faded from his mind Psmith meanwhile was preserving an unusual silence being deep in a large square book of the sort in which Press cuttings are pasted As Psmith scanned its contents a curious smile lit up his face
807-124223-0116	train-other-500	His reflections seemed to be of an agreeable nature Hullo said Mike
none	none	 what have you got hold of there 
807-124223-0117	train-other-500	Where did you get that Comrade Waller very kindly lent it to me He showed it to me after supper knowing how enthusiastically I was attached to the Cause Had you been less tensely wrapped up in Comrade Prebble s conversation
none	none	 I would have desired you to step across and join us 
807-124223-0118	train-other-500	However you now have your opportunity
none	none	 But what is it asked Mike 
807-124223-0119	train-other-500	It is the record of the meetings of the Tulse Hill Parliament said Psmith impressively A faithful record of all they said all the votes of confidence they passed in the Government and also all the nasty knocks they gave it from time to time What on earth s the Tulse Hill Parliament
807-124223-0120	train-other-500	It is alas said Psmith in a grave sad voice no more In life it was beautiful but now it has done the Tom Bowling act It has gone aloft We are dealing Comrade Jackson not with the live vivid present but with the far off rusty past
807-124223-0121	train-other-500	And yet in a way there is a touch of the live vivid present mixed up in it I don t know what the dickens you re talking about said Mike Let s have a look anyway Psmith handed him the volume and leaning back sipped his coffee and watched him
807-124223-0122	train-other-500	At first Mike s face was bored and blank but suddenly an interested look came into it Aha said Psmith Who s Bickersdyke Anything to do with our Bickersdyke No other than our genial friend himself Mike turned the pages reading a line or two on each
none	none	 Hullo he said chuckling 
807-124223-0123	train-other-500	He lets himself go a bit doesn t he He does acknowledged Psmith A fiery passionate nature that of Comrade Bickersdyke He s simply cursing the Government here Giving them frightful beans Psmith nodded I noticed the fact myself But what s it all about
807-124223-0124	train-other-500	As far as I can glean from Comrade Waller said Psmith about twenty years ago when he and Comrade Bickersdyke worked hand in hand as fellow clerks at the New Asiatic they were both members of the Tulse Hill Parliament that powerful institution
807-124223-0125	train-other-500	At that time Comrade Bickersdyke was as fruity a Socialist as Comrade Waller is now Only apparently as he began to get on a bit in the world he altered his views to some extent as regards the iniquity of freezing on to a decent share of the doubloons
807-124223-0126	train-other-500	And that you see is where the dim and rusty past begins to get mixed up with the live vivid present If any tactless person were to publish those very able speeches made by Comrade Bickersdyke when a bulwark of the Tulse Hill Parliament
807-124223-0127	train-other-500	our revered chief would be more or less caught bending if I may employ the expression as regards his chances of getting in as Unionist candidate at Kenningford
none	none	 You follow me Watson I rather fancy the light hearted electors of Kenningford 
807-124223-0128	train-other-500	from what I have seen of their rather acute sense of humour
none	none	 would be as it were all over it It would be very very trying for Comrade Bickersdyke if these speeches of his were to get about 
807-124223-0129	train-other-500	You aren t going to I shall do nothing rashly I shall merely place this handsome volume among my treasured books I shall add it to my Books that have helped me series Because I fancy that in an emergency it may not be at all a bad thing to have about me
none	none	 And now he concluded as the hour is getting late perhaps we had better be shoving off for home nineteen The Illness of Edward Life in a bank is at its pleasantest in the winter 
318_124224_000001_000001	train-clean-360	When all the world outside is dark and damp and cold the light and warmth of the place are comforting 
318_124224_000001_000002	train-clean-360	There is a pleasant air of solidity about the interior of a bank 
318_124224_000001_000003	train-clean-360	The green shaded lamps look cosy 
318_124224_000001_000004	train-clean-360	And the outside world offering so few attractions the worker perched on his stool feels that he is not so badly off after all 
none	none	It is when the days are long and the sun beats hot on the pavement and everything shouts to him how splendid it is out in the country that he begins to grow restless 
318_124224_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Mike except for a fortnight at the beginning of his career in the New Asiatic Bank had not had to stand the test of sunshine 
318_124224_000002_000001	train-clean-360	At present the weather being cold and dismal he was almost entirely contented Now that he had got into the swing of his work the days passed very quickly and with his life after office hours he had no fault to find at all 
318_124224_000003_000000	train-clean-360	His life was very regular 
none	none	He would arrive in the morning just in time to sign his name in the attendance book before it was removed to the accountant s room 
318_124224_000003_000002	train-clean-360	That was at ten o clock 
318_124224_000003_000003	train-clean-360	From ten to eleven he would potter 
none	none	There was nothing going on at that time in his department and mister Waller seemed to take it for granted that he should stroll off to the Postage Department and talk to Psmith who had generally some fresh grievance against the ring wearing Bristow to air 
318_124224_000003_000005	train-clean-360	From eleven to half past twelve he would put in a little gentle work 
none	none	Lunch unless there was a rush of business or mister Waller happened to suffer from a spasm of conscientiousness could be spun out from half past twelve to two 
318_124224_000003_000007	train-clean-360	More work from two till half past three 
318_124224_000003_000008	train-clean-360	From half past three till half past four tea in the tearoom with a novel 
318_124224_000003_000009	train-clean-360	And from half past four till five either a little more work or more pottering according to whether there was any work to do or not 
none	none	It was by no means an unpleasant mode of spending a late January day 
318_124224_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Then there was no doubt that it was an interesting little community that of the New Asiatic Bank 
none	none	The curiously amateurish nature of the institution lent a certain air of light heartedness to the place It was not like one of those banks whose London office is their main office where stern business is everything and a man becomes a mere machine for getting through a certain amount of routine work 
318_124224_000004_000003	train-clean-360	The employees of the New Asiatic Bank having plenty of time on their hands were able to retain their individuality 
318_124224_000004_000004	train-clean-360	They had leisure to think of other things besides their work 
318_124224_000004_000005	train-clean-360	Indeed they had so much leisure that it is a wonder they thought of their work at all 
318_124224_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The place was full of quaint characters 
318_124224_000005_000001	train-clean-360	There was West who had been requested to leave Haileybury owing to his habit of borrowing horses and attending meets in the neighbourhood the same being always out of bounds and necessitating a complete disregard of the rules respecting evening chapel and lock up 
318_124224_000005_000002	train-clean-360	He was a small dried up youth with black hair plastered down on his head 
318_124224_000005_000003	train-clean-360	He went about his duties in a costume which suggested the sportsman of the comic papers 
318_124224_000006_000000	train-clean-360	There was also Hignett who added to the meagre salary allowed him by the bank by singing comic songs at the minor music halls 
318_124224_000006_000001	train-clean-360	He confided to Mike his intention of leaving the bank as soon as he had made a name and taking seriously to the business 
318_124224_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He told him that he had knocked them at the Bedford the week before and in support of the statement showed him a cutting from the Era in which the writer said that Other acceptable turns were the Bounding Zouaves Steingruber s Dogs and Arthur Hignett Mike wished him luck 
none	none	And there was Raymond who dabbled in journalism and was the author of Straight Talks to Housewives in Trifles under the pseudonym of Lady Gussie Wragge who believed that the earth was flat and addressed meetings on the subject in Hyde Park on Sundays and many others all interesting to talk to of a morning when work was slack and time had to be filled in 
318_124224_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Mike found himself by degrees growing quite attached to the New Asiatic Bank 
none	none	One morning early in February he noticed a curious change in mister Waller The head of the Cash Department was as a rule mildly cheerful on arrival and apt excessively Mike thought though he always listened with polite interest to relate the most recent sayings and doings of his snub nosed son Edward 
318_124224_000009_000002	train-clean-360	No action of this young prodigy was withheld from Mike 
none	none	He had heard on different occasions how he had won a prize at his school for General Information which Mike could well believe how he had trapped young mister Richards now happily reconciled to Ada with an ingenious verbal catch and how he had made a sequence of diverting puns on the name of the new curate during the course of that cleric s first Sunday afternoon visit 
318_124224_000010_000000	train-clean-360	On this particular day however the cashier was silent and absent minded 
none	none	He answered Mike s good morning mechanically and sitting down at his desk stared blankly across the building There was a curiously grey tired look on his face 
318_124224_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Mike could not make it out 
318_124224_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He did not like to ask if there was anything the matter 
318_124224_000011_000002	train-clean-360	mister Waller s face had the unreasonable effect on him of making him feel shy and awkward 
none	none	Anything in the nature of sorrow always dried Mike up and robbed him of the power of speech Being naturally sympathetic he had raged inwardly in many a crisis at this devil of dumb awkwardness which possessed him and prevented him from putting his sympathy into words 
318_124224_000011_000004	train-clean-360	He had always envied the cooing readiness of the hero on the stage when anyone was in trouble 
none	none	He wondered whether he would ever acquire that knack of pouring out a limpid stream of soothing words on such occasions At present he could get no farther than a scowl and an almost offensive gruffness The happy thought struck him of consulting Psmith 
318_124224_000012_000001	train-clean-360	It was his hour for pottering so he pottered round to the Postage Department where he found the old Etonian eyeing with disfavour a new satin tie which Bristow was wearing that morning for the first time 
none	none	I say Smith he said I want to speak to you for a second Psmith rose 
318_124224_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Mike led the way to a quiet corner of the Telegrams Department 
none	none	I tell you Comrade Jackson said Psmith I am hard pressed 
318_124224_000015_000001	train-clean-360	The fight is beginning to be too much for me 
none	none	After a grim struggle after days of unremitting toil I succeeded yesterday in inducing the man Bristow to abandon that rainbow waistcoat of his Today I enter the building blythe and buoyant worn of course from the long struggle but seeing with aching eyes the dawn of another better era and there is Comrade Bristow in a satin tie 
318_124224_000015_000004	train-clean-360	It s hard Comrade Jackson it s hard I tell you 
318_124224_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Look here Smith said Mike I wish you d go round to the Cash and find out what s up with old Waller 
318_124224_000016_000001	train-clean-360	He s got the hump about something He s sitting there looking absolutely fed up with things 
318_124224_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I hope there s nothing up 
318_124224_000016_000003	train-clean-360	He s not a bad sort 
none	none	It would be rot if anything rotten s happened Psmith began to display a gentle interest
318_124224_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 So other people have troubles as well as myself he murmured musingly 
none	none	I had almost forgotten that Comrade Waller s misfortunes cannot but be trivial compared with mine but possibly it will be as well to ascertain their nature 
318_124224_000018_000003	train-clean-360	I will reel round and make inquiries 
318_124224_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Good man said Mike 
none	none	I ll wait here Psmith departed and returned ten minutes later looking more serious than when he had left
318_124224_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 His kid s ill poor chap he said briefly 
318_124224_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 Pretty badly too from what I can gather 
318_124224_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Pneumonia 
318_124224_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Waller was up all night 
318_124224_000021_000004	train-clean-360	He oughtn t to be here at all today 
none	none	He doesn t know what he s doing half the time He s absolutely fagged out 
318_124224_000021_000006	train-clean-360	Look here you d better nip back and do as much of the work as you can 
318_124224_000021_000007	train-clean-360	I shouldn t talk to him much if I were you 
318_124224_000021_000008	train-clean-360	Buck along 
none	none	Mike went 
318_124224_000022_000001	train-clean-360	mister Waller was still sitting staring out across the aisle There was something more than a little gruesome in the sight of him 
318_124224_000022_000002	train-clean-360	He wore a crushed beaten look as if all the life and fight had gone out of him 
318_124224_000022_000003	train-clean-360	A customer came to the desk to cash a cheque 
none	none	The cashier shovelled the money to him under the bars with the air of one whose mind is elsewhere 
318_124224_000022_000005	train-clean-360	Mike could guess what he was feeling and what he was thinking about 
none	none	The fact that the snub nosed Edward was without exception the most repulsive small boy he had ever met in this world where repulsive small boys crowd and jostle one another did not interfere with his appreciation of the cashier s state of mind Mike s was essentially a sympathetic character He had the gift of intuitive understanding where people of whom he was fond were concerned 
318_124224_000022_000009	train-clean-360	It was this which drew to him those who had intelligence enough to see beyond his sometimes rather forbidding manner and to realize that his blunt speech was largely due to shyness 
318_124224_000022_000010	train-clean-360	In spite of his prejudice against Edward he could put himself into mister Waller s place and see the thing from his point of view 
318_124224_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Psmith s injunction to him not to talk much was unnecessary 
318_124224_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Mike as always was rendered utterly dumb by the sight of suffering 
318_124224_000023_000002	train-clean-360	He sat at his desk occupying himself as best he could with the driblets of work which came to him 
none	none	mister Waller s silence and absentness continued unchanged 
318_124224_000024_000001	train-clean-360	The habit of years had made his work mechanical 
318_124224_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Probably few of the customers who came to cash cheques suspected that there was anything the matter with the man who paid them their money 
318_124224_000024_000003	train-clean-360	After all most people look on the cashier of a bank as a sort of human slot machine 
none	none	You put in your cheque and out comes money 
318_124224_000024_000005	train-clean-360	It is no affair of yours whether life is treating the machine well or ill that day 
318_124224_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The hours dragged slowly by till five o clock struck and the cashier putting on his coat and hat passed silently out through the swing doors 
318_124224_000025_000001	train-clean-360	He walked listlessly 
318_124224_000025_000002	train-clean-360	He was evidently tired out 
none	none	Mike shut his ledger with a vicious bang and went across to find Psmith He was glad the day was over twenty Concerning a Cheque 
318_124224_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Things never happen quite as one expects them to 
318_124224_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Mike came to the office next morning prepared for a repetition of the previous day 
318_124224_000028_000002	train-clean-360	He was amazed to find the cashier not merely cheerful but even exuberantly cheerful 
none	none	Edward it appeared had rallied in the afternoon and when his father had got home had been out of danger He was now going along excellently and had stumped Ada who was nursing him with a question about the Thirty Years War only a few minutes before his father had left to catch his train 
318_124224_000028_000004	train-clean-360	The cashier was overflowing with happiness and goodwill towards his species 
none	none	He greeted customers with bright remarks on the weather and snappy views on the leading events of the day the former tinged with optimism the latter full of a gentle spirit of toleration 
318_124224_000028_000006	train-clean-360	His attitude towards the latest actions of His Majesty s Government was that of one who felt that after all there was probably some good even in the vilest of his fellow creatures if one could only find it 
none	none	Altogether the cloud had lifted from the Cash Department 
318_124224_000029_000001	train-clean-360	All was joy jollity and song 
none	none	The attitude of Comrade Waller said Psmith on being informed of the change is reassuring 
318_124224_000030_000001	train-clean-360	I may now think of my own troubles 
318_124224_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Comrade Bristow has blown into the office today in patent leather boots with white kid uppers as I believe the technical term is 
none	none	Add to that the fact that he is still wearing the satin tie the waistcoat and the ring and you will understand why I have definitely decided this morning to abandon all hope of his reform 
318_124224_000030_000004	train-clean-360	Henceforth my services for what they are worth are at the disposal of Comrade Bickersdyke 
318_124224_000030_000005	train-clean-360	My time from now onward is his 
318_124224_000030_000006	train-clean-360	He shall have the full educative value of my exclusive attention 
none	none	I give Comrade Bristow up 
318_124224_000030_000008	train-clean-360	Made straight for the corner flag you understand he added as mister Rossiter emerged from his lair and centred and Sandy Turnbull headed a beautiful goal 
318_124224_000030_000009	train-clean-360	I was just telling Jackson about the match against Blackburn Rovers he said to mister Rossiter 
none	none	Just so just so 
318_124224_000031_000001	train-clean-360	But get on with your work Smith 
none	none	We are a little behind hand 
318_124224_000031_000003	train-clean-360	I think perhaps it would be as well not to leave it just yet 
none	none	I will leap at it at once said Psmith cordially Mike went back to his department 
318_124224_000034_000000	train-clean-360	The day passed quickly 
318_124224_000034_000001	train-clean-360	mister Waller in the intervals of work talked a good deal mostly of Edward his doings his sayings and his prospects 
none	none	The only thing that seemed to worry mister Waller was the problem of how to employ his son s almost superhuman talents to the best advantage 
318_124224_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Most of the goals towards which the average man strives struck him as too unambitious for the prodigy 
318_124224_000035_000000	train-clean-360	By the end of the day Mike had had enough of Edward 
none	none	He never wished to hear the name again 
318_124224_000036_000000	train-clean-360	We do not claim originality for the statement that things never happen quite as one expects them to 
318_124224_000036_000001	train-clean-360	We repeat it now because of its profound truth 
318_124224_000036_000002	train-clean-360	The Edward s pneumonia episode having ended satisfactorily or rather being apparently certain to end satisfactorily for the invalid though out of danger was still in bed Mike looked forward to a series of days unbroken by any but the minor troubles of life 
318_124224_000036_000003	train-clean-360	For these he was prepared 
318_124224_000036_000004	train-clean-360	What he did not expect was any big calamity 
none	none	At the beginning of the day there were no signs of it 
318_124224_000037_000001	train-clean-360	The sky was blue and free from all suggestions of approaching thunderbolts 
318_124224_000037_000002	train-clean-360	mister Waller still chirpy had nothing but good news of Edward 
318_124224_000037_000003	train-clean-360	Mike went for his morning stroll round the office feeling that things had settled down and had made up their mind to run smoothly 
318_124224_000038_000000	train-clean-360	When he got back barely half an hour later the storm had burst 
318_124224_000039_000000	train-clean-360	There was no one in the department at the moment of his arrival but a few minutes later he saw mister Waller come out of the manager s room and make his way down the aisle 
none	none	It was his walk which first gave any hint that something was wrong 
318_124224_000040_000001	train-clean-360	It was the same limp crushed walk which Mike had seen when Edward s safety still hung in the balance 
none	none	As mister Waller came nearer Mike saw that the cashier s face was deadly pale 
318_124224_000042_000000	train-clean-360	mister Waller caught sight of him and quickened his pace 
none	none	Jackson he said 
318_124224_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Mike came forward 
none	none	Do you remember he spoke slowly and with an effort do you remember a cheque coming through the day before yesterday for a hundred pounds with Sir John Morrison s signature Yes 
318_124224_000046_000001	train-clean-360	It came in the morning rather late 
318_124224_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Mike remembered the cheque perfectly well owing to the amount 
318_124224_000047_000001	train-clean-360	It was the only three figure cheque which had come across the counter during the day 
none	none	It had been presented just before the cashier had gone out to lunch 
318_124224_000047_000003	train-clean-360	He recollected the man who had presented it a tallish man with a beard 
none	none	He had noticed him particularly because of the contrast between his manner and that of the cashier 
318_124224_000047_000005	train-clean-360	The former had been so very cheery and breezy the latter so dazed and silent 
318_124224_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Why he said 
318_124224_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 It was a forgery muttered mister Waller sitting down heavily 
318_124224_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 a forgery 
none	none	muttered mister Waller sitting down heavily 
318_124224_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Mike could not take it in all at once 
318_124224_000050_000001	train-clean-360	He was stunned 
318_124224_000050_000002	train-clean-360	All he could understand was that a far worse thing had happened than anything he could have imagined 
318_124224_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 A forgery he said 
none	none	A forgery 
318_124224_000052_000001	train-clean-360	And a clumsy one 
318_124224_000052_000002	train-clean-360	Oh it s hard 
318_124224_000052_000003	train-clean-360	I should have seen it on any other day but that 
318_124224_000052_000004	train-clean-360	I could not have missed it 
none	none	They showed me the cheque in there just now 
318_124224_000052_000006	train-clean-360	I could not believe that I had passed it 
318_124224_000052_000007	train-clean-360	I don t remember doing it 
318_124224_000052_000008	train-clean-360	My mind was far away 
318_124224_000052_000009	train-clean-360	I don t remember the cheque or anything about it 
318_124224_000052_000010	train-clean-360	Yet there it is 
318_124224_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Once more Mike was tongue tied 
318_124224_000053_000001	train-clean-360	For the life of him he could not think of anything to say 
none	none	Surely he thought he could find something in the shape of words to show his sympathy 
318_124224_000053_000003	train-clean-360	But he could find nothing that would not sound horribly stilted and cold 
318_124224_000053_000004	train-clean-360	He sat silent 
none	none	Sir John is in there went on the cashier He is furious mister Bickersdyke too 
318_124224_000054_000003	train-clean-360	They are both furious 
318_124224_000054_000004	train-clean-360	I shall be dismissed 
318_124224_000055_000003	train-clean-360	I shall be dismissed 
318_124224_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall lose my place 
318_124224_000054_000005	train-clean-360	I shall lose my place 
318_124224_000054_000006	train-clean-360	I shall be dismissed He was talking more to himself than to Mike 
318_124224_000054_000007	train-clean-360	It was dreadful to see him sitting there all limp and broken 
none	none	I shall lose my place 
318_124224_000055_000001	train-clean-360	mister Bickersdyke has wanted to get rid of me for a long time 
318_124224_000055_000002	train-clean-360	He never liked me 
none	none	I shall be dismissed 
318_124224_000055_000004	train-clean-360	What can I do I m an old man 
318_124224_000055_000005	train-clean-360	I can t make another start 
318_124224_000055_000006	train-clean-360	I am good for nothing Nobody will take an old man like me 
318_124224_000056_000000	train-clean-360	His voice died away 
none	none	There was a silence 
318_124224_000056_000002	train-clean-360	Mike sat staring miserably in front of him 
318_124224_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Then quite suddenly an idea came to him 
318_124224_000057_000001	train-clean-360	The whole pressure of the atmosphere seemed to lift 
318_124224_000057_000002	train-clean-360	He saw a way out 
318_124224_000057_000003	train-clean-360	It was a curious crooked way but at that moment it stretched clear and broad before him 
none	none	He felt lighthearted and excited as if he were watching the development of some interesting play at the theatre 
318_124224_000058_000000	train-clean-360	He got up smiling 
318_124224_000059_000000	train-clean-360	The cashier did not notice the movement 
318_124224_000059_000001	train-clean-360	Somebody had come in to cash a cheque and he was working mechanically 
none	none	Mike walked up the aisle to mister Bickersdyke s room and went in 
318_124224_000061_000000	train-clean-360	The manager was in his chair at the big table 
318_124224_000061_000001	train-clean-360	Opposite him facing slightly sideways was a small round very red faced man 
318_124224_000061_000002	train-clean-360	mister Bickersdyke was speaking as Mike entered 
318_124224_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 I can assure you Sir John he was saying 
318_124224_000063_000000	train-clean-360	He looked up as the door opened 
318_124224_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Well mister Jackson 
318_124224_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Mike almost laughed 
none	none	The situation was tickling him
318_124224_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Waller has told me he began 
318_124224_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 I have already seen mister Waller 
none	none	I know 
318_124224_000068_000001	train-clean-360	He told me about the cheque 
318_124224_000068_000002	train-clean-360	I came to explain 
none	none	Explain Yes 
318_124224_000070_000001	train-clean-360	He didn t cash it at all 
318_124224_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t understand you mister Jackson 
none	none	I was at the counter when it was brought in said Mike I cashed it twenty one Psmith Makes Inquiries Psmith as was his habit of a morning when the fierce rush of his commercial duties had abated somewhat was leaning gracefully against his desk musing on many things when he was aware that Bristow was standing before him 
318_124224_000075_000000	train-clean-360	Focusing his attention with some reluctance upon this blot on the horizon he discovered that the exploiter of rainbow waistcoats and satin ties was addressing him 
none	none	I say Smithy said Bristow 
318_124224_000076_000001	train-clean-360	He spoke in rather an awed voice 
none	none	Say on Comrade Bristow said Psmith graciously
318_124224_000077_000001	train-clean-360	 You have our ear You would seem to have something on your chest in addition to that Neapolitan ice garment which I regret to see you still flaunt 
318_124224_000077_000002	train-clean-360	If it is one tithe as painful as that you have my sympathy 
318_124224_000077_000003	train-clean-360	Jerk it out Comrade Bristow 
318_124224_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Jackson isn t half copping it from old Bick 
none	none	Isn t 
318_124224_000079_000001	train-clean-360	What exactly did you say 
318_124224_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 He s getting it hot on the carpet 
none	none	You wish to indicate said Psmith that there is some slight disturbance some passing breeze between Comrades Jackson and Bickersdyke 
318_124224_000082_000000	train-clean-360	Bristow chuckled 
none	none	Breeze 
318_124224_000083_000001	train-clean-360	Blooming hurricane more like it 
318_124224_000083_000002	train-clean-360	I was in Bick s room just now with a letter to sign and I tell you the fur was flying all over the bally shop 
318_124224_000083_000003	train-clean-360	There was old Bick cursing for all he was worth and a little red faced buffer puffing out his cheeks in an armchair 
none	none	We all have our hobbies said Psmith
318_124224_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Jackson wasn t saying much 
318_124224_000085_000001	train-clean-360	He jolly well hadn t a chance 
318_124224_000085_000002	train-clean-360	Old Bick was shooting it out fourteen to the dozen 
none	none	I have been privileged said Psmith to hear Comrade Bickersdyke speak both in his sanctum and in public 
318_124224_000086_000001	train-clean-360	He has as you suggest a ready flow of speech 
318_124224_000086_000002	train-clean-360	What exactly was the cause of the turmoil 
318_124224_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 I couldn t wait to hear 
318_124224_000087_000001	train-clean-360	I was too jolly glad to get away 
318_124224_000087_000002	train-clean-360	Old Bick looked at me as if he could eat me snatched the letter out of my hand signed it and waved his hand at the door as a hint to hop it 
318_124224_000087_000003	train-clean-360	Which I jolly well did 
318_124224_000087_000004	train-clean-360	He had started jawing Jackson again before I was out of the room 
none	none	While applauding his hustle said Psmith I fear that I must take official notice of this 
318_124224_000088_000001	train-clean-360	Comrade Jackson is essentially a Sensitive Plant highly strung neurotic 
318_124224_000088_000002	train-clean-360	I cannot have his nervous system jolted and disorganized in this manner and his value as a confidential secretary and adviser impaired even though it be only temporarily 
318_124224_000088_000003	train-clean-360	I must look into this 
318_124224_000088_000004	train-clean-360	I will go and see if the orgy is concluded 
318_124224_000088_000005	train-clean-360	I will hear what Comrade Jackson has to say on the matter 
318_124224_000088_000006	train-clean-360	I shall not act rashly Comrade Bristow 
318_124224_000088_000007	train-clean-360	If the man Bickersdyke is proved to have had good grounds for his outbreak he shall escape uncensured 
318_124224_000088_000008	train-clean-360	I may even look in on him and throw him a word of praise 
318_124224_000088_000009	train-clean-360	But if I find as I suspect that he has wronged Comrade Jackson I shall be forced to speak sharply to him 
none	none	Mike had left the scene of battle by the time Psmith reached the Cash Department and was sitting at his desk in a somewhat dazed condition trying to clear his mind sufficiently to enable him to see exactly how matters stood as concerned himself 
318_124224_000089_000001	train-clean-360	He felt confused and rattled 
none	none	He had known when he went to the manager s room to make his statement that there would be trouble 
318_124224_000089_000003	train-clean-360	But then trouble is such an elastic word 
none	none	It embraces a hundred degrees of meaning 
318_124224_000089_000005	train-clean-360	Mike had expected sentence of dismissal and he had got it 
none	none	So far he had nothing to complain of 
318_124224_000089_000007	train-clean-360	But he had not expected it to come to him riding high on the crest of a great frothing wave of verbal denunciation 
none	none	mister Bickersdyke through constantly speaking in public had developed the habit of fluent denunciation to a remarkable extent 
318_124224_000089_000009	train-clean-360	He had thundered at Mike as if Mike had been his Majesty s Government or the Encroaching Alien or something of that sort 
318_124224_000089_000010	train-clean-360	And that kind of thing is a little overwhelming at short range 
318_124224_000089_000011	train-clean-360	Mike s head was still spinning 
318_124224_000090_000000	train-clean-360	It continued to spin but he never lost sight of the fact round which it revolved namely that he had been dismissed from the service of the bank 
318_124224_000090_000001	train-clean-360	And for the first time he began to wonder what they would say about this at home 
318_124224_000091_000000	train-clean-360	Up till now the matter had seemed entirely a personal one 
none	none	He had charged in to rescue the harassed cashier in precisely the same way as that in which he had dashed in to save him from Bill the Stone Flinging Scourge of Clapham Common 
318_124224_000091_000002	train-clean-360	Mike s was one of those direct honest minds which are apt to concentrate themselves on the crisis of the moment and to leave the consequences out of the question entirely 
none	none	What would they say at home 
318_124224_000092_000001	train-clean-360	That was the point 
318_124224_000093_000000	train-clean-360	Again what could he do by way of earning a living 
318_124224_000093_000001	train-clean-360	He did not know much about the City and its ways but he knew enough to understand that summary dismissal from a bank is not the best recommendation one can put forward in applying for another job 
318_124224_000093_000002	train-clean-360	And if he did not get another job in the City what could he do 
318_124224_000093_000003	train-clean-360	If it were only summer he might get taken on somewhere as a cricket professional 
318_124224_000093_000004	train-clean-360	Cricket was his line 
318_124224_000093_000005	train-clean-360	He could earn his pay at that 
none	none	But it was very far from being summer He had turned the problem over in his mind till his head ached and had eaten in the process one third of a wooden penholder when Psmith arrived It has reached me said Psmith that you and Comrade Bickersdyke have been seen doing the Hackenschmidt Gotch act on the floor 
318_124224_000095_000001	train-clean-360	When my informant left he tells me Comrade B had got a half Nelson on you and was biting pieces out of your ear 
318_124224_000095_000002	train-clean-360	Is this so 
none	none	Mike got up Psmith was the man he felt to advise him in this crisis Psmith s was the mind to grapple with his Hard Case
318_124224_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 Look here Smith he said I want to speak to you 
318_124224_000097_000001	train-clean-360	I m in a bit of a hole and perhaps you can tell me what to do 
none	none	Let s go out and have a cup of coffee shall we 
318_124224_000097_000003	train-clean-360	I can t tell you about it here 
none	none	An admirable suggestion said Psmith Things in the Postage Department are tolerably quiescent at present 
318_124224_000098_000001	train-clean-360	Naturally I shall be missed if I go out 
318_124224_000098_000002	train-clean-360	But my absence will not spell irretrievable ruin as it would at a period of greater commercial activity 
318_124224_000098_000003	train-clean-360	Comrades Rossiter and Bristow have studied my methods 
318_124224_000098_000004	train-clean-360	They know how I like things to be done 
318_124224_000098_000005	train-clean-360	They are fully competent to conduct the business of the department in my absence 
318_124224_000098_000006	train-clean-360	Let us as you say scud forth 
318_124224_000098_000007	train-clean-360	We will go to a Mecca 
318_124224_000098_000008	train-clean-360	Why so called I do not know nor indeed do I ever hope to know 
none	none	There we may obtain at a price a passable cup of coffee and you shall tell me your painful story 
318_124224_000099_000000	train-clean-360	The Mecca except for the curious aroma which pervades all Meccas was deserted 
none	none	Psmith moving a box of dominoes on to the next table sat down
318_124224_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 Dominoes he said is one of the few manly sports which have never had great attractions for me 
318_124224_000100_000001	train-clean-360	A cousin of mine who secured his chess blue at Oxford would they tell me have represented his University in the dominoes match also had he not unfortunately dislocated the radius bone of his bazooka while training for it 
none	none	Except for him there has been little dominoes talent in the Psmith family Let us merely talk What of this slight brass rag parting to which I alluded just now 
318_124224_000100_000004	train-clean-360	Tell me all 
318_124224_000101_000000	train-clean-360	He listened gravely while Mike related the incidents which had led up to his confession and the results of the same 
318_124224_000101_000001	train-clean-360	At the conclusion of the narrative he sipped his coffee in silence for a moment 
318_124224_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 This habit of taking on to your shoulders the harvest of other people s bloomers he said meditatively is growing upon you Comrade Jackson 
318_124224_000102_000001	train-clean-360	You must check it 
none	none	It is like dram drinking You begin in a small way by breaking school rules to extract Comrade Jellicoe perhaps the supremest of all the blitherers I have ever met from a hole 
318_124224_000102_000004	train-clean-360	If you had stopped there all might have been well 
318_124224_000102_000005	train-clean-360	But the thing once started fascinated you 
none	none	Now you have landed yourself with a splash in the very centre of the Oxo in order to do a good turn to Comrade Waller You must drop it Comrade Jackson 
318_124224_000102_000008	train-clean-360	When you were free and without ties it did not so much matter 
none	none	But now that you are confidential secretary and adviser to a Shropshire Psmith the thing must stop 
318_124224_000102_000010	train-clean-360	Your secretarial duties must be paramount 
318_124224_000102_000011	train-clean-360	Nothing must be allowed to interfere with them 
none	none	Yes 
318_124224_000102_000013	train-clean-360	The thing must stop before it goes too far 
318_124224_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 It seems to me said Mike that it has gone too far 
318_124224_000103_000001	train-clean-360	I ve got the sack 
318_124224_000103_000002	train-clean-360	I don t know how much farther you want it to go 
none	none	Psmith stirred his coffee before replying True he said things look perhaps a shade rocky just now but all is not yet lost 
318_124224_000105_000001	train-clean-360	You must recollect that Comrade Bickersdyke spoke in the heat of the moment 
318_124224_000105_000002	train-clean-360	That generous temperament was stirred to its depths 
318_124224_000105_000003	train-clean-360	He did not pick his words 
318_124224_000105_000004	train-clean-360	But calm will succeed storm and we may be able to do something yet 
318_124224_000105_000005	train-clean-360	I have some little influence with Comrade Bickersdyke 
none	none	Wrongly perhaps added Psmith modestly he thinks somewhat highly of my judgement 
318_124224_000105_000007	train-clean-360	If he sees that I am opposed to this step he may possibly reconsider it 
none	none	What Psmith thinks today is his motto I shall think tomorrow However we shall see
318_124224_000106_000000	train-clean-360	 I bet we shall said Mike ruefully 
none	none	There is moreover continued Psmith another aspect to the affair When you were being put through it in Comrade Bickersdyke s inimitably breezy manner Sir John What s his name was I am given to understand present 
318_124224_000107_000001	train-clean-360	Naturally to pacify the aggrieved bart Comrade B had to lay it on regardless of expense 
318_124224_000107_000002	train-clean-360	In America as possibly you are aware there is a regular post of mistake clerk whose duty it is to receive in the neck anything that happens to be coming along when customers make complaints 
318_124224_000107_000003	train-clean-360	He is hauled into the presence of the foaming customer cursed and sacked 
none	none	The customer goes away appeased The mistake clerk if the harangue has been unusually energetic applies for a rise of salary 
318_124224_000107_000006	train-clean-360	Now possibly in your case 
318_124224_000108_000000	train-clean-360	 In my case interrupted Mike there was none of that rot Bickersdyke wasn t putting it on 
318_124224_000108_000001	train-clean-360	He meant every word 
none	none	Why dash it all you know yourself he d be only too glad to sack me just to get some of his own back with me Psmith s eyes opened in pained surprise
318_124224_000110_000000	train-clean-360	 Get some of his own back he repeated 
none	none	Are you insinuating Comrade Jackson that my relations with Comrade Bickersdyke are not of the most pleasant and agreeable nature possible How do these ideas get about 
318_124224_000111_000001	train-clean-360	I yield to nobody in my respect for our manager 
none	none	I may have had occasion from time to time to correct him in some trifling matter but surely he is not the man to let such a thing rankle No 
318_124224_000111_000004	train-clean-360	I prefer to think that Comrade Bickersdyke regards me as his friend and well wisher and will lend a courteous ear to any proposal I see fit to make 
none	none	I hope shortly to be able to prove this to you I will discuss this little affair of the cheque with him at our ease at the club and I shall be surprised if we do not come to some arrangement Look here Smith said Mike earnestly for goodness sake don t go playing the goat There s no earthly need for you to get lugged into this business Don t you worry about me I shall be all right I think said Psmith that you will when I have chatted with Comrade Bickersdyke twenty two And Take Steps On returning to the bank Mike found mister Waller in the grip of a peculiarly varied set of mixed feelings Shortly after Mike s departure for the Mecca the cashier had been summoned once more into the Presence and had there been informed that as apparently he had not been directly responsible for the gross piece of carelessness by which the bank had suffered so considerable a loss here Sir John puffed out his cheeks like a meditative toad the matter as far as he was concerned was at an end On the other hand Here mister Waller was hauled over the coals for Incredible Rashness in allowing a mere junior subordinate to handle important tasks like the paying out of money and so on till he felt raw all over However it was not dismissal That was the great thing And his principal sensation was one of relief Mingled with the relief were sympathy for Mike gratitude to him for having given himself up so promptly and a curiously dazed sensation as if somebody had been hitting him on the head with a bolster All of which emotions taken simultaneously had the effect of rendering him completely dumb when he saw Mike He felt that he did not know what to say to him And as Mike for his part simply wanted to be let alone and not compelled to talk conversation was at something of a standstill in the Cash Department After five minutes it occurred to mister Waller that perhaps the best plan would be to interview Psmith Psmith would know exactly how matters stood He could not ask Mike point blank whether he had been dismissed But there was the probability that Psmith had been informed and would pass on the information Psmith received the cashier with a dignified kindliness Oh er Smith said mister Waller I wanted just to ask you about Jackson Psmith bowed his head gravely Exactly he said Comrade Jackson I think I may say that you have come to the right man Comrade Jackson has placed himself in my hands and I am dealing with his case A somewhat tricky business but I shall see him through Has he mister Waller hesitated You were saying said Psmith Does mister Bickersdyke intend to dismiss him At present admitted Psmith there is some idea of that description floating nebulously as it were in Comrade Bickersdyke s mind Indeed from what I gather from my client the push was actually administered in so many words But tush And possibly bah we know what happens on these occasions do we not You and I are students of human nature and we know that a man of Comrade Bickersdyke s warm hearted type is apt to say in the heat of the moment a great deal more than he really means Men of his impulsive character cannot help expressing themselves in times of stress with a certain generous strength which those who do not understand them are inclined to take a little too seriously I shall have a chat with Comrade Bickersdyke at the conclusion of the day s work and I have no doubt that we shall both laugh heartily over this little episode mister Waller pulled at his beard with an expression on his face that seemed to suggest that he was not quite so confident on this point He was about to put his doubts into words when mister Rossiter appeared and Psmith murmuring something about duty turned again to his ledger The cashier drifted back to his own department It was one of Psmith s theories of Life which he was accustomed to propound to Mike in the small hours of the morning with his feet on the mantelpiece that the secret of success lay in taking advantage of one s occasional slices of luck in seizing as it were the happy moment When Mike who had had the passage to write out ten times at Wrykyn on one occasion as an imposition reminded him that Shakespeare had once said something about there being a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood c Psmith had acknowledged with an easy grace that possibly Shakespeare had got on to it first and that it was but one more proof of how often great minds thought alike Though waiving his claim to the copyright of the maxim he nevertheless had a high opinion of it and frequently acted upon it in the conduct of his own life Thus when approaching the Senior Conservative Club at five o clock with the idea of finding mister Bickersdyke there he observed his quarry entering the Turkish Baths which stand some twenty yards from the club s front door he acted on his maxim and decided instead of waiting for the manager to finish his bath before approaching him on the subject of Mike to corner him in the Baths themselves He gave mister Bickersdyke five minutes start Then reckoning that by that time he would probably have settled down he pushed open the door and went in himself And having paid his money and left his boots with the boy at the threshold he was rewarded by the sight of the manager emerging from a box at the far end of the room clad in the mottled towels which the bather irrespective of his personal taste in dress is obliged to wear in a Turkish bath Psmith made for the same box mister Bickersdyke s clothes lay at the head of one of the sofas but nobody else had staked out a claim Psmith took possession of the sofa next to the manager s Then humming lightly he undressed and made his way downstairs to the Hot Rooms He rather fancied himself in towels There was something about them which seemed to suit his figure They gave him he though rather a debonnaire look He paused for a moment before the looking glass to examine himself with approval then pushed open the door of the Hot Rooms and went in twenty three mister Bickersdyke Makes a Concession mister Bickersdyke was reclining in an easy chair in the first room staring before him in the boiled fish manner customary in a Turkish Bath Psmith dropped into the next seat with a cheery Good evening The manager started as if some firm hand had driven a bradawl into him He looked at Psmith with what was intended to be a dignified stare But dignity is hard to achieve in a couple of parti coloured towels The stare did not differ to any great extent from the conventional boiled fish look alluded to above Psmith settled himself comfortably in his chair Fancy finding you here he said pleasantly We seem always to be meeting To me he added with a reassuring smile it is a great pleasure A very great pleasure indeed We see too little of each other during office hours Not that one must grumble at that Work before everything You have your duties I mine It is merely unfortunate that those duties are not such as to enable us to toil side by side encouraging each other with word and gesture However it is idle to repine We must make the most of these chance meetings when the work of the day is over mister Bickersdyke heaved himself up from his chair and took another at the opposite end of the room Psmith joined him There s something pleasantly mysterious to my mind said he chattily in a Turkish Bath It seems to take one out of the hurry and bustle of the everyday world It is a quiet backwater in the rushing river of Life I like to sit and think in a Turkish Bath Except of course when I have a congenial companion to talk to As now To me mister Bickersdyke rose and went into the next room To me continued Psmith again following and seating himself beside the manager there is too something eerie in these places There is a certain sinister air about the attendants They glide rather than walk They say little Who knows what they may be planning and plotting That drip drip again It may be merely water but how are we to know that it is not blood It would be so easy to do away with a man in a Turkish Bath Nobody has seen him come in Nobody can trace him if he disappears These are uncomfortable thoughts mister Bickersdyke mister Bickersdyke seemed to think them so He rose again and returned to the first room I have made you restless said Psmith in a voice of self reproach when he had settled himself once more by the manager s side I am sorry I will not pursue the subject Indeed I believe that my fears are unnecessary Statistics show I understand that large numbers of men emerge in safety every year from Turkish Baths There was another matter of which I wished to speak to you It is a somewhat delicate matter and I am only encouraged to mention it to you by the fact that you are so close a friend of my father s mister Bickersdyke had picked up an early edition of an evening paper left on the table at his side by a previous bather and was to all appearances engrossed in it Psmith however not discouraged proceeded to touch upon the matter of Mike There was he said some little friction I hear in the office today in connection with a cheque The evening paper hid the manager s expressive face but from the fact that the hands holding it tightened their grip Psmith deduced that mister Bickersdyke s attention was not wholly concentrated on the City news Moreover his toes wriggled And when a man s toes wriggle he is interested in what you are saying All these petty breezes continued Psmith sympathetically must be very trying to a man in your position a man who wishes to be left alone in order to devote his entire thought to the niceties of the higher Finance It is as if Napoleon while planning out some intricate scheme of campaign were to be called upon in the midst of his meditations to bully a private for not cleaning his buttons Naturally you were annoyed Your giant brain wrenched temporarily from its proper groove expended its force in one tremendous reprimand of Comrade Jackson It was as if one had diverted some terrific electric current which should have been controlling a vast system of machinery and turned it on to annihilate a black beetle In the present case of course the result is as might have been expected Comrade Jackson not realizing the position of affairs went away with the absurd idea that all was over that you meant all you said briefly that his number was up I assured him that he was mistaken but no He persisted in declaring that all was over that you had dismissed him from the bank mister Bickersdyke lowered the paper and glared bulbously at the old Etonian mister Jackson is perfectly right he snapped Of course I dismissed him Yes yes said Psmith I have no doubt that at the moment you did work the rapid push What I am endeavouring to point out is that Comrade Jackson is under the impression that the edict is permanent that he can hope for no reprieve Nor can he You don t mean I mean what I say Ah I quite understand said Psmith as one who sees that he must make allowances The incident is too recent The storm has not yet had time to expend itself You have not had leisure to think the matter over coolly It is hard of course to be cool in a Turkish Bath Your ganglions are still vibrating Later perhaps Once and for all growled mister Bickersdyke the thing is ended mister Jackson will leave the bank at the end of the month We have no room for fools in the office You surprise me said Psmith I should not have thought that the standard of intelligence in the bank was extremely high With the exception of our two selves I think that there are hardly any men of real intelligence on the staff And comrade Jackson is improving every day Being as he is under my constant supervision he is rapidly developing a stranglehold on his duties which I have no wish to discuss the matter any further No no Quite so quite so Not another word I am dumb There are limits you see to the uses of impertinence mister Smith Psmith started You are not suggesting You do not mean that I I have no more to say I shall be glad if you will allow me to read my paper Psmith waved a damp hand I should be the last man he said stiffly to force my conversation on another I was under the impression that you enjoyed these little chats as keenly as I did If I was wrong He relapsed into a wounded silence mister Bickersdyke resumed his perusal of the evening paper and presently laying it down rose and made his way to the room where muscular attendants were in waiting to perform that blend of Jiu Jitsu and Catch as catch can which is the most valuable and at the same time most painful part of a Turkish Bath It was not till he was resting on his sofa swathed from head to foot in a sheet and smoking a cigarette that he realized that Psmith was sharing his compartment He made the unpleasant discovery just as he had finished his first cigarette and lighted his second He was blowing out the match when Psmith accompanied by an attendant appeared in the doorway and proceeded to occupy the next sofa to himself All that feeling of dreamy peace which is the reward one receives for allowing oneself to be melted like wax and kneaded like bread left him instantly He felt hot and annoyed To escape was out of the question Once one has been scientifically wrapped up by the attendant and placed on one s sofa one is a fixture He lay scowling at the ceiling resolved to combat all attempt at conversation with a stony silence Psmith however did not seem to desire conversation He lay on his sofa motionless for a quarter of an hour then reached out for a large book which lay on the table and began to read When he did speak he seemed to be speaking to himself Every now and then he would murmur a few words sometimes a single name In spite of himself mister Bickersdyke found himself listening At first the murmurs conveyed nothing to him Then suddenly a name caught his ear Strowther was the name and somehow it suggested something to him He could not say precisely what It seemed to touch some chord of memory He knew no one of the name of Strowther He was sure of that And yet it was curiously familiar An unusual name too He could not help feeling that at one time he must have known it quite well mister Strowther murmured Psmith said that the honorable gentleman s remarks would have been nothing short of treason if they had not been so obviously the mere babblings of an irresponsible lunatic Cries of Order order and a voice Sit down fat head For just one moment mister Bickersdyke s memory poised motionless like a hawk about to swoop Then it darted at the mark Everything came to him in a flash The hands of the clock whizzed back He was no longer mister John Bickersdyke manager of the London branch of the New Asiatic Bank lying on a sofa in the Cumberland Street Turkish Baths He was Jack Bickersdyke clerk in the employ of Messrs Norton and Biggleswade standing on a chair and shouting Order order in the Masonic Room of the Red Lion at Tulse Hill while the members of the Tulse Hill Parliament divided into two camps yelled at one another and young Tom Barlow in his official capacity as Mister Speaker waved his arms dumbly and banged the table with his mallet in his efforts to restore calm He remembered the whole affair as if it had happened yesterday It had been a speech of his own which had called forth the above expression of opinion from Strowther He remembered Strowther now a pale spectacled clerk in Baxter and Abrahams an inveterate upholder of the throne the House of Lords and all constituted authority Strowther had objected to the socialistic sentiments of his speech in connection with the Budget and there had been a disturbance unparalleled even in the Tulse Hill Parliament where disturbances were frequent and loud Psmith looked across at him with a bright smile They report you verbatim he said And rightly A more able speech I have seldom read I like the bit where you call the Royal Family blood suckers Even then it seems you knew how to express yourself fluently and well mister Bickersdyke sat up The hands of the clock had moved again and he was back in what Psmith had called the live vivid present What have you got there he demanded It is a record said Psmith of the meeting of an institution called the Tulse Hill Parliament A bright chatty little institution too if one may judge by these reports You in particular if I may say so appear to have let yourself go with refreshing vim Your political views have changed a great deal since those days have they not It is extremely interesting A most fascinating study for political students When I send these speeches of yours to the Clarion mister Bickersdyke bounded on his sofa What he cried I was saying said Psmith that the Clarion will probably make a most interesting comparison between these speeches and those you have been making at Kenningford I I I forbid you to make any mention of these speeches Psmith hesitated It would be great fun seeing what the papers said he protested Great fun It is true mused Psmith that in a measure it would dish you at the election From what I saw of those light hearted lads at Kenningford the other night I should say they would be so amused that they would only just have enough strength left to stagger to the poll and vote for your opponent mister Bickersdyke broke out into a cold perspiration I forbid you to send those speeches to the papers he cried Psmith reflected You see he said at last it is like this The departure of Comrade Jackson my confidential secretary and adviser is certain to plunge me into a state of the deepest gloom The only way I can see at present by which I can ensure even a momentary lightening of the inky cloud is the sending of these speeches to some bright paper like the Clarion I feel certain that their comments would wring at any rate a sad sweet smile from me Possibly even a hearty laugh I must therefore look on these very able speeches of yours in something of the light of an antidote They will stand between me and black depression Without them I am in the cart With them I may possibly buoy myself up mister Bickersdyke shifted uneasily on his sofa He glared at the floor Then he eyed the ceiling as if it were a personal enemy of his Finally he looked at Psmith Psmith s eyes were closed in peaceful meditation Very well said he at last Jackson shall stop Psmith came out of his thoughts with a start You were observing he said I shall not dismiss Jackson said mister Bickersdyke Psmith smiled winningly Just as I had hoped he said Your very justifiable anger melts before reflection The storm subsides and you are at leisure to examine the matter dispassionately Doubts begin to creep in Possibly you say to yourself I have been too hasty too harsh Justice must be tempered with mercy I have caught Comrade Jackson bending you add still to yourself but shall I press home my advantage too ruthlessly No you cry I will abstain And I applaud your action I like to see this spirit of gentle toleration It is bracing and comforting As for these excellent speeches he added I shall of course no longer have any need of their consolation I can lay them aside The sunlight can now enter and illumine my life through more ordinary channels The cry goes round Psmith is himself again mister Bickersdyke said nothing Unless a snort of fury may be counted as anything twenty four The Spirit of Unrest During the following fortnight two things happened which materially altered Mike s position in the bank The first was that mister Bickersdyke was elected a member of Parliament He got in by a small majority amidst scenes of disorder of a nature unusual even in Kenningford Psmith who went down on the polling day to inspect the revels and came back with his hat smashed in reported that as far as he could see the electors of Kenningford seemed to be in just that state of happy intoxication which might make them vote for mister Bickersdyke by mistake Also it had been discovered on the eve of the poll that the bank manager s opponent in his youth had been educated at a school in Germany and had subsequently spent two years at Heidelberg University These damaging revelations were having a marked effect on the warm hearted patriots of Kenningford who were now referring to the candidate in thick but earnest tones as the German Spy So that taking everything into consideration said Psmith summing up I fancy that Comrade Bickersdyke is home And the papers next day proved that he was right A hundred and fifty seven said Psmith as he read his paper at breakfast Not what one would call a slashing victory It is fortunate for Comrade Bickersdyke I think that I did not send those very able speeches of his to the Clarion Till now Mike had been completely at a loss to understand why the manager had sent for him on the morning following the scene about the cheque and informed him that he had reconsidered his decision to dismiss him Mike could not help feeling that there was more in the matter than met the eye mister Bickersdyke had not spoken as if it gave him any pleasure to reprieve him On the contrary his manner was distinctly brusque Mike was thoroughly puzzled To Psmith s statement that he had talked the matter over quietly with the manager and brought things to a satisfactory conclusion he had paid little attention But now he began to see light Great Scott Smith he said did you tell him you d send those speeches to the papers if he sacked me Psmith looked at him through his eye glass and helped himself to another piece of toast I am unable he said to recall at this moment the exact terms of the very pleasant conversation I had with Comrade Bickersdyke on the occasion of our chance meeting in the Turkish Bath that afternoon but thinking things over quietly now that I have more leisure I cannot help feeling that he may possibly have read some such intention into my words You know how it is in these little chats Comrade Jackson One leaps to conclusions Some casual word I happened to drop may have given him the idea you mention At this distance of time it is impossible to say with any certainty Suffice it that all has ended well He did reconsider his resolve I shall be only too happy if it turns out that the seed of the alteration in his views was sown by some careless word of mine Perhaps we shall never know Mike was beginning to mumble some awkward words of thanks when Psmith resumed his discourse Be that as it may however he said we cannot but perceive that Comrade Bickersdyke s election has altered our position to some extent As you have pointed out he may have been influenced in this recent affair by some chance remark of mine about those speeches Now however they will cease to be of any value Now that he is elected he has nothing to lose by their publication I mention this by way of indicating that it is possible that if another painful episode occurs he may be more ruthless I see what you mean said Mike If he catches me on the hop again he ll simply go ahead and sack me That said Psmith is more or less the position of affairs The other event which altered Mike s life in the bank was his removal from mister Waller s department to the Fixed Deposits The work in the Fixed Deposits was less pleasant and mister Gregory the head of the department was not of mister Waller s type mister Gregory before joining the home staff of the New Asiatic Bank had spent a number of years with a firm in the Far East where he had acquired a liver and a habit of addressing those under him in a way that suggested the mate of a tramp steamer Even on the days when his liver was not troubling him he was truculent And when as usually happened it did trouble him he was a perfect fountain of abuse Mike and he hated each other from the first The work in the Fixed Deposits was not really difficult when you got the hang of it but there was a certain amount of confusion in it to a beginner and Mike in commercial matters was as raw a beginner as ever began In the two other departments through which he had passed he had done tolerably well As regarded his work in the Postage Department stamping letters and taking them down to the post office was just about his form It was the sort of work on which he could really get a grip And in the Cash Department mister Waller s mild patience had helped him through But with mister Gregory it was different Mike hated being shouted at It confused him And mister Gregory invariably shouted He always spoke as if he were competing against a high wind With Mike he shouted more than usual On his side it must be admitted that Mike was something out of the common run of bank clerks The whole system of banking was a horrid mystery to him He did not understand why things were done or how the various departments depended on and dove tailed into one another Each department seemed to him something separate and distinct Why they were all in the same building at all he never really gathered He knew that it could not be purely from motives of sociability in order that the clerks might have each other s company during slack spells That much he suspected but beyond that he was vague It naturally followed that after having grown little by little under mister Waller s easy going rule to enjoy life in the bank he now suffered a reaction Within a day of his arrival in the Fixed Deposits he was loathing the place as earnestly as he had loathed it on the first morning Psmith who had taken his place in the Cash Department reported that mister Waller was inconsolable at his loss I do my best to cheer him up he said and he smiles bravely every now and then But when he thinks I am not looking his head droops and that wistful expression comes into his face The sunshine has gone out of his life It had just come into Mike s and more than anything else was making him restless and discontented That is to say it was now late spring the sun shone cheerfully on the City and cricket was in the air And that was the trouble In the dark days when everything was fog and slush Mike had been contented enough to spend his mornings and afternoons in the bank and go about with Psmith at night Under such conditions London is the best place in which to be and the warmth and light of the bank were pleasant But now things had changed The place had become a prison With all the energy of one who had been born and bred in the country Mike hated having to stay indoors on days when all the air was full of approaching summer There were mornings when it was almost more than he could do to push open the swing doors and go out of the fresh air into the stuffy atmosphere of the bank The days passed slowly and the cricket season began Instead of being a relief this made matters worse The little cricket he could get only made him want more It was as if a starving man had been given a handful of wafer biscuits If the summer had been wet he might have been less restless But as it happened it was unusually fine After a week of cold weather at the beginning of May a hot spell set in May passed in a blaze of sunshine Large scores were made all over the country Mike s name had been down for the M C C for some years and he had become a member during his last season at Wrykyn Once or twice a week he managed to get up to Lord s for half an hour s practice at the nets and on Saturdays the bank had matches in which he generally managed to knock the cover off rather ordinary club bowling But it was not enough for him June came and with it more sunshine The atmosphere of the bank seemed more oppressive than ever twenty five At the Telephone If one looks closely into those actions which are apparently due to sudden impulse one generally finds that the sudden impulse was merely the last of a long series of events which led up to the action Alone it would not have been powerful enough to effect anything But coming after the way has been paved for it it is irresistible The hooligan who bonnets a policeman is apparently the victim of a sudden impulse In reality however the bonneting is due to weeks of daily encounters with the constable at each of which meetings the dislike for his helmet and the idea of smashing it in grow a little larger till finally they blossom into the deed itself This was what happened in Mike s case Day by day through the summer as the City grew hotter and stuffier his hatred of the bank became more and more the thought that occupied his mind It only needed a moderately strong temptation to make him break out and take the consequences Psmith noticed his restlessness and endeavoured to soothe it All is not well he said with Comrade Jackson the Sunshine of the Home I note a certain wanness of the cheek The peach bloom of your complexion is no longer up to sample Your eye is wild your merry laugh no longer rings through the bank causing nervous customers to leap into the air with startled exclamations You have the manner of one whose only friend on earth is a yellow dog and who has lost the dog Why is this Comrade Jackson They were talking in the flat at Clement s Inn The night was hot Through the open windows the roar of the Strand sounded faintly Mike walked to the window and looked out I m sick of all this rot he said shortly Psmith shot an inquiring glance at him but said nothing This restlessness of Mike s was causing him a good deal of inconvenience which he bore in patient silence hoping for better times With Mike obviously discontented and out of tune with all the world there was but little amusement to be extracted from the evenings now Mike did his best to be cheerful but he could not shake off the caged feeling which made him restless What rot it all is went on Mike sitting down again What s the good of it all You go and sweat all day at a desk day after day for about twopence a year And when you re about eighty five you retire It isn t living at all It s simply being a bally vegetable You aren t hankering by any chance to be a pirate of the Spanish main or anything like that are you inquired Psmith And all this rot about going out East continued Mike What s the good of going out East I gather from casual chit chat in the office that one becomes something of a blood when one goes out East said Psmith Have a dozen native clerks under you all looking up to you as the Last Word in magnificence and end by marrying the Governor s daughter End by getting some foul sort of fever more likely and being booted out as no further use to the bank You look on the gloomy side Comrade Jackson I seem to see you sitting in an armchair fanned by devoted coolies telling some Eastern potentate that you can give him five minutes I understand that being in a bank in the Far East is one of the world s softest jobs Millions of natives hang on your lightest word Enthusiastic rajahs draw you aside and press jewels into your hand as a token of respect and esteem When on an elephant s back you pass somebody beats on a booming brass gong The Banker of Bhong Isn t your generous young heart stirred to any extent by the prospect I am given to understand I ve a jolly good mind to chuck up the whole thing and become a pro I ve got a birth qualification for Surrey It s about the only thing I could do any good at Psmith s manner became fatherly You re all right he said The hot weather has given you that tired feeling What you want is a change of air We will pop down together hand in hand this week end to some seaside resort You shall build sand castles while I lie on the beach and read the paper In the evening we will listen to the band or stroll on the esplanade not so much because we want to as to give the natives a treat Possibly if the weather continues warm we may even paddle A vastly exhilarating pastime I am led to believe and so strengthening for the ankles And on Monday morning we will return bronzed and bursting with health to our toil once more I m going to bed said Mike rising Psmith watched him lounge from the room and shook his head sadly All was not well with his confidential secretary and adviser The next day which was a Thursday found Mike no more reconciled to the prospect of spending from ten till five in the company of mister Gregory and the ledgers He was silent at breakfast and Psmith seeing that things were still wrong abstained from conversation Mike propped the Sportsman up against the hot water jug and read the cricket news His county captained by brother Joe had as he had learned already from yesterday s evening paper beaten Sussex by five wickets at Brighton Today they were due to play Middlesex at Lord s Mike thought that he would try to get off early and go and see some of the first day s play As events turned out he got off a good deal earlier and saw a good deal more of the first day s play than he had anticipated He had just finished the preliminary stages of the morning s work which consisted mostly of washing his hands changing his coat and eating a section of a pen holder when William the messenger approached You re wanted on the phone mister Jackson The New Asiatic Bank unlike the majority of London banks was on the telephone a fact which Psmith found a great convenience when securing seats at the theatre Mike went to the box and took up the receiver Hullo he said Who s that said an agitated voice Is that you Mike I m Joe Hullo Joe said Mike What s up I m coming to see you this evening I m going to try and get off early Look here Mike are you busy at the bank just now Not at the moment There s never anything much going on before eleven I mean are you busy today Could you possibly manage to get off and play for us against Middlesex Mike nearly dropped the receiver What he cried There s been the dickens of a mix up We re one short and you re our only hope We can t possibly get another man in the time We start in half an hour Can you play For the space of perhaps one minute Mike thought Well said Joe s voice The sudden vision of Lord s ground all green and cool in the morning sunlight was too much for Mike s resolution sapped as it was by days of restlessness The feeling surged over him that whatever happened afterwards the joy of the match in perfect weather on a perfect wicket would make it worth while What did it matter what happened afterwards All right Joe he said I ll hop into a cab now and go and get my things Good man said Joe hugely relieved twenty six Breaking The News Dashing away from the call box Mike nearly cannoned into Psmith who was making his way pensively to the telephone with the object of ringing up the box office of the Haymarket Theatre Sorry said Mike Hullo Smith Hullo indeed said Psmith courteously I rejoice Comrade Jackson to find you going about your commercial duties like a young bomb How is it people repeatedly ask me that Comrade Jackson contrives to catch his employer s eye and win the friendly smile from the head of his department My reply is that where others walk Comrade Jackson runs Where others stroll Comrade Jackson legs it like a highly trained mustang of the prairie He does not loiter He gets back to his department bathed in perspiration in level time He I say Smith said Mike you might do me a favour A thousand Say on Just look in at the Fixed Deposits and tell old Gregory that I shan t be with him today will you I haven t time myself I must rush Psmith screwed his eyeglass into his eye and examined Mike carefully What exactly be began Tell the old ass I ve popped off Just so just so murmured Psmith as one who assents to a thoroughly reasonable proposition Tell him you have popped off It shall be done But it is within the bounds of possibility that Comrade Gregory may inquire further Could you give me some inkling as to why you are popping My brother Joe has just rung me up from Lords The county are playing Middlesex and they re one short He wants me to roll up Psmith shook his head sadly I don t wish to interfere in any way he said but I suppose you realize that by acting thus you are to some extent knocking the stuffing out of your chances of becoming manager of this bank If you dash off now I shouldn t count too much on that marrying the Governor s daughter scheme I sketched out for you last night I doubt whether this is going to help you to hold the gorgeous East in fee and all that sort of thing Oh dash the gorgeous East By all means said Psmith obligingly I just thought I d mention it I ll look in at Lord s this afternoon I shall send my card up to you and trust to your sympathetic cooperation to enable me to effect an entry into the pavilion on my face My father is coming up to London today I ll bring him along too Right ho Dash it it s twenty to So long See you at Lord s Psmith looked after his retreating form till it had vanished through the swing door and shrugged his shoulders resignedly as if disclaiming all responsibility He has gone without his hat he murmured It seems to me that this is practically a case of running amok And now to break the news to bereaved Comrade Gregory He abandoned his intention of ringing up the Haymarket Theatre and turning away from the call box walked meditatively down the aisle till he came to the Fixed Deposits Department where the top of mister Gregory s head was to be seen over the glass barrier as he applied himself to his work Psmith resting his elbows on the top of the barrier and holding his head between his hands eyed the absorbed toiler for a moment in silence then emitted a hollow groan mister Gregory who was ruling a line in a ledger most of the work in the Fixed Deposits Department consisted of ruling lines in ledgers sometimes in black ink sometimes in red started as if he had been stung and made a complete mess of the ruled line He lifted a fiery bearded face and met Psmith s eye which shone with kindly sympathy He found words What the dickens are you standing there for mooing like a blanked cow he inquired I was groaning explained Psmith with quiet dignity And why was I groaning he continued Because a shadow has fallen on the Fixed Deposits Department Comrade Jackson the Pride of the Office has gone mister Gregory rose from his seat I don t know who the dickens you are he began I am Psmith said the old Etonian Oh you re Smith are you With a preliminary P Which however is not sounded And what s all this dashed nonsense about Jackson He is gone Gone like the dew from the petal of a rose Gone Where s he gone to Lord s What lord s Psmith waved his hand gently You misunderstand me Comrade Jackson has not gone to mix with any member of our gay and thoughtless aristocracy He has gone to Lord s cricket ground mister Gregory s beard bristled even more than was its wont What he roared Gone to watch a cricket match Gone Not to watch To play An urgent summons I need not say Nothing but an urgent summons could have wrenched him from your very delightful society I am sure mister Gregory glared I don t want any of your impudence he said Psmith nodded gravely We all have these curious likes and dislikes he said tolerantly You do not like my impudence Well well some people don t And now having broken the sad news I will return to my own department Half a minute You come with me and tell this yarn of yours to mister Bickersdyke You think it would interest amuse him Perhaps you are right Let us buttonhole Comrade Bickersdyke mister Bickersdyke was disengaged The head of the Fixed Deposits Department stumped into the room Psmith followed at a more leisurely pace Allow me he said with a winning smile as mister Gregory opened his mouth to speak to take this opportunity of congratulating you on your success at the election A narrow but well deserved victory There was nothing cordial in the manager s manner What do you want he said Myself nothing said Psmith But I understand that mister Gregory has some communication to make Tell mister Bickersdyke that story of yours said mister Gregory Surely said Psmith reprovingly this is no time for anecdotes mister Bickersdyke is busy He Tell him what you told me about Jackson mister Bickersdyke looked up inquiringly Jackson said Psmith has been obliged to absent himself from work today owing to an urgent summons from his brother who I understand has suffered a bereavement It s a lie roared mister Gregory You told me yourself he d gone to play in a cricket match True As I said he received an urgent summons from his brother What about the bereavement then The team was one short His brother was very distressed about it What could Comrade Jackson do Could he refuse to help his brother when it was in his power His generous nature is a byword He did the only possible thing He consented to play mister Bickersdyke spoke Am I to understand he asked with sinister calm that mister Jackson has left his work and gone off to play in a cricket match Something of that sort has I believe happened said Psmith He knew of course he added bowing gracefully in mister Gregory s direction that he was leaving his work in thoroughly competent hands Thank you said mister Bickersdyke That will do You will help mister Gregory in his department for the time being mister Smith I will arrange for somebody to take your place in your own department It will be a pleasure murmured Psmith Show mister Smith what he has to do mister Gregory said the manager They left the room How curious Comrade Gregory mused Psmith as they went are the workings of Fate A moment back and your life was a blank Comrade Jackson that prince of Fixed Depositors had gone How you said to yourself despairingly can his place be filled Then the cloud broke and the sun shone out again I came to help you What you lose on the swings you make up on the roundabouts Now show me what I have to do and then let us make this department sizzle You have drawn a good ticket Comrade Gregory twenty seven At Lord s Mike got to Lord s just as the umpires moved out into the field He raced round to the pavilion Joe met him on the stairs It s all right he said No hurry We ve won the toss I ve put you in fourth wicket Right ho said Mike Glad we haven t to field just yet We oughtn t to have to field today if we don t chuck our wickets away Good wicket Like a billiard table I m glad you were able to come Have any difficulty in getting away Joe Jackson s knowledge of the workings of a bank was of the slightest He himself had never since he left Oxford been in a position where there were obstacles to getting off to play in first class cricket By profession he was agent to a sporting baronet whose hobby was the cricket of the county and so far from finding any difficulty in playing for the county he was given to understand by his employer that that was his chief duty It never occurred to him that Mike might find his bank less amenable in the matter of giving leave His only fear when he rang Mike up that morning had been that this might be a particularly busy day at the New Asiatic Bank If there was no special rush of work he took it for granted that Mike would simply go to the manager ask for leave to play in the match and be given it with a beaming smile Mike did not answer the question but asked one on his own account How did you happen to be short he said It was rotten luck It was like this We were altering our team after the Sussex match to bring in Ballard Keene and Willis They couldn t get down to Brighton as the Varsity had a match but there was nothing on for them in the last half of the week so they d promised to roll up Ballard Keene and Willis were members of the Cambridge team all very capable performers and much in demand by the county when they could get away to play for it Well said Mike Well we all came up by train from Brighton last night But these three asses had arranged to motor down from Cambridge early today and get here in time for the start What happens Why Willis who fancies himself as a chauffeur undertakes to do the driving and naturally being an absolute rotter goes and smashes up the whole concern just outside saint Albans The first thing I knew of it was when I got to Lord s at half past ten and found a wire waiting for me to say that they were all three of them crocked and couldn t possibly play I tell you it was a bit of a jar to get half an hour before the match started Willis has sprained his ankle apparently Keene s damaged his wrist and Ballard has smashed his collar bone I don t suppose they ll be able to play in the Varsity match Rotten luck for Cambridge Well fortunately we d had two reserve pros with us at Brighton who had come up to London with the team in case they might be wanted so with them we were only one short Then I thought of you That s how it was I see said Mike Who are the pros Davis and Brockley Both bowlers It weakens our batting a lot Ballard or Willis might have got a stack of runs on this wicket Still we ve got a certain amount of batting as it is We oughtn t to do badly if we re careful You ve been getting some practice I suppose this season In a sort of a way Nets and so on No matches of any importance Dash it I wish you d had a game or two in decent class cricket Still nets are better than nothing I hope you ll be in form We may want a pretty long knock from you if things go wrong These men seem to be settling down all right thank goodness he added looking out of the window at the county s first pair Warrington and Mills two professionals who as the result of ten minutes play had put up twenty I d better go and change said Mike picking up his bag You re in first wicket I suppose Yes And Reggie second wicket Reggie was another of Mike s brothers not nearly so fine a player as Joe but a sound bat who generally made runs if allowed to stay in Mike changed and went out into the little balcony at the top of the pavilion He had it to himself There were not many spectators in the pavilion at this early stage of the game There are few more restful places if one wishes to think than the upper balconies of Lord s pavilion Mike watching the game making its leisurely progress on the turf below set himself seriously to review the situation in all its aspects The exhilaration of bursting the bonds had begun to fade and he found himself able to look into the matter of his desertion and weigh up the consequences There was no doubt that he had cut the painter once and for all Even a friendly disposed management could hardly overlook what he had done And the management of the New Asiatic Bank was the very reverse of friendly mister Bickersdyke he knew would jump at this chance of getting rid of him He realized that he must look on his career in the bank as a closed book It was definitely over and he must now think about the future It was not a time for half measures He could not go home He must carry the thing through now that he had begun and find something definite to do to support himself There seemed only one opening for him What could he do he asked himself Just one thing He could play cricket It was by his cricket that he must live He would have to become a professional Could he get taken on That was the question It was impossible that he should play for his own county on his residential qualification He could not appear as a professional in the same team in which his brothers were playing as amateurs He must stake all on his birth qualification for Surrey On the other hand had he the credentials which Surrey would want He had a school reputation But was that enough He could not help feeling that it might not be Thinking it over more tensely than he had ever thought over anything in his whole life he saw clearly that everything depended on what sort of show he made in this match which was now in progress It was his big chance If he succeeded all would be well He did not care to think what his position would be if he did not succeed A distant appeal and a sound of clapping from the crowd broke in on his thoughts Mills was out caught at the wicket The telegraph board gave the total as forty eight Not sensational The success of the team depended largely on what sort of a start the two professionals made The clapping broke out again as Joe made his way down the steps Joe as an All England player was a favourite with the crowd Mike watched him play an over in his strong graceful style then it suddenly occurred to him that he would like to know how matters had gone at the bank in his absence He went down to the telephone rang up the bank and asked for Psmith Presently the familiar voice made itself heard Hullo Smith Hullo Is that Comrade Jackson How are things progressing Fairly well We re in first We ve lost one wicket and the fifty s just up I say what s happened at the bank I broke the news to Comrade Gregory A charming personality I feel that we shall be friends Was he sick In a measure yes Indeed I may say he practically foamed at the mouth I explained the situation but he was not to be appeased He jerked me into the presence of Comrade Bickersdyke with whom I had a brief but entertaining chat He had not a great deal to say but he listened attentively to my narrative and eventually told me off to take your place in the Fixed Deposits That melancholy task I am now performing to the best of my ability I find the work a little trying There is too much ledger lugging to be done for my simple tastes I have been hauling ledgers from the safe all the morning The cry is beginning to go round Psmith is willing but can his physique stand the strain In the excitement of the moment just now I dropped a somewhat massive tome on to Comrade Gregory s foot unfortunately I understand the foot in which he has of late been suffering twinges of gout I passed the thing off with ready tact but I cannot deny that there was a certain temporary coolness which indeed is not yet past These things Comrade Jackson are the whirlpools in the quiet stream of commercial life Have I got the sack No official pronouncement has been made to me as yet on the subject but I think I should advise you if you are offered another job in the course of the day to accept it I cannot say that you are precisely the pet of the management just at present However I have ideas for your future which I will divulge when we meet I propose to slide coyly from the office at about four o clock I am meeting my father at that hour We shall come straight on to Lord s Right ho said Mike I ll be looking out for you Is there any little message I can give Comrade Gregory from you You can give him my love if you like It shall be done Good bye Good bye Mike replaced the receiver and went up to his balcony again As soon as his eye fell on the telegraph board he saw with a start that things had been moving rapidly in his brief absence The numbers of the batsmen on the board were three and five Great Scott he cried Why I m in next What on earth s been happening He put on his pads hurriedly expecting every moment that a wicket would fall and find him unprepared But the batsmen were still together when he rose ready for the fray and went downstairs to get news He found his brother Reggie in the dressing room What s happened he said How were you out L b w said Reggie Goodness knows how it happened My eyesight must be going I mistimed the thing altogether How was Warrington out Caught in the slips By Jove said Mike This is pretty rocky Three for sixty one We shall get mopped Unless you and Joe do something There s no earthly need to get out The wicket s as good as you want and the bowling s nothing special Well played Joe A beautiful glide to leg by the greatest of the Jacksons had rolled up against the pavilion rails The fieldsmen changed across for the next over If only Peters stops a bit began Mike and broke off Peters off stump was lying at an angle of forty five degrees Well he hasn t said Reggie grimly Silly ass why did he hit at that one All he d got to do was to stay in with Joe Now it s up to you Do try and do something or we ll be out under the hundred Mike waited till the outcoming batsman had turned in at the professionals gate Then he walked down the steps and out into the open feeling more nervous than he had felt since that far off day when he had first gone in to bat for Wrykyn against the M C C He found his thoughts flying back to that occasion Today as then everything seemed very distant and unreal The spectators were miles away He had often been to Lord s as a spectator but the place seemed entirely unfamiliar now He felt as if he were in a strange land He was conscious of Joe leaving the crease to meet him on his way He smiled feebly Buck up said Joe in that robust way of his which was so heartening Nothing in the bowling and the wicket like a shirt front Play just as if you were at the nets And for goodness sake don t try to score all your runs in the first over Stick in and we ve got them Mike smiled again more feebly than before and made a weird gurgling noise in his throat It had been the Middlesex fast bowler who had destroyed Peters Mike was not sorry He did not object to fast bowling He took guard and looked round him taking careful note of the positions of the slips As usual once he was at the wicket the paralysed feeling left him He became conscious again of his power Dash it all what was there to be afraid of He was a jolly good bat and he would jolly well show them that he was too The fast bowler with a preliminary bound began his run Mike settled himself into position his whole soul concentrated on the ball Everything else was wiped from his mind twenty eight Psmith Arranges his Future It was exactly four o clock when Psmith sliding unostentatiously from his stool flicked divers pieces of dust from the leg of his trousers 
584-124227-0000	train-other-500	and sidled towards the basement where he was wont to keep his hat during business hours He was aware that it would be a matter of some delicacy to leave the bank at that hour
584-124227-0001	train-other-500	There was a certain quantity of work still to be done in the Fixed Deposits Department work in which by rights as Mike s understudy he should have lent a sympathetic and helping hand
584-124227-0002	train-other-500	But what of that he mused thoughtfully smoothing his hat with his knuckles Comrade Gregory is a man who takes such an enthusiastic pleasure in his duties
none	none	 that he will go singing about the office when he discovers that he has got a double lot of work to do With this comforting thought he started on his perilous journey to the open air 
584-124227-0003	train-other-500	As he walked delicately not courting observation he reminded himself of the hero of Pilgrim s Progress On all sides of him lay fearsome beasts lying in wait to pounce upon him
584-124227-0004	train-other-500	At any moment mister Gregory s hoarse roar might shatter the comparative stillness or the sinister note of mister Bickersdyke make itself heard
584-124227-0005	train-other-500	However said Psmith philosophically these are Life s Trials and must be borne patiently A roundabout route
584-124227-0006	train-other-500	via the Postage and Inwards Bills Departments took him to the swing doors It was here that the danger became acute The doors were well within view of the Fixed Deposits Department
584-124227-0007	train-other-500	and mister Gregory had an eye compared with which that of an eagle was more or less bleared Psmith sauntered to the door and pushed it open in a gingerly manner
none	none	 As he did so a bellow rang through the office causing a timid customer who had come in to arrange about an overdraft to lose his nerve completely and postpone his business till the following afternoon Psmith looked up 
584-124227-0008	train-other-500	mister Gregory was leaning over the barrier which divided his lair from the outer world and gesticulating violently Where are you going roared the head of the Fixed Deposits
584-124227-0009	train-other-500	Psmith did not reply With a benevolent smile and a gesture intended to signify all would come right in the future he slid through the swing doors
none	none	 and began to move down the street at a somewhat swifter pace than was his habit Once round the corner he slackened his speed This can t go on he said to himself This life of commerce is too great a strain 
584-124227-0010	train-other-500	One is practically a hunted hare Either the heads of my department must refrain from View Halloos when they observe me going for a stroll or I abandon Commerce for some less exacting walk in life
584-124227-0011	train-other-500	He removed his hat
none	none	 and allowed the cool breeze to play upon his forehead 
584-124227-0012	train-other-500	The episode had been disturbing He was to meet his father at the Mansion House
none	none	 As he reached that land mark he saw with approval that punctuality was a virtue of which he had not the sole monopoly in the Smith family His father was waiting for him at the tryst 
584-124227-0013	train-other-500	Certainly my boy said mister Smith senior
none	none	 all activity in a moment when Psmith had suggested going to Lord s 
584-124227-0014	train-other-500	Excellent We must be getting on We must not miss a moment of the match
none	none	 Bless my soul I haven t seen a first class match this season 
584-124227-0015	train-other-500	Where s a cab Hi cabby No that one s got some one in it There s another Hi Here lunatic Are you blind Good he s seen us
none	none	 That s right Here he comes 
584-124227-0016	train-other-500	Lord s Cricket Ground cabby as quick as you can Jump in Rupert my boy jump in Psmith rarely jumped
584-124227-0017	train-other-500	He entered the cab with something of the stateliness of an old Roman Emperor boarding his chariot and settled himself comfortably in his seat mister Smith dived in like a rabbit
584-124227-0018	train-other-500	A vendor of newspapers came to the cab thrusting an evening paper into the interior Psmith bought it Let s see how they re getting on he said opening the paper Where are we
584-124227-0019	train-other-500	Lunch scores Lord s
none	none	 Aha Comrade Jackson is in form Jackson said mister Smith is that the same youngster you brought home last summer The batsman Is he playing today He was not out 
584-124227-0020	train-other-500	thirty at lunch time He would appear to be making something of a stand with his brother Joe who has made sixty one up to the moment of going to press It s possible he may still be in when we get there In which case we shall not be able to slide into the pavilion
584-124227-0021	train-other-500	A grand bat that boy I said so last summer Better than any of his brothers
none	none	 He s in the bank with you isn t he He was this morning I doubt however whether he can be said to be still in that position Eh what How s that There was some slight friction between him and the management They wished him to be glued to his stool he preferred to play for the county I think we may say that Comrade Jackson has secured the Order of the Boot What Do you mean to say 
584-124227-0023	train-other-500	Psmith related briefly the history of Mike s departure mister Smith listened with interest Well he said at last
none	none	 hang me if I blame the boy It s a sin cooping up a fellow who can bat like that in a bank 
584-124227-0024	train-other-500	I should have done the same myself in his place Psmith smoothed his waistcoat
none	none	 Do you know father he said 
584-124227-0025	train-other-500	this bank business is far from being much of a catch Indeed I should describe it definitely as a bit off I have given it a fair trial and I now denounce it unhesitatingly as a shade too thick
584-124227-0026	train-other-500	What Are you getting tired of it Not precisely tired But
none	none	 after considerable reflection 
584-124227-0027	train-other-500	I have come to the conclusion that my talents lie elsewhere At lugging ledgers I am among the also rans a mere cipher I have been wanting to speak to you about this for some time If you have no objection I should like to go to the Bar
584-124227-0028	train-other-500	The Bar Well I fancy I should make a pretty considerable hit as a barrister mister Smith reflected The idea had not occurred to him before Now that it was suggested
none	none	 his always easily fired imagination took hold of it readily 
584-124227-0029	train-other-500	There was a good deal to be said for the Bar as a career Psmith knew his father
none	none	 and he knew that the thing was practically as good as settled 
584-124227-0030	train-other-500	It was a new idea and as such was bound to be favourably received What I should do if I were you
584-124227-0031	train-other-500	he went on as if he were advising a friend on some course of action
none	none	 certain to bring him profit and pleasure is to take me away from the bank at once Don t wait There is no time like the present Let me hand in my resignation tomorrow 
584-124227-0032	train-other-500	The blow to the management especially to Comrade Bickersdyke will be a painful one but it is the truest kindness to administer it swiftly Let me resign tomorrow and devote my time to quiet study
none	none	 Then I can pop up to Cambridge next term and all will be well I ll think it over began mister Smith Let us hustle urged Psmith 
584-124227-0033	train-other-500	Let us Do It Now
none	none	 It is the only way Have I your leave to shoot in my resignation to Comrade Bickersdyke tomorrow morning 
584-124227-0034	train-other-500	mister Smith hesitated for a moment then made up his mind Very well he said I really think it is a good idea There are great opportunities open to a barrister I wish we had thought of it before I am
584-124227-0035	train-other-500	not altogether sorry that we did not said Psmith I have enjoyed the chances my commercial life has given me of associating with such a man as Comrade Bickersdyke In many ways a master mind But perhaps
584-124227-0036	train-other-500	it is as well to close the chapter How it happened it is hard to say but somehow I fancy I did not precisely hit it off with Comrade Bickersdyke With Psmith the worker he had no fault to find
584-124227-0037	train-other-500	but it seemed to me sometimes during our festive evenings together at the club that all was not well From little almost imperceptible signs I have suspected now and then that he would just as soon have been without my company
584-124227-0038	train-other-500	One cannot explain these things It must have been some incompatibility of temperament Perhaps he will manage to bear up at my departure But here we are he added as the cab drew up
none	none	 I wonder if Comrade Jackson is still going strong 
584-124227-0039	train-other-500	They passed through the turnstile and caught sight of the telegraph board
none	none	 By Jove said Psmith he is I don t know if he s number three or number six I expect he s number six In which case he has got ninety eight We re just in time to see his century twenty nine And Mike s For nearly two hours Mike had been experiencing the keenest pleasure that it had ever fallen to his lot to feel From the moment he took his first ball till the luncheon interval he had suffered the acutest discomfort His nervousness had left him to a great extent but he had never really settled down Sometimes by luck and sometimes by skill he had kept the ball out of his wicket but he was scratching and he knew it Not for a single over had he been comfortable On several occasions he had edged balls to leg and through the slips in quite an inferior manner and it was seldom that he managed to hit with the centre of the bat Nobody is more alive to the fact that he is not playing up to his true form than the batsman Even though his score mounted little by little into the twenties Mike was miserable If this was the best he could do on a perfect wicket he felt there was not much hope for him as a professional The poorness of his play was accentuated by the brilliance of Joe s Joe combined science and vigour to a remarkable degree He laid on the wood with a graceful robustness which drew much cheering from the crowd Beside him Mike was oppressed by that leaden sense of moral inferiority which weighs on a man who has turned up to dinner in ordinary clothes when everybody else has dressed He felt awkward and conspicuously out of place Then came lunch and after lunch a glorious change Volumes might be written on the cricket lunch and the influence it has on the run of the game how it undoes one man and sends another back to the fray like a giant refreshed how it turns the brilliant fast bowler into the sluggish medium and the nervous bat into the masterful smiter On Mike its effect was magical He lunched wisely and well chewing his food with the concentration of a thirty three bites a mouthful crank and drinking dry ginger ale As he walked out with Joe after the interval he knew that a change had taken place in him His nerve had come back and with it his form It sometimes happens at cricket that when one feels particularly fit one gets snapped in the slips in the first over or clean bowled by a full toss but neither of these things happened to Mike He stayed in and began to score Now there were no edgings through the slips and snicks to leg He was meeting the ball in the centre of the bat and meeting it vigorously Two boundaries in successive balls off the fast bowler hard clean drives past extra cover put him at peace with all the world He was on top He had found himself Joe at the other end resumed his brilliant career His century and Mike s fifty arrived in the same over The bowling began to grow loose Joe having reached his century slowed down somewhat and Mike took up the running The score rose rapidly A leg theory bowler kept down the pace of the run getting for a time but the bowlers at the other end continued to give away runs Mike s score passed from sixty to seventy from seventy to eighty from eighty to ninety When the Smiths father and son came on to the ground the total was ninety eight Joe had made a hundred and thirty three Mike reached his century just as Psmith and his father took their seats A square cut off the slow bowler was just too wide for point to get to By the time third man had sprinted across and returned the ball the batsmen had run two mister Smith was enthusiastic I tell you he said to Psmith who was clapping in a gently encouraging manner the boy s a wonderful bat I said so when he was down with us I remember telling him so myself I ve seen your brothers play I said and you re better than any of them I remember it distinctly He ll be playing for England in another year or two Fancy putting a cricketer like that into the City It s a crime I gather said Psmith that the family coffers had got a bit low It was necessary for Comrade Jackson to do something by way of saving the Old Home He ought to be at the University Look he s got that man away to the boundary again They ll never get him out At six o clock the partnership was broken Joe running himself out in trying to snatch a single where no single was He had made a hundred and eighty nine Mike flung himself down on the turf with mixed feelings He was sorry Joe was out but he was very glad indeed of the chance of a rest He was utterly fagged A half day match once a week is no training for first class cricket Joe who had been playing all the season was as tough as india rubber and trotted into the pavilion as fresh as if he had been having a brief spell at the nets Mike on the other hand felt that he simply wanted to be dropped into a cold bath and left there indefinitely There was only another half hour s play but he doubted if he could get through it He dragged himself up wearily as Joe s successor arrived at the wickets He had crossed Joe before the latter s downfall and it was his turn to take the bowling Something seemed to have gone out of him He could not time the ball properly The last ball of the over looked like a half volley and he hit out at it But it was just short of a half volley and his stroke arrived too soon The bowler running in the direction of mid on brought off an easy c and b Mike turned away towards the pavilion He heard the gradually swelling applause in a sort of dream It seemed to him hours before he reached the dressing room He was sitting on a chair wishing that somebody would come along and take off his pads when Psmith s card was brought to him A few moments later the old Etonian appeared in person Hullo Smith said Mike By Jove I m done How Little Willie Saved the Match said Psmith What you want is one of those gin and ginger beers we hear so much about Remove those pads and let us flit downstairs in search of a couple Well Comrade Jackson you have fought the good fight this day My father sends his compliments He is dining out or he would have come up He is going to look in at the flat latish How many did I get asked Mike I was so jolly done I didn t think of looking A hundred and forty eight of the best said Psmith What will they say at the old homestead about this Are you ready Then let us test this fruity old ginger beer of theirs The two batsmen who had followed the big stand were apparently having a little stand all of their own No more wickets fell before the drawing of stumps Psmith waited for Mike while he changed and carried him off in a cab to Simpson s a restaurant which as he justly observed offered two great advantages namely that you need not dress and secondly that you paid your half crown and were then at liberty to eat till you were helpless if you felt so disposed without extra charge Mike stopped short of this giddy height of mastication but consumed enough to make him feel a great deal better Psmith eyed his inroads on the menu with approval There is nothing he said like victualling up before an ordeal What s the ordeal said Mike I propose to take you round to the club anon where I trust we shall find Comrade Bickersdyke We have much to say to one another Look here I m hanged began Mike Yes you must be there said Psmith Your presence will serve to cheer Comrade B up Fate compels me to deal him a nasty blow and he will want sympathy I have got to break it to him that I am leaving the bank What are you going to chuck it Psmith inclined his head The time he said has come to part It has served its turn The startled whisper runs round the City Psmith has had sufficient What are you going to do I propose to enter the University of Cambridge and there to study the intricacies of the Law with a view to having a subsequent dash at becoming Lord Chancellor By Jove said Mike you re lucky I wish I were coming too Psmith knocked the ash off his cigarette Are you absolutely set on becoming a pro he asked It depends on what you call set It seems to me it s about all I can do I can offer you a not entirely scaly job said Smith if you feel like taking it In the course of conversation with my father during the match this afternoon I gleaned the fact that he is anxious to secure your services as a species of agent The vast Psmith estates it seems need a bright boy to keep an eye upon them Are you prepared to accept the post Mike stared Me Dash it all how old do you think I am I m only nineteen I had suspected as much from the alabaster clearness of your unwrinkled brow But my father does not wish you to enter upon your duties immediately There would be a preliminary interval of three possibly four years at Cambridge during which I presume you would be learning divers facts concerning spuds turmuts and the like At least said Psmith airily I suppose so Far be it from me to dictate the line of your researches Then I m afraid it s off said Mike gloomily My pater couldn t afford to send me to Cambridge That obstacle said Psmith can be surmounted You would of course accompany me to Cambridge in the capacity which you enjoy at the present moment of my confidential secretary and adviser Any expenses that might crop up would be defrayed from the Psmith family chest Mike s eyes opened wide again Do you mean he asked bluntly that your pater would pay for me at the Varsity No I say dash it I mean I couldn t Do you suggest said Psmith raising his eyebrows that I should go to the University without a confidential secretary and adviser No but I mean protested Mike Then that s settled said Psmith I knew you would not desert me in my hour of need Comrade Jackson What will you do asked my father alarmed for my safety among these wild undergraduates I fear for my Rupert Have no fear father I replied Comrade Jackson will be beside me His face brightened immediately Comrade Jackson he said is a man in whom I have the supremest confidence If he is with you I shall sleep easy of nights It was after that that the conversation drifted to the subject of agents Psmith called for the bill and paid it in the affable manner of a monarch signing a charter Mike sat silent his mind in a whirl He saw exactly what had happened He could almost hear Psmith talking his father into agreeing with his scheme He could think of nothing to say As usually happened in any emotional crisis in his life words absolutely deserted him The thing was too big Anything he could say would sound too feeble When a friend has solved all your difficulties and smoothed out all the rough places which were looming in your path you cannot thank him as if he had asked you to lunch The occasion demanded some neat polished speech and neat polished speeches were beyond Mike I say Psmith he began Psmith rose Let us now he said collect our hats and meander to the club where I have no doubt we shall find Comrade Bickersdyke all unconscious of impending misfortune dreaming pleasantly over coffee and a cigar in the lower smoking room thirty The Last Sad Farewells As it happened that was precisely what mister Bickersdyke was doing He was feeling thoroughly pleased with life For nearly nine months Psmith had been to him a sort of spectre at the feast inspiring him with an ever present feeling of discomfort which he had found impossible to shake off And tonight he saw his way of getting rid of him At five minutes past four mister Gregory crimson and wrathful 
584-124229-0000	train-other-500	had plunged into his room with a long statement of how Psmith deputed to help in the life and thought of the Fixed Deposits Department had left the building at four o clock
none	none	 when there was still another hour and a half s work to be done 
584-124229-0001	train-other-500	Moreover mister Gregory deposed the errant one seen sliding out of the swinging door and summoned in a loud clear voice to come back had flatly disobeyed
584-124229-0002	train-other-500	and had gone upon his ways Grinning at me
none	none	 said the aggrieved mister Gregory 
584-124229-0003	train-other-500	like a dashed ape A most unjust description of the sad sweet smile which Psmith had bestowed upon him from the doorway
none	none	 Ever since that moment mister Bickersdyke had felt that there was a silver lining to the cloud Hitherto Psmith had left nothing to be desired in the manner in which he performed his work His righteousness in the office had clothed him as in a suit of mail 
584-124229-0004	train-other-500	But now he had slipped To go off an hour and a half before the proper time and to refuse to return when summoned by the head of his department these were offences for which he could be dismissed without fuss
584-124229-0005	train-other-500	mister Bickersdyke looked forward to tomorrow s interview with his employee Meanwhile having enjoyed an excellent dinner he was now as Psmith had predicted
584-124229-0006	train-other-500	engaged with a cigar and a cup of coffee in the lower smoking room of the Senior Conservative Club Psmith and Mike entered the room when he was about half through these luxuries Psmith s first action was to summon a waiter
none	none	 and order a glass of neat brandy 
584-124229-0007	train-other-500	Not for myself he explained to Mike For Comrade Bickersdyke He is about to sustain a nasty shock and may need a restorative at a moment s notice For all we know his heart may not be strong
584-124229-0008	train-other-500	In any case it is safest to have a pick me up handy He paid the waiter and advanced across the room followed by Mike In his hand extended at arm s length
none	none	 he bore the glass of brandy mister Bickersdyke caught sight of the procession and started Psmith set the brandy down very carefully on the table beside the manager s coffee cup and dropping into a chair regarded him 
584-124229-0009	train-other-500	pityingly through his eyeglass Mike who felt embarrassed took a seat some little way behind his companion This was Psmith s affair and he proposed to allow him to do the talking
584-124229-0010	train-other-500	mister Bickersdyke except for a slight deepening of the colour of his complexion gave no sign of having seen them He puffed away at his cigar his eyes fixed on the ceiling An
none	none	 unpleasant task lies before us 
584-124229-0011	train-other-500	began Psmith in a low sorrowful voice and it must not be shirked Have I your ear mister Bickersdyke Addressed thus directly
584-124229-0012	train-other-500	the manager allowed his gaze to wander from the ceiling He eyed Psmith for a moment like an elderly basilisk then looked back at the ceiling again I shall speak to you tomorrow he said
none	none	 Psmith heaved a heavy sigh You will not see us tomorrow he said pushing the brandy a little nearer mister Bickersdyke s eyes left the ceiling once more What do you mean he said Drink this 
584-124229-0013	train-other-500	urged Psmith sympathetically holding out the glass Be brave he went on rapidly Time softens the harshest blows
none	none	 Shocks stun us for the moment but we recover 
584-124229-0014	train-other-500	Little by little we come to ourselves again Life which we had thought could hold no more pleasure for us gradually shows itself not wholly grey
584-124229-0015	train-other-500	mister Bickersdyke seemed about to make an observation at this point but Psmith with a wave of the hand hurried on We find that the sun still shines the birds still sing
none	none	 Things which used to entertain us resume their attraction Gradually we emerge from the soup 
584-124229-0016	train-other-500	and begin If you have anything to say to me said the manager I should be glad if you would say it and go
none	none	 You prefer me not to break the bad news gently 
584-124229-0017	train-other-500	said Psmith Perhaps you are wise In a word then he picked up the brandy and held it out to him
none	none	 Comrade Jackson and myself 
584-124229-0018	train-other-500	are leaving the bank I am aware of that said mister Bickersdyke drily Psmith put down the glass You have been told already he said That accounts for your calm
none	none	 The shock has expended its force on you and can do no more You are stunned I am sorry but it had to be You will say that it is madness for us to offer our resignations 
584-124229-0019	train-other-500	that our grip on the work of the bank made a prosperous career in Commerce certain for us It may be so But somehow we feel that our talents lie elsewhere To Comrade Jackson
584-124229-0020	train-other-500	the management of the Psmith estates seems the job on which he can get the rapid half Nelson For my own part I feel that my long suit is the Bar I am a poor unready speaker
584-124229-0021	train-other-500	but I intend to acquire a knowledge of the Law which shall outweigh this defect Before leaving you I should like to say I may speak for you as well as myself Comrade Jackson
none	none	 Mike uttered his first contribution to the conversation a gurgle and relapsed into silence again I should like to say continued Psmith how much Comrade Jackson and I have enjoyed our stay in the bank The insight it has given us into your masterly handling of the intricate mechanism of the office has been a treat we would not have missed But 
584-124229-0022	train-other-500	our place is elsewhere He rose Mike followed his example with alacrity
none	none	 It occurred to mister Bickersdyke as they turned to go that he had not yet been able to get in a word about their dismissal They were drifting away with all the honours of war Come back he cried Psmith paused and shook his head sadly 
584-124229-0023	train-other-500	This is unmanly Comrade Bickersdyke he said I had not expected this That you should be dazed by the shock was natural
none	none	 But that you should beg us to reconsider 
584-124229-0024	train-other-500	our resolve and return to the bank is unworthy of you Be a man Bite the bullet The first keen pang will pass Time will soften the feeling of bereavement You must be brave
none	none	 Come Comrade Jackson 
584-124229-0025	train-other-500	Mike responded to the call without hesitation
none	none	 We will now said Psmith leading the way to the door push back to the flat My father will be round there soon He looked over his shoulder mister Bickersdyke appeared to be wrapped in thought A painful business sighed Psmith The man seems quite broken up 
584-124229-0026	train-other-500	It had to be however The bank was no place for us An excellent career in many respects but unsuitable for you and me It is hard on Comrade Bickersdyke especially as he took such trouble to get me into it
584-124229-0027	train-other-500	but I think we may say that we are well out of the place Mike s mind roamed into the future
none	none	 Cambridge first and then an open air life of the sort he had always dreamed of 
584-124229-0028	train-other-500	The Problem of Life seemed to him to be solved He looked on down the years
none	none	 and he could see no troubles there of any kind whatsoever 
584-124229-0029	train-other-500	Reason suggested that there were probably one or two knocking about somewhere but this was no time to think of them He examined the future and found it good
none	none	 I should jolly well think he said simply that we might End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Psmith in the City by P G Wodehouse END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PSMITH IN THE CITY This
