dreamily She and Diana Barry had been picking apples in the Green Gables orchard but were now resting from their labors in a sunny corner where airy fleets of thistledown drifted by on the wings of a wind that was still summer sweet with the incense of ferns in the Haunted Wood But everything in the landscape around them spoke of autumn The sea was roaring hollowly in the distance the fields were bare and sere scarfed with golden rod the brook valley below Green Gables overflowed with asters of ethereal purple and the Lake of Shining Waters was blue blue blue not the changeful blue of spring nor the pale azure of summer but a clear steadfast serene blue as if the water were past all moods and tenses of emotion and had settled down to a tranquility unbroken by fickle dreams It has been a nice summer said Diana twisting the new ring on her left hand with a smile And Miss Lavendar s wedding seemed to come as a sort of crown to it I suppose mister and missus Irving are on the Pacific coast now It seems to me they have been gone long enough to go around the world sighed Anne I can t believe it is only a week since they were married Everything has changed Miss Lavendar and mister and missus Allan gone how lonely the manse looks with the shutters all closed I went past it last night and it made me feel as if everybody in it had died We ll never get another minister as nice as mister Allan said Diana with gloomy conviction I suppose we ll have all kinds of supplies this winter and half the Sundays no preaching at all And you and Gilbert gone it will be awfully dull Fred will be here insinuated Anne slyly When is missus Lynde going to move up asked Diana as if she had not heard Anne s remark Tomorrow I m glad she s coming but it will be another change Marilla and I cleared everything out of the spare room yesterday Do you know I hated to do it Of course it was silly but it did seem as if we were committing sacrilege That old spare room has always seemed like a shrine to me When I was a child I thought it the most wonderful apartment in the world You remember what a consuming desire I had to sleep in a spare room bed but not the Green Gables spare room Oh no never there It would have been too terrible I couldn t have slept a wink from awe I never WALKED through that room when Marilla sent me in on an errand no indeed I tiptoed through it and held my breath as if I were in church and felt relieved when I got out of it The pictures of George Whitefield and the Duke of Wellington hung there one on each side of the mirror and frowned so sternly at me all the time I was in especially if I dared peep in the mirror which was the only one in the house that didn t twist my face a little I always wondered how Marilla dared houseclean that room And now it s not only cleaned but stripped bare George Whitefield and the Duke have been relegated to the upstairs hall So passes the glory of this world concluded Anne with a laugh in which there was a little note of regret It is never pleasant to have our old shrines desecrated even when we have outgrown them I ll be so lonesome when you go moaned Diana for the hundredth time And to think you go next week But we re together still said Anne cheerily We mustn t let next week rob us of this week s joy I hate the thought of going myself home and I are such good friends Talk of being lonesome It s I who should groan YOU LL be here with any number of your old friends AND Fred While I shall be alone among strangers not knowing a soul EXCEPT Gilbert AND Charlie Sloane said Diana imitating Anne s italics and slyness Charlie Sloane will be a great comfort of course agreed Anne sarcastically whereupon both those irresponsible damsels laughed Diana knew exactly what Anne thought of Charlie Sloane but despite sundry confidential talks she did not know just what Anne thought of Gilbert Blythe To be sure Anne herself did not know that The boys may be boarding at the other end of Kingsport for all I know Anne went on I am glad I m going to Redmond and I am sure I shall like it after a while But for the first few weeks I know I won t I shan t even have the comfort of looking forward to the weekend visit home as I had when I went to Queen s Christmas will seem like a thousand years away Everything is changing or going to change said Diana sadly I have a feeling that things will never be the same again Anne We have come to a parting of the ways I suppose said Anne thoughtfully We had to come to it Do you think Diana that being grown up is really as nice as we used to imagine it would be when we were children

none	none	there are SOME nice things about it answered Diana again caressing her ring with that little smile which always had the effect of making Anne feel suddenly left out and inexperienced But there are so many puzzling things too Sometimes I feel as if being grown up just frightened me and then I would give anything to be a little girl again I suppose we ll get used to being grownup in time said Anne cheerfully There won t be so many unexpected things about it by and by though after all I fancy it s the unexpected things that give spice to life We re eighteen Diana In two more years we ll be twenty When I was ten I thought twenty was a green old age In no time you ll be a staid middle aged matron and I shall be nice old maid Aunt Anne coming to visit you on vacations You ll always keep a corner for me won t you Di darling Not the spare room of course old maids can t aspire to spare rooms and I shall be as umble as Uriah Heep and quite content with a little over the porch or off the parlor cubby hole What nonsense you do talk Anne laughed Diana You ll marry somebody splendid and handsome and rich and no spare room in Avonlea will be half gorgeous enough for you and you ll turn up your nose at all the friends of your youth That would be a pity my nose is quite nice but I fear turning it up would spoil it said Anne patting that shapely organ I haven t so many good features that I could afford to spoil those I have so even if I should marry the King of the Cannibal Islands I promise you I won t turn up my nose at you Diana With another gay laugh the girls separated Diana to return to Orchard Slope Anne to walk to the Post Office She found a letter awaiting her there and when Gilbert Blythe overtook her on the bridge over the Lake of Shining Waters she was sparkling with the excitement of it Priscilla Grant is going to Redmond too she exclaimed Isn t that splendid I hoped she would but she didn t think her father would consent He has however and we re to board together I feel that I can face an army with banners or all the professors of Redmond in one fell phalanx with a chum like Priscilla by my side I think we ll like Kingsport said Gilbert It s a nice old burg they tell me and has the finest natural park in the world I ve heard that the scenery in it is magnificent I wonder if it will be can be any more beautiful than this murmured Anne looking around her with the loving enraptured eyes of those to whom home must always be the loveliest spot in the world no matter what fairer lands may lie under alien stars They were leaning on the bridge of the old pond drinking deep of the enchantment of the dusk just at the spot where Anne had climbed from her sinking Dory on the day Elaine floated down to Camelot The fine empurpling dye of sunset still stained the western skies but the moon was rising and the water lay like a great silver dream in her light Remembrance wove a sweet and subtle spell over the two young creatures You are very quiet Anne said Gilbert at last I m afraid to speak or move for fear all this wonderful beauty will vanish just like a broken silence breathed Anne Gilbert suddenly laid his hand over the slender white one lying on the rail of the bridge His hazel eyes deepened into darkness his still boyish lips opened to say something of the dream and hope that thrilled his soul But Anne snatched her hand away and turned quickly The spell of the dusk was broken for her I must go home she exclaimed with a rather overdone carelessness Marilla had a headache this afternoon and I m sure the twins will be in some dreadful mischief by this time I really shouldn t have stayed away so long She chattered ceaselessly and inconsequently until they reached the Green Gables lane Poor Gilbert hardly had a chance to get a word in edgewise Anne felt rather relieved when they parted There had been a new secret self consciousness in her heart with regard to Gilbert ever since that fleeting moment of revelation in the garden of Echo Lodge Something alien had intruded into the old perfect school day comradeship something that threatened to mar it I never felt glad to see Gilbert go before she thought half resentfully half sorrowfully as she walked alone up the lane Our friendship will be spoiled if he goes on with this nonsense It mustn t be spoiled I won t let it Oh WHY can t boys be just sensible Anne had an uneasy doubt that it was not strictly sensible that she should still feel on her hand the warm pressure of Gilbert s as distinctly as she had felt it for the swift second his had rested there and still less sensible that the sensation was far from being an unpleasant one very different from that which had attended a similar demonstration on Charlie Sloane s part when she had been sitting out a dance with him at a White Sands party three nights before Anne shivered over the disagreeable recollection But all problems connected with infatuated swains vanished from her mind when she entered the homely unsentimental atmosphere of the Green Gables kitchen where an eight year old boy was crying grievously on the sofa What is the matter Davy asked Anne taking him up in her arms Where are Marilla and Dora Marilla s putting Dora to bed sobbed Davy and I m crying cause Dora fell down the outside cellar steps heels over head and scraped all the skin off her nose and Oh well don t cry about it dear Of course you are sorry for her but crying won t help her any She ll be all right tomorrow Crying never helps any one Davy boy and I ain t crying cause Dora fell down cellar said Davy cutting short Anne s wellmeant preachment with increasing bitterness I m crying cause I wasn t there to see her fall I m always missing some fun or other seems to me Oh Davy Anne choked back an unholy shriek of laughter Would you call it fun to see poor little Dora fall down the steps and get hurt She wasn t MUCH hurt said Davy defiantly Course if she d been killed I d have been real sorry Anne But the Keiths ain t so easy killed They re like the Blewetts I guess Herb Blewett fell off the hayloft last Wednesday and rolled right down through the turnip chute into the box stall where they had a fearful wild cross horse and rolled right under his heels And still he got out alive with only three bones broke missus Lynde says there are some folks you can t kill with a meat axe Is missus Lynde coming here tomorrow Anne Yes Davy and I hope you ll be always very nice and good to her I ll be nice and good But will she ever put me to bed at nights Anne Perhaps Why Cause said Davy very decidedly if she does I won t say my prayers before her like I do before you Anne Why not Cause I don t think it would be nice to talk to God before strangers Anne Dora can say hers to missus Lynde if she likes but I won t I ll wait till she s gone and then say em Won t that be all right Anne Yes if you are sure you won t forget to say them Davy boy Oh I won t forget you bet I think saying my prayers is great fun But it won t be as good fun saying them alone as saying them to you I wish you d stay home Anne I don t see what you want to go away and leave us for I don t exactly WANT to Davy but I feel I ought to go If you don t want to go you needn t You re grown up When I m grown up I m not going to do one single thing I don t want to do Anne All your life Davy you ll find yourself doing things you don t want to do I won t said Davy flatly Catch me I have to do things I don t want to now cause you and Marilla ll send me to bed if I don t But when I grow up you can t do that and there ll be nobody to tell me not to do things Won t I have the time Say Anne Milty Boulter says his mother says you re going to college to see if you can catch a man Are you Anne I want to know For a second Anne burned with resentment Then she laughed reminding herself that missus Boulter s crude vulgarity of thought and speech could not harm her No Davy I m not I m going to study and grow and learn about many things What things Shoes and ships and sealing wax And cabbages and kings quoted Anne But if you DID want to catch a man how would you go about it I want to know persisted Davy for whom the subject evidently possessed a certain fascination You d better ask missus Boulter said Anne thoughtlessly I think it s likely she knows more about the process than I do I will the next time I see her said Davy gravely Davy If you do cried Anne realizing her mistake But you just told me to protested Davy aggrieved It s time you went to bed decreed Anne by way of getting out of the scrape After Davy had gone to bed Anne wandered down to Victoria Island and sat there alone curtained with fine spun moonlit gloom while the water laughed around her in a duet of brook and wind Anne had always loved that brook Many a dream had she spun over its sparkling water in days gone by She forgot lovelorn youths and the cayenne speeches of malicious neighbors and all the problems of her girlish existence In imagination she sailed over storied seas that wash the distant shining shores of faery lands forlorn where lost Atlantis and Elysium lie with the evening star for pilot to the land of Heart s Desire And she was richer in those dreams than in realities for things seen pass away but the things that are unseen are eternal Chapter II Garlands of Autumn The following week sped swiftly crowded with innumerable last things as Anne called them Good bye calls had to be made and received being pleasant or otherwise according to whether callers and called upon were heartily in sympathy with Anne s hopes or thought she was too much puffed up over going to college and that it was their duty to take her down a peg or two The A V I S gave a farewell party in honor of Anne and Gilbert one evening at the home of Josie Pye choosing that place partly because mister Pye s house was large and convenient partly because it was strongly suspected that the Pye girls would have nothing to do with the affair if their offer of the house for the party was not accepted It was a very pleasant little time for the Pye girls were gracious and said and did nothing to mar the harmony of the occasion which was not according to their wont Josie was unusually amiable so much so that she even remarked condescendingly to Anne Your new dress is rather becoming to you Anne Really you look ALMOST PRETTY in it How kind of you to say so responded Anne with dancing eyes Her sense of humor was developing and the speeches that would have hurt her at fourteen were becoming merely food for amusement now Josie suspected that Anne was laughing at her behind those wicked eyes but she contented herself with whispering to Gertie as they went downstairs that Anne Shirley would put on more airs than ever now that she was going to college you d see All the old crowd was there full of mirth and zest and youthful lightheartedness Diana Barry rosy and dimpled shadowed by the faithful Fred Jane Andrews neat and sensible and plain Ruby Gillis looking her handsomest and brightest in a cream silk blouse with red geraniums in her golden hair Gilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane both trying to keep as near the elusive Anne as possible Carrie Sloane looking pale and melancholy because so it was reported her father would not allow Oliver Kimball to come near the place Moody Spurgeon MacPherson whose round face and objectionable ears were as round and objectionable as ever and Billy Andrews who sat in a corner all the evening chuckled when any one spoke to him and watched Anne Shirley with a grin of pleasure on his broad freckled countenance Anne had known beforehand of the party but she had not known that she and Gilbert were as the founders of the Society to be presented with a very complimentary address and tokens of respect in her case a volume of Shakespeare s plays in Gilbert s a fountain pen She was so taken by surprise and pleased by the nice things said in the address read in Moody Spurgeon s most solemn and ministerial tones that the tears quite drowned the sparkle of her big gray eyes She had worked hard and faithfully for the A V I S and it warmed the cockles of her heart that the members appreciated her efforts so sincerely And they were all so nice and friendly and jolly even the Pye girls had their merits at that moment Anne loved all the world She enjoyed the evening tremendously but the end of it rather spoiled all Gilbert again made the mistake of saying something sentimental to her as they ate their supper on the moonlit verandah and Anne to punish him was gracious to Charlie Sloane and allowed the latter to walk home with her She found however that revenge hurts nobody quite so much as the one who tries to inflict it Gilbert walked airily off with Ruby Gillis and Anne could hear them laughing and talking gaily as they loitered along in the still crisp autumn air They were evidently having the best of good times while she was horribly bored by Charlie Sloane who talked unbrokenly on and never even by accident said one thing that was worth listening to Anne gave an occasional absent yes or no and thought how beautiful Ruby had looked that night how very goggly Charlie s eyes were in the moonlight worse even than by daylight and that the world somehow wasn t quite such a nice place as she had believed it to be earlier in the evening I m just tired out that is what is the matter with me she said when she thankfully found herself alone in her own room And she honestly believed it was But a certain little gush of joy as from some secret unknown spring bubbled up in her heart the next evening when she saw Gilbert striding down through the Haunted Wood and crossing the old log bridge with that firm quick step of his So Gilbert was not going to spend this last evening with Ruby Gillis after all You look tired Anne he said I am tired and worse than that I m disgruntled I m tired because I ve been packing my trunk and sewing all day But I m disgruntled because six women have been here to say good bye to me and every one of the six managed to say something that seemed to take the color right out of life and leave it as gray and dismal and cheerless as a November morning Spiteful old cats was Gilbert s elegant comment Oh no they weren t said Anne seriously That is just the trouble If they had been spiteful cats I wouldn t have minded them But they are all nice kind motherly souls who like me and whom I like and that is why what they said or hinted had such undue weight with me They let me see they thought I was crazy going to Redmond and trying to take a B A and ever since I ve been wondering if I am missus Peter Sloane sighed and said she hoped my strength would hold out till I got through and at once I saw myself a hopeless victim of nervous prostration at the end of my third year missus Eben Wright said it must cost an awful lot to put in four years at Redmond and I felt all over me that it was unpardonable of me to squander Marilla s money and my own on such a folly missus Jasper Bell said she hoped I wouldn t let college spoil me as it did some people and I felt in my bones that the end of my four Redmond years would see me a most insufferable creature thinking I knew it all and looking down on everything and everybody in Avonlea missus Elisha Wright said she understood that Redmond girls especially those who belonged to Kingsport were dreadful dressy and stuck up and she guessed I wouldn t feel much at home among them and I saw myself a snubbed dowdy humiliated country girl shuffling through Redmond s classic halls in coppertoned boots Anne ended with a laugh and a sigh commingled With her sensitive nature all disapproval had weight even the disapproval of those for whose opinions she had scant respect For the time being life was savorless and ambition had gone out like a snuffed candle You surely don t care for what they said protested Gilbert You know exactly how narrow their outlook on life is excellent creatures though they are To do anything THEY have never done is anathema maranatha You are the first Avonlea girl who has ever gone to college and you know that all pioneers are considered to be afflicted with moonstruck madness Oh I know But FEELING is so different from KNOWING My common sense tells me all you can say but there are times when common sense has no power over me Common nonsense takes possession of my soul Really after missus Elisha went away I hardly had the heart to finish packing You re just tired Anne Come forget it all and take a walk with me a ramble back through the woods beyond the marsh There should be something there I want to show you Should be Don t you know if it is there No I only know it should be from something I saw there in spring Come on We ll pretend we are two children again and we ll go the way of the wind They started gaily off Anne remembering the unpleasantness of the preceding evening was very nice to Gilbert and Gilbert who was learning wisdom took care to be nothing save the schoolboy comrade again missus Lynde and Marilla watched them from the kitchen window That ll be a match some day missus Lynde said approvingly Marilla winced slightly In her heart she hoped it would but it went against her grain to hear the matter spoken of in missus Lynde s gossipy matter of fact way They re only children yet she said shortly missus Lynde laughed good naturedly Anne is eighteen I was married when I was that age We old folks Marilla are too much given to thinking children never grow up that s what Anne is a young woman and Gilbert s a man and he worships the ground she walks on as any one can see He s a fine fellow and Anne can t do better I hope she won t get any romantic nonsense into her head at Redmond I don t approve of them coeducational places and never did that s what I don t believe concluded missus Lynde solemnly that the students at such colleges ever do much else than flirt They must study a little said Marilla with a smile Precious little sniffed missus Rachel However I think Anne will She never was flirtatious But she doesn t appreciate Gilbert at his full value that s what Oh I know girls Charlie Sloane is wild about her too but I d never advise her to marry a Sloane The Sloanes are good honest respectable people of course But when all s said and done they re SLOANES Marilla nodded To an outsider the statement that Sloanes were Sloanes might not be very illuminating but she understood Every village has such a family good honest respectable people they may be but SLOANES they are and must ever remain though they speak with the tongues of men and angels Gilbert and Anne happily unconscious that their future was thus being settled by missus Rachel were sauntering through the shadows of the Haunted Wood Beyond the harvest hills were basking in an amber sunset radiance under a pale aerial sky of rose and blue The distant spruce groves were burnished bronze and their long shadows barred the upland meadows But around them a little wind sang among the fir tassels and in it there was the note of autumn This wood really is haunted now by old memories said Anne stooping to gather a spray of ferns bleached to waxen whiteness by frost It seems to me that the little girls Diana and I used to be play here still and sit by the Dryad s Bubble in the twilights trysting with the ghosts Do you know I can never go up this path in the dusk without feeling a bit of the old fright and shiver There was one especially horrifying phantom which we created the ghost of the murdered child that crept up behind you and laid cold fingers on yours I confess that to this day I cannot help fancying its little furtive footsteps behind me when I come here after nightfall I m not afraid of the White Lady or the headless man or the skeletons but I wish I had never imagined that baby s ghost into existence How angry Marilla and missus Barry were over that affair concluded Anne with reminiscent laughter The woods around the head of the marsh were full of purple vistas threaded with gossamers Past a dour plantation of gnarled spruces and a maple fringed sun warm valley they found the something Gilbert was looking for Ah here it is he said with satisfaction An apple tree and away back here exclaimed Anne delightedly Yes a veritable apple bearing apple tree too here in the very midst of pines and beeches a mile away from any orchard I was here one day last spring and found it all white with blossom So I resolved I d come again in the fall and see if it had been apples See it s loaded They look good too tawny as russets but with a dusky red cheek Most wild seedlings are green and uninviting I suppose it sprang years ago from some chance sown seed said Anne dreamily And how it has grown and flourished and held its own here all alone among aliens the brave determined thing Here s a fallen tree with a cushion of moss Sit down Anne it will serve for a woodland throne I ll climb for some apples They all grow high the tree had to reach up to the sunlight The apples proved to be delicious Under the tawny skin was a white white flesh faintly veined with red and besides their own proper apple taste they had a certain wild delightful tang no orchard grown apple ever possessed The fatal apple of Eden couldn t have had a rarer flavor commented Anne But it s time we were going home See it was twilight three minutes ago and now it s moonlight What a pity we couldn t have caught the moment of transformation But such moments never are caught I suppose Let s go back around the marsh and home by way of Lover s Lane Do you feel as disgruntled now as when you started out Anne Not I Those apples have been as manna to a hungry soul I feel that I shall love Redmond and have a splendid four years there And after those four years what Oh there s another bend in the road at their end answered Anne lightly I ve no idea what may be around it I don t want to have It s nicer not to know Lover s Lane was a dear place that night still and mysteriously dim in the pale radiance of the moonlight They loitered through it in a pleasant chummy silence neither caring to talk If Gilbert were always as he has been this evening how nice and simple everything would be reflected Anne Gilbert was looking at Anne as she walked along In her light dress with her slender delicacy she made him think of a white iris I wonder if I can ever make her care for me he thought with a pang of self distrust Chapter III Greeting and Farewell Charlie Sloane Gilbert Blythe and Anne Shirley left Avonlea the following Monday morning Anne had hoped for a fine day Diana was to drive her to the station and they wanted this their last drive together for some time to be a pleasant one But when Anne went to bed Sunday night the east wind was moaning around Green Gables with an ominous prophecy which was fulfilled in the morning Anne awoke to find raindrops pattering against her window and shadowing the pond s gray surface with widening rings hills and sea were hidden in mist and the whole world seemed dim and dreary Anne dressed in the cheerless gray dawn for an early start was necessary to catch the boat train she struggled against the tears that WOULD well up in her eyes in spite of herself She was leaving the home that was so dear to her and something told her that she was leaving it forever save as a holiday refuge Things would never be the same again coming back for vacations would not be living there And oh how dear and beloved everything was that little white porch room sacred to the dreams of girlhood the old Snow Queen at the window the brook in the hollow the Dryad s Bubble the Haunted Woods and Lover s Lane all the thousand and one dear spots where memories of the old years bided Could she ever be really happy anywhere else Breakfast at Green Gables that morning was a rather doleful meal Davy for the first time in his life probably could not eat but blubbered shamelessly over his porridge Nobody else seemed to have much appetite save Dora who tucked away her rations comfortably Dora like the immortal and most prudent Charlotte who went on cutting bread and butter when her frenzied lover s body had been carried past on a shutter was one of those fortunate creatures who are seldom disturbed by anything Even at eight it took a great deal to ruffle Dora s placidity She was sorry Anne was going away of course but was that any reason why she should fail to appreciate a poached egg on toast Not at all And seeing that Davy could not eat his Dora ate it for him Promptly on time Diana appeared with horse and buggy her rosy face glowing above her raincoat The good byes had to be said then somehow missus Lynde came in from her quarters to give Anne a hearty embrace and warn her to be careful of her health whatever she did Marilla brusque and tearless pecked Anne s cheek and said she supposed they d hear from her when she got settled A casual observer might have concluded that Anne s going mattered very little to her unless said observer had happened to get a good look in her eyes Dora kissed Anne primly and squeezed out two decorous little tears but Davy who had been crying on the back porch step ever since they rose from the table refused to say good bye at all When he saw Anne coming towards him he sprang to his feet bolted up the back stairs and hid in a clothes closet out of which he would not come His muffled howls were the last sounds Anne heard as she left Green Gables It rained heavily all the way to Bright River to which station they had to go since the branch line train from Carmody did not connect with the boat train Charlie and Gilbert were on the station platform when they reached it and the train was whistling Anne had just time to get her ticket and trunk check say a hurried farewell to Diana and hasten on board She wished she were going back with Diana to Avonlea she knew she was going to die of homesickness And oh if only that dismal rain would stop pouring down as if the whole world were weeping over summer vanished and joys departed Even Gilbert s presence brought her no comfort for Charlie Sloane was there too and Sloanishness could be tolerated only in fine weather It was absolutely insufferable in rain But when the boat steamed out of Charlottetown harbor things took a turn for the better The rain ceased and the sun began to burst out goldenly now and again between the rents in the clouds burnishing the gray seas with copper hued radiance and lighting up the mists that curtained the Island s red shores with gleams of gold foretokening a fine day after all Besides Charlie Sloane promptly became so seasick that he had to go below and Anne and Gilbert were left alone on deck I am very glad that all the Sloanes get seasick as soon as they go on water thought Anne mercilessly I am sure I couldn t take my farewell look at the ould sod with Charlie standing there pretending to look sentimentally at it too Well we re off remarked Gilbert unsentimentally Yes I feel like Byron s Childe Harold only it isn t really my native shore that I m watching said Anne winking her gray eyes vigorously Nova Scotia is that I suppose But one s native shore is the land one loves the best and that s good old P E I for me I can t believe I didn t always live here Those eleven years before I came seem like a bad dream It s seven years since I crossed on this boat the evening missus Spencer brought me over from Hopetown I can see myself in that dreadful old wincey dress and faded sailor hat exploring decks and cabins with enraptured curiosity It was a fine evening and how those red Island shores did gleam in the sunshine Now I m crossing the strait again Oh Gilbert I do hope I ll like Redmond and Kingsport but I m sure I won t Where s all your philosophy gone Anne It s all submerged under a great swamping wave of loneliness and homesickness I ve longed for three years to go to Redmond and now I m going and I wish I weren t Never mind I shall be cheerful and philosophical again after I have just one good cry I MUST have that as a went and I ll have to wait until I get into my boardinghouse bed tonight wherever it may be before I can have it Then Anne will be herself again I wonder if Davy has come out of the closet yet It was nine that night when their train reached Kingsport and they found themselves in the blue white glare of the crowded station Anne felt horribly bewildered but a moment later she was seized by Priscilla Grant who had come to Kingsport on Saturday Here you are beloved And I suppose you re as tired as I was when I got here Saturday night Tired Priscilla don t talk of it I m tired and green and provincial and only about ten years old For pity s sake take your poor broken down chum to some place where she can hear herself think I ll take you right up to our boardinghouse I ve a cab ready outside It s such a blessing you re here Prissy If you weren t I think I should just sit down on my suitcase here and now and weep bitter tears What a comfort one familiar face is in a howling wilderness of strangers Is that Gilbert Blythe over there Anne How he has grown up this past year He was only a schoolboy when I taught in Carmody And of course that s Charlie Sloane HE hasn t changed couldn t He looked just like that when he was born and he ll look like that when he s eighty This way dear We ll be home in twenty minutes Home groaned Anne You mean we ll be in some horrible boardinghouse in a still more horrible hall bedroom looking out on a dingy back yard It isn t a horrible boardinghouse Anne girl Here s our cab Hop in the driver will get your trunk
112_123216_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes 
none	none	the boardinghouse it s really a very nice place of its kind as you ll admit tomorrow morning when a

none	none	s sleep has turned your blues rosy pink It s a big old fashioned gray stone house on saint John Street just a nice little constitutional from Redmond It used to be the residence of great folk but fashion has deserted saint John Street and its houses only dream now of better days They re so big that people living in them have to take boarders just to fill up At least that is the reason our landladies are very anxious to impress on us They re delicious Anne our landladies I mean How many are there Two Miss Hannah Harvey and Miss Ada Harvey They were born twins about fifty years ago I can t get away from twins it seems smiled Anne Wherever I go they confront me Oh they re not twins now dear After they reached the age of thirty they never were twins again Miss Hannah has grown old not too gracefully and Miss Ada has stayed thirty less gracefully still I don t know whether Miss Hannah can smile or not I ve never caught her at it so far but Miss Ada smiles all the time and that s worse However they re nice kind souls and they take two boarders every year because Miss Hannah s economical soul cannot bear to waste room space not because they need to or have to as Miss Ada has told me seven times since Saturday night As for our rooms I admit they are hall bedrooms and mine does look out on the back yard Your room is a front one and looks out on Old saint John s graveyard which is just across the street That sounds gruesome shivered Anne I think I d rather have the back yard view Oh no you wouldn t Wait and see Old saint John s is a darling place It s been a graveyard so long that it s ceased to be one and has become one of the sights of Kingsport I was all through it yesterday for a pleasure exertion There s a big stone wall and a row of enormous trees all around it and rows of trees all through it and the queerest old tombstones with the queerest and quaintest inscriptions You ll go there to study Anne see if you don t Of course nobody is ever buried there now But a few years ago they put up a beautiful monument to the memory of Nova Scotian soldiers who fell in the Crimean War It is just opposite the entrance gates and there s scope for imagination in it as you used to say Here s your trunk at last and the boys coming to say good night Must I really shake hands with Charlie Sloane Anne His hands are always so cold and fishy feeling We must ask them to call occasionally Miss Hannah gravely told me we could have young gentlemen callers two evenings in the week if they went away at a reasonable hour and Miss Ada asked me smiling please to be sure they didn t sit on her beautiful cushions I promised to see to it but goodness knows where else they CAN sit unless they sit on the floor for there are cushions on EVERYTHING Miss Ada even has an elaborate Battenburg one on top of the piano Anne was laughing by this time Priscilla s gay chatter had the intended effect of cheering her up homesickness vanished for the time being and did not even return in full force when she finally found herself alone in her little bedroom She went to her window and looked out The street below was dim and quiet Across it the moon was shining above the trees in Old saint John s just behind the great dark head of the lion on the monument Anne wondered if it could have been only that morning that she had left Green Gables She had the sense of a long passage of time which one day of change and travel gives I suppose that very moon is looking down on Green Gables now she mused But I won t think about it that way homesickness lies I m not even going to have my good cry I ll put that off to a more convenient season and just now I ll go calmly and sensibly to bed and to sleep Chapter IV April s Lady Kingsport is a quaint old town hearking back to early Colonial days and wrapped in its ancient atmosphere as some fine old dame in garments fashioned like those of her youth Here and there it sprouts out into modernity but at heart it is still unspoiled it is full of curious relics and haloed by the romance of many legends of the past Once it was a mere frontier station on the fringe of the wilderness and those were the days when Indians kept life from being monotonous to the settlers Then it grew to be a bone of contention between the British and the French being occupied now by the one and now by the other emerging from each occupation with some fresh scar of battling nations branded on it It has in its park a martello tower autographed all over by tourists a dismantled old French fort on the hills beyond the town and several antiquated cannon in its public squares It has other historic spots also which may be hunted out by the curious and none is more quaint and delightful than Old saint John s Cemetery at the very core of the town with streets of quiet old time houses on two sides and busy bustling modern thoroughfares on the others Every citizen of Kingsport feels a thrill of possessive pride in Old saint John s for if he be of any pretensions at all he has an ancestor buried there with a queer crooked slab at his head or else sprawling protectively over the grave on which all the main facts of his history are recorded For the most part no great art or skill was lavished on those old tombstones The larger number are of roughly chiselled brown or gray native stone and only in a few cases is there any attempt at ornamentation Some are adorned with skull and cross bones and this grizzly decoration is frequently coupled with a cherub s head Many are prostrate and in ruins Into almost all Time s tooth has been gnawing until some inscriptions have been completely effaced and others can only be deciphered with difficulty The graveyard is very full and very bowery for it is surrounded and intersected by rows of elms and willows beneath whose shade the sleepers must lie very dreamlessly forever crooned to by the winds and leaves over them and quite undisturbed by the clamor of traffic just beyond Anne took the first of many rambles in Old saint John s the next afternoon She and Priscilla had gone to Redmond in the forenoon and registered as students after which there was nothing more to do that day The girls gladly made their escape for it was not exhilarating to be surrounded by crowds of strangers most of whom had a rather alien appearance as if not quite sure where they belonged The freshettes stood about in detached groups of two or three looking askance at each other the freshies wiser in their day and generation had banded themselves together on the big staircase of the entrance hall where they were shouting out glees with all the vigor of youthful lungs as a species of defiance to their traditional enemies the Sophomores a few of whom were prowling loftily about looking properly disdainful of the unlicked cubs on the stairs Gilbert and Charlie were nowhere to be seen Little did I think the day would ever come when I d be glad of the sight of a Sloane said Priscilla as they crossed the campus but I d welcome Charlie s goggle eyes almost ecstatically At least they d be familiar eyes Oh sighed Anne I can t describe how I felt when I was standing there waiting my turn to be registered as insignificant as the teeniest drop in a most enormous bucket It s bad enough to feel insignificant but it s unbearable to have it grained into your soul that you will never can never be anything but insignificant and that is how I did feel as if I were invisible to the naked eye and some of those Sophs might step on me I knew I would go down to my grave unwept unhonored and unsung Wait till next year comforted Priscilla Then we ll be able to look as bored and sophisticated as any Sophomore of them all No doubt it is rather dreadful to feel insignificant but I think it s better than to feel as big and awkward as I did as if I were sprawled all over Redmond That s how I felt I suppose because I was a good two inches taller than any one else in the crowd I wasn t afraid a Soph might walk over me I was afraid they d take me for an elephant or an overgrown sample of a potato fed Islander I suppose the trouble is we can t forgive big Redmond for not being little Queen s said Anne gathering about her the shreds of her old cheerful philosophy to cover her nakedness of spirit When we left Queen s we knew everybody and had a place of our own I suppose we have been unconsciously expecting to take life up at Redmond just where we left off at Queen s and now we feel as if the ground had slipped from under our feet I m thankful that neither missus Lynde nor missus Elisha Wright know or ever will know my state of mind at present They would exult in saying I told you so and be convinced it was the beginning of the end Whereas it is just the end of the beginning Exactly That sounds more Anneish In a little while we ll be acclimated and acquainted and all will be well Anne did you notice the girl who stood alone just outside the door of the coeds dressing room all the morning the pretty one with the brown eyes and crooked mouth Yes I did I noticed her particularly because she seemed the only creature there who LOOKED as lonely and friendless as I FELT I had YOU but she had no one I think she felt pretty all by herselfish too Several times I saw her make a motion as if to cross over to us but she never did it too shy I suppose I wished she would come If I hadn t felt so much like the aforesaid elephant I d have gone to her But I couldn t lumber across that big hall with all those boys howling on the stairs She was the prettiest freshette I saw today but probably favor is deceitful and even beauty is vain on your first day at Redmond concluded Priscilla with a laugh I m going across to Old saint John s after lunch said Anne I don t know that a graveyard is a very good place to go to get cheered up but it seems the only get at able place where there are trees and trees I must have I ll sit on one of those old slabs and shut my eyes and imagine I m in the Avonlea woods Anne did not do that however for she found enough of interest in Old saint John s to keep her eyes wide open They went in by the entrance gates past the simple massive stone arch surmounted by the great lion of England And on Inkerman yet the wild bramble is gory And those bleak heights henceforth shall be famous in story quoted Anne looking at it with a thrill They found themselves in a dim cool green place where winds were fond of purring Up and down the long grassy aisles they wandered reading the quaint voluminous epitaphs carved in an age that had more leisure than our own Here lieth the body of Albert Crawford esquire read Anne from a worn gray slab for many years Keeper of His Majesty s Ordnance at Kingsport He served in the army till the peace of seventeen sixty three when he retired from bad health He was a brave officer the best of husbands the best of fathers the best of friends He died October twenty ninth seventeen ninety two aged eighty four years There s an epitaph for you Prissy There is certainly some scope for imagination in it How full such a life must have been of adventure And as for his personal qualities I m sure human eulogy couldn t go further I wonder if they told him he was all those best things while he was alive Here s another said Priscilla Listen To the memory of Alexander Ross who died on the twenty second of September eighteen forty aged forty three years This is raised as a tribute of affection by one whom he served so faithfully for twenty seven years that he was regarded as a friend deserving the fullest confidence and attachment A very good epitaph commented Anne thoughtfully I wouldn t wish a better We are all servants of some sort and if the fact that we are faithful can be truthfully inscribed on our tombstones nothing more need be added Here s a sorrowful little gray stone Prissy to the memory of a favorite child And here is another erected to the memory of one who is buried elsewhere I wonder where that unknown grave is Really Pris the graveyards of today will never be as interesting as this You were right I shall come here often I love it already I see we re not alone here there s a girl down at the end of this avenue Yes and I believe it s the very girl we saw at Redmond this morning I ve been watching her for five minutes She has started to come up the avenue exactly half a dozen times and half a dozen times has she turned and gone back Either she s dreadfully shy or she has got something on her conscience Let s go and meet her It s easier to get acquainted in a graveyard than at Redmond I believe They walked down the long grassy arcade towards the stranger who was sitting on a gray slab under an enormous willow She was certainly very pretty with a vivid irregular bewitching type of prettiness There was a gloss as of brown nuts on her satin smooth hair and a soft ripe glow on her round cheeks Her eyes were big and brown and velvety under oddly pointed black brows and her crooked mouth was rose red She wore a smart brown suit with two very modish little shoes peeping from beneath it and her hat of dull pink straw wreathed with golden brown poppies had the indefinable unmistakable air which pertains to the creation of an artist in millinery Priscilla had a sudden stinging consciousness that her own hat had been trimmed by her village store milliner and Anne wondered uncomfortably if the blouse she had made herself and which missus Lynde had fitted looked VERY countrified and home made besides the stranger s smart attire For a moment both girls felt like turning back But they had already stopped and turned towards the gray slab It was too late to retreat for the brown eyed girl had evidently concluded that they were coming to speak to her Instantly she sprang up and came forward with outstretched hand and a gay friendly smile in which there seemed not a shadow of either shyness or burdened conscience Oh I want to know who you two girls are she exclaimed eagerly I ve been DYING to know I saw you at Redmond this morning Say wasn t it AWFUL there For the time I wished I had stayed home and got married Anne and Priscilla both broke into unconstrained laughter at this unexpected conclusion The brown eyed girl laughed too I really did I COULD have you know Come let s all sit down on this gravestone and get acquainted It won t be hard I know we re going to adore each other I knew it as soon as I saw you at Redmond this morning I wanted so much to go right over and hug you both Why didn t you asked Priscilla Because I simply couldn t make up my mind to do it I never can make up my mind about anything myself I m always afflicted with indecision Just as soon as I decide to do something I feel in my bones that another course would be the correct one It s a dreadful misfortune but I was born that way and there is no use in blaming me for it as some people do So I couldn t make up my mind to go and speak to you much as I wanted to We thought you were too shy said Anne No no dear Shyness isn t among the many failings or virtues of Philippa Gordon Phil for short Do call me Phil right off Now what are your handles She s Priscilla Grant said Anne pointing And SHE S Anne Shirley said Priscilla pointing in turn And we re from the Island said both together I hail from Bolingbroke Nova Scotia said Philippa Bolingbroke exclaimed Anne Why that is where I was born Do you really mean it Why that makes you a Bluenose after all No it doesn t retorted Anne Wasn t it Dan O Connell who said that if a man was born in a stable it didn t make him a horse I m Island to the core Well I m glad you were born in Bolingbroke anyway It makes us kind of neighbors doesn t it And I like that because when I tell you secrets it won t be as if I were telling them to a stranger I have to tell them I can t keep secrets it s no use to try That s my worst failing that and indecision as aforesaid Would you believe it it took me half an hour to decide which hat to wear when I was coming here HERE to a graveyard At first I inclined to my brown one with the feather but as soon as I put it on I thought this pink one with the floppy brim would be more becoming When I got IT pinned in place I liked the brown one better At last I put them close together on the bed shut my eyes and jabbed with a hat pin The pin speared the pink one so I put it on It is becoming isn t it Tell me what do you think of my looks At this naive demand made in a perfectly serious tone Priscilla laughed again But Anne said impulsively squeezing Philippa s hand We thought this morning that you were the prettiest girl we saw at Redmond Philippa s crooked mouth flashed into a bewitching crooked smile over very white little teeth I thought that myself was her next astounding statement but I wanted some one else s opinion to bolster mine up I can t decide even on my own appearance Just as soon as I ve decided that I m pretty I begin to feel miserably that I m not Besides have a horrible old great aunt who is always saying to me with a mournful sigh You were such a pretty baby It s strange how children change when they grow up I adore aunts but I detest great aunts Please tell me quite often that I am pretty if you don t mind I feel so much more comfortable when I can believe I m pretty And I ll be just as obliging to you if you want me to I CAN be with a clear conscience Thanks laughed Anne but Priscilla and I are so firmly convinced of our own good looks that we don t need any assurance about them so you needn t trouble Oh you re laughing at me I know you think I m abominably vain but I m not There really isn t one spark of vanity in me And I m never a bit grudging about paying compliments to other girls when they deserve them I m so glad I know you folks I came up on Saturday and I ve nearly died of homesickness ever since It s a horrible feeling isn t it In Bolingbroke I m an important personage and in Kingsport I m just nobody There were times when I could feel my soul turning a delicate blue Where do you hang out Thirty eight saint John s Street Better and better Why I m just around the corner on Wallace Street I don t like my boardinghouse though It s bleak and lonesome and my room looks out on such an unholy back yard It s the ugliest place in the world As for cats well surely ALL the Kingsport cats can t congregate there at night but half of them must I adore cats on hearth rugs snoozing before nice friendly fires but cats in back yards at midnight are totally different animals The first night I was here I cried all night and so did the cats You should have seen my nose in the morning How I wished I had never left home I don t know how you managed to make up your mind to come to Redmond at all if you are really such an undecided person said amused Priscilla Bless your heart honey I didn t It was father who wanted me to come here His heart was set on it why I don t know It seems perfectly ridiculous to think of me studying for a B A degree doesn t it Not but what I can do it all right I have heaps of brains Oh said Priscilla vaguely Yes But it s such hard work to use them And B A s are such learned dignified wise solemn creatures they must be No I didn t want to come to Redmond I did it just to oblige father He IS such a duck Besides I knew if I stayed home I d have to get married Mother wanted that wanted it decidedly Mother has plenty of decision But I really hated the thought of being married for a few years yet I want to have heaps of fun before I settle down And ridiculous as the idea of my being a B A is the idea of my being an old married woman is still more absurd isn t it I m only eighteen No I concluded I would rather come to Redmond than be married Besides how could I ever have made up my mind which man to marry Were there so many laughed Anne Heaps The boys like me awfully they really do But there were only two that mattered The rest were all too young and too poor I must marry a rich man you know Why must you Honey you couldn t imagine ME being a poor man s wife could you I can t do a single useful thing and I am VERY extravagant Oh no my husband must have heaps of money So that narrowed them down to two But I couldn t decide between two any easier than between two hundred I knew perfectly well that whichever one I chose I d regret all my life that I hadn t married the other Didn t you love either of them asked Anne a little hesitatingly It was not easy for her to speak to a stranger of the great mystery and transformation of life Goodness no I couldn t love anybody It isn t in me Besides I wouldn t want to Being in love makes you a perfect slave I think And it would give a man such power to hurt you I d be afraid No no Alec and Alonzo are two dear boys and I like them both so much that I really don t know which I like the better That is the trouble Alec is the best looking of course and I simply couldn t marry a man who wasn t handsome He is good tempered too and has lovely curly black hair He s rather too perfect I don t believe I d like a perfect husband somebody I could never find fault with Then why not marry Alonzo asked Priscilla gravely Think of marrying a name like Alonzo said Phil dolefully I don t believe I could endure it But he has a classic nose and it WOULD be a comfort to have a nose in the family that could be depended on I can t depend on mine So far it takes after the Gordon pattern but I m so afraid it will develop Byrne tendencies as I grow older I examine it every day anxiously to make sure it s still Gordon Mother was a Byrne and has the Byrne nose in the Byrnest degree Wait till you see it I adore nice noses Your nose is awfully nice Anne Shirley Alonzo s nose nearly turned the balance in his favor But ALONZO No I couldn t decide If I could have done as I did with the hats stood them both up together shut my eyes and jabbed with a hatpin it would have been quite easy What did Alec and Alonzo feel like when you came away queried Priscilla Oh they still have hope I told them they d have to wait till I could make up my mind They re quite willing to wait They both worship me you know Meanwhile I intend to have a good time I expect I shall have heaps of beaux at Redmond I can t be happy unless I have you know But don t you think the freshmen are fearfully homely I saw only one really handsome fellow among them He went away before you came I heard his chum call him Gilbert His chum had eyes that stuck out THAT FAR But you re not going yet girls Don t go yet I think we must said Anne rather coldly It s getting late and I ve some work to do But you ll both come to see me won t you asked Philippa getting up and putting an arm around each And let me come to see you I want to be chummy with you I ve taken such a fancy to you both And I haven t quite disgusted you with my frivolity have I Not quite laughed Anne responding to Phil s squeeze with a return of cordiality Because I m not half so silly as I seem on the surface you know You just accept Philippa Gordon as the Lord made her with all her faults and I believe you ll come to like her Isn t this graveyard a sweet place I d love to be buried here Here s a grave I didn t see before this one in the iron railing oh girls look see the stone says it s the grave of a middy who was killed in the fight between the Shannon and the Chesapeake Just fancy Anne paused by the railing and looked at the worn stone her pulses thrilling with sudden excitement The old graveyard with its over arching trees and long aisles of shadows faded from her sight Instead she saw the Kingsport Harbor of nearly a century agone Out of the mist came slowly a great frigate brilliant with the meteor flag of England Behind her was another with a still heroic form wrapped in his own starry flag lying on the quarter deck the gallant Lawrence Time s finger had turned back his pages and that was the Shannon sailing triumphant up the bay with the Chesapeake as her prize Come back Anne Shirley come back laughed Philippa pulling her arm You re a hundred years away from us Come back Anne came back with a sigh her eyes were shining softly I ve always loved that old story she said and although the English won that victory I think it was because of the brave defeated commander I love it This grave seems to bring it so near and make it so real This poor little middy was only eighteen He died of desperate wounds received in gallant action so reads his epitaph It is such as a soldier might wish for Before she turned away Anne unpinned the little cluster of purple pansies she wore and dropped it softly on the grave of the boy who had perished in the great sea duel Well what do you think of our new friend asked Priscilla when Phil had left them I like her There is something very lovable about her in spite of all her nonsense I believe as she says herself that she isn t half as silly as she sounds She s a dear kissable baby and I don t know that she ll ever really grow up I like her too said Priscilla decidedly She talks as much about boys as Ruby Gillis does But it always enrages or sickens me to hear Ruby whereas I just wanted to laugh good naturedly at Phil Now what is the why of that There is a difference said Anne meditatively I think it s because Ruby is really so CONSCIOUS of boys She plays at love and love making Besides you feel when she is boasting of her beaux that she is doing it to rub it well into you that you haven t half so many Now when Phil talks of her beaux it sounds as if she was just speaking of chums She really looks upon boys as good comrades and she is pleased when she has dozens of them tagging round simply because she likes to be popular and to be thought popular Even Alex and Alonzo I ll never be able to think of those two names separately after this are to her just two playfellows who want her to play with them all their lives I m glad we met her and I m glad we went to Old saint John s I believe I ve put forth a tiny soul root into Kingsport soil this afternoon I hope so I hate to feel transplanted Chapter V Letters from Home For the next three weeks Anne and Priscilla continued to feel as strangers in a strange land Then suddenly everything seemed to fall into focus Redmond professors classes students studies social doings Life became homogeneous again instead of being made up of detached fragments The Freshmen instead of being a collection of unrelated individuals found themselves a class with a class spirit a class yell class interests class antipathies and class ambitions They won the day in the annual Arts Rush against the Sophomores and thereby gained the respect of all the classes and an enormous confidence giving opinion of themselves For three years the Sophomores had won in the rush that the victory of this year perched upon the Freshmen s banner was attributed to the strategic generalship of Gilbert Blythe who marshalled the campaign and originated certain new tactics which demoralized the Sophs and swept the Freshmen to triumph As a reward of merit he was elected president of the Freshman Class a position of honor and responsibility from a Fresh point of view at least coveted by many He was also invited to join the Lambs Redmondese for Lamba Theta a compliment rarely paid to a Freshman As a preparatory initiation ordeal he had to parade the principal business streets of Kingsport for a whole day wearing a sunbonnet and a voluminous kitchen apron of gaudily flowered calico This he did cheerfully doffing his sunbonnet with courtly grace when he met ladies of his acquaintance Charlie Sloane who had not been asked to join the Lambs told Anne he did not see how Blythe could do it and HE for his part could never humiliate himself so Fancy Charlie Sloane in a caliker apron and a sunbunnit giggled Priscilla He d look exactly like his old Grandmother Sloane Gilbert now looked as much like a man in them as in his own proper habiliments Anne and Priscilla found themselves in the thick of the social life of Redmond That this came about so speedily was due in great measure to Philippa Gordon Philippa was the daughter of a rich and well known man and belonged to an old and exclusive Bluenose family This combined with her beauty and charm a charm acknowledged by all who met her promptly opened the gates of all cliques clubs and classes in Redmond to her and where she went Anne and Priscilla went too Phil adored Anne and Priscilla especially Anne She was a loyal little soul crystal free from any form of snobbishness Love me love my friends seemed to be her unconscious motto Without effort she took them with her into her ever widening circle of acquaintanceship and the two Avonlea girls found their social pathway at Redmond made very easy and pleasant for them to the envy and wonderment of the other freshettes who lacking Philippa s sponsorship were doomed to remain rather on the fringe of things during their first college year To Anne and Priscilla with their more serious views of life Phil remained the amusing lovable baby she had seemed on their first meeting Yet as she said herself she had heaps of brains When or where she found time to study was a mystery for she seemed always in demand for some kind of fun and her home evenings were crowded with callers She had all the beaux that heart could desire for nine tenths of the Freshmen and a big fraction of all the other classes were rivals for her smiles She was naively delighted over this and gleefully recounted each new conquest to Anne and Priscilla with comments that might have made the unlucky lover s ears burn fiercely Alec and Alonzo don t seem to have any serious rival yet remarked Anne teasingly Not one agreed Philippa I write them both every week and tell them all about my young men here I m sure it must amuse them But of course the one I like best I can t get Gilbert Blythe won t take any notice of me except to look at me as if I were a nice little kitten he d like to pat Too well I know the reason I owe you a grudge Queen Anne I really ought to hate you and instead I love you madly and I m miserable if I don t see you every day You re different from any girl I ever knew before When you look at me in a certain way I feel what an insignificant frivolous little beast I am and I long to be better and wiser and stronger And then I make good resolutions but the first nice looking mannie who comes my way knocks them all out of my head Isn t college life magnificent It s so funny to think I hated it that first day But if I hadn t I might never got really acquainted with you Anne please tell me over again that you like me a little bit I yearn to hear it I like you a big bit and I think you re a dear sweet adorable velvety clawless little kitten laughed Anne but I don t see when you ever get time to learn your lessons Phil must have found time for she held her own in every class of her year Even the grumpy old professor of Mathematics who detested coeds and had bitterly opposed their admission to Redmond couldn t floor her She led the freshettes everywhere except in English where Anne Shirley left her far behind Anne herself found the studies of her Freshman year very easy thanks in great part to the steady work she and Gilbert had put in during those two past years in Avonlea This left her more time for a social life which she thoroughly enjoyed But never for a moment did she forget Avonlea and the friends there To her the happiest moments in each week were those in which letters came from home It was not until she had got her first letters that she began to think she could ever like Kingsport or feel at home there Before they came Avonlea had seemed thousands of miles away those letters brought it near and linked the old life to the new so closely that they began to seem one and the same instead of two hopelessly segregated existences The first batch contained six letters from Jane Andrews Ruby Gillis Diana Barry Marilla missus Lynde and Davy Jane s was a copperplate production with every t nicely crossed and every i precisely dotted and not an interesting sentence in it She never mentioned the school concerning which Anne was avid to hear she never answered one of the questions Anne had asked in her letter But she told Anne how many yards of lace she had recently crocheted and the kind of weather they were having in Avonlea and how she intended to have her new dress made and the way she felt when her head ached Ruby Gillis wrote a gushing epistle deploring Anne s absence assuring her she was horribly missed in everything asking what the Redmond fellows were like and filling the rest with accounts of her own harrowing experiences with her numerous admirers It was a silly harmless letter and Anne would have laughed over it had it not been for the postscript Gilbert seems to be enjoying Redmond judging from his letters wrote Ruby I don t think Charlie is so stuck on it So Gilbert was writing to Ruby Very well He had a perfect right to of course Only Anne did not know that Ruby had written the first letter and that Gilbert had answered it from mere courtesy She tossed Ruby s letter aside contemptuously But it took all Diana s breezy newsy delightful epistle to banish the sting of Ruby s postscript Diana s letter contained a little too much Fred but was otherwise crowded and crossed with items of interest and Anne almost felt herself back in Avonlea while reading it Marilla s was a rather prim and colorless epistle severely innocent of gossip or emotion Yet somehow it conveyed to Anne a whiff of the wholesome simple life at Green Gables with its savor of ancient peace and the steadfast abiding love that was there for her missus Lynde s letter was full of church news Having broken up housekeeping missus Lynde had more time than ever to devote to church affairs and had flung herself into them heart and soul She was at present much worked up over the poor supplies they were having in the vacant Avonlea pulpit I don t believe any but fools enter the ministry nowadays she wrote bitterly Such candidates as they have sent us and such stuff as they preach Half of it ain t true and what s worse it ain t sound doctrine The one we have now is the worst of the lot He mostly takes a text and preaches about something else And he says he doesn t believe all the heathen will be eternally lost The idea If they won t all the money we ve been giving to Foreign Missions will be clean wasted that s what Last Sunday night he announced that next Sunday he d preach on the axe head that swam I think he d better confine himself to the Bible and leave sensational subjects alone Things have come to a pretty pass if a minister can t find enough in Holy Writ to preach about that s what What church do you attend Anne I hope you go regularly People are apt to get so careless about church going away from home and I understand college students are great sinners in this respect I m told many of them actually study their lessons on Sunday I hope you ll never sink that low Anne Remember how you were brought up And be very careful what friends you make You never know what sort of creatures are in them colleges Outwardly they may be as whited sepulchers and inwardly as ravening wolves that s what You d better not have anything to say to any young man who isn t from the Island I forgot to tell you what happened the day the minister called here It was the funniest thing I ever saw I said to Marilla If Anne had been here wouldn t she have had a laugh Even Marilla laughed You know he s a very short fat little man with bow legs Well that old pig of mister Harrison s the big tall one had wandered over here that day again and broke into the yard and it got into the back porch unbeknowns to us and it was there when the minister appeared in the doorway It made one wild bolt to get out but there was nowhere to bolt to except between them bow legs So there it went and being as it was so big and the minister so little it took him clean off his feet and carried him away His hat went one way and his cane another just as Marilla and I got to the door I ll never forget the look of him And that poor pig was near scared to death I ll never be able to read that account in the Bible of the swine that rushed madly down the steep place into the sea without seeing mister Harrison s pig careering down the hill with that minister I guess the pig thought he had the Old Boy on his back instead of inside of him I was thankful the twins weren t about It wouldn t have been the right thing for them to have seen a minister in such an undignified predicament Just before they got to the brook the minister jumped off or fell off The pig rushed through the brook like mad and up through the woods Marilla and I run down and helped the minister get up and brush his coat He wasn t hurt but he was mad He seemed to hold Marilla and me responsible for it all though we told him the pig didn t belong to us and had been pestering us all summer Besides what did he come to the back door for You d never have caught mister Allan doing that It ll be a long time before we get a man like mister Allan But it s an ill wind that blows no good We ve never seen hoof or hair of that pig since and it s my belief we never will Things is pretty quiet in Avonlea I don t find Green Gables as lonesome as I expected I think I ll start another cotton warp quilt this winter missus Silas Sloane has a handsome new apple leaf pattern When I feel that I must have some excitement I read the murder trials in that Boston paper my niece sends me I never used to do it but they re real interesting The States must be an awful place I hope you ll never go there Anne But the way girls roam over the earth now is something terrible It always makes me think of Satan in the Book of Job going to and fro and walking up and down I don t believe the Lord ever intended it that s what Davy has been pretty good since you went away One day

none	none	and Marilla punished him by making him wear Dora s apron all day and then he went and cut all Dora s aprons up I spanked him for that and then he went and chased my rooster to death The MacPhersons have moved down to my place She s a great housekeeper and very particular She s rooted all my June lilies up because she says they make a garden look so untidy Thomas set them lilies out

much about her insides I wonder said Anne as she folded up her letters what missus Lynde would think of Philippa Chapter VI In the Park What are you going to do with yourselves today girls asked Philippa popping into Anne s room one Saturday afternoon We are going for a walk in the park answered Anne I ought to stay in and finish my blouse But I couldn t sew on a day like this There s something in the air that gets into my blood and makes a sort of glory in my soul My fingers would twitch and I d sew a crooked seam So it s ho for the park and the pines Does we include any one but yourself and Priscilla Yes it includes Gilbert and Charlie and we ll be very glad if it will include you also But said Philippa dolefully if I go I ll have to be gooseberry and that will be a new experience for Philippa Gordon Well new experiences are broadening Come along and you ll be able to sympathize with all poor souls who have to play gooseberry often But where are all the victims Oh I was tired of them all and simply couldn t be bothered with any of them today Besides I ve been feeling a little blue just a pale elusive azure It isn t serious enough for anything darker I wrote Alec and Alonzo last week I put the letters into envelopes and addressed them but I didn t seal them up That evening something funny happened That is Alec would think it funny but Alonzo wouldn t be likely to I was in a hurry so I snatched Alec s letter as I thought out of the envelope and scribbled down a postscript Then I mailed both letters I got Alonzo s reply this morning Girls I had put that postscript to his letter and he was furious Of course he ll get over it and I don t care if he doesn t but it spoiled my day So I thought I d come to you darlings to get cheered up After the football season opens I won t have any spare Saturday afternoons I adore football I ve got the most gorgeous cap and sweater striped in Redmond colors to wear to the games To be sure a little way off I ll look like a walking barber s pole Do you know that that Gilbert of yours has been elected Captain of the Freshman football team Yes he told us so last evening said Priscilla seeing that outraged Anne would not answer He and Charlie were down We knew they were coming so we painstakingly put out of sight or out of reach all Miss Ada s cushions That very elaborate one with the raised embroidery I dropped on the floor in the corner behind the chair it was on I thought it would be safe there But would you believe it Charlie Sloane made for that chair noticed the cushion behind it solemnly fished it up and sat on it the whole evening Such a wreck of a cushion as it was Poor Miss Ada asked me today still smiling but oh so reproachfully why I had allowed it to be sat upon I told her I hadn t that it was a matter of predestination coupled with inveterate Sloanishness and I wasn t a match for both combined Miss Ada s cushions are really getting on my nerves said Anne She finished two new ones last week stuffed and embroidered within an inch of their lives There being absolutely no other cushionless place to put them she stood them up against the wall on the stair landing They topple over half the time and if we come up or down the stairs in the dark we fall over them Last Sunday when doctor Davis prayed for all those exposed to the perils of the sea I added in thought and for all those who live in houses where cushions are loved not wisely but too well There we re ready and I see the boys coming through Old saint John s Do you cast in your lot with us Phil I ll go if I can walk with Priscilla and Charlie That will be a bearable degree of gooseberry That Gilbert of yours is a darling Anne but why does he go around so much with Goggle eyes Anne stiffened She had no great liking for Charlie Sloane but he was of Avonlea so no outsider had any business to laugh at him Charlie and Gilbert have always been friends she said coldly Charlie is a nice boy He s not to blame for his eyes Don t tell me that He is He must have done something dreadful in a previous existence to be punished with such eyes Pris and I are going to have such sport with him this afternoon We ll make fun of him to his face and he ll never know it Doubtless the abandoned P s as Anne called them did carry out their amiable intentions But Sloane was blissfully ignorant he thought he was quite a fine fellow to be walking with two such coeds especially Philippa Gordon the class beauty and belle It must surely impress Anne She would see that some people appreciated him at his real value Gilbert and Anne loitered a little behind the others enjoying the calm still beauty of the autumn afternoon under the pines of the park on the road that climbed and twisted round the harbor shore The silence here is like a prayer isn t it said Anne her face upturned to the shining sky How I love the pines They seem to strike their roots deep into the romance of all the ages It is so comforting to creep away now and then for a good talk with them I always feel so happy out here And so in mountain solitudes o ertaken As by some spell divine Their cares drop from them like the needles shaken From out the gusty pine quoted Gilbert They make our little ambitions seem rather petty don t they Anne I think if ever any great sorrow came to me I would come to the pines for comfort said Anne dreamily I hope no great sorrow ever will come to you Anne said Gilbert who could not connect the idea of sorrow with the vivid joyous creature beside him unwitting that those who can soar to the highest heights can also plunge to the deepest depths and that the natures which enjoy most keenly are those which also suffer most sharply But there must sometime mused Anne Life seems like a cup of glory held to my lips just now But there must be some bitterness in it there is in every cup I shall taste mine some day Well I hope I shall be strong and brave to meet it And I hope it won t be through my own fault that it will come Do you remember what doctor Davis said last Sunday evening that the sorrows God sent us brought comfort and strength with them while the sorrows we brought on ourselves through folly or wickedness were by far the hardest to bear But we mustn t talk of sorrow on an afternoon like this It s meant for the sheer joy of living isn t it If I had my way I d shut everything out of your life but happiness and pleasure Anne said Gilbert in the tone that meant danger ahead Then you would be very unwise rejoined Anne hastily I m sure no life can be properly developed and rounded out without some trial and sorrow though I suppose it is only when we are pretty comfortable that we admit it Come the others have got to the pavilion and are beckoning to us They all sat down in the little pavilion to watch an autumn sunset of deep red fire and pallid gold To their left lay Kingsport its roofs and spires dim in their shroud of violet smoke To their right lay the harbor taking on tints of rose and copper as it stretched out into the sunset Before them the water shimmered satin smooth and silver gray and beyond clean shaven William s Island loomed out of the mist guarding the town like a sturdy bulldog Its lighthouse beacon flared through the mist like a baleful star and was answered by another in the far horizon Did you ever see such a strong looking place asked Philippa I don t want William s Island especially but I m sure I couldn t get it if I did Look at that sentry on the summit of the fort right beside the flag Doesn t he look as if he had stepped out of a romance Speaking of romance said Priscilla we ve been looking for heather but of course we couldn t find any It s too late in the season I suppose Heather exclaimed Anne Heather doesn t grow in America does it There are just two patches of it in the whole continent said Phil one right here in the park and one somewhere else in Nova Scotia I forget where The famous Highland Regiment the Black Watch camped here one year and when the men shook out the straw of their beds in the spring some seeds of heather took root Oh how delightful said enchanted Anne Let s go home around by Spofford Avenue suggested Gilbert We can see all the handsome houses where the wealthy nobles dwell Spofford Avenue is the finest residential street in Kingsport Nobody can build on it unless he s a millionaire Oh do said Phil There s a perfectly killing little place I want to show you Anne IT wasn t built by a millionaire It s the first place after you leave the park and must have grown while Spofford Avenue was still a country road It DID grow it wasn t built I don t care for the houses on the Avenue They re too brand new and plateglassy But this little spot is a dream and its name but wait till you see it They saw it as they walked up the pine fringed hill from the park Just on the crest where Spofford Avenue petered out into a plain road was a little white frame house with groups of pines on either side of it stretching their arms protectingly over its low roof It was covered with red and gold vines through which its green shuttered windows peeped Before it was a tiny garden surrounded by a low stone wall October though it was the garden was still very sweet with dear old fashioned unworldly flowers and shrubs sweet may southern wood lemon verbena alyssum petunias marigolds and chrysanthemums A tiny brick wall in herring bone pattern led from the gate to the front porch The whole place might have been transplanted from some remote country village yet there was something about it that made its nearest neighbor the big lawn encircled palace of a tobacco king look exceedingly crude and showy and ill bred by contrast As Phil said it was the difference between being born and being made It s the dearest place I ever saw said Anne delightedly It gives me one of my old delightful funny aches It s dearer and quainter than even Miss Lavendar s stone house It s the name I want you to notice especially said Phil Look in white letters around the archway over the gate Patty s Place Isn t that killing Especially on this Avenue of Pinehursts and Elmwolds and Cedarcrofts Patty s Place if you please I adore it Have you any idea who Patty is asked Priscilla Patty Spofford is the name of the old lady who owns it I ve discovered She lives there with her niece and they ve lived there for hundreds of years more or less maybe a little less Anne Exaggeration is merely a flight of poetic fancy I understand that wealthy folk have tried to buy the lot time and again it s really worth a small fortune now you know but Patty won t sell upon any consideration And there s an apple orchard behind the house in place of a back yard you ll see it when we get a little past a real apple orchard on Spofford Avenue I m going to dream about Patty s Place tonight said Anne Why I feel as if I belonged to it I wonder if by any chance we ll ever see the inside of it It isn t likely said Priscilla Anne smiled mysteriously No it isn t likely But I believe it will happen I have a queer creepy crawly feeling you can call it a presentiment if you like that Patty s Place and I are going to be better acquainted yet Chapter VII Home Again Those first three weeks at Redmond had seemed long but the rest of the term flew by on wings of wind Before they realized it the Redmond students found themselves in the grind of Christmas examinations emerging therefrom more or less triumphantly The honor of leading in the Freshman classes fluctuated between Anne Gilbert and Philippa Priscilla did very well Charlie Sloane scraped through respectably and comported himself as complacently as if he had led in everything I can t really believe that this time tomorrow I ll be in Green Gables said Anne on the night before departure But I shall be And you Phil will be in Bolingbroke with Alec and Alonzo I m longing to see them admitted Phil between the chocolate she was nibbling They really are such dear boys you know There s to be no end of dances and drives and general jamborees I shall never forgive you Queen Anne for not coming home with me for the holidays Never means three days with you Phil It was dear of you to ask me and I d love to go to Bolingbroke some day But I can t go this year I MUST go home You don t know how my heart longs for it You won t have much of a time said Phil scornfully There ll be one or two quilting parties I suppose and all the old gossips will talk you over to your face and behind your back You ll die of lonesomeness child In Avonlea said Anne highly amused Now if you d come with me you d have a perfectly gorgeous time Bolingbroke would go wild over you Queen Anne your hair and your style and oh everything You re so DIFFERENT You d be such a success and I would bask in reflected glory not the rose but near the rose Do come after all Anne Your picture of social triumphs is quite fascinating Phil but I ll paint one to offset it I m going home to an old country farmhouse once green rather faded now set among leafless apple orchards There is a brook below and a December fir wood beyond where I ve heard harps swept by the fingers of rain and wind There is a pond nearby that will be gray and brooding now There will be two oldish ladies in the house one tall and thin one short and fat and there will be two twins one a perfect model the other what missus Lynde calls a holy terror There will be a little room upstairs over the porch where old dreams hang thick and a big fat glorious feather bed which will almost seem the height of luxury after a boardinghouse mattress How do you like my picture Phil It seems a very dull one said Phil with a grimace Oh but I ve left out the transforming thing said Anne softly There ll be love there Phil faithful tender love such as I ll never find anywhere else in the world love that s waiting for me That makes my picture a masterpiece doesn t it even if the colors are not very brilliant Phil silently got up tossed her box of chocolates away went up to Anne and put her arms about her Anne I wish I was like you she said soberly Diana met Anne at the Carmody station the next night and they drove home together under silent star sown depths of sky Green Gables had a very festal appearance as they drove up the lane There was a light in every window the glow breaking out through the darkness like flame red blossoms swung against the dark background of the Haunted Wood And in the yard was a brave bonfire with two gay little figures dancing around it one of which gave an unearthly yell as the buggy turned in under the poplars Davy means that for an Indian war whoop said Diana mister Harrison s hired boy taught it to him and he s been practicing it up to welcome you with missus Lynde says it has worn her nerves to a frazzle He creeps up behind her you know and then lets go He was determined to have a bonfire for you too He s been piling up branches for a fortnight and pestering Marilla to be let pour some kerosene oil over it before setting it on fire I guess she did by the smell though missus Lynde said up to the last that Davy would blow himself and everybody else up if he was let Anne was out of the buggy by this time and Davy was rapturously hugging her knees while even Dora was clinging to her hand Isn t that a bully bonfire Anne Just let me show you how to poke it see the sparks I did it for you Anne cause I was so glad you were coming home The kitchen door opened and Marilla s spare form darkened against the inner light She preferred to meet Anne in the shadows for she was horribly afraid that she was going to cry with joy she stern repressed Marilla who thought all display of deep emotion unseemly missus Lynde was behind her sonsy kindly matronly as of yore The love that Anne had told Phil was waiting for her surrounded her and enfolded her with its blessing and its sweetness Nothing after all could compare with old ties old friends and old Green Gables How starry Anne s eyes were as they sat down to the loaded supper table how pink her cheeks how silver clear her laughter And Diana was going to stay all night too How like the dear old times it was And the rose bud tea set graced the table With Marilla the force of nature could no further go I suppose you and Diana will now proceed to talk all night said Marilla sarcastically as the girls went upstairs Marilla was always sarcastic after any self betrayal Yes agreed Anne gaily but I m going to put Davy to bed first He insists on that You bet said Davy as they went along the hall I want somebody to say my prayers to again It s no fun saying them alone You don t say them alone Davy God is always with you to hear you Well I can t see Him objected Davy I want to pray to somebody I can see but I WON T say them to missus Lynde or Marilla there now Nevertheless when Davy was garbed in his gray flannel nighty he did not seem in a hurry to begin He stood before Anne shuffling one bare foot over the other and looked undecided Come dear kneel down said Anne Davy came and buried his head in Anne s lap but he did not kneel down Anne he said in a muffled voice I don t feel like praying after all I haven t felt like it for a week now I I DIDN T pray last night nor the night before Why not Davy asked Anne gently You you won t be mad if I tell you implored Davy Anne lifted the little gray flannelled body on her knee and cuddled his head on her arm Do I ever get mad when you tell me things Davy No o o you never do But you get sorry and that s worse You ll be awful sorry when I tell you this Anne and you ll be shamed of me I s pose Have you done something naughty Davy and is that why you can t say your prayers No I haven t done anything naughty yet But I want to do it What is it Davy I I want to say a bad word Anne blurted out Davy with a desperate effort I heard mister Harrison s hired boy say it one day last week and ever since I ve been wanting to say it ALL the time even when I m saying my prayers Say it then Davy Davy lifted his flushed face in amazement But Anne it s an AWFUL bad word SAY IT Davy gave her another incredulous look then in a low voice he said the dreadful word The next minute his face was burrowing against her Oh Anne I ll never say it again never I ll never WANT to say it again I knew it was bad but I didn t s pose it was so so I didn t s pose it was like THAT No I don t think you ll ever want to say it again Davy or think it either And I wouldn t go about much with mister Harrison s hired boy if I were you He can make bully war whoops said Davy a little regretfully But you don t want your mind filled with bad words do you Davy words that will poison it and drive out all that is good and manly No said Davy owl eyed with introspection Then don t go with those people who use them And now do you feel as if you could say your prayers Davy Oh yes said Davy eagerly wriggling down on his knees I can say them now all right I ain t scared now to say if I should die before I wake like I was when I was wanting to say that word Probably Anne and Diana did empty out their souls to each other that night but no record of their confidences has been preserved They both looked as fresh and bright eyed at breakfast as only youth can look after unlawful hours of revelry and confession There had been no snow up to this time but as Diana crossed the old log bridge on her homeward way the white flakes were beginning to flutter down over the fields and woods russet and gray in their dreamless sleep Soon the far away slopes and hills were dim and wraith like through their gauzy scarfing as if pale autumn had flung a misty bridal veil over her hair and was waiting for her wintry bridegroom So they had a white Christmas after all and a very pleasant day it was In the forenoon letters and gifts came from Miss Lavendar and Paul Anne opened them in the cheerful Green Gables kitchen which was filled with what Davy sniffing in ecstasy called pretty smells Miss Lavendar and mister Irving are settled in their new home now reported Anne I am sure Miss Lavendar is perfectly happy I know it by the general tone of her letter but there s a note from Charlotta the Fourth She doesn t like Boston at all and she is fearfully homesick Miss Lavendar wants me to go through to Echo Lodge some day while I m home and light a fire to air it and see that the cushions aren t getting moldy I think I ll get Diana to go over with me next week and we can spend the evening with Theodora Dix I want to see Theodora By the way is Ludovic Speed still going to see her They say so said Marilla and he s likely to continue it Folks have given up expecting that that courtship will ever arrive anywhere I d hurry him up a bit if I was Theodora that s what said missus Lynde And there is not the slightest doubt but that she would There was also a characteristic scrawl from Philippa full of Alec and Alonzo what they said and what they did and how they looked when they saw her But I can t make up my mind yet which to marry wrote Phil I do wish you had come with me to decide for me Some one will have to When I saw Alec my heart gave a great thump and I thought He might be the right one And then when Alonzo came thump went my heart again So that s no guide though it should be according to all the novels I ve ever read Now Anne YOUR heart wouldn t thump for anybody but the genuine Prince Charming would it There must be something radically wrong with mine But I m having a perfectly gorgeous time How I wish you were here It s snowing today and I m rapturous I was so afraid we d have a green Christmas and I loathe them You know when Christmas is a dirty grayey browney affair looking as if it had been left over a hundred years ago and had been in soak ever since it is called a GREEN Christmas Don t ask me why As Lord Dundreary says there are thome thingth no fellow can underthtand Anne did you ever get on a street car and then discover that you hadn t any money with you to pay your fare I did the other day It s quite awful I had a nickel with me when I got on the car I thought it was in the left pocket of my coat When I got settled down comfortably I felt for it It wasn t there I had a cold chill I felt in the other pocket Not there I had another chill Then I felt in a little inside pocket All in vain I had two chills at once I took off my gloves laid them on the seat and went over all my pockets again It was not there I stood up and shook myself and then looked on the floor The car was full of people who were going home from the opera and they all stared at me but I was past caring for a little thing like that But I could not find my fare I concluded I must have put it in my mouth and swallowed it inadvertently I didn t know what to do Would the conductor I wondered stop the car and put me off in ignominy and shame Was it possible that I could convince him that I was merely the victim of my own absentmindedness and not an unprincipled creature trying to obtain a ride upon false pretenses How I wished that Alec or Alonzo were there But they weren t because I wanted them If I HADN T wanted them they would have been there by the dozen And I couldn t decide what to say to the conductor when he came around As soon as I got one sentence of explanation mapped out in my mind I felt nobody could believe it and I must compose another It seemed there was nothing to do but trust in Providence and for all the comfort that gave me I might as well have been the old lady who when told by the captain during a storm that she must put her trust in the Almighty exclaimed Oh Captain is it as bad as that Just at the conventional moment when all hope had fled and the conductor was holding out his box to the passenger next to me I suddenly remembered where I had put that wretched coin of the realm I hadn t swallowed it after all I meekly fished it out of the index finger of my glove and poked it in the box I smiled at everybody and felt that it was a beautiful world The visit to Echo Lodge was not the least pleasant of many pleasant holiday outings Anne and Diana went back to it by the old way of the beech woods carrying a lunch basket with them Echo Lodge which had been closed ever since Miss Lavendar s wedding was briefly thrown open to wind and sunshine once more and firelight glimmered again in the little rooms The perfume of Miss Lavendar s rose bowl still filled the air It was hardly possible to believe that Miss Lavendar would not come tripping in presently with her brown eyes a star with welcome and that Charlotta the Fourth blue of bow and wide of smile would not pop through the door Paul too seemed hovering around with his fairy fancies It really makes me feel a little bit like a ghost revisiting the old time glimpses of the moon laughed Anne Let s go out and see if the echoes are at home Bring the old horn It is still behind the kitchen door The echoes were at home over the white river as silver clear and multitudinous as ever and when they had ceased to answer the girls locked up Echo Lodge again and went away in the perfect half hour that follows the rose and saffron of a winter sunset Chapter VIII Anne s First Proposal The old year did not slip away in a green twilight with a pinky yellow sunset Instead it went out with a wild white bluster and blow It was one of the nights when the storm wind hurtles over the frozen meadows and black hollows and moans around the eaves like a lost creature and drives the snow sharply against the shaking panes Just the sort of night people like to cuddle down between their blankets and count their mercies said Anne to Jane Andrews who had come up to spend the afternoon and stay all night But when they were cuddled between their blankets in Anne s little porch room it was not her mercies of which Jane was thinking Anne she said very solemnly I want to tell you something May I Anne was feeling rather sleepy after the party Ruby Gillis had given the night before She would much rather have gone to sleep than listen to Jane s confidences which she was sure would bore her She had no prophetic inkling of what was coming Probably Jane was engaged too rumor averred that Ruby Gillis was engaged to the Spencervale schoolteacher about whom all the girls were said to be quite wild I ll soon be the only fancy free maiden of our old quartet thought Anne drowsily Aloud she said Of course Anne said Jane still more solemnly what do you think of my brother Billy Anne gasped over this unexpected question and floundered helplessly in her thoughts Goodness what DID she think of Billy Andrews She had never thought ANYTHING about him round faced stupid perpetually smiling good natured Billy Andrews Did ANYBODY ever think about Billy Andrews I I don t understand Jane she stammered What do you mean exactly Do you like Billy asked Jane bluntly Why why yes I like him of course gasped Anne wondering if she were telling the literal truth Certainly she did not DISlike Billy But could the indifferent tolerance with which she regarded him when he happened to be in her range of vision be considered positive enough for liking WHAT was Jane trying to elucidate Would you like him for a husband asked Jane calmly A husband Anne had been sitting up in bed the better to wrestle with the problem of her exact opinion of Billy Andrews Now she fell flatly back on her pillows the very breath gone out of her Whose husband Yours of course answered Jane Billy wants to marry you He s always been crazy about you and now father has given him the upper farm in his own name and there s nothing to prevent him from getting married But he s so shy he couldn t ask you himself if you d have him so he got me to do it I d rather not have but he gave me no peace till I said I would if I got a good chance What do you think about it Anne Was it a dream Was it one of those nightmare things in which you find yourself engaged or married to some one you hate or don t know without the slightest idea how it ever came about No she Anne Shirley was lying there wide awake in her own bed and Jane Andrews was beside her calmly proposing for her brother Billy Anne did not know whether she wanted to writhe or laugh but she could do neither for Jane s feelings must not be hurt I I couldn t marry Bill you know Jane she managed to gasp Why such an idea never occurred to me never I don t suppose it did agreed Jane Billy has always been far too shy to think of courting But you might think it over Anne Billy is a good fellow I must say that if he is my brother He has no bad habits and he s a great worker and you can depend on him A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush He told me to tell you he d be quite willing to wait till you got through college if you insisted though he d RATHER get married this spring before the planting begins He d always be very good to you I m sure and you know Anne I d love to have you for a sister I can t marry Billy said Anne decidedly She had recovered her wits and was even feeling a little angry It was all so ridiculous There is no use thinking of it Jane I don t care anything for him in that way and you must tell him so Well I didn t suppose you would said Jane with a resigned sigh feeling that she had done her best I told Billy I didn t believe it was a bit of use to ask you but he insisted Well you ve made your decision Anne and I hope you won t regret it Jane spoke rather coldly She had been perfectly sure that the enamored Billy had no chance at all of inducing Anne to marry him Nevertheless she felt a little resentment that Anne Shirley who was after all merely an adopted orphan without kith or kin should refuse her brother one of the Avonlea Andrews Well pride sometimes goes before a fall Jane reflected ominously Anne permitted herself to smile in the darkness over the idea that she might ever regret not marrying Billy Andrews I hope Billy won t feel very badly over it she said nicely Jane made a movement as if she were tossing her head on her pillow Oh he won t break his heart Billy has too much good sense for that He likes Nettie Blewett pretty well too and mother would rather he married her than any one She s such a good manager and saver I think when Billy is once sure you won t have him he ll take Nettie Please don t mention this to any one will you Anne Certainly not said Anne who had no desire whatever to publish abroad the fact that Billy Andrews wanted to marry her preferring her when all was said and done to Nettie Blewett Nettie Blewett And now I suppose we d better go to sleep suggested Jane To sleep went Jane easily and speedily but though very unlike MacBeth in most respects she had certainly contrived to murder sleep for Anne That proposed to damsel lay on a wakeful pillow until the wee sma s but her meditations were far from being romantic It was not however until the next morning that she had an opportunity to indulge in a good laugh over the whole affair When Jane had gone home still with a hint of frost in voice and manner because Anne had declined so ungratefully and decidedly the honor of an alliance with the House of Andrews Anne retreated to the porch room shut the door and had her laugh out at last If I could only share the joke with some one she thought But I can t Diana is the only one I d want to tell and even if I hadn t sworn secrecy to Jane I can t tell Diana things now She tells everything to Fred I know she does Well I ve had my first proposal I supposed it would come some day but I certainly never thought it would be by proxy It s awfully funny and yet there s a sting in it too somehow Anne knew quite well wherein the sting consisted though she did not put it into words She had had her secret dreams of the first time some one should ask her the great question And it had in those dreams always been very romantic and beautiful and the some one was to be very handsome and dark eyed and distinguished looking and eloquent whether he were Prince Charming to be enraptured with yes or one to whom a regretful beautifully worded but hopeless refusal must be given If the latter the refusal was to be expressed so delicately that it would be next best thing to acceptance and he would go away after kissing her hand assuring her of his unalterable life long devotion And it would always be a beautiful memory to be proud of and a little sad about also And now this thrilling experience had turned out to be merely grotesque Billy Andrews had got his sister to propose for him because his father had given him the upper farm and if Anne wouldn t have him Nettie Blewett would There was romance for you with a vengeance Anne laughed and then sighed The bloom had been brushed from one little maiden dream Would the painful process go on until everything became prosaic and hum drum Chapter IX An Unwelcome Lover and a Welcome Friend The second term at Redmond sped as quickly as had the first actually whizzed away Philippa said Anne enjoyed it thoroughly in all its phases the stimulating class rivalry the making and deepening of new and helpful friendships the gay little social stunts the doings of the various societies of which she was a member the widening of horizons and interests She studied hard for she had made up her mind to win the Thorburn Scholarship in English This being won meant that she could come back to Redmond the next year without trenching on Marilla s small savings something Anne was determined she would not do Gilbert too was in full chase after a scholarship but found plenty of time for frequent calls at Thirty eight saint John s He was Anne s escort at nearly all the college affairs and she knew that their names were coupled in Redmond gossip Anne raged over this but was helpless she could not cast an old friend like Gilbert aside especially when he had grown suddenly wise and wary as behooved him in the dangerous proximity of more than one Redmond youth who would gladly have taken his place by the side of the slender red haired coed whose gray eyes were as alluring as stars of evening Anne was never attended by the crowd of willing victims who hovered around Philippa s conquering march through her Freshman year but there was a lanky brainy Freshie a jolly little round Sophomore and a tall learned Junior who all liked to call at Thirty eight saint John s and talk over ologies and isms as well as lighter subjects with Anne in the becushioned parlor of that domicile Gilbert did not love any of them and he was exceedingly careful to give none of them the advantage over him by any untimely display of his real feelings Anne ward To her he had become again the boy comrade of Avonlea days and as such could hold his own against any smitten swain who had so far entered the lists against him As a companion Anne honestly acknowledged nobody could be so satisfactory as Gilbert she was very glad so she told herself that he had evidently dropped all nonsensical ideas though she spent considerable time secretly wondering why Only one disagreeable incident marred that winter Charlie Sloane sitting bolt upright on Miss Ada s most dearly beloved cushion asked Anne one night if she would promise to become missus Charlie Sloane some day Coming after Billy Andrews proxy effort this was not quite the shock to Anne s romantic sensibilities that it would otherwise have been but it was certainly another heart rending disillusion She was angry too for she felt that she had never given Charlie the slightest encouragement to suppose such a thing possible But what could you expect of a Sloane as missus Rachel Lynde would ask scornfully Charlie s whole attitude tone air words fairly reeked with Sloanishness He was conferring a great honor no doubt whatever about that And when Anne utterly insensible to the honor refused him as delicately and considerately as she could for even a Sloane had feelings which ought not to be unduly lacerated Sloanishness still further betrayed itself Charlie certainly did not take his dismissal as Anne s imaginary rejected suitors did Instead he became angry and showed it he said two or three quite nasty things Anne s temper flashed up mutinously and she retorted with a cutting little speech whose keenness pierced even Charlie s protective Sloanishness and reached the quick he caught up his hat and flung himself out of the house with a very red face Anne rushed upstairs falling twice over Miss Ada s cushions on the way and threw herself on her bed in tears of humiliation and rage Had she actually stooped to quarrel with a Sloane Was it possible anything Charlie Sloane could say had power to make her angry Oh this was degradation indeed worse even than being the rival of Nettie Blewett I wish I need never see the horrible creature again she sobbed vindictively into her pillows She could not avoid seeing him again but the outraged Charlie took care that it should not be at very close quarters Miss Ada s cushions were henceforth safe from his depredations and when he met Anne on the street or in Redmond s halls his bow was icy in the extreme Relations between these two old schoolmates continued to be thus strained for nearly a year Then Charlie transferred his blighted affections to a round rosy snub nosed blue eyed little Sophomore who appreciated them as they deserved whereupon he forgave Anne and condescended to be civil to her again in a patronizing manner intended to show her just what she had lost One day Anne scurried excitedly into Priscilla s room Read that she cried tossing Priscilla a letter It s from Stella and she s coming to Redmond next year and what do you think of her idea I think it s a perfectly splendid one if we can only carry it out Do you suppose we can Pris I ll be better able to tell you when I find out what it is said Priscilla casting aside a Greek lexicon and taking up Stella s letter Stella Maynard had been one of their chums at Queen s Academy and had been teaching school ever since But I m going to give it up Anne dear she wrote and go to college next year As I took the third year at Queen s I can enter the Sophomore year I m tired of teaching in a back country school Some day I m going to write a treatise on The Trials of a Country Schoolmarm It will be a harrowing bit of realism It seems to be the prevailing impression that we live in clover and have nothing to do but draw our quarter s salary My treatise shall tell the truth about us Why if a week should pass without some one telling me that I am doing easy work for big pay I would conclude that I might as well order my ascension robe immediately and to onct Well you get your money easy some rate payer will tell me condescendingly All you have to do is to sit there and hear lessons I used to argue the matter at first but I m wiser now Facts are stubborn things but as some one has wisely said not half so stubborn as fallacies So I only smile loftily now in eloquent silence Why I have nine grades in my school and I have to teach a little of everything from investigating the interiors of earthworms to the study of the solar system My youngest pupil is four his mother sends him to school to get him out of the way and my oldest twenty it suddenly struck him that it would be easier to go to school and get an education than follow the plough any longer In the wild effort to cram all sorts of research into six hours a day I don t wonder if the children feel like the little boy who was taken to see the biograph I have to look for what s coming next before I know what went last he complained I feel like that myself And the letters I get Anne Tommy s mother writes me that Tommy is not coming on in arithmetic as fast as she would like He is only in simple reduction yet and Johnny Johnson is in fractions and Johnny isn t half as smart as her Tommy and she can t understand it And Susy s father wants to know why Susy can t write a letter without misspelling half the words and Dick s aunt wants me to change his seat because that bad Brown boy he is sitting with is teaching him to say naughty words As to the financial part but I ll not begin on that Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make country schoolmarms There I feel better after that growl After all I ve enjoyed these past two years But I m coming to Redmond And now Anne I ve a little plan You know how I loathe boarding I ve boarded for four years and I m so tired of it I don t feel like enduring three years more of it Now why can t you and Priscilla and I club together rent a little house somewhere in Kingsport and board ourselves It would be cheaper than any other way Of course we would have to have a housekeeper and I have one ready on the spot You ve heard me speak of Aunt Jamesina She s the sweetest aunt that ever lived in spite of her name She can t help that She was called Jamesina because her father whose name was James was drowned at sea a month before she was born I always call her Aunt Jimsie Well her only daughter has recently married and gone to the foreign mission field Aunt Jamesina is left alone in a great big house and she is horribly lonesome She will come to Kingsport and keep house for us if we want her and I know you ll both love her The more I think of the plan the more I like it We could have such good independent times Now if you and Priscilla agree to it wouldn t it be a good idea for you who are on the spot to look around and see if you can find a suitable house this spring That would be better than leaving it till the fall If you could get a furnished one so much the better but if not we can scare up a few sticks of finiture between us and old family friends with attics Anyhow decide as soon as you can and write me so that Aunt Jamesina will know what plans to make for next year I think it s a good idea said Priscilla So do I agreed Anne delightedly Of course we have a nice boardinghouse here but when all s said and done a boardinghouse isn t home So let s go house hunting at once before exams come on I m afraid it will be hard enough to get a really suitable house warned Priscilla Don t expect too much Anne Nice houses in nice localities will probably be away beyond our means We ll likely have to content ourselves with a shabby little place on some street whereon live people whom to know is to be unknown and make life inside compensate for the outside Accordingly they went house hunting but to find just what they wanted proved even harder than Priscilla had feared Houses there were galore furnished and unfurnished but one was too big another too small this one too expensive that one too far from Redmond Exams were on and over the last week of the term came and still their house o dreams as Anne called it remained a castle in the air We shall have to give up and wait till the fall I suppose said Priscilla wearily as they rambled through the park on one of April s darling days of breeze and blue when the harbor was creaming and shimmering beneath the pearl hued mists floating over it We may find some shack to shelter us then and if not boardinghouses we shall have always with us I m not going to worry about it just now anyway and spoil this lovely afternoon said Anne gazing around her with delight The fresh chill air was faintly charged with the aroma of pine balsam and the sky above was crystal clear and blue a great inverted cup of blessing Spring is singing in my blood today and the lure of April is abroad on the air I m seeing visions and dreaming dreams Pris That s because the wind is from the west I do love the west wind It sings of hope and gladness doesn t it When the east wind blows I always think of sorrowful rain on the eaves and sad waves on a gray shore When I get old I shall have rheumatism when the wind is east And isn t it jolly when you discard furs and winter garments for the first time and sally forth like this in spring attire laughed Priscilla Don t you feel as if you had been made over new Everything is new in the spring said Anne Springs themselves are always so new too No spring is ever just like any other spring It always has something of its own to be its own peculiar sweetness See how green the grass is around that little pond and how the willow buds are bursting And exams are over and gone the time of Convocation will come soon next Wednesday This day next week we ll be home I m glad said Anne dreamily There are so many things I want to do I want to sit on the back porch steps and feel the breeze blowing down over mister Harrison s fields I want to hunt ferns in the Haunted Wood and gather violets in Violet Vale Do you remember the day of our golden picnic Priscilla I want to hear the frogs singing and the poplars whispering But I ve learned to love Kingsport too and I m glad I m coming back next fall If I hadn t won the Thorburn I don t believe I could have I COULDN T take any of Marilla s little hoard If we could only find a house sighed Priscilla Look over there at Kingsport Anne houses houses everywhere and not one for us Stop it Pris The best is yet to be Like the old Roman we ll find a house or build one On a day like this there s no such word as fail in my bright lexicon They lingered in the park until sunset living in the amazing miracle and glory and wonder of the springtide and they went home as usual by way of Spofford Avenue that they might have the delight of looking at Patty s Place I feel as if something mysterious were going to happen right away by the pricking of my thumbs said Anne as they went up the slope It s a nice story bookish feeling Why why why Priscilla Grant look over there and tell me if it s true or am I seein things Priscilla looked Anne s thumbs and eyes had not deceived her Over the arched gateway of Patty s Place dangled a little modest sign It said To Let Furnished Inquire Within Priscilla said Anne in a whisper do you suppose it s possible that we could rent Patty s Place No I don t averred Priscilla It would be too good to be true Fairy tales don t happen nowadays I won t hope Anne The disappointment would be too awful to bear They re sure to want more for it than we can afford Remember it s on Spofford Avenue We must find out anyhow said Anne resolutely It s too late to call this evening but we ll come tomorrow Oh Pris if we can get this darling spot I ve always felt that my fortunes were linked with Patty s Place ever since I saw it first Chapter X Patty s Place The next evening found them treading resolutely the herring bone walk through the tiny garden The April wind was filling the pine trees with its roundelay and the grove was alive with robins great plump saucy fellows strutting along the paths The girls rang rather timidly and were admitted by a grim and ancient handmaiden The door opened directly into a large living room where by a cheery little fire sat two other ladies both of whom were also grim and ancient Except that one looked to be about seventy and the other fifty there seemed little difference between them Each had amazingly big light blue eyes behind steel rimmed spectacles each wore a cap and a gray shawl each was knitting without haste and without rest each rocked placidly and looked at the girls without speaking and just behind each sat a large white china dog with round green spots all over it a green nose and green ears Those dogs captured Anne s fancy on the spot they seemed like the twin guardian deities of Patty s Place For a few minutes nobody spoke The girls were too nervous to find words and neither the ancient ladies nor the china dogs seemed conversationally inclined Anne glanced about the room What a dear place it was Another door opened out of it directly into the pine grove and the robins came boldly up on the very step The floor was spotted with round braided mats such as Marilla made at Green Gables but which were considered out of date everywhere else even in Avonlea And yet here they were on Spofford Avenue A big polished grandfather s clock ticked loudly and solemnly in a corner There were delightful little cupboards over the mantelpiece behind whose glass doors gleamed quaint bits of china The walls were hung with old prints and silhouettes In one corner the stairs went up and at the first low turn was a long window with an inviting seat It was all just as Anne had known it must be By this time the silence had grown too dreadful and Priscilla nudged Anne to intimate that she must speak We we saw by your sign that this house is to let said Anne faintly addressing the older lady who was evidently Miss Patty Spofford Oh yes said Miss Patty I intended to take that sign down today Then then we are too late said Anne sorrowfully You ve let it to some one else No but we have decided not to let it at all Oh I m so sorry exclaimed Anne impulsively I love this place so I did hope we could have got it Then did Miss Patty lay down her knitting take off her specs rub them put them on again and for the first time look at Anne as at a human being The other lady followed her example so perfectly that she might as well have been a reflection in a mirror You LOVE it said Miss Patty with emphasis Does that mean that you really LOVE it Or that you merely like the looks of it The girls nowadays indulge in such exaggerated statements that one never can tell what they DO mean It wasn t so in my young days THEN a girl did not say she LOVED turnips in just the same tone as she might have said she loved her mother or her Savior Anne s conscience bore her up I really do love it she said gently I ve loved it ever since I saw it last fall My two college chums and I want to keep house next year instead of boarding so we are looking for a little place to rent and when I saw that this house was to let I was so happy If you love it you can have it said Miss Patty Maria and I decided today that we would not let it after all because we did not like any of the people who have wanted it We don t HAVE to let it We can afford to go to Europe even if we don t let it It would help us out but not for gold will I let my home pass into the possession of such people as have come here and looked at it YOU are different I believe you do love it and will be good to it You can have it If if we can afford to pay what you ask for it hesitated Anne Miss Patty named the amount required Anne and Priscilla looked at each other Priscilla shook her head I m afraid we can t afford quite so much said Anne choking back her disappointment You see we are only college girls and we are poor What were you thinking you could afford demanded Miss Patty ceasing not to knit Anne named her amount Miss Patty nodded gravely That will do As I told you it is not strictly necessary that we should let it at all We are not rich but we have enough to go to Europe on I have never been in Europe in my life and never expected or wanted to go But my niece there Maria Spofford has taken a fancy to 
829_123192_000129_000001	train-clean-360	go Now 
none	none	you know a young person like Maria can t go globetrotting alone No I I suppose not murmured Anne seeing that Miss Patty was quite solemnly in earnest Of course not So I have to go along to look after her I expect to enjoy it too I m seventy years old but I m not tired of living yet I daresay I d have gone to Europe before if the idea had occurred to me We shall be away for two years perhaps three We sail in June and we shall send you the key and leave all in order for you to take possession when you choose We shall pack away a few things we prize especially but all the rest will be left Will you leave the china dogs asked Anne timidly Would you like me to Oh indeed yes They are delightful A pleased expression came into Miss Patty s face I think a great deal of those dogs she said proudly They are over a hundred years old and they have sat on either side of this fireplace ever since my brother Aaron brought them from London fifty years ago Spofford Avenue was called after my brother Aaron A fine man he was said Miss Maria speaking for the first time Ah you don t see the like of him nowadays He was a good uncle to you Maria said Miss Patty with evident emotion You do well to remember him I shall always remember him said Miss Maria solemnly I can see him this minute standing there before that fire with his hands under his coat tails beaming on us Miss Maria took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes but Miss Patty came resolutely back from the regions of sentiment to those of business I shall leave the dogs where they are if you will promise to be very careful of them she said Their names are Gog and Magog Gog looks to the right and Magog to the left And there s just one thing more You don t object I hope to this house being called Patty s Place No indeed We think that is one of the nicest things about it You have sense I see said Miss Patty in a tone of great satisfaction Would you believe it All the people who came here to rent the house wanted to know if they couldn t take the name off the gate during their occupation of it I told them roundly that the name went with the house This has been Patty s Place ever since my brother Aaron left it to me in his will and Patty s Place it shall remain until I die and Maria dies After that happens the next possessor can call it any fool name he likes concluded Miss Patty much as she might have said After that the deluge And now wouldn t you like to go over the house and see it all before we consider the bargain made Further exploration still further delighted the girls Besides the big living room there was a kitchen and a small bedroom downstairs Upstairs were three rooms one large and two small Anne took an especial fancy to one of the small ones looking out into the big pines and hoped it would be hers It was papered in pale blue and had a little old timey toilet table with sconces for candles There was a diamond paned window with a seat under the blue muslin frills that would be a satisfying spot for studying or dreaming It s all so delicious that I know we are going to wake up and find it a fleeting vision of the night said Priscilla as they went away Miss Patty and Miss Maria are hardly such stuff as dreams are made of laughed Anne Can you fancy them globe trotting especially in those shawls and caps I suppose they ll take them off when they really begin to trot said Priscilla but I know they ll take their knitting with them everywhere They simply couldn t be parted from it They will walk about Westminster Abbey and knit I feel sure Meanwhile Anne we shall be living in Patty s Place and on Spofford Avenue I feel like a millionairess even now I feel like one of the morning stars that sang for joy said Anne Phil Gordon crept into Thirty eight saint John s that night and flung herself on Anne s bed Girls dear I m tired to death I feel like the man without a country or was it without a shadow I forget which Anyway I ve been packing up And I suppose you are worn out because you couldn t decide which things to pack first or where to put them laughed Priscilla E zackly And when I had got everything jammed in somehow and my landlady and her maid had both sat on it while I locked it I discovered I had packed a whole lot of things I wanted for Convocation at the very bottom I had to unlock the old thing and poke and dive into it for an hour before I fished out what I wanted I would get hold of something that felt like what I was looking for and I d yank it up and it would be something else No Anne I did NOT swear I didn t say you did Well you looked it But I admit my thoughts verged on the profane And I have such a cold in the head I can do nothing but sniffle sigh and sneeze Isn t that alliterative agony for you Queen Anne do say something to cheer me up Remember that next Thursday night you ll be back in the land of Alec and Alonzo suggested Anne Phil shook her head dolefully More alliteration No I don t want Alec and Alonzo when I have a cold in the head But what has happened you two Now that I look at you closely you seem all lighted up with an internal iridescence Why you re actually SHINING What s up We are going to live in Patty s Place next winter said Anne triumphantly Live mark you not board We ve rented it and Stella Maynard is coming and her aunt is going to keep house for us Phil bounced up wiped her nose and fell on her knees before Anne Girls girls let me come too Oh I ll be so good If there s no room for me I ll sleep in the little doghouse in the orchard I ve seen it Only let me come Get up you goose I won t stir off my marrow bones till you tell me I can live with you next winter Anne and Priscilla looked at each other Then Anne said slowly Phil dear we d love to have you But we may as well speak plainly I m poor Pris is poor Stella Maynard is poor our housekeeping will have to be very simple and our table plain You d have to live as we would Now you are rich and your boardinghouse fare attests the fact Oh what do I care for that demanded Phil tragically Better a dinner of herbs where your chums are than a stalled ox in a lonely boardinghouse Don t think I m ALL stomach girls I ll be willing to live on bread and water with just a LEETLE jam if you ll let me come And then continued Anne there will be a good deal of work to be done Stella s aunt can t do it all We all expect to have our chores to do Now you Toil not neither do I spin finished Philippa But I ll learn to do things You ll only have to show me once I CAN make my own bed to begin with And remember that though I can t cook I CAN keep my temper That s something And I NEVER growl about the weather That s more Oh please please I never wanted anything so much in my life and this floor is awfully hard There s just one more thing said Priscilla resolutely You Phil as all Redmond knows entertain callers almost every evening Now at Patty s Place we can t do that We have decided that we shall be at home to our friends on Friday evenings only If you come with us you ll have to abide by that rule Well you don t think I ll mind that do you Why I m glad of it I knew I should have had some such rule myself but I hadn t enough decision to make it or stick to it When I can shuffle off the responsibility on you it will be a real relief If you won t let me cast in my lot with you I ll die of the disappointment and then I ll come back and haunt you I ll camp on the very doorstep of Patty s Place and you won t be able to go out or come in without falling over my spook Again Anne and Priscilla exchanged eloquent looks Well said Anne of course we can t promise to take you until we ve consulted with Stella but I don t think she ll object and as far as we are concerned you may come and glad welcome If you get tired of our simple life you can leave us and no questions asked added Priscilla Phil sprang up hugged them both jubilantly and went on her way rejoicing I hope things will go right said Priscilla soberly We must MAKE them go right avowed Anne I think Phil will fit into our appy little ome very well Oh Phil s a dear to rattle round with and be chums And of course the more there are of us the easier it will be on our slim purses But how will she be to live with You have to summer and winter with any one before you know if she s LIVABLE or not Oh well we ll all be put to the test as far as that goes And we must quit us like sensible folk living and let live Phil isn t selfish though she s a little thoughtless and I believe we will all get on beautifully in Patty s Place Chapter XI The Round of Life Anne was back in Avonlea with the luster of the Thorburn Scholarship on her brow People told her she hadn t changed much in a tone which hinted they were surprised and a little disappointed she hadn t Avonlea had not changed either At least so it seemed at first But as Anne sat in the Green Gables pew on the first Sunday after her return and looked over the congregation she saw several little changes which all coming home to her at once made her realize that time did not quite stand still even in Avonlea A new minister was in the pulpit In the pews more than one familiar face was missing forever Old Uncle Abe his prophesying over and done with missus Peter Sloane who had sighed it was to be hoped for the last time Timothy Cotton who as missus Rachel Lynde said had actually managed to die at last after practicing at it for twenty years and old Josiah Sloane whom nobody knew in his coffin because he had his whiskers neatly trimmed were all sleeping in the little graveyard behind the church And Billy Andrews was married to Nettie Blewett They appeared out that Sunday When Billy beaming with pride and happiness showed his be plumed and be silked bride into the Harmon Andrews pew Anne dropped her lids to hide her dancing eyes She recalled the stormy winter night of the Christmas holidays when Jane had proposed for Billy He certainly had not broken his heart over his rejection Anne wondered if Jane had also proposed to Nettie for him or if he had mustered enough spunk to ask the fateful question himself All the Andrews family seemed to share in his pride and pleasure from missus Harmon in the pew to Jane in the choir Jane had resigned from the Avonlea school and intended to go West in the fall Can t get a beau in Avonlea that s what said missus Rachel Lynde scornfully SAYS she thinks she ll have better health out West I never heard her health was poor before Jane is a nice girl Anne had said loyally She never tried to attract attention as some did Oh she never chased the boys if that s what you mean said missus Rachel But she d like to be married just as much as anybody that s what What else would take her out West to some forsaken place whose only recommendation is that men are plenty and women scarce Don t you tell me But it was not at Jane Anne gazed that day in dismay and surprise It was at Ruby Gillis who sat beside her in the choir What had happened to Ruby She was even handsomer than ever but her blue eyes were too bright and lustrous and the color of her cheeks was hectically brilliant besides she was very thin the hands that held her hymn book were almost transparent in their delicacy Is Ruby Gillis ill Anne asked of missus Lynde as they went home from church Ruby Gillis is dying of galloping consumption said missus Lynde bluntly Everybody knows it except herself and her FAMILY They won t give in If you ask THEM she s perfectly well She hasn t been able to teach since she had that attack of congestion in the winter but she says she s going to teach again in the fall and she s after the White Sands school She ll be in her grave poor girl when White Sands school opens that s what Anne listened in shocked silence Ruby Gillis her old school chum dying Could it be possible Of late years they had grown apart but the old tie of school girl intimacy was there and made itself felt sharply in the tug the news gave at Anne s heartstrings Ruby the brilliant the merry the coquettish It was impossible to associate the thought of her with anything like death She had greeted Anne with gay cordiality after church and urged her to come up the next evening I ll be away Tuesday and Wednesday evenings she had whispered triumphantly There s a concert at Carmody and a party at White Sands Herb Spencer s going to take me He s my LATEST Be sure to come up tomorrow I m dying for a good talk with you I want to hear all about your doings at Redmond Anne knew that Ruby meant that she wanted to tell Anne all about her own recent flirtations but she promised to go and Diana offered to go with her I ve been wanting to go to see Ruby for a long while she told Anne when they left Green Gables the next evening but I really couldn t go alone It s so awful to hear Ruby rattling on as she does and pretending there is nothing the matter with her even when she can hardly speak for coughing She s fighting so hard for her life and yet she hasn t any chance at all they say The girls walked silently down the red twilit road The robins were singing vespers in the high treetops filling the golden air with their jubilant voices The silver fluting of the frogs came from marshes and ponds over fields where seeds were beginning to stir with life and thrill to the sunshine and rain that had drifted over them The air was fragrant with the wild sweet wholesome smell of young raspberry copses White mists were hovering in the silent hollows and violet stars were shining bluely on the brooklands What a beautiful sunset said Diana Look Anne it s just like a land in itself isn t it That long low back of purple cloud is the shore and the clear sky further on is like a golden sea If we could sail to it in the moonshine boat Paul wrote of in his old composition you remember how nice it would be said Anne rousing from her reverie Do you think we could find all our yesterdays there Diana all our old springs and blossoms The beds of flowers that Paul saw there are the roses that have bloomed for us in the past Don t said Diana You make me feel as if we were old women with everything in life behind us I think I ve almost felt as if we were since I heard about poor Ruby said Anne If it is true that she is dying any other sad thing might be true too You don t mind calling in at Elisha Wright s for a moment do you asked Diana Mother asked me to leave this little dish of jelly for Aunt Atossa Who is Aunt Atossa Oh haven t you heard She s missus Samson Coates of Spencervale missus Elisha Wright s aunt She s father s aunt too Her husband died last winter and she was left very poor and lonely so the Wrights took her to live with them Mother thought we ought to take her but father put his foot down Live with Aunt Atossa he would not Is she so terrible asked Anne absently You ll probably see what she s like before we can get away said Diana significantly Father says she has a face like a hatchet it cuts the air But her tongue is sharper still Late as it was Aunt Atossa was cutting potato sets in the Wright kitchen She wore a faded old wrapper and her gray hair was decidedly untidy Aunt Atossa did not like being caught in a kilter so she went out of her way to be disagreeable Oh so you re Anne Shirley she said when Diana introduced Anne I ve heard of you Her tone implied that she had heard nothing good missus Andrews was telling me you were home She said you had improved a good deal There was no doubt Aunt Atossa thought there was plenty of room for further improvement She ceased not from cutting sets with much energy Is it any use to ask you to sit down she inquired sarcastically Of course there s nothing very entertaining here for you The rest are all away Mother sent you this little pot of rhubarb jelly said Diana pleasantly She made it today and thought you might like some Oh thanks said Aunt Atossa sourly I never fancy your mother s jelly she always makes it too sweet However I ll try to worry some down My appetite s been dreadful poor this spring I m far from well continued Aunt Atossa solemnly but still I keep a doing People who can t work aren t wanted here If it isn t too much trouble will you be condescending enough to set the jelly in the pantry I m in a hurry to get these spuds done tonight I suppose you two LADIES never do anything like this You d be afraid of spoiling your hands I used to cut potato sets before we rented the farm smiled Anne I do it yet laughed Diana I cut sets three days last week Of course she added teasingly I did my hands up in lemon juice and kid gloves every night after it Aunt Atossa sniffed I suppose you got that notion out of some of those silly magazines you read so many of I wonder your mother allows you But she always spoiled you We all thought when George married her she wouldn t be a suitable wife for him Aunt Atossa sighed heavily as if all forebodings upon the occasion of George Barry s marriage had been amply and darkly fulfilled Going are you she inquired as the girls rose Well I suppose you can t find much amusement talking to an old woman like me It s such a pity the boys ain t home We want to run in and see Ruby Gillis a little while explained Diana Oh anything does for an excuse of course said Aunt Atossa amiably Just whip in and whip out before you have time to say how do decently It s college airs I s pose You d be wiser to keep away from Ruby Gillis The doctors say consumption s catching I always knew Ruby d get something gadding off to Boston last fall for a visit People who ain t content to stay home always catch something People who don t go visiting catch things too Sometimes they even die said Diana solemnly Then they don t have themselves to blame for it retorted Aunt Atossa triumphantly I hear you are to be married in June Diana There is no truth in that report said Diana blushing Well don t put it off too long said Aunt Atossa significantly You ll fade soon you re all complexion and hair And the Wrights are terrible fickle You ought to wear a hat MISS SHIRLEY Your nose is freckling scandalous My but you ARE redheaded Well I s pose we re all as the Lord made us Give Marilla Cuthbert my respects She s never been to see me since I come to Avonlea but I s pose I oughtn t to complain The Cuthberts always did think themselves a cut higher than any one else round here Oh isn t she dreadful gasped Diana as they escaped down the lane She s worse than Miss Eliza Andrews said Anne But then think of living all your life with a name like Atossa Wouldn t it sour almost any one She should have tried to imagine her name was Cordelia It might have helped her a great deal It certainly helped me in the days when I didn t like ANNE Josie Pye will be just like her when she grows up said Diana Josie s mother and Aunt Atossa are cousins you know Oh dear I m glad that s over She s so malicious she seems to put a bad flavor in everything Father tells such a funny story about her One time they had a minister in Spencervale who was a very good spiritual man but very deaf He couldn t hear any ordinary conversation at all Well they used to have a prayer meeting on Sunday evenings and all the church members present would get up and pray in turn or say a few words on some Bible verse But one evening Aunt Atossa bounced up She didn t either pray or preach Instead she lit into everybody else in the church and gave them a fearful raking down calling them right out by name and telling them how they all had behaved and casting up all the quarrels and scandals of the past ten years Finally she wound up by saying that she was disgusted with Spencervale church and she never meant to darken its door again and she hoped a fearful judgment would come upon it Then she sat down out of breath and the minister who hadn t heard a word she said immediately remarked in a very devout voice amen The Lord grant our dear sister s prayer You ought to hear father tell the story Speaking of stories Diana remarked Anne in a significant confidential tone do you know that lately I have been wondering if I could write a short story a story that would be good enough to be published Why of course you could said Diana after she had grasped the amazing suggestion You used to write perfectly thrilling stories years ago in our old Story Club Well I hardly meant one of that kind of stories smiled Anne I ve been thinking about it a little of late but I m almost afraid to try for if I should fail it would be too humiliating I heard Priscilla say once that all missus Morgan s first stories were rejected But I m sure yours wouldn t be Anne for it s likely editors have more sense nowadays Margaret Burton one of the Junior girls at Redmond wrote a story last winter and it was published in the Canadian Woman I really do think I could write one at least as good And will you have it published in the Canadian Woman I might try one of the bigger magazines first It all depends on what kind of a story I write What is it to be about I don t know yet I want to get hold of a good plot I believe this is very necessary from an editor s point of view The only thing I ve settled on is the heroine s name It is to be AVERIL LESTER Rather pretty don t you think Don t mention this to any one Diana I haven t told anybody but you and mister Harrison HE wasn t very encouraging he said there was far too much trash written nowadays as it was and he d expected something better of me after a year at college What does mister Harrison know about it demanded Diana scornfully They found the Gillis home gay with lights and callers Leonard Kimball of Spencervale and Morgan Bell of Carmody were glaring at each other across the parlor Several merry girls had dropped in Ruby was dressed in white and her eyes and cheeks were very brilliant She laughed and chattered incessantly and after the other girls had gone she took Anne upstairs to display her new summer dresses I ve a blue silk to make up yet but it s a little heavy for summer wear I think I ll leave it until the fall I m going to teach in White Sands you know How do you like my hat That one you had on in church yesterday was real dinky But I like something brighter for myself Did you notice those two ridiculous boys downstairs They ve both come determined to sit each other out I don t care a single bit about either of them you know Herb Spencer is the one I like Sometimes I really do think he s mister RIGHT At Christmas I thought the Spencervale schoolmaster was that But I found out something about him that turned me against him He nearly went insane when I turned him down I wish those two boys hadn t come tonight I wanted to have a nice good talk with you Anne and tell you such heaps of things You and I were always good chums weren t we Ruby slipped her arm about Anne s waist with a shallow little laugh But just for a moment their eyes met and behind all the luster of Ruby s Anne saw something that made her heart ache Come up often won t you Anne whispered Ruby Come alone I want you Are you feeling quite well Ruby Me Why I m perfectly well I never felt better in my life Of course that congestion last winter pulled me down a little But just see my color I don t look much like an invalid I m sure Ruby s voice was almost sharp She pulled her arm away from Anne as if in resentment and ran downstairs where she was gayer than ever apparently so much absorbed in bantering her two swains that Diana and Anne felt rather out of it and soon went away Chapter XII Averil s Atonement What are you dreaming of Anne The two girls were loitering one evening in a fairy hollow of the brook Ferns nodded in it and little grasses were green and wild pears hung finely scented white curtains around it Anne roused herself from her reverie with a happy sigh I was thinking out my story Diana
829_123191_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh have you really begun it cried Diana all alight with eager interest in a moment 
none	none	Yes I have only a few pages written but I have it all pretty well thought out I ve had such a time to get a suitable plot None of the plots that suggested themselves suited a girl named AVERIL Couldn t you have changed her name No the thing was impossible I tried to but I couldn t do it any more than I could change yours AVERIL was so real to me that no matter what other name I tried to give her I just thought of her as AVERIL behind it all But finally I got a plot that matched her Then came the excitement of choosing names for all my characters You have no idea how fascinating that is I ve lain awake for hours thinking over those names The hero s name is PERCEVAL DALRYMPLE Have you named ALL the characters asked Diana wistfully If you hadn t I was going to ask you to let me name one just some unimportant person I d feel as if I had a share in the story then You may name the little hired boy who lived with the LESTERS conceded Anne He is not very important but he is the only one left unnamed Call him RAYMOND FITZOSBORNE suggested Diana who had a store of such names laid away in her memory relics of the old Story Club which she and Anne and Jane Andrews and Ruby Gillis had had in their schooldays Anne shook her head doubtfully I m afraid that is too aristocratic a name for a chore boy Diana I couldn t imagine a Fitzosborne feeding pigs and picking up chips could you Diana didn t see why if you had an imagination at all you couldn t stretch it to that extent but probably Anne knew best and the chore boy was finally christened ROBERT RAY to be called BOBBY should occasion require
829_123191_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 How much do you suppose you ll get for it asked Diana 
none	none	But Anne had not thought about this at all She was in pursuit of fame not filthy lucre and her literary dreams were as yet untainted by mercenary considerations You ll let me read it won t you pleaded Diana When it is finished I ll read it to you and mister Harrison and I shall want you to criticize it SEVERELY No one else shall see it until it is published
829_123191_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 How are you going to end it happily or unhappily 
none	none	I m not sure I d like it to end unhappily because that would be so much more romantic But I understand editors have a prejudice against sad endings I heard Professor Hamilton say once that nobody but a genius should try to write an unhappy ending And concluded Anne modestly I m anything but a genius Oh I like happy endings best You d better let him marry her said Diana who especially since her engagement to Fred thought this was how every story should end
829_123191_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 But you like to cry over stories 
none	none	Oh yes in the middle of them 
829_123191_000024_000001	train-clean-360	But I like everything to come right at last 
none	none	I must have one pathetic scene in it said Anne thoughtfully I might let ROBERT RAY be injured in an accident and have a death scene No you mustn t kill BOBBY off declared Diana laughing He belongs to me and I want him to live and flourish Kill somebody else if you have to For the next fortnight Anne writhed or reveled according to mood in her literary pursuits Now she would be jubilant over a brilliant idea now despairing because some contrary character would NOT behave properly Diana could not understand this MAKE them do as you want them to she said I can t mourned Anne Averil is such an unmanageable heroine She WILL do and say things I never meant her to Then that spoils everything that went before and I have to write it all over again Finally however the story was finished and Anne read it to Diana in the seclusion of the porch gable She had achieved her pathetic scene without sacrificing ROBERT RAY and she kept a watchful eye on Diana as she read it Diana rose to the occasion and cried properly but when the end came she looked a little disappointed
829_123191_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Why did you kill MAURICE LENNOX she asked reproachfully 
none	none	He was the villain protested Anne
829_123191_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 He had to be punished 
none	none	I like him best of them all said unreasonable Diana Well he s dead and he ll have to stay dead said Anne rather resentfully If I had let him live he d have gone on persecuting AVERIL and PERCEVAL Yes unless you had reformed him
829_123191_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 That wouldn t have been romantic and besides it would have made the story too long 
none	none	Well anyway it s a perfectly elegant story Anne and will make you famous of that I m sure 
829_123191_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Have you got a title for it 
none	none	Oh I decided on the title long ago 
829_123191_000038_000001	train-clean-360	I call it AVERIL S ATONEMENT Doesn t that sound nice and alliterative 
none	none	Now Diana tell me candidly do you see any faults in my story Well hesitated Diana that part where AVERIL makes the cake doesn t seem to me quite romantic enough to match the rest It s just what anybody might do Heroines shouldn t do cooking I think Why that is where the humor comes in and it s one of the best parts of the whole story said Anne And it may be stated that in this she was quite right Diana prudently refrained from any further criticism but mister Harrison was much harder to please First he told her there was entirely too much description in the story Cut out all those flowery passages he said unfeelingly Anne had an uncomfortable conviction that mister Harrison was right and she forced herself to expunge most of her beloved descriptions though it took three re writings before the story could be pruned down to please the fastidious mister Harrison I ve left out ALL the descriptions but the sunset she said at last I simply COULDN T let it go It was the best of them all It hasn t anything to do with the story said mister Harrison and you shouldn t have laid the scene among rich city people What do you know of them Why didn t you lay it right here in Avonlea changing the name of course or else missus Rachel Lynde would probably think she was the heroine Oh that would never have done protested Anne Avonlea is the dearest place in the world but it isn t quite romantic enough for the scene of a story I daresay there s been many a romance in Avonlea and many a tragedy too said mister Harrison drily
829_123191_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 But your folks ain t like real folks anywhere 
none	none	They talk too much and use too high flown language There s one place where that DALRYMPLE chap talks even on for two pages and never lets the girl get a word in edgewise 
829_123191_000047_000004	train-clean-360	If he d done that in real life she d have pitched him 
829_123191_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe it said Anne flatly 
none	none	In her secret soul she thought that the beautiful poetical things said to AVERIL would win any girl s heart completely Besides it was gruesome to hear of AVERIL the stately queen like AVERIL pitching any one AVERIL declined her suitors Anyhow resumed the merciless mister Harrison I don t see why MAURICE LENNOX didn t get her He was twice the man the other is He did bad things but he did them Perceval hadn t time for anything but mooning Mooning That was even worse than pitching MAURICE LENNOX was the villain said Anne indignantly I don t see why every one likes him better than PERCEVAL Perceval is too good He s aggravating Next time you write about a hero put a little spice of human nature in him AVERIL couldn t have married MAURICE He was bad She d have reformed him You can reform a man you can t reform a jelly fish of course Your story isn t bad it s kind of interesting I ll admit But you re too young to write a story that would be worth while Wait ten years Anne made up her mind that the next time she wrote a story she wouldn t ask anybody to criticize it It was too discouraging She would not read the story to Gilbert although she told him about it If it is a success you ll see it when it is published Gilbert but if it is a failure nobody shall ever see it Marilla knew nothing about the venture In imagination Anne saw herself reading a story out of a magazine to Marilla entrapping her into praise of it for in imagination all things are possible and then triumphantly announcing herself the author One day Anne took to the Post Office a long bulky envelope addressed with the delightful confidence of youth and inexperience to the very biggest of the big magazines Diana was as excited over it as Anne herself How long do you suppose it will be before you hear from it she asked It shouldn t be longer than a fortnight Oh how happy and proud I shall be if it is accepted Of course it will be accepted and they will likely ask you to send them more You may be as famous as missus Morgan some day Anne and then how proud I ll be of knowing you said Diana who possessed at least the striking merit of an unselfish admiration of the gifts and graces of her friends A week of delightful dreaming followed and then came a bitter awakening One evening Diana found Anne in the porch gable with suspicious looking eyes On the table lay a long envelope and a crumpled manuscript Anne your story hasn t come back cried Diana incredulously Yes it has said Anne shortly Well that editor must be crazy What reason did he give No reason at all There is just a printed slip saying that it wasn t found acceptable I never thought much of that magazine anyway said Diana hotly The stories in it are not half as interesting as those in the Canadian Woman although it costs so much more I suppose the editor is prejudiced against any one who isn t a Yankee Don t be discouraged Anne Remember how missus Morgan s stories came back Send yours to the Canadian Woman I believe I will said Anne plucking up heart And if it is published I ll send that American editor a marked copy But I ll cut the sunset out I believe mister Harrison was right Out came the sunset but in spite of this heroic mutilation the editor of the Canadian Woman sent Averil s Atonement back so promptly that the indignant Diana declared that it couldn t have been read at all and vowed she was going to stop her subscription immediately Anne took this second rejection with the calmness of despair She locked the story away in the garret trunk where the old Story Club tales reposed but first she yielded to Diana s entreaties and gave her a copy This is the end of my literary ambitions she said bitterly She never mentioned the matter to mister Harrison but one evening he asked her bluntly if her story had been accepted No the editor wouldn t take it she answered briefly mister Harrison looked sidewise at the flushed delicate profile Well I suppose you ll keep on writing them he said encouragingly No I shall never try to write a story again declared Anne with the hopeless finality of nineteen when a door is shut in its face I wouldn t give up altogether said mister Harrison reflectively I d write a story once in a while but I wouldn t pester editors with it I d write of people and places like I knew and I d make my characters talk everyday English and I d let the sun rise and set in the usual quiet way without much fuss over the fact If I had to have villains at all I d give them a chance Anne I d give them a chance There are some terrible bad men in the world I suppose but you d have to go a long piece to find them though missus Lynde believes we re all bad But most of us have got a little decency somewhere in us Keep on writing Anne No It was very foolish of me to attempt it When I m through Redmond I ll stick to teaching 
829_123191_000077_000003	train-clean-360	I can teach 
none	none	I can t write stories It ll be time for you to be getting a husband when you re through Redmond said mister Harrison I don t believe in putting marrying off too long like I did Anne got up and marched home There were times when mister Harrison was really intolerable Pitching mooning and getting a husband Ow Chapter XIII The Way of Transgressors Davy and Dora were ready for Sunday School They were going alone which did not often happen for missus Lynde always attended Sunday School But missus Lynde had twisted her ankle and was lame so she was staying home this morning The twins were also to represent the family at church for Anne had gone away the evening before to spend Sunday with friends in Carmody and Marilla had one of her headaches Davy came downstairs slowly Dora was waiting in the hall for him having been made ready by missus Lynde Davy had attended to his own preparations He had a cent in his pocket for the Sunday School collection and a five cent piece for the church collection he carried his Bible in one hand and his Sunday School quarterly in the other he knew his lesson and his Golden Text and his catechism question perfectly Had he not studied them perforce in missus Lynde s kitchen all last Sunday afternoon Davy therefore should have been in a placid frame of mind As a matter of fact despite text and catechism he was inwardly as a ravening wolf missus Lynde limped out of her kitchen as he joined Dora Are you clean she demanded severely Yes all of me that shows Davy answered with a defiant scowl missus Rachel sighed She had her suspicions about Davy s neck and ears But she knew that if she attempted to make a personal examination Davy would likely take to his heels and she could not pursue him today Well be sure you behave yourselves she warned them Don t walk in the dust Don t stop in the porch to talk to the other children Don t squirm or wriggle in your places Don t forget the Golden Text Don t lose your collection or forget to put it in Don t whisper at prayer time and don t forget to pay attention to the sermon Davy deigned no response He marched away down the lane followed by the meek Dora But his soul seethed within Davy had suffered or thought he had suffered many things at the hands and tongue of missus Rachel Lynde since she had come to Green Gables for missus Lynde could not live with anybody whether they were nine or ninety without trying to bring them up properly And it was only the preceding afternoon that she had interfered to influence Marilla against allowing Davy to go fishing with the Timothy Cottons Davy was still boiling over this As soon as he was out of the lane Davy stopped and twisted his countenance into such an unearthly and terrific contortion that Dora although she knew his gifts in that respect was honestly alarmed lest he should never in the world be able to get it straightened out again
829_123192_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Darn her exploded Davy 
none	none	Oh Davy don t swear gasped Dora in dismay Darn isn t swearing not real swearing And I don t care if it is retorted Davy recklessly Well if you MUST say dreadful words don t say them on Sunday pleaded Dora Davy was as yet far from repentance but in his secret soul he felt that perhaps he had gone a little too far I m going to invent a swear word of my own he declared God will punish you if you do said Dora solemnly Then I think God is a mean old scamp retorted Davy Doesn t He know a fellow must have some way of spressing his feelings Davy said Dora She expected that Davy would be struck down dead on the spot But nothing happened Anyway I ain t going to stand any more of missus Lynde s bossing spluttered Davy Anne and Marilla may have the right to boss me but SHE hasn t I m going to do every single thing she told me not to do You watch me In grim deliberate silence while Dora watched him with the fascination of horror Davy stepped off the green grass of the roadside ankle deep into the fine dust which four weeks of rainless weather had made on the road and marched along in it shuffling his feet viciously until he was enveloped in a hazy cloud That s the beginning he announced triumphantly And I m going to stop in the porch and talk as long as there s anybody there to talk to I m going to squirm and wriggle and whisper and I m going to say I don t know the Golden Text And I m going to throw away both of my collections RIGHT NOW And Davy hurled cent and nickel over mister Barry s fence with fierce delight Satan made you do that said Dora reproachfully
829_123192_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 He didn t cried Davy indignantly 
none	none	I just thought it out for myself And I ve thought of something else 
829_123192_000025_000002	train-clean-360	I m not going to Sunday School or church at all 
none	none	I m going up to play with the Cottons They told me yesterday they weren t going to Sunday School today cause their mother was away and there was nobody to make them Come along Dora we ll have a great time I don t want to go protested Dora
829_123192_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 You ve got to said Davy 
none	none	If you don t come I ll tell Marilla that Frank Bell kissed you in school last Monday
829_123192_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I couldn t help it 
none	none	I didn t know he was going to cried Dora blushing scarlet Well you didn t slap him or seem a bit cross retorted Davy I ll tell her THAT too if you don t come We ll take the short cut up this field I m afraid of those cows protested poor Dora seeing a prospect of escape
829_123192_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 The very idea of your being scared of those cows scoffed Davy 
none	none	Why they re both younger than you
829_123192_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 They re bigger said Dora 
none	none	They won t hurt you Come along now 
829_123192_000033_000002	train-clean-360	This is great 
none	none	When I grow up I ain t going to bother going to church at all I believe I can get to heaven by myself You ll go to the other place if you break the Sabbath day said unhappy Dora following him sorely against her will But Davy was not scared yet Hell was very far off and the delights of a fishing expedition with the Cottons were very near He wished Dora had more spunk She kept looking back as if she were going to cry every minute and that spoiled a fellow s fun Hang girls anyway Davy did not say darn this time even in thought He was not sorry yet that he had said it once but it might be as well not to tempt the Unknown Powers too far on one day The small Cottons were playing in their back yard and hailed Davy s appearance with whoops of delight Pete Tommy Adolphus and Mirabel Cotton were all alone Their mother and older sisters were away Dora was thankful Mirabel was there at least She had been afraid she would be alone in a crowd of boys Mirabel was almost as bad as a boy she was so noisy and sunburned and reckless But at least she wore dresses
829_123192_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 We ve come to go fishing announced Davy 
none	none	Whoop yelled the Cottons They rushed away to dig worms at once Mirabel leading the van with a tin can Dora could have sat down and cried Oh if only that hateful Frank Bell had never kissed her Then she could have defied Davy and gone to her beloved Sunday School They dared not of course go fishing on the pond where they would be seen by people going to church They had to resort to the brook in the woods behind the Cotton house But it was full of trout and they had a glorious time that morning at least the Cottons certainly had and Davy seemed to have it Not being entirely bereft of prudence he had discarded boots and stockings and borrowed Tommy Cotton s overalls Thus accoutered bog and marsh and undergrowth had no terrors for him Dora was frankly and manifestly miserable She followed the others in their peregrinations from pool to pool clasping her Bible and quarterly tightly and thinking with bitterness of soul of her beloved class where she should be sitting that very moment before a teacher she adored Instead here she was roaming the woods with those half wild Cottons trying to keep her boots clean and her pretty white dress free from rents and stains Mirabel had offered the loan of an apron but Dora had scornfully refused The trout bit as they always do on Sundays In an hour the transgressors had all the fish they wanted so they returned to the house much to Dora s relief She sat primly on a hencoop in the yard while the others played an uproarious game of tag and then they all climbed to the top of the pig house roof and cut their initials on the saddleboard The flat roofed henhouse and a pile of straw beneath gave Davy another inspiration They spent a splendid half hour climbing on the roof and diving off into the straw with whoops and yells But even unlawful pleasures must come to an end When the rumble of wheels over the pond bridge told that people were going home from church Davy knew they must go He discarded Tommy s overalls resumed his own rightful attire and turned away from his string of trout with a sigh No use to think of taking them home Well hadn t we a splendid time he demanded defiantly as they went down the hill field I hadn t said Dora flatly And I don t believe you had really either she added with a flash of insight that was not to be expected of her I had so cried Davy but in the voice of one who doth protest too much No wonder you hadn t just sitting there like a like a mule I ain t going to sociate with the Cottons said Dora loftily The Cottons are all right retorted Davy
829_123192_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 And they have far better times than we have 
none	none	They do just as they please and say just what they like before everybody I m going to do that too after this There are lots of things you wouldn t dare say before everybody averred Dora No there isn t There is too Would you demanded Dora gravely would you say tomcat before the minister This was a staggerer Davy was not prepared for such a concrete example of the freedom of speech But one did not have to be consistent with Dora Of course not he admitted sulkily Tomcat isn t a holy word I wouldn t mention such an animal before a minister at all But if you had to persisted Dora I d call it a Thomas pussy said Davy I think gentleman cat would be more polite reflected Dora YOU thinking retorted Davy with withering scorn Davy was not feeling comfortable though he would have died before he admitted it to Dora Now that the exhilaration of truant delights had died away his conscience was beginning to give him salutary twinges After all perhaps it would have been better to have gone to Sunday School and church missus Lynde might be bossy but there was always a box of cookies in her kitchen cupboard and she was not stingy At this inconvenient moment Davy remembered that when he had torn his new school pants the week before missus Lynde had mended them beautifully and never said a word to Marilla about them But Davy s cup of iniquity was not yet full He was to discover that one sin demands another to cover it They had dinner with missus Lynde that day and the first thing she asked Davy was
829_123192_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Were all your class in Sunday School today 
none	none	Yes m said Davy with a gulp All were there cept one Did you say your Golden Text and catechism Yes m
829_123192_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you put your collection in 
none	none	Yes m Was missus Malcolm MacPherson in church I don t know This at least was the truth thought wretched Davy
829_123192_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Was the Ladies Aid announced for next week 
none	none	Yes m quakingly
829_123192_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Was prayer meeting 
none	none	I I don t know YOU should know You should listen more attentively to the announcements What was mister Harvey s text Davy took a frantic gulp of water and swallowed it and the last protest of conscience together He glibly recited an old Golden Text learned several weeks ago Fortunately missus Lynde now stopped questioning him but Davy did not enjoy his dinner He could only eat one helping of pudding What s the matter with you demanded justly astonished missus Lynde Are you sick No muttered Davy
829_123192_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 You look pale 
none	none	You d better keep out of the sun this afternoon admonished missus Lynde Do you know how many lies you told missus Lynde asked Dora reproachfully as soon as they were alone after dinner Davy goaded to desperation turned fiercely I don t know and I don t care he said
829_123192_000079_000001	train-clean-360	 You just shut up Dora Keith 
none	none	Then poor Davy betook himself to a secluded retreat behind the woodpile to think over the way of transgressors Green Gables was wrapped in darkness and silence when Anne reached home She lost no time going to bed for she was very tired and sleepy There had been several Avonlea jollifications the preceding week involving rather late hours Anne s head was hardly on her pillow before she was half asleep but just then her door was softly opened and a pleading voice said Anne Anne sat up drowsily Davy is that you What is the matter A white clad figure flung itself across the floor and on to the bed Anne sobbed Davy getting his arms about her neck I m awful glad you re home I couldn t go to sleep till I d told somebody Told somebody what How mis rubul I am Why are you miserable dear Cause I was so bad today Anne Oh I was awful bad badder n I ve ever been yet What did you do Oh I m afraid to tell you You ll never like me again Anne I couldn t say my prayers tonight I couldn t tell God what I d done I was shamed to have Him know But He knew anyway Davy That s what Dora said But I thought p raps He mightn t have noticed just at the time Anyway I d rather tell you first WHAT is it you did Out it all came in a rush I run away from Sunday School and went fishing with the Cottons and I told ever so many whoppers to missus Lynde oh most half a dozen and and I I said a swear word Anne a pretty near swear word anyhow and I called God names There was silence Davy didn t know what to make of it Was Anne so shocked that she never would speak to him again Anne what are you going to do to me he whispered Nothing dear You ve been punished already I think No I haven t Nothing s been done to me You ve been very unhappy ever since you did wrong haven t you
829_123192_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 You bet said Davy emphatically 
none	none	That was your conscience punishing you Davy What s my conscience I want to know It s something in you Davy that always tells you when you are doing wrong and makes you unhappy if you persist in doing it Haven t you noticed that Yes but I didn t know what it was I wish I didn t have it I d have lots more fun Where is my conscience Anne I want to know Is it in my stomach No it s in your soul answered Anne thankful for the darkness since gravity must be preserved in serious matters I s pose I can t get clear of it then said Davy with a sigh Are you going to tell Marilla and missus Lynde on me Anne No dear I m not going to tell any one You are sorry you were naughty aren t you You bet And you ll never be bad like that again No but added Davy cautiously I might be bad some other way You won t say naughty words or run away on Sundays or tell falsehoods to cover up your sins No It doesn t pay said Davy Well Davy just tell God you are sorry and ask Him to forgive you Have YOU forgiven me Anne Yes dear Then said Davy joyously I don t care much whether God does or not Davy Oh I ll ask Him I ll ask Him said Davy quickly scrambling off the bed convinced by Anne s tone that he must have said something dreadful I don t mind asking Him Anne Please God I m awful sorry I behaved bad today and I ll try to be good on Sundays always and please forgive me There now Anne Well now run off to bed like a good boy All right Say I don t feel mis rubul any more I feel fine Good night Good night Anne slipped down on her pillows with a sigh of relief Oh how sleepy she was In another second Anne Davy was back again by her bed Anne dragged her eyes open What is it now dear she asked trying to keep a note of impatience out of her voice Anne have you ever noticed how mister Harrison spits Do you s pose if I practice hard I can learn to spit just like him Anne sat up Davy Keith she said go straight to your bed and don t let me catch you out of it again tonight Go now Davy went and stood not upon the order of his going Chapter XIV The Summons Anne was sitting with Ruby Gillis in the Gillis garden after the day had crept lingeringly through it and was gone 
608-123193-0000	train-other-500	It had been a warm smoky summer afternoon The world was in a splendor of out flowering The idle valleys were full of hazes The woodways were pranked with shadows and the fields with the purple of the asters
none	none	 Anne had given up a moonlight drive to the White Sands beach that she might spend the evening with Ruby 
608-123193-0001	train-other-500	She had so spent many evenings that summer although she often wondered what good it did any one and sometimes went home deciding that she could not go again Ruby grew paler as the summer waned the White Sands school was given up
608-123193-0002	train-other-500	her father thought it better that she shouldn t teach till New Year s and the fancy work she loved oftener and oftener fell from hands grown too weary for it But she was always gay always hopeful
608-123193-0003	train-other-500	always chattering and whispering of her beaux and their rivalries and despairs It was this that made Anne s visits hard for her What had once been silly or amusing was gruesome now it was death peering through a wilful mask of life
none	none	 Yet Ruby seemed to cling to her and never let her go until she had promised to come again soon missus Lynde grumbled about Anne s frequent visits and declared she would catch consumption even Marilla was dubious 
608-123193-0004	train-other-500	Every time you go to see Ruby you come home looking tired out she said It s so very sad and dreadful said Anne in a low tone Ruby doesn t seem to realize her condition in the least
none	none	 And yet I somehow feel she needs help craves it and I want to give it to her and can t 
608-123193-0005	train-other-500	All the time I m with her I feel as if I were watching her struggle with an invisible foe trying to push it back with such feeble resistance as she has That is why I come home tired
none	none	 But tonight Anne did not feel this so keenly 
608-123193-0006	train-other-500	Ruby was strangely quiet She said not a word about parties and drives and dresses and fellows She lay in the hammock with her untouched work beside her and a white shawl wrapped about her thin shoulders Her long yellow braids of hair
608-123193-0007	train-other-500	how Anne had envied those beautiful braids in old schooldays lay on either side of her She had taken the pins out they made her head ache she said
none	none	 The hectic flush was gone for the time 
608-123193-0008	train-other-500	leaving her pale and childlike The moon rose in the silvery sky empearling the clouds around her Below the pond shimmered in its hazy radiance Just beyond the Gillis homestead was the church with the old graveyard beside it
608-123193-0009	train-other-500	The moonlight shone on the white stones bringing them out in clear cut relief against the dark trees behind How strange the graveyard looks by moonlight said Ruby suddenly How ghostly she shuddered Anne
608-123193-0010	train-other-500	it won t be long now before I ll be lying over there You and Diana and all the rest will be going about full of life and I ll be there in the old graveyard dead The surprise of it bewildered Anne For a few moments she could not speak You know it s so don t you
608-123193-0011	train-other-500	said Ruby insistently Yes I know
none	none	 answered Anne in a low tone 
608-123193-0012	train-other-500	Dear Ruby I know Everybody knows it said Ruby bitterly
none	none	 I know it I ve known it all summer though I wouldn t give in And oh Anne she reached out and caught Anne s hand pleadingly impulsively 
608-123193-0013	train-other-500	I don t want to die I m AFRAID to die Why should you be afraid Ruby asked Anne quietly Because because oh I m not afraid but that I ll go to heaven Anne I m a church member
none	none	 But it ll be all so different I think and think and I get so frightened and 
608-123193-0014	train-other-500	and homesick Heaven must be very beautiful of course the Bible says so but Anne IT WON T BE WHAT I VE BEEN USED TO
none	none	 Through Anne s mind drifted an intrusive recollection of a funny story she had heard Philippa Gordon tell the story of some old man who had said very much the same thing about the world to come It had sounded funny then she remembered how she and Priscilla had laughed over it But it did not seem in the least humorous now coming from Ruby s pale trembling lips 
608-123193-0015	train-other-500	It was sad tragic and true Heaven could not be what Ruby had been used to There had been nothing in her gay frivolous life her shallow ideals and aspirations to fit her for that great change
none	none	 or make the life to come seem to her anything but alien and unreal and undesirable Anne wondered helplessly what she could say that would help her Could she say anything I think Ruby she began hesitatingly 
608-123193-0016	train-other-500	for it was difficult for Anne to speak to any one of the deepest thoughts of her heart or the new ideas that had
none	none	 vaguely begun to shape themselves in her mind concerning the great mysteries of life here and hereafter superseding her old childish conceptions and it was hardest of all to speak of them to such as Ruby Gillis I think perhaps we have very mistaken ideas about heaven 
608-123193-0017	train-other-500	what it is and what it holds for us I don t think it can be so very different from life here as most people seem to think I believe we ll just go on living a good deal as we live here and be OURSELVES just the same
608-123193-0018	train-other-500	only it will be easier to be good and to follow the highest All the hindrances and perplexities will be taken away and we shall see clearly Don t be afraid Ruby I can t help it said Ruby pitifully
none	none	 Even if what you say about heaven is true and you can t be sure it may be only that imagination of yours it won t be JUST the same It CAN T be I want to go on living HERE I m so young Anne I haven t had my life I ve fought so hard to live and it isn t any use I have to die and leave EVERYTHING I care for Anne sat in a pain that was almost intolerable She could not tell comforting falsehoods 
608-123193-0019	train-other-500	and all that Ruby said was so horribly true She WAS leaving everything she cared for She had laid up her treasures on earth only she had lived solely for the little things of life the things that pass forgetting the great things that go onward into eternity
none	none	 bridging the gulf between the two lives and making of death a mere passing from one dwelling to the other from twilight to unclouded day God would take care of her there Anne believed she would learn 
608-123193-0020	train-other-500	but now it was no wonder her soul clung in blind helplessness to the only things she knew and loved
none	none	 Ruby raised herself on her arm and lifted up her bright beautiful blue eyes to the moonlit skies I want to live she said in a trembling voice I want to live like other girls I I want to be married Anne and 
608-123193-0021	train-other-500	and have little children You know I always loved babies Anne
none	none	 I couldn t say this to any one but you I know you understand And then poor Herb he he loves me and I love him Anne The others meant nothing to me but HE does and if I could live I would be his wife and be so happy Oh Anne it s hard Ruby sank back on her pillows and sobbed convulsively 
608-123193-0022	train-other-500	Anne pressed her hand in an agony of sympathy
none	none	 silent sympathy which perhaps helped Ruby more than broken imperfect words could have done 
608-123193-0023	train-other-500	for presently she grew calmer and her sobs ceased
none	none	 I m glad I ve told you this Anne she whispered It has helped me just to say it all out 
608-123193-0024	train-other-500	I ve wanted to all summer every time you came I wanted to talk it over with you but I COULDN T
none	none	 It seemed as if it would make death so SURE if I SAID I was going to die or if any one else said it or hinted it 
608-123193-0025	train-other-500	I wouldn t say it or even think it In the daytime when people were around me and everything was cheerful it wasn t so hard to keep from thinking of it But in the night when I couldn t sleep it was so dreadful Anne I couldn t get away from it then
608-123193-0026	train-other-500	Death just came and stared me in the face until I got so frightened
none	none	 I could have screamed 
608-123193-0027	train-other-500	But you won t be frightened any more Ruby will you
none	none	 You ll be brave and believe that all is going to be well with you I ll try I ll think over what you have said and try to believe it 
608-123193-0028	train-other-500	And you ll come up as often as you can won t you Anne
none	none	 Yes dear It it won t be very long now Anne I feel sure of that 
608-123193-0029	train-other-500	And I d rather have you than any one else I always liked you best of all the girls I went to school with You were never jealous or mean like some of them
none	none	 were Poor Em White was up to see me yesterday You remember Em and I were such chums for three years when we went to school And then we quarrelled the time of the school concert 
608-123193-0030	train-other-500	We ve never spoken to each other since
none	none	 Wasn t it silly 
608-123193-0031	train-other-500	Anything like that seems silly NOW But Em and I made up the old quarrel yesterday
none	none	 She said she d have spoken years ago only she thought I wouldn t And I never spoke to her because I was sure she wouldn t speak to me Isn t it strange how people misunderstand each other Anne Most of the trouble in life comes from misunderstanding I think said Anne I must go now Ruby It s getting late 
608-123193-0032	train-other-500	and you shouldn t be out in the damp You ll come up soon again Yes very soon And if there s anything I can do to help you I ll be so glad I know You HAVE helped me already
608-123193-0033	train-other-500	Nothing seems quite so dreadful now Good night Anne Good night dear
none	none	 Anne walked home very slowly in the moonlight The evening had changed something for her 
608-123193-0034	train-other-500	Life held a different meaning a deeper purpose On the surface it would go on just the same but the deeps had been stirred It must not be with her as with poor butterfly Ruby
none	none	 When she came to the end of one life it must not be to face the next with the shrinking terror of something wholly different 
608-123193-0035	train-other-500	something for which accustomed thought and ideal and aspiration had unfitted her The little things of life sweet and excellent in their place must not be the things lived for the highest must be sought and followed the life of heaven must be begun here on earth
608-123193-0036	train-other-500	That good night in the garden was for all time Anne never saw Ruby in life again The next night the A V I S gave a farewell party to Jane Andrews before her departure for the West And while light feet danced and bright eyes laughed and merry tongues chattered
608-123193-0037	train-other-500	there came a summons to a soul in Avonlea that might not be disregarded or evaded The next morning the word went from house to house that Ruby Gillis was dead She had died in her sleep painlessly and calmly and on her face was a smile
608-123193-0038	train-other-500	as if after all death had come as a kindly friend to lead her over the threshold instead of the grisly phantom she had dreaded missus Rachel Lynde said emphatically after the funeral that Ruby Gillis was the handsomest corpse she ever laid eyes on Her loveliness
608-123193-0039	train-other-500	as she lay white clad among the delicate flowers that Anne had placed about her was remembered and talked of for years in Avonlea Ruby had always been beautiful but her beauty had been of the earth earthy
none	none	 it had had a certain insolent quality in it as if it flaunted itself in the beholder s eye 
608-123193-0040	train-other-500	spirit had never shone through it intellect had never refined it But death had touched it and consecrated it bringing out delicate modelings and purity of outline never seen before doing what life and love and great sorrow
608-123193-0041	train-other-500	and deep womanhood joys might have done for Ruby Anne looking down through a mist of tears at her old playfellow thought she saw the face God had meant Ruby to have and remembered it so always
none	none	 missus Gillis called Anne aside into a vacant room before the funeral procession left the house and gave her a small packet 
608-123193-0042	train-other-500	I want you to have this she sobbed Ruby would have liked you to have it It s the embroidered centerpiece she was working at It isn t quite finished the needle is sticking in it just where her poor little fingers put it the last time she laid it down the afternoon before she died
none	none	 There s always a piece of unfinished work left said missus Lynde with tears in her eyes But I suppose there s always some one to finish it How difficult it is to realize that one we have always known can really be dead said Anne as she and Diana walked home 
608-123193-0043	train-other-500	Ruby is the first of our schoolmates to go One by one sooner or later all the rest of us must follow Yes I suppose so said Diana uncomfortably
none	none	 She did not want to talk of that She would have preferred to have discussed the details of the funeral the splendid white velvet casket mister Gillis had insisted on having for Ruby 
608-123193-0044	train-other-500	the Gillises must always make a splurge even at funerals quoth missus Rachel Lynde Herb Spencer s sad face
none	none	 the uncontrolled hysteric grief of one of Ruby s sisters 
608-123193-0045	train-other-500	but Anne would not talk of these things She seemed wrapped in a reverie in which Diana felt lonesomely that she had neither lot nor part Ruby Gillis was a great girl to laugh said Davy suddenly
none	none	 Will she laugh as much in heaven as she did in Avonlea Anne 
608-123193-0046	train-other-500	I want to know Yes I think she will said Anne Oh Anne protested Diana with a rather shocked smile Well why not Diana asked Anne seriously Do you think we ll never laugh in heaven Oh I I don t know floundered Diana
none	none	 It doesn t seem just right somehow 
608-123193-0047	train-other-500	You know it s rather dreadful to laugh in church But heaven won t be like church all the time said Anne I hope it ain t said Davy emphatically
none	none	 If it is I don t want to go Church is awful dull Anyway I don t mean to go for ever so long I mean to live to be a hundred years old like mister Thomas Blewett of White Sands He says he s lived so long cause he always smoked tobacco and it killed all the germs Can I smoke tobacco pretty soon Anne No Davy I hope you ll never use tobacco said Anne absently What ll you feel like if the germs kill me then demanded Davy Chapter XV A Dream Turned Upside Down Just one more week and we go back to Redmond said Anne She was happy at the thought of returning to work classes and Redmond friends 
608-123194-0000	train-other-500	Pleasing visions were also being woven around Patty s Place There was a warm pleasant sense of home in the thought of it even though she had never lived there But the summer had been a very happy one too a time of glad living with summer suns and skies a time of keen delight in wholesome things
none	none	 a time of renewing and deepening of old friendships a time in which she had learned to live more nobly 
608-123194-0001	train-other-500	to work more patiently to play more heartily All life lessons are not learned at college she thought Life teaches them everywhere But alas the final week of that pleasant vacation was spoiled for Anne
608-123194-0002	train-other-500	by one of those impish happenings which are like a dream turned upside down Been writing any more stories lately inquired mister Harrison genially one evening when Anne was taking tea with him and missus Harrison
608-123194-0003	train-other-500	No answered Anne rather crisply Well no offense meant
none	none	 missus Hiram Sloane told me the other day that a big envelope addressed to the Rollings Reliable Baking Powder Company of Montreal 
608-123194-0004	train-other-500	had been dropped into the post office box a month ago
none	none	 and she suspicioned that somebody was trying for the prize they d offered for the best story that introduced the name of their baking powder She said it wasn t addressed in your writing but I thought maybe it was you 
608-123194-0005	train-other-500	Indeed no I saw the prize offer but I d never dream of competing for it
none	none	 I think it would be perfectly disgraceful to write a story to advertise a baking powder 
608-123194-0006	train-other-500	It would be almost as bad as Judson Parker s patent medicine fence So spake Anne loftily little dreaming of the valley of humiliation awaiting her That very evening Diana popped into the porch gable bright eyed and rosy cheeked carrying a letter
none	none	 Oh Anne here s a letter for you I was at the office so I thought I d bring it along Do open it quick If it is what I believe it is I shall just be wild with delight 
608-123194-0007	train-other-500	Anne puzzled opened the letter and glanced over the typewritten contents Miss Anne Shirley Green Gables Avonlea P E Island DEAR MADAM
none	none	 We have much pleasure in informing you that your charming story Averil s Atonement has won the prize of twenty five dollars offered in our recent competition We enclose the check herewith We are arranging for the publication of the story in several prominent Canadian newspapers and we also intend to have it printed in pamphlet form for distribution among our patrons 
608-123194-0008	train-other-500	Thanking you for the interest you have shown in our enterprise we remain Yours very truly
none	none	 THE ROLLINGS RELIABLE BAKING POWDER company 
608-123194-0009	train-other-500	I don t understand said Anne blankly Diana clapped her hands
none	none	 Oh I KNEW it would win the prize 
608-123194-0010	train-other-500	I was sure of it I sent your story into the competition Anne
none	none	 Diana Barry Yes I did said Diana gleefully perching herself on the bed When I saw the offer I thought of your story in a minute and at first I thought I d ask you to send it in But then I was afraid you wouldn t you had so little faith left in it So I just decided I d send the copy you gave me and say nothing about it Then if it didn t win the prize you d never know and you wouldn t feel badly over it because the stories that failed were not to be returned and if it did you d have such a delightful surprise Diana was not the most discerning of mortals 
608-123194-0011	train-other-500	but just at this moment it struck her that Anne was not looking exactly overjoyed The surprise was there beyond doubt but where was the delight Why Anne you don t seem a bit pleased she exclaimed
608-123194-0012	train-other-500	Anne instantly manufactured a smile and put it on Of course I couldn t be anything but pleased over your unselfish wish to give me pleasure she said slowly But you know I m so amazed I can t realize it
608-123194-0013	train-other-500	and I don t understand There wasn t a word in my story about about Anne choked a little over the word baking powder Oh I put that in said Diana reassured
none	none	 It was as easy as wink and of course my experience in our old Story Club helped me You know the scene where Averil makes the cake Well I just stated that she used the Rollings Reliable in it 
608-123194-0014	train-other-500	and that was why it turned out so well and then in the last paragraph where PERCEVAL clasps AVERIL in his arms and says Sweetheart the beautiful coming years will bring us the fulfilment of our home of dreams I added
608-123194-0015	train-other-500	in which we will never use any baking powder except Rollings Reliable Oh gasped poor Anne
none	none	 as if some one had dashed cold water on her And you ve won the twenty five dollars continued Diana jubilantly 
608-123194-0016	train-other-500	Why I heard Priscilla say once that the Canadian Woman only pays five dollars for a story Anne held out the hateful pink slip in shaking fingers I can t take it it s yours by right Diana You sent the story in and made the alterations I
none	none	 I would certainly never have sent it 
608-123194-0017	train-other-500	So you must take the check I d like to see myself said Diana scornfully Why what I did wasn t any trouble The honor of being a friend of the prizewinner is enough for me Well I must go
none	none	 I should have gone straight home from the post office for we have company 
608-123194-0018	train-other-500	But I simply had to come and hear the news I m so glad for your sake Anne Anne suddenly bent forward put her arms about Diana and kissed her cheek I think you are the sweetest and truest friend in the world Diana she said
608-123194-0019	train-other-500	with a little tremble in her voice and I assure you I appreciate the motive of what you ve done Diana pleased and embarrassed got herself away and poor Anne after flinging the innocent check into her bureau drawer as if it were blood money
608-123194-0020	train-other-500	cast herself on her bed and wept tears of shame and outraged sensibility Oh she could never live this down never Gilbert arrived at dusk brimming over with congratulations
none	none	 for he had called at Orchard Slope and heard the news But his congratulations died on his lips at sight of Anne s face Why Anne what is the matter I expected to find you radiant over winning Rollings Reliable prize Good for you Oh Gilbert not you implored Anne in an ET TU BRUTE tone 
608-123194-0021	train-other-500	I thought YOU would understand Can t you see how awful it is I must confess I can t WHAT is wrong Everything moaned Anne I feel as if I were disgraced forever
none	none	 What do you think a mother would feel like if she found her child tattooed over with a baking powder advertisement 
608-123194-0022	train-other-500	I feel just the same I loved my poor little story and I wrote it out of the best that was in me And it is SACRILEGE to have it degraded to the level of a baking powder advertisement
none	none	 Don t you remember what Professor Hamilton used to tell us in the literature class at Queen s 
608-123194-0023	train-other-500	He said we were never to write a word for a low or unworthy motive but always to cling to the very highest ideals
none	none	 What will he think when he hears I ve written a story to advertise Rollings Reliable And oh when it gets out at Redmond Think how I ll be teased and laughed at 
608-123194-0024	train-other-500	That you won t said Gilbert wondering uneasily if it were that confounded Junior s opinion in particular over which Anne was worried The Reds will think just as I thought that you being like nine out of ten of us not overburdened with worldly wealth
none	none	 had taken this way of earning an honest penny to help yourself through the year 
608-123194-0025	train-other-500	I don t see that there s anything low or unworthy about that or anything ridiculous either
none	none	 One would rather write masterpieces of literature no doubt 
608-123194-0026	train-other-500	but meanwhile board and tuition fees have to be paid
none	none	 This commonsense matter of fact view of the case cheered Anne a little At least it removed her dread of being laughed at though the deeper hurt of an outraged ideal remained Chapter XVI Adjusted Relationships It s the homiest spot I ever saw it s homier than home avowed Philippa Gordon looking about her with delighted eyes They were all assembled at twilight in the big living room at Patty s Place Anne and Priscilla Phil and Stella Aunt Jamesina Rusty Joseph the Sarah Cat and Gog and Magog The firelight shadows were dancing over the walls the cats were purring and a huge bowl of hothouse chrysanthemums sent to Phil by one of the victims shone through the golden gloom like creamy moons It was three weeks since they had considered themselves settled and already all believed the experiment would be a success The first fortnight after their return had been a pleasantly exciting one they had been busy setting up their household goods organizing their little establishment and adjusting different opinions Anne was not over sorry to leave Avonlea when the time came to return to college The last few days of her vacation had not been pleasant Her prize story had been published in the Island papers and mister William Blair had upon the counter of his store a huge pile of pink green and yellow pamphlets containing it one of which he gave to every customer He sent a complimentary bundle to Anne who promptly dropped them all in the kitchen stove Her humiliation was the consequence of her own ideals only for Avonlea folks thought it quite splendid that she should have won the prize Her many friends regarded her with honest admiration her few foes with scornful envy Josie Pye said she believed Anne Shirley had just copied the story she was sure she remembered reading it in a paper years before The Sloanes who had found out or guessed that Charlie had been turned down said they didn t think it was much to be proud of almost any one could have done it if she tried Aunt Atossa told Anne she was very sorry to hear she had taken to writing novels nobody born and bred in Avonlea would do it that was what came of adopting orphans from goodness knew where with goodness knew what kind of parents Even missus Rachel Lynde was darkly dubious about the propriety of writing fiction though she was almost reconciled to it by that twenty five dollar check It is perfectly amazing the price they pay for such lies that s what she said half proudly half severely All things considered it was a relief when going away time came And it was very jolly to be back at Redmond a wise experienced Soph with hosts of friends to greet on the merry opening day Pris and Stella and Gilbert were there Charlie Sloane looking more important than ever a Sophomore looked before Phil with the Alec and Alonzo question still unsettled and Moody Spurgeon MacPherson Moody Spurgeon had been teaching school ever since leaving Queen s but his mother had concluded it was high time he gave it up and turned his attention to learning how to be a minister Poor Moody Spurgeon fell on hard luck at the very beginning of his college career Half a dozen ruthless Sophs who were among his fellow boarders swooped down upon him one night and shaved half of his head In this guise the luckless Moody Spurgeon had to go about until his hair grew again He told Anne bitterly that there were times when he had his doubts as to whether he was really called to be a minister Aunt Jamesina did not come until the girls had Patty s Place ready for her Miss Patty had sent the key to Anne with a letter in which she said Gog and Magog were packed in a box under the spare room bed but might be taken out when wanted in a postscript she added that she hoped the girls would be careful about putting up pictures The living room had been newly papered five years before and she and Miss Maria did not want any more holes made in that new paper than was absolutely necessary For the rest she trusted everything to Anne How those girls enjoyed putting their nest in order As Phil said it was almost as good as getting married You had the fun of homemaking without the bother of a husband All brought something with them to adorn or make comfortable the little house Pris and Phil and Stella had knick knacks and pictures galore which latter they proceeded to hang according to taste in reckless disregard of Miss Patty s new paper We ll putty the holes up when we leave dear she ll never know they said to protesting Anne Diana had given Anne a pine needle cushion and Miss Ada had given both her and Priscilla a fearfully and wonderfully embroidered one Marilla had sent a big box of preserves and darkly hinted at a hamper for Thanksgiving and missus Lynde gave Anne a patchwork quilt and loaned her five more You take them she said authoritatively They might as well be in use as packed away in that trunk in the garret for moths to gnaw No moths would ever have ventured near those quilts for they reeked of mothballs to such an extent that they had to be hung in the orchard of Patty s Place a full fortnight before they could be endured indoors Verily aristocratic Spofford Avenue had rarely beheld such a display The gruff old millionaire who lived next door came over and wanted to buy the gorgeous red and yellow tulip pattern one which missus Rachel had given Anne He said his mother used to make quilts like that and by Jove he wanted one to remind him of her Anne would not sell it much to his disappointment but she wrote all about it to missus Lynde That highly gratified lady sent word back that she had one just like it to spare so the tobacco king got his quilt after all and insisted on having it spread on his bed to the disgust of his fashionable wife missus Lynde s quilts served a very useful purpose that winter Patty s Place for all its many virtues had its faults also It was really a rather cold house and when the frosty nights came the girls were very glad to snuggle down under missus Lynde s quilts and hoped that the loan of them might be accounted unto her for righteousness Anne had the blue room she had coveted at sight Priscilla and Stella had the large one Phil was blissfully content with the little one over the kitchen and Aunt Jamesina was to have the downstairs one off the living room Rusty at first slept on the doorstep Anne walking home from Redmond a few days after her return became aware that the people that she met surveyed her with a covert indulgent smile Anne wondered uneasily what was the matter with her Was her hat crooked Was her belt loose Craning her head to investigate Anne for the first time saw Rusty Trotting along behind her close to her heels was quite the most forlorn specimen of the cat tribe she had ever beheld The animal was well past kitten hood lank thin disreputable looking Pieces of both ears were lacking one eye was temporarily out of repair and one jowl ludicrously swollen As for color if a once black cat had been well and thoroughly singed the result would have resembled the hue of this waif s thin draggled unsightly fur Anne shooed but the cat would not shoo As long as she stood he sat back on his haunches and gazed at her reproachfully out of his one good eye when she resumed her walk he followed Anne resigned herself to his company until she reached the gate of Patty s Place which she coldly shut in his face fondly supposing she had seen the last of him But when fifteen minutes later Phil opened the door there sat the rusty brown cat on the step More he promptly darted in and sprang upon Anne s lap with a half pleading half triumphant miaow Anne said Stella severely do you own that animal No I do NOT protested disgusted Anne The creature followed me home from somewhere I couldn t get rid of him Ugh get down I like decent cats reasonably well but I don t like beasties of your complexion Pussy however refused to get down He coolly curled up in Anne s lap and began to purr He has evidently adopted you laughed Priscilla I won t BE adopted said Anne stubbornly The poor creature is starving said Phil pityingly Why his bones are almost coming through his skin Well I ll give him a square meal and then he must return to whence he came said Anne resolutely The cat was fed and put out In the morning he was still on the doorstep On the doorstep he continued to sit bolting in whenever the door was opened No coolness of welcome had the least effect on him of nobody save Anne did he take the least notice Out of compassion the girls fed him but when a week had passed they decided that something must be done The cat s appearance had improved His eye and cheek had resumed their normal appearance he was not quite so thin and he had been seen washing his face But for all that we can t keep him said Stella Aunt Jimsie is coming next week and she will bring the Sarah cat with her We can t keep two cats and if we did this Rusty Coat would fight all the time with the Sarah cat He s a fighter by nature He had a pitched battle last evening with the tobacco king s cat and routed him horse foot and artillery We must get rid of him agreed Anne looking darkly at the subject of their discussion who was purring on the hearth rug with an air of lamb like meekness But the question is how How can four unprotected females get rid of a cat who won t be got rid of We must chloroform him said Phil briskly That is the most humane way Who of us knows anything about chloroforming a cat demanded Anne gloomily I do honey It s one of my few sadly few useful accomplishments I ve disposed of several at home You take the cat in the morning and give him a good breakfast Then you take an old burlap bag there s one in the back porch put the cat on it and turn over him a wooden box Then take a two ounce bottle of chloroform uncork it and slip it under the edge of the box Put a heavy weight on top of the box and leave it till evening The cat will be dead curled up peacefully as if he were asleep No pain no struggle It sounds easy said Anne dubiously It IS easy Just leave it to me I ll see to it said Phil reassuringly Accordingly the chloroform was procured and the next morning Rusty was lured to his doom He ate his breakfast licked his chops and climbed into Anne s lap Anne s heart misgave her This poor creature loved her trusted her How could she be a party to this destruction Here take him she said hastily to Phil I feel like a murderess He won t suffer you know comforted Phil but Anne had fled The fatal deed was done in the back porch Nobody went near it that day But at dusk Phil declared that Rusty must be buried Pris and Stella must dig his grave in the orchard declared Phil and Anne must come with me to lift the box off That s the part I always hate The two conspirators tip toed reluctantly to the back porch Phil gingerly lifted the stone she had put on the box Suddenly faint but distinct sounded an unmistakable mew under the box He he isn t dead gasped Anne sitting blankly down on the kitchen doorstep He must be said Phil incredulously Another tiny mew proved that he wasn t The two girls stared at each other What will we do questioned Anne Why in the world don t you come demanded Stella appearing in the doorway We ve got the grave ready What silent still and silent all she quoted teasingly Oh no the voices of the dead Sound like the distant torrent s fall promptly counter quoted Anne pointing solemnly to the box A burst of laughter broke the tension We must leave him here till morning said Phil replacing the stone He hasn t mewed for five minutes Perhaps the mews we heard were his dying groan Or perhaps we merely imagined them under the strain of our guilty consciences But when the box was lifted in the morning Rusty bounded at one gay leap to Anne s shoulder where he began to lick her face affectionately Never was there a cat more decidedly alive Here s a knot hole in the box groaned Phil I never saw it That s why he didn t die Now we ve got to do it all over again No we haven t declared Anne suddenly Rusty isn t going to be killed again He s my cat and you ve just got to make the best of it Oh well if you ll settle with Aunt Jimsie and the Sarah cat said Stella with the air of one washing her hands of the whole affair From that time Rusty was one of the family He slept o nights on the scrubbing cushion in the back porch and lived on the fat of the land By the time Aunt Jamesina came he was plump and glossy and tolerably respectable But like Kipling s cat he walked by himself His paw was against every cat and every cat s paw against him One by one he vanquished the aristocratic felines of Spofford Avenue As for human beings he loved Anne and Anne alone Nobody else even dared stroke him An angry spit and something that sounded much like very improper language greeted any one who did The airs that cat puts on are perfectly intolerable declared Stella Him was a nice old pussens him was vowed Anne cuddling her pet defiantly Well I don t know how he and the Sarah cat will ever make out to live together said Stella pesimistically Cat fights in the orchard o nights are bad enough But cat fights here in the livingroom are unthinkable In due time Aunt Jamesina arrived Anne and Priscilla and Phil had awaited her advent rather dubiously but when Aunt Jamesina was enthroned in the rocking chair before the open fire they figuratively bowed down and worshipped her Aunt Jamesina was a tiny old woman with a little softly triangular face and large soft blue eyes that were alight with unquenchable youth and as full of hopes as a girl s She had pink cheeks and snow white hair which she wore in quaint little puffs over her ears It s a very old fashioned way she said knitting industriously at something as dainty and pink as a sunset cloud But I am old fashioned My clothes are and it stands to reason my opinions are too I don t say they re any the better of that mind you In fact I daresay they re a good deal the worse But they ve worn nice and easy New shoes are smarter than old ones but the old ones are more comfortable I m old enough to indulge myself in the matter of shoes and opinions I mean to take it real easy here I know you expect me to look after you and keep you proper but I m not going to do it You re old enough to know how to behave if you re ever going to be So as far as I am concerned concluded Aunt Jamesina with a twinkle in her young eyes you can all go to destruction in your own way Oh will somebody separate those cats pleaded Stella shudderingly Aunt Jamesina had brought with her not only the Sarah cat but Joseph Joseph she explained had belonged to a dear friend of hers who had gone to live in Vancouver She couldn t take Joseph with her so she begged me to take him I really couldn t refuse He s a beautiful cat that is his disposition is beautiful She called him Joseph because his coat is of many colors It certainly was Joseph as the disgusted Stella said looked like a walking rag bag It was impossible to say what his ground color was His legs were white with black spots on them His back was gray with a huge patch of yellow on one side and a black patch on the other His tail was yellow with a gray tip One ear was black and one yellow A black patch over one eye gave him a fearfully rakish look In reality he was meek and inoffensive of a sociable disposition In one respect if in no other Joseph was like a lily of the field He toiled not neither did he spin or catch mice Yet Solomon in all his glory slept not on softer cushions or feasted more fully on fat things Joseph and the Sarah cat arrived by express in separate boxes After they had been released and fed Joseph selected the cushion and corner which appealed to him and the Sarah cat gravely sat herself down before the fire and proceeded to wash her face She was a large sleek gray and white cat with an enormous dignity which was not at all impaired by any consciousness of her plebian origin She had been given to Aunt Jamesina by her washerwoman Her name was Sarah so my husband always called puss the Sarah cat explained Aunt Jamesina She is eight years old and a remarkable mouser Don t worry Stella The Sarah cat NEVER fights and Joseph rarely They ll have to fight here in self defense said Stella At this juncture Rusty arrived on the scene He bounded joyously half way across the room before he saw the intruders Then he stopped short his tail expanded until it was as big as three tails The fur on his back rose up in a defiant arch Rusty lowered his head uttered a fearful shriek of hatred and defiance and launched himself at the Sarah cat The stately animal had stopped washing her face and was looking at him curiously She met his onslaught with one contemptuous sweep of her capable paw Rusty went rolling helplessly over on the rug he picked himself up dazedly What sort of a cat was this who had boxed his ears He looked dubiously at the Sarah cat Would he or would he not The Sarah cat deliberately turned her back on him and resumed her toilet operations Rusty decided that he would not He never did From that time on the Sarah cat ruled the roost Rusty never again interfered with her But Joseph rashly sat up and yawned Rusty burning to avenge his disgrace swooped down upon him Joseph pacific by nature could fight upon occasion and fight well The result was a series of drawn battles Every day Rusty and Joseph fought at sight Anne took Rusty s part and detested Joseph Stella was in despair But Aunt Jamesina only laughed Let them fight it out she said tolerantly They ll make friends after a bit Joseph needs some exercise he was getting too fat And Rusty has to learn he isn t the only cat in the world Eventually Joseph and Rusty accepted the situation and from sworn enemies became sworn friends They slept on the same cushion with their paws about each other and gravely washed each other s faces We ve all got used to each other said Phil And I ve learned how to wash dishes and sweep a floor But you needn t try to make us believe you can chloroform a cat laughed Anne It was all the fault of the knothole protested Phil It was a good thing the knothole was there said Aunt Jamesina rather severely Kittens HAVE to be drowned I admit or the world would be overrun But no decent grown up cat should be done to death unless he sucks eggs You wouldn t have thought Rusty very decent if you d seen him when he came here said Stella He positively looked like the Old Nick I don t believe Old Nick can be so very ugly said Aunt Jamesina reflectively He wouldn t do so much harm if he was I always think of him as a rather handsome gentleman Chapter XVII A Letter from Davy It s beginning to snow girls said Phil coming in one November evening and there are the loveliest little stars and crosses all over the garden walk I never noticed before what exquisite things snowflakes really are One has time to notice things like that in the simple life Bless you all for permitting me to live it It s really delightful to feel worried because butter has gone up five cents a pound Has it demanded Stella who kept the household accounts It has and here s your butter I m getting quite expert at marketing It s better fun than flirting concluded Phil gravely Everything is going up scandalously sighed Stella Never mind Thank goodness air and salvation are still free said Aunt Jamesina And so is laughter added Anne There s no tax on it yet and that is well because you re all going to laugh presently I m going to read you Davy s letter His spelling has improved immensely this past year though he is not strong on apostrophes and he certainly possesses the gift of writing an interesting letter Listen and laugh before we settle down to the evening s study grind Dear Anne ran Davy s letter I take my pen to tell you that we are all pretty well and hope this will find you the same It s snowing some today and Marilla says the old woman in the sky is shaking her feather beds Is the old woman in the sky God s wife Anne I want to know missus Lynde has been real sick but she is better now She fell down the cellar stairs last week When she fell she grabbed hold of the shelf with all the milk pails and stewpans on it and it gave way and went down with her and made a splendid crash Marilla thought it was an earthquake at first One of the stewpans was all dinged up and missus Lynde straned her ribs The doctor came and gave her medicine to rub on her ribs but she didn t under stand him and took it all inside instead The doctor said it was a wonder it dident kill her but it dident and it cured her ribs and missus Lynde says doctors dont know much anyhow But we couldent fix up the stewpan Marilla had to throw it out Thanksgiving was last week There was no school and we had a great dinner I et mince pie and rost turkey and frut cake and donuts and cheese and jam and choklut cake Marilla said I d die but I dident Dora had earake after it only it wasent in her ears it was in her stummick I dident have earake anywhere Our new teacher is a man He does things for jokes Last week he made all us third class boys write a composishun on what kind of a wife we d like to have and the girls on what kind of a husband He laughed fit to kill when he read them This was mine I thought youd like to see it The kind of a wife I d like to Have She must have good manners and get my meals on time and do what I tell her and always be very polite to me She must be fifteen yers old She must be good to the poor and keep her house tidy and be good tempered and go to church regularly She must be very handsome and have curly hair If I get a wife that is just what I like Ill be an awful good husband to her I think a woman ought to be awful good to her husband Some poor women haven t any husbands THE END I was at missus Isaac Wrights funeral at White Sands last week The husband of the corpse felt real sorry missus Lynde says missus Wrights grandfather stole a sheep but Marilla says we mustent speak ill of the dead Why mustent we Anne I want to know It s pretty safe ain t it missus Lynde was awful mad the other day because I asked her if she was alive in Noah s time I dident mean to hurt her feelings I just wanted to know Was she Anne mister Harrison wanted to get rid of his dog So he hunged him once but he come to life and scooted for the barn while mister Harrison was digging the grave so he hunged him again and he stayed dead that time mister Harrison has a new man working for him He s awful okward mister Harrison says he is left handed in both his feet mister Barry s hired man is lazy missus Barry says that but mister Barry says he aint lazy exactly only he thinks it easier to pray for things than to work for them missus Harmon Andrews prize pig that she talked so much of died in a fit missus Lynde says it was a judgment on her for pride But I think it was hard on the pig Milty Boulter has been sick The doctor gave him medicine and it tasted horrid I offered to take it for him for a quarter but the Boulters are so mean Milty says he d rather take it himself and save his money I asked missus Boulter how a person would go about catching a man and she got awful mad and said she dident know shed never chased men The A V I S is going to paint the hall again They re tired of having it blue The new minister was here to tea last night He took three pieces of pie If I did that missus Lynde would call me piggy And he et fast and took big bites and Marilla is always telling me not to do that Why can ministers do what boys can t I want to know I haven t any more news Here are six kisses xxxxxx Dora sends one Heres hers x Your loving friend DAVID KEITH P S Anne who was the devils father I want to know Chapter XVIII Miss Josephine Remembers the Anne girl When Christmas holidays came the girls of Patty s Place scattered to their respective homes but Aunt Jamesina elected to stay where she was I couldn t go to any of the places I ve been invited and take those three cats she said And I m not going to leave the poor creatures here alone for nearly three weeks If we had any decent neighbors who would feed them I might but there s nothing except millionaires on this street So I ll stay here and keep Patty s Place warm for you Anne went home with the usual joyous anticipations which were not wholly fulfilled She found Avonlea in the grip of such an early cold and stormy winter as even the oldest inhabitant could not recall Green Gables was literally hemmed in by huge drifts Almost every day of that ill starred vacation it stormed fiercely and even on fine days it drifted unceasingly No sooner were the roads broken than they filled in again It was almost impossible to stir out The A V I S tried on three evenings to have a party in honor of the college students and on each evening the storm was so wild that nobody could go so they gave up the attempt in despair Anne despite her love of and loyalty to Green Gables could not help thinking longingly of Patty s Place its cosy open fire Aunt Jamesina s mirthful eyes the three cats the merry chatter of the girls the pleasantness of Friday evenings when college friends dropped in to talk of grave and gay Anne was lonely Diana during the whole of the holidays was imprisoned at home with a bad attack of bronchitis She could not come to Green Gables and it was rarely Anne could get to Orchard Slope for the old way through the Haunted Wood was impassable with drifts and the long way over the frozen Lake of Shining Waters was almost as bad Ruby Gillis was sleeping in the white heaped graveyard Jane Andrews was teaching a school on western prairies Gilbert to be sure was still faithful and waded up to Green Gables every possible evening But Gilbert s visits were not what they once were Anne almost dreaded them It was very disconcerting to look up in the midst of a sudden silence and find Gilbert s hazel eyes fixed upon her with a quite unmistakable expression in their grave depths and it was still more disconcerting to find herself blushing hotly and uncomfortably under his gaze just as if just as if well it was very embarrassing Anne wished herself back at Patty s Place where there was always somebody else about to take the edge off a delicate situation At Green Gables Marilla went promptly to missus Lynde s domain when Gilbert came and insisted on taking the twins with her The significance of this was unmistakable and Anne was in a helpless fury over it Davy however was perfectly happy He reveled in getting out in the morning and shoveling out the paths to the well and henhouse He gloried in the Christmas tide delicacies which Marilla and missus Lynde vied with each other in preparing for Anne and he was reading an enthralling tale in a school library book of a wonderful hero who seemed blessed with a miraculous faculty for getting into scrapes from which he was usually delivered by an earthquake or a volcanic explosion which blew him high and dry out of his troubles landed him in a fortune and closed the story with proper ECLAT I tell you it s a bully story Anne he said ecstatically I d ever so much rather read it than the Bible Would you smiled Anne Davy peered curiously at her You don t seem a bit shocked Anne missus Lynde was awful shocked when I said it to her No I m not shocked Davy I think it s quite natural that a nine year old boy would sooner read an adventure story than the Bible But when you are older I hope and think that you will realize what a wonderful book the Bible is Oh I think some parts of it are fine conceded Davy That story about Joseph now it s bully But if I d been Joseph I wouldn t have forgive the brothers No siree Anne I d have cut all their heads off missus Lynde was awful mad when I said that and shut the Bible up and said she d never read me any more of it if I talked like that So I don t talk now when she reads it Sunday afternoons I just think things and say them to Milty Boulter next day in school I told Milty the story about Elisha and the bears and it scared him so he s never made fun of mister Harrison s bald head once Are there any bears on P E Island Anne I want to know Not nowadays said Anne absently as the wind blew a scud of snow against the window Oh dear will it ever stop storming God knows said Davy airily preparing to resume his reading Anne WAS shocked this time Davy she exclaimed reproachfully missus Lynde says that protested Davy One night last week Marilla said Will Ludovic Speed and Theodora Dix EVER get married and missus Lynde said God knows just like that Well it wasn t right for her to say it said Anne promptly deciding upon which horn of this dilemma to empale herself It isn t right for anybody to take that name in vain or speak it lightly Davy Don t ever do it again Not if I say it slow and solemn like the minister queried Davy gravely No not even then Well I won t Ludovic Speed and Theodora Dix live in Middle Grafton and missus Rachel says he has been courting her for a hundred years Won t they soon be too old to get married Anne I hope Gilbert won t court YOU that long When are you going to be married Anne missus Lynde says it s a sure thing missus Lynde is a began Anne hotly then stopped Awful old gossip completed Davy calmly That s what every one calls her But is it a sure thing Anne I want to know You re a very silly little boy Davy said Anne stalking haughtily out of the room The kitchen was deserted and she sat down by the window in the fast falling wintry twilight The sun had set and the wind had died down A pale chilly moon looked out behind a bank of purple clouds in the west The sky faded out but the strip of yellow along the western horizon grew brighter and fiercer as if all the stray gleams of light were concentrating in one spot the distant hills rimmed with priest like firs stood out in dark distinctness against it Anne looked across the still white fields cold and lifeless in the harsh light of that grim sunset and sighed She was very lonely and she was sad at heart for she was wondering if she would be able to return to Redmond next year It did not seem likely The only scholarship possible in the Sophomore year was a very small affair She would not take Marilla s money and there seemed little prospect of being able to earn enough in the summer vacation I suppose I ll just have to drop out next year she thought drearily and teach a district school again until I earn enough to finish my course And by that time all my old class will have graduated and Patty s Place will be out of the question But there I m not going to be a coward I m thankful I can earn my way through if necessary Here s mister Harrison wading up the lane announced Davy running out I hope he s brought the mail It s three days since we got it I want to see what them pesky Grits are doing I m a Conservative Anne And I tell you you have to keep your eye on them Grits mister Harrison had brought the mail and merry letters from Stella and Priscilla and Phil soon dissipated Anne s blues Aunt Jamesina too had written saying that she was keeping the hearth fire alight and that the cats were all well and the house plants doing fine The weather has been real cold she wrote so I let the cats sleep in the house Rusty and Joseph on the sofa in the living room and the Sarah cat on the foot of my bed It s real company to hear her purring when I wake up in the night and think of my poor daughter in the foreign field If it was anywhere but in India I wouldn t worry but they say the snakes out there are terrible It takes all the Sarah cats s purring to drive away the thought of those snakes I have enough faith for everything but the snakes I can t think why Providence ever made them Sometimes I don t think He did I m inclined to believe the Old Harry had a hand in making THEM Anne had left a thin typewritten communication till the last thinking it unimportant When she had read it she sat very still with tears in her eyes What is the matter Anne asked Marilla Miss Josephine Barry is dead said Anne in a low tone So she has gone at last said Marilla Well she has been sick for over a year and the Barrys have been expecting to hear of her death any time It is well she is at rest for she has suffered dreadfully Anne She was always kind to you She has been kind to the last Marilla This letter is from her lawyer She has left me a thousand dollars in her will Gracious ain t that an awful lot of money exclaimed Davy She s the woman you and Diana lit on when you jumped into the spare room bed ain t she Diana told me that story Is that why she left you so much Hush Davy said Anne gently She slipped away to the porch gable with a full heart leaving Marilla and missus Lynde to talk over the news to their hearts content Do you s pose Anne will ever get married now speculated Davy anxiously When Dorcas Sloane got married last summer she said if she d had enough money to live on she d never have been bothered with a man but even a widower with eight children was better n living with a sister in law Davy Keith do hold your tongue said missus Rachel severely The way you talk is scandalous for a small boy that s what Chapter XIX An Interlude To think that this is my twentieth birthday and that I ve left my teens behind me forever said Anne who was curled up on the hearth rug with Rusty in her lap to Aunt Jamesina who was reading in her pet chair They were alone in the living room Stella and Priscilla had gone to a committee meeting and Phil was upstairs adorning herself for a party I suppose you feel kind of sorry said Aunt Jamesina The teens are such a nice part of life I m glad I ve never gone out of them myself Anne laughed You never will Aunty You ll be eighteen when you should be a hundred Yes I m sorry and a little dissatisfied as well Miss Stacy told me long ago that by the time I was twenty my character would be formed for good or evil I don t feel that it s what it should be It s full of flaws So s everybody s said Aunt Jamesina cheerfully Mine s cracked in a hundred places Your Miss Stacy likely meant that when you are twenty your character would have got its permanent bent in one direction or tother and would go on developing in that line Don t worry over it Anne Do your duty by God and your neighbor and yourself and have a good time That s my philosophy and it s always worked pretty well Where s Phil off to tonight She s going to a dance and she s got the sweetest dress for it creamy yellow silk and cobwebby lace It just suits those brown tints of hers There s magic in the words silk and lace isn t there said Aunt Jamesina The very sound of them makes me feel like skipping off to a dance And YELLOW silk It makes one think of a dress of sunshine I always wanted a yellow silk dress but first my mother and then my husband wouldn t hear of it The very first thing I m going to do when I get to heaven is to get a yellow silk dress Amid Anne s peal of laughter Phil came downstairs trailing clouds of glory and surveyed herself in the long oval mirror on the wall A flattering looking glass is a promoter of amiability she said The one in my room does certainly make me green Do I look pretty nice Anne Do you really know how pretty you are Phil asked Anne in honest admiration Of course I do What are looking glasses and men for That wasn t what I meant Are all my ends tucked in Is my skirt straight And would this rose look better lower down I m afraid it s too high it will make me look lop sided But I hate things tickling my ears Everything is just right and that southwest dimple of yours is lovely Anne there s one thing in particular I like about you you re so ungrudging There isn t a particle of envy in you Why should she be envious demanded Aunt Jamesina She s not quite as goodlooking as you maybe but she s got a far handsomer nose I know it conceded Phil My nose always has been a great comfort to me confessed Anne And I love the way your hair grows on your forehead Anne And that one wee curl always looking as if it were going to drop but never dropping is delicious But as for noses mine is a dreadful worry to me I know by the time I m forty it will be Byrney What do you think I ll look like when I m forty Anne Like an old matronly married woman teased Anne I won t said Phil sitting down comfortably to wait for her escort Joseph you calico beastie don t you dare jump on my lap I won t go to a dance all over cat hairs No Anne I WON T look matronly But no doubt I ll be married To Alec or Alonzo asked Anne To one of them I suppose sighed Phil if I can ever decide which It shouldn t be hard to decide scolded Aunt Jamesina I was born a see saw Aunty and nothing can ever prevent me from teetering You ought to be more levelheaded Philippa It s best to be levelheaded of course agreed Philippa but you miss lots of fun As for Alec and Alonzo if you knew them you d understand why it s difficult to choose between them They re equally nice Then take somebody who is nicer suggested Aunt Jamesina There s that Senior who is so devoted to you Will Leslie He has such nice large mild eyes They re a little bit too large and too mild like a cow s said Phil cruelly What do you say about George Parker There s nothing to say about him except that he always looks as if he had just been starched and ironed Marr Holworthy then You can t find a fault with him No he would do if he wasn t poor I must marry a rich man Aunt Jamesina That and good looks is an indispensable qualification I d marry Gilbert Blythe if he were rich Oh would you said Anne rather viciously We don t like that idea a little bit although we don t want Gilbert ourselves oh no mocked Phil But don t let s talk of disagreeable subjects I ll have to marry sometime I suppose but I shall put off the evil day as long as I can You mustn t marry anybody you don t love Phil when all s said and done said Aunt Jamesina Oh hearts that loved in the good old way Have been out o the fashion this many a day trilled Phil mockingly There s the carriage I fly Bi bi you two old fashioned darlings When Phil had gone Aunt Jamesina looked solemnly at Anne That girl is pretty and sweet and goodhearted but do you think she is quite right in her mind by spells Anne Oh I don t think there s anything the matter with Phil s mind said Anne hiding a smile It s just her way of talking Aunt Jamesina shook her head Well I hope so Anne I do hope so because I love her But I can t understand her she beats me She isn t like any of the girls I ever knew or any of the girls I was myself How many girls were you Aunt Jimsie About half a dozen my dear Chapter XX Gilbert Speaks This has been a dull prosy day yawned Phil stretching herself idly on the sofa having previously dispossessed two exceedingly indignant cats Anne looked up from Pickwick Papers Now that spring examinations were over she was treating herself to Dickens It has been a prosy day for us she said thoughtfully but to some people it has been a wonderful day Some one has been rapturously happy in it Perhaps a great deed has been done somewhere today or a great poem written or a great man born And some heart has been broken Phil Why did you spoil your pretty thought by tagging that last sentence on honey grumbled Phil I don t like to think of broken hearts or anything unpleasant Do you think you ll be able to shirk unpleasant things all your life Phil Dear me no Am I not up against them now You don t call Alec and Alonzo pleasant things do you when they simply plague my life out You never take anything seriously Phil Why should I There are enough folks who do The world needs people like me Anne just to amuse it It would be a terrible place if EVERYBODY were intellectual and serious and in deep deadly earnest MY mission is as Josiah Allen says to charm and allure Confess now Hasn t life at Patty s Place been really much brighter and pleasanter this past winter because I ve been here to leaven you Yes it has owned Anne And you all love me even Aunt Jamesina who thinks I m stark mad So why should I try to be different Oh dear I m so sleepy I was awake until one last night reading a harrowing ghost story I read it in bed and after I had finished it do you suppose I could get out of bed to put the light out No And if Stella had not fortunately come in late that lamp would have burned good and bright till morning When I heard Stella I called her in explained my predicament and got her to put out the light If I had got out myself to do it I knew something would grab me by the feet when I was getting in again By the way Anne has Aunt Jamesina decided what to do this summer Yes she s going to stay here I know she s doing it for the sake of those blessed cats although she says it s too much trouble to open her own house and she hates visiting What are you reading Pickwick That s a book that always makes me hungry said Phil There s so much good eating in it The characters seem always to be reveling on ham and eggs and milk punch I generally go on a cupboard rummage after reading Pickwick The mere thought reminds me that I m starving Is there any tidbit in the pantry Queen Anne I made a lemon pie this morning You may have a piece of it Phil dashed out to the pantry and Anne betook herself to the orchard in company with Rusty It was a moist pleasantly odorous night in early spring The snow was not quite all gone from the park a little dingy bank of it yet lay under the pines of the harbor road screened from the influence of April suns It kept the harbor road muddy and chilled the evening air But grass was growing green in sheltered spots and Gilbert had found some pale sweet arbutus in a hidden corner He came up from the park his hands full of it Anne was sitting on the big gray boulder in the orchard looking at the poem of a bare birchen bough hanging against the pale red sunset with the very perfection of grace She was building a castle in air a wondrous mansion whose sunlit courts and stately halls were steeped in Araby s perfume and where she reigned queen and chatelaine She frowned as she saw Gilbert coming through the orchard Of late she had managed not to be left alone with Gilbert But he had caught her fairly now and even Rusty had deserted her Gilbert sat down beside her on the boulder and held out his Mayflowers Don t these remind you of home and our old schoolday picnics Anne Anne took them and buried her face in them I m in mister Silas Sloane s barrens this very minute she said rapturously I suppose you will be there in reality in a few days No not for a fortnight I m going to visit with Phil in Bolingbroke before I go home You ll be in Avonlea before I will No I shall not be in Avonlea at all this summer Anne I ve been offered a job in the Daily News office and I m going to take it Oh said Anne vaguely She wondered what a whole Avonlea summer would be like without Gilbert Somehow she did not like the prospect Well she concluded flatly it is a good thing for you of course Yes I ve been hoping I would get it It will help me out next year You mustn t work too HARD said Anne without any very clear idea of what she was saying She wished desperately that Phil would come out You ve studied very constantly this winter Isn t this a delightful evening Do you know I found a cluster of white violets under that old twisted tree over there today I felt as if I had discovered a gold mine You are always discovering gold mines said Gilbert also absently Let us go and see if we can find some more suggested Anne eagerly I ll call Phil and Never mind Phil and the violets just now Anne said Gilbert quietly taking her hand in a clasp from which she could not free it There is something I want to say to you Oh don t say it cried Anne pleadingly Don t PLEASE Gilbert I must Things can t go on like this any longer Anne I love you You know I do I I can t tell you how much Will you promise me that some day you ll be my wife I I can t said Anne miserably Oh Gilbert you you ve spoiled everything Don t you care for me at all Gilbert asked after a very dreadful pause during which Anne had not dared to look up Not not in that way I do care a great deal for you as a friend But I don t love you Gilbert But can t you give me some hope that you will yet No I can t exclaimed Anne desperately I never never can love you in that way Gilbert You must never speak of this to me again There was another pause so long and so dreadful that Anne was driven at last to look up Gilbert s face was white to the lips And his eyes but Anne shuddered and looked away There was nothing romantic about this Must proposals be either grotesque or horrible Could she ever forget Gilbert s face Is there anybody else he asked at last in a low voice No no said Anne eagerly I don t care for any one like THAT and I LIKE you better than anybody else in the world Gilbert And we must we must go on being friends Gilbert Gilbert gave a bitter little laugh Friends Your friendship can t satisfy me Anne I want your love and you tell me I can never have that I m sorry Forgive me Gilbert was all Anne could say Where oh where were all the gracious and graceful speeches wherewith in imagination she had been wont to dismiss rejected suitors Gilbert released her hand gently There isn t anything to forgive There have been times when I thought you did care I ve deceived myself that s all Goodbye Anne Anne got herself to her room sat down on her window seat behind the pines and cried bitterly She felt as if something incalculably precious had gone out of her life It was Gilbert s friendship of course Oh why must she lose it after this fashion What is the matter honey asked Phil coming in through the moonlit gloom Anne did not answer At that moment she wished Phil were a thousand miles away I suppose you ve gone and refused Gilbert Blythe You are an idiot Anne Shirley Do you call it idiotic to refuse to marry a man I don t love said Anne coldly goaded to reply You don t know love when you see it You ve tricked something out with your imagination that you think love and you expect the real thing to look like that There that s the first sensible thing I ve ever said in my life I wonder how I managed it Phil pleaded Anne please go away and leave me alone for a little while My world has tumbled into pieces I want to reconstruct it Without any Gilbert in it said Phil going A world without any Gilbert in it Anne repeated the words drearily Would it not be a very lonely forlorn place Well it was all Gilbert s fault He had spoiled their beautiful comradeship She must just learn to live without it Chapter XXI Roses of Yesterday The fortnight Anne spent in Bolingbroke was a very pleasant one with a little under current of vague pain and dissatisfaction running through it whenever she thought about Gilbert There was not however much time to think about him Mount Holly the beautiful old Gordon homestead was a very gay place overrun by Phil s friends of both sexes There was quite a bewildering succession of drives dances picnics and boating parties all expressively lumped together by Phil under the head of jamborees Alec and Alonzo were so constantly on hand that Anne wondered if they ever did anything but dance attendance on that will o the wisp of a Phil They were both nice manly fellows but Anne would not be drawn into any opinion as to which was the nicer And I depended so on you to help me make up my mind which of them I should promise to marry mourned Phil You must do that for yourself You are quite expert at making up your mind as to whom other people should marry retorted Anne rather caustically Oh that s a very different thing said Phil truly But the sweetest incident of Anne s sojourn in Bolingbroke was the visit to her birthplace the little shabby yellow house in an out of the way street she had so often dreamed about She looked at it with delighted eyes as she and Phil turned in at the gate It s almost exactly as I ve pictured it she said There is no honeysuckle over the windows but there is a lilac tree by the gate and yes there are the muslin curtains in the windows How glad I am it is still painted yellow A very tall very thin woman opened the door Yes the Shirleys lived here twenty years ago she said in answer to Anne s question They had it rented I remember em They both died of fever at onct It was turrible sad They left a baby I guess it s dead long ago It was a sickly thing Old Thomas and his wife took it as if they hadn t enough of their own It didn t die said Anne smiling I was that baby You don t say so Why you have grown exclaimed the woman as if she were much surprised that Anne was not still a baby Come to look at you I see the resemblance You re complected like your pa He had red hair But you favor your ma in your eyes and mouth She was a nice little thing My darter went to school to her and was nigh crazy about her They was buried in the one grave and the School Board put up a tombstone to them as a reward for faithful service Will you come in Will you let me go all over the house asked Anne eagerly Laws yes you can if you like Twon t take you long there ain t much of it I keep at my man to build a new kitchen but he ain t one of your hustlers The parlor s in there and there s two rooms upstairs Just prowl about yourselves I ve got to see to the baby The east room was the one you were born in I remember your ma saying she loved to see the sunrise and I mind hearing that you was born just as the sun was rising and its light on your face was the first thing your ma saw Anne went up the narrow stairs and into that little east room with a full heart It was as a shrine to her Here her mother had dreamed the exquisite happy dreams of anticipated motherhood here that red sunrise light had fallen over them both in the sacred hour of birth here her mother had died Anne looked about her reverently her eyes with tears It was for her one of the jeweled hours of life that gleam out radiantly forever in memory Just to think of it mother was younger than I am now when I was born she whispered When Anne went downstairs the lady of the house met her in the hall She held out a dusty little packet tied with faded blue ribbon Here s a bundle of old letters I found in that closet upstairs when I came here she said I dunno what they are I never bothered to look in em but the address on the top one is Miss Bertha Willis and that was your ma s maiden name You can take em if you d keer to have em Oh thank you thank you cried Anne clasping the packet rapturously That was all that was in the house said her hostess The furniture was all sold to pay the doctor bills and missus Thomas got your ma s clothes and little things I reckon they didn t last long among that drove of Thomas youngsters They was destructive young animals as I mind em I haven t one thing that belonged to my mother said Anne chokily I I can never thank you enough for these letters You re quite welcome Laws but your eyes is like your ma s She could just about talk with hers Your father was sorter homely but awful nice I mind hearing folks say when they was married that there never was two people more in love with each other Pore creatures they didn t live much longer but they was awful happy while they was alive and I s pose that counts for a good deal Anne longed to get home to read her precious letters but she made one little pilgrimage first She went alone to the green corner of the old Bolingbroke cemetery where her father and mother were buried and left on their grave the white flowers she carried Then she hastened back to Mount Holly shut herself up in her room and read the letters Some were written by her father some by her mother There were not many only a dozen in all for Walter and Bertha Shirley had not been often separated during their courtship The letters were yellow and faded and dim blurred with the touch of passing years No profound words of wisdom were traced on the stained and wrinkled pages but only lines of love and trust The sweetness of forgotten things clung to them the far off fond imaginings of those long dead lovers Bertha Shirley had possessed the gift of writing letters which embodied the charming personality of the writer in words and thoughts that retained their beauty and fragrance after the lapse of time The letters were tender intimate sacred To Anne the sweetest of all was the one written after her birth to the father on a brief absence It was full of a proud young mother s accounts of baby her cleverness her brightness her thousand sweetnesses I love her best when she is asleep and better still when she is awake Bertha Shirley had written in the postscript Probably it was the last sentence she had ever penned The end was very near for her This has been the most beautiful day of my life Anne said to Phil that night I ve FOUND my father and mother Those letters have made them REAL to me I m not an orphan any longer I feel as if I had opened a book and found roses of yesterday sweet and beloved between its leaves Chapter XXII Spring and Anne Return to Green Gables The firelight shadows were dancing over the kitchen walls at Green Gables for the spring evening was chilly through the open east window drifted in the subtly sweet voices of the night Marilla was sitting by the fire at least in body In spirit she was roaming olden ways with feet grown young Of late Marilla had thus spent many an hour when she thought she should have been knitting for the twins I suppose I m growing old she said Yet Marilla had changed but little in the past nine years save to grow something thinner and even more angular there was a little more gray in the hair that was still twisted up in the same hard knot with two hairpins WERE they the same hairpins still stuck through it But her expression was very different the something about the mouth which had hinted at a sense of humor had developed wonderfully her eyes were gentler and milder her smile more frequent and tender Marilla was thinking of her whole past life her cramped but not unhappy childhood the jealously hidden dreams and the blighted hopes of her girlhood the long gray narrow monotonous years of dull middle life that followed And the coming of Anne the vivid imaginative impetuous child with her heart of love and her world of fancy bringing with her color and warmth and radiance until the wilderness of existence had blossomed like the rose Marilla felt that out of her sixty years she had lived only the nine that had followed the advent of Anne And Anne would be home tomorrow night The kitchen door opened Marilla looked up expecting to see missus Lynde Anne stood before her tall and starry eyed with her hands full of Mayflowers and violets Anne Shirley exclaimed Marilla For once in her life she was surprised out of her reserve she caught her girl in her arms and crushed her and her flowers against her heart kissing the bright hair and sweet face warmly I never looked for you till tomorrow night How did you get from Carmody Walked dearest of Marillas Haven t I done it a score of times in the Queen s days The mailman is to bring my trunk tomorrow I just got homesick all at once and came a day earlier And oh I ve had such a lovely walk in the May twilight I stopped by the barrens and picked these Mayflowers I came through Violet Vale it s just a big bowlful of violets now the dear sky tinted things Smell them Marilla drink them in Marilla sniffed obligingly but she was more interested in Anne than in drinking violets Sit down child You must be real tired I m going to get you some supper There s a darling moonrise behind the hills tonight Marilla and oh how the frogs sang me home from Carmody I do love the music of the frogs It seems bound up with all my happiest recollections of old spring evenings And it always reminds me of the night I came here first Do you remember it Marilla Well yes said Marilla with emphasis I m not likely to forget it ever They used to sing so madly in the marsh and brook that year I would listen to them at my window in the dusk and wonder how they could seem so glad and so sad at the same time Oh but it s good to be home again Redmond was splendid and Bolingbroke delightful but Green Gables is HOME Gilbert isn t coming home this summer I hear said Marilla No Something in Anne s tone made Marilla glance at her sharply but Anne was apparently absorbed in arranging her violets in a bowl See aren t they sweet she went on hurriedly The year is a book isn t it Marilla Spring s pages are written in Mayflowers and violets summer s in roses autumn s in red maple leaves and winter in holly and evergreen Did Gilbert do well in his examinations persisted Marilla Excellently well He led his class But where are the twins and missus Lynde Rachel and Dora are over at mister Harrison s Davy is down at Boulters I think I hear him coming now Davy burst in saw Anne stopped and then hurled himself upon her with a joyful yell Oh Anne ain t I glad to see you Say Anne I ve grown two inches since last fall missus Lynde measured me with her tape today and say Anne see my front tooth It s gone missus Lynde tied one end of a string to it and the other end to the door and then shut the door I sold it to Milty for two cents Milty s collecting teeth What in the world does he want teeth for asked Marilla To make a necklace for playing Indian Chief explained Davy climbing upon Anne s lap He s got fifteen already and everybody s else s promised so there s no use in the rest of us starting to collect too I tell you the Boulters are great business people Were you a good boy at missus Boulter s asked Marilla severely Yes but say Marilla I m tired of being good You d get tired of being bad much sooner Davy boy said Anne Well it d be fun while it lasted wouldn t it persisted Davy I could be sorry for it afterwards couldn t I Being sorry wouldn t do away with the consequences of being bad Davy Don t you remember the Sunday last summer when you ran away from Sunday School You told me then that being bad wasn t worth while What were you and Milty doing today Oh we fished and chased the cat and hunted for eggs and yelled at the echo There s a great echo in the bush behind the Boulter barn Say what is echo Anne I want to know Echo is a beautiful nymph Davy living far away in the woods and laughing at the world from among the hills What does she look like Her hair and eyes are dark but her neck and arms are white as snow No mortal can ever see how fair she is She is fleeter than a deer and that mocking voice of hers is all we can know of her You can hear her calling at night you can hear her laughing under the stars But you can never see her She flies afar if you follow her and laughs at you always just over the next hill Is that true Anne Or is it a whopper demanded Davy staring Davy said Anne despairingly haven t you sense enough to distinguish between a fairytale and a falsehood Then what is it that sasses back from the Boulter bush I want to know insisted Davy When you are a little older Davy I ll explain it all to you The mention of age evidently gave a new turn to Davy s thoughts for after a few moments of reflection he whispered solemnly Anne I m going to be married When asked Anne with equal solemnity Oh not until I m grown up of course Well that s a relief Davy Who is the lady Stella Fletcher she s in my class at school And say Anne she s the prettiest girl you ever saw If I die before I grow up you ll keep an eye on her won t you Davy Keith do stop talking such nonsense said Marilla severely Tisn t nonsense protested Davy in an injured tone She s my promised wife and if I was to die she d be my promised widow wouldn t she And she hasn t got a soul to look after her except her old grandmother Come and have your supper Anne said Marilla and don t encourage that child in his absurd talk Chapter XXIII Paul Cannot Find the Rock People Life was very pleasant in Avonlea that summer although Anne amid all her vacation joys was haunted by a sense of something gone which should be there 
52-123202-0001	train-other-500	She would not admit even in her inmost reflections that this was caused by Gilbert s absence But when she had to walk home alone from prayer meetings and A V I S pow wows
52-123202-0002	train-other-500	while Diana and Fred and many other gay couples loitered along the dusky starlit country roads there was a queer lonely ache in her heart which she could not explain away Gilbert did not even write to her as she thought he might have done
none	none	 She knew he wrote to Diana occasionally but she would not inquire about him 
52-123202-0003	train-other-500	and Diana supposing that Anne heard from him volunteered no information Gilbert s mother who was a gay frank light hearted lady but not overburdened with tact had a very embarrassing habit of asking Anne
52-123202-0004	train-other-500	always in a painfully distinct voice and always in the presence of a crowd if she had heard from Gilbert lately Poor Anne could only blush horribly and murmur not very lately which was taken by all missus Blythe included to be merely a maidenly evasion
52-123202-0005	train-other-500	Apart from this Anne enjoyed her summer Priscilla came for a merry visit in June
none	none	 and when she had gone mister and missus Irving 
52-123202-0006	train-other-500	Paul and Charlotta the Fourth came home for July and August Echo Lodge was the scene of gaieties once more and the echoes over the river were kept busy mimicking the laughter that rang in the old garden behind the spruces
none	none	 Miss Lavendar had not changed except to grow even sweeter and prettier 
52-123202-0007	train-other-500	Paul adored her and the companionship between them was beautiful to see But I don t call her mother just by itself he explained to Anne You see THAT name belongs just to my own little mother and I can t give it to any one else You know teacher
52-123202-0008	train-other-500	But I call her Mother Lavendar and I love her next best to father I I even love her a LITTLE better than you teacher
none	none	 Which is just as it ought to be answered Anne 
52-123202-0009	train-other-500	Paul was thirteen now and very tall for his years His face and eyes were as beautiful as ever and his fancy was still like a prism separating everything that fell upon it into rainbows He and Anne had delightful rambles to wood and field and shore
52-123202-0010	train-other-500	Never were there two more thoroughly kindred spirits Charlotta the Fourth had blossomed out into young ladyhood She wore her hair now in an enormous pompador and had discarded the blue ribbon bows of auld lang syne
52-123202-0011	train-other-500	but her face was as freckled her nose as snubbed and her mouth and smiles as wide as ever You don t think I talk with a Yankee accent do you Miss Shirley ma am she demanded anxiously I don t notice it Charlotta I m real glad of that
52-123202-0012	train-other-500	They said I did at home but I thought likely they just wanted to aggravate me I don t want no Yankee accent
none	none	 Not that I ve a word to say against the Yankees Miss Shirley ma am 
52-123202-0013	train-other-500	They re real civilized But give me old P E Island every time Paul spent his first fortnight with his grandmother Irving in Avonlea Anne was there to meet him when he came and found him wild with eagerness to get to the shore Nora and the Golden Lady and the Twin Sailors would be there
52-123202-0014	train-other-500	He could hardly wait to eat his supper Could he not see Nora s elfin face peering around the point watching for him wistfully But it was a very sober Paul who came back from the shore in the twilight Didn t you find your Rock People asked Anne
52-123202-0015	train-other-500	Paul shook his chestnut curls sorrowfully The Twin Sailors and the Golden Lady never came at all he said Nora was there but Nora is not the same teacher She is changed Oh Paul it is you who are changed said Anne
52-123202-0016	train-other-500	You have grown too old for the Rock People They like only children for playfellows I am afraid the Twin Sailors will never again come to you in the pearly enchanted boat with the sail of moonshine and the Golden Lady will play no more for you on her golden harp Even Nora will not meet you much longer
52-123202-0017	train-other-500	You must pay the penalty of growing up Paul You must leave fairyland behind you You two talk as much foolishness as ever you did said old missus Irving half indulgently half reprovingly Oh no we don t said Anne
none	none	 shaking her head gravely 
52-123202-0018	train-other-500	We are getting very very wise and it is such a pity
none	none	 We are never half so interesting when we have learned that language is given us to enable us to conceal our thoughts But it isn t it is given us to exchange our thoughts said missus Irving seriously She had never heard of Tallyrand and did not understand epigrams Anne spent a fortnight of halcyon days at Echo Lodge in the golden prime of August While there she incidentally contrived to hurry Ludovic Speed in his leisurely courting of Theodora Dix as related duly in another chronicle of her history one Arnold Sherman an elderly friend of the Irvings was there at the same time and added not a little to the general pleasantness of life one Chronicles of Avonlea What a nice play time this has been said Anne I feel like a giant refreshed And it s only a fortnight more till I go back to Kingsport and Redmond and Patty s Place Patty s Place is the dearest spot Miss Lavendar I feel as if I had two homes one at Green Gables and one at Patty s Place But where has the summer gone 
52-123202-0019	train-other-500	It doesn t seem a day since I came home that spring evening with the Mayflowers When I was little I couldn t see from one end of the summer to the other It stretched before me like an unending season Now tis a handbreadth tis a tale
none	none	 Anne are you and Gilbert Blythe as good friends as you used to be asked Miss Lavendar quietly 
52-123202-0020	train-other-500	I am just as much Gilbert s friend as ever I was Miss Lavendar
none	none	 Miss Lavendar shook her head 
52-123202-0021	train-other-500	I see something s gone wrong Anne I m going to be impertinent and ask what Have you quarrelled No it s only that Gilbert wants more than friendship and I can t give him more Are you sure of that Anne Perfectly sure
52-123202-0022	train-other-500	I m very very sorry I wonder why everybody seems to think I ought to marry Gilbert Blythe said Anne petulantly
none	none	 Because you were made and meant for each other Anne that is why You needn t toss that young head of yours It s a fact Chapter XXIV Enter Jonas PROSPECT POINT August twentieth Dear Anne spelled with an E wrote Phil I must prop my eyelids open long enough to write you I ve neglected you shamefully this summer honey but all my other correspondents have been neglected too I have a huge pile of letters to answer so I must gird up the loins of my mind and hoe in Excuse my mixed metaphors I m fearfully sleepy Last night Cousin Emily and I were calling at a neighbor s There were several other callers there and as soon as those unfortunate creatures left our hostess and her three daughters picked them all to pieces I knew they would begin on Cousin Emily and me as soon as the door shut behind us When we came home missus Lilly informed us that the aforesaid neighbor s hired boy was supposed to be down with scarlet fever You can always trust missus Lilly to tell you cheerful things like that I have a horror of scarlet fever I couldn t sleep when I went to bed for thinking of it I tossed and tumbled about dreaming fearful dreams when I did snooze for a minute and at three I wakened up with a high fever a sore throat and a raging headache I knew I had scarlet fever I got up in a panic and hunted up Cousin Emily s doctor book to read up the symptoms Anne I had them all So I went back to bed and knowing the worst slept like a top the rest of the night Though why a top should sleep sounder than anything else I never could understand But this morning I was quite well so it couldn t have been the fever I suppose if I did catch it last night it couldn t have developed so soon I can remember that in daytime but at three o clock at night I never can be logical I suppose you wonder what I m doing at Prospect Point Well I always like to spend a month of summer at the shore and father insists that I come to his second cousin Emily s select boardinghouse at Prospect Point So a fortnight ago I came as usual And as usual old Uncle Mark Miller brought me from the station with his ancient buggy and what he calls his generous purpose horse He is a nice old man and gave me a handful of pink peppermints Peppermints always seem to me such a religious sort of candy I suppose because when I was a little girl Grandmother Gordon always gave them to me in church Once I asked referring to the smell of peppermints Is that the odor of sanctity I didn t like to eat Uncle Mark s peppermints because he just fished them loose out of his pocket and had to pick some rusty nails and other things from among them before he gave them to me But I wouldn t hurt his dear old feelings for anything so I carefully sowed them along the road at intervals When the last one was gone Uncle Mark said a little rebukingly Ye shouldn t a et all them candies to onct Miss Phil You ll likely have the stummick ache Cousin Emily has only five boarders besides myself four old ladies and one young man My right hand neighbor is missus Lilly She is one of those people who seem to take a gruesome pleasure in detailing all their many aches and pains and sicknesses You cannot mention any ailment but she says shaking her head Ah I know too well what that is and then you get all the details Jonas declares he once spoke of locomotor ataxia in hearing and she said she knew too well what that was She suffered from it for ten years and was finally cured by a traveling doctor Who is Jonas Just wait Anne Shirley You ll hear all about Jonas in the proper time and place He is not to be mixed up with estimable old ladies My left hand neighbor at the table is missus Phinney She always speaks with a wailing dolorous voice you are nervously expecting her to burst into tears every moment She gives you the impression that life to her is indeed a vale of tears and that a smile never to speak of a laugh is a frivolity truly reprehensible She has a worse opinion of me than Aunt Jamesina and she doesn t love me hard to atone for it as Aunty J does either Miss Maria Grimsby sits cati corner from me The first day I came I remarked to Miss Maria that it looked a little like rain and Miss Maria laughed I said the road from the station was very pretty and Miss Maria laughed I said there seemed to be a few mosquitoes left yet and Miss Maria laughed I said that Prospect Point was as beautiful as ever and Miss Maria laughed If I were to say to Miss Maria My father has hanged himself my mother has taken poison my brother is in the penitentiary and I am in the last stages of consumption Miss Maria would laugh She can t help it she was born so but is very sad and awful The fifth old lady is missus Grant She is a sweet old thing but she never says anything but good of anybody and so she is a very uninteresting conversationalist And now for Jonas Anne That first day I came I saw a young man sitting opposite me at the table smiling at me as if he had known me from my cradle I knew for Uncle Mark had told me that his name was Jonas Blake that he was a Theological Student from saint Columbia and that he had taken charge of the Point Prospect Mission Church for the summer He is a very ugly young man really the ugliest young man I ve ever seen He has a big loose jointed figure with absurdly long legs His hair is tow color and lank his eyes are green and his mouth is big and his ears but I never think about his ears if I can help it He has a lovely voice if you shut your eyes he is adorable and he certainly has a beautiful soul and disposition We were good chums right way Of course he is a graduate of Redmond and that is a link between us We fished and boated together and we walked on the sands by moonlight He didn t look so homely by moonlight and oh he was nice Niceness fairly exhaled from him The old ladies except missus Grant don t approve of Jonas because he laughs and jokes and because he evidently likes the society of frivolous me better than theirs Somehow Anne I don t want him to think me frivolous This is ridiculous Why should I care what a tow haired person called Jonas whom I never saw before thinks of me Last Sunday Jonas preached in the village church I went of course but I couldn t realize that Jonas was going to preach The fact that he was a minister or going to be one persisted in seeming a huge joke to me Well Jonas preached And by the time he had preached ten minutes I felt so small and insignificant that I thought I must be invisible to the naked eye Jonas never said a word about women and he never looked at me But I realized then and there what a pitiful frivolous small souled little butterfly I was and how horribly different I must be from Jonas ideal woman SHE would be grand and strong and noble He was so earnest and tender and true He was everything a minister ought to be I wondered how I could ever have thought him ugly but he really is with those inspired eyes and that intellectual brow which the roughly falling hair hid on week days It was a splendid sermon and I could have listened to it forever and it made me feel utterly wretched Oh I wish I was like YOU Anne He caught up with me on the road home and grinned as cheerfully as usual But his grin could never deceive me again I had seen the REAL Jonas I wondered if he could ever see the REAL PHIL whom NOBODY not even you Anne has ever seen yet Jonas I said I forgot to call him mister Blake Wasn t it dreadful But there are times when things like that don t matter Jonas you were born to be a minister You COULDN T be anything else No I couldn t he said soberly I tried to be something else for a long time I didn t want to be a minister But I came to see at last that it was the work given me to do and God helping me I shall try to do it His voice was low and reverent I thought that he would do his work and do it well and nobly and happy the woman fitted by nature and training to help him do it SHE would be no feather blown about by every fickle wind of fancy SHE would always know what hat to put on Probably she would have only one Ministers never have much money But she wouldn t mind having one hat or none at all because she would have Jonas Anne Shirley don t you dare to say or hint or think that I ve fallen in love with mister Blake Could I care for a lank poor ugly theologue named Jonas As Uncle Mark says It s impossible and what s more it s improbable Good night PHIL P S It is impossible but I am horribly afraid it s true I m happy and wretched and scared HE can NEVER care for me I know Do you think I could ever develop into a passable minister s wife Anne And WOULD they expect me to lead in prayer P G Chapter XXV Enter Prince Charming I m contrasting the claims of indoors and out said Anne looking from the window of Patty s Place to the distant pines of the park I ve an afternoon to spend in sweet doing nothing Aunt Jimsie Shall I spend it here where there is a cosy fire a plateful of delicious russets three purring and harmonious cats and two impeccable china dogs with green noses Or shall I go to the park where there is the lure of gray woods and of gray water lapping on the harbor rocks If I was as young as you I d decide in favor of the park said Aunt Jamesina tickling Joseph s yellow ear with a knitting needle I thought that you claimed to be as young as any of us Aunty teased Anne Yes in my soul But I ll admit my legs aren t as young as yours You go and get some fresh air Anne You look pale lately I think I ll go to the park said Anne restlessly I don t feel like tame domestic joys today I want to feel alone and free and wild The park will be empty for every one will be at the football match Why didn t you go to it Nobody axed me sir she said at least nobody but that horrid little Dan Ranger I wouldn t go anywhere with him but rather than hurt his poor little tender feelings I said I wasn t going to the game at all I don t mind I m not in the mood for football today somehow You go and get some fresh air repeated Aunt Jamesina but take your umbrella for I believe it s going to rain I ve rheumatism in my leg Only old people should have rheumatism Aunty Anybody is liable to rheumatism in her legs Anne It s only old people who should have rheumatism in their souls though Thank goodness I never have When you get rheumatism in your soul you might as well go and pick out your coffin It was November the month of crimson sunsets parting birds deep sad hymns of the sea passionate wind songs in the pines Anne roamed through the pineland alleys in the park and as she said let that great sweeping wind blow the fogs out of her soul Anne was not wont to be troubled with soul fog But somehow since her return to Redmond for this third year life had not mirrored her spirit back to her with its old perfect sparkling clearness Outwardly existence at Patty s Place was the same pleasant round of work and study and recreation that it had always been On Friday evenings the big fire lighted livingroom was crowded by callers and echoed to endless jest and laughter while Aunt Jamesina smiled beamingly on them all The Jonas of Phil s letter came often running up from saint Columbia on the early train and departing on the late He was a general favorite at Patty s Place though Aunt Jamesina shook her head and opined that divinity students were not what they used to be He s VERY nice my dear she told Phil but ministers ought to be graver and more dignified Can t a man laugh and laugh and be a Christian still demanded Phil Oh MEN yes But I was speaking of MINISTERS my dear said Aunt Jamesina rebukingly And you shouldn t flirt so with mister Blake you really shouldn t I m not flirting with him protested Phil Nobody believed her except Anne The others thought she was amusing herself as usual and told her roundly that she was behaving very badly mister Blake isn t of the Alec and Alonzo type Phil said Stella severely He takes things seriously You may break his heart Do you really think I could asked Phil I d love to think so Philippa Gordon I never thought you were utterly unfeeling The idea of you saying you d love to break a man s heart I didn t say so honey Quote me correctly I said I d like to think I COULD break it I would like to know I had the POWER to do it I don t understand you Phil You are leading that man on deliberately and you know you don t mean anything by it I mean to make him ask me to marry him if I can said Phil calmly I give you up said Stella hopelessly Gilbert came occasionally on Friday evenings He seemed always in good spirits and held his own in the jests and repartee that flew about He neither sought nor avoided Anne When circumstances brought them in contact he talked to her pleasantly and courteously as to any newly made acquaintance The old camaraderie was gone entirely Anne felt it keenly but she told herself she was very glad and thankful that Gilbert had got so completely over his disappointment in regard to her She had really been afraid that April evening in the orchard that she had hurt him terribly and that the wound would be long in healing Now she saw that she need not have worried Men have died and the worms have eaten them but not for love Gilbert evidently was in no danger of immediate dissolution He was enjoying life and he was full of ambition and zest For him there was to be no wasting in despair because a woman was fair and cold Anne as she listened to the ceaseless badinage that went on between him and Phil wondered if she had only imagined that look in his eyes when she had told him she could never care for him There were not lacking those who would gladly have stepped into Gilbert s vacant place But Anne snubbed them without fear and without reproach If the real Prince Charming was never to come she would have none of a substitute So she sternly told herself that gray day in the windy park Suddenly the rain of Aunt Jamesina s prophecy came with a swish and rush Anne put up her umbrella and hurried down the slope As she turned out on the harbor road a savage gust of wind tore along it Instantly her umbrella turned wrong side out Anne clutched at it in despair And then there came a voice close to her Pardon me may I offer you the shelter of my umbrella Anne looked up Tall and handsome and distinguished looking dark melancholy inscrutable eyes melting musical sympathetic voice yes the very hero of her dreams stood before her in the flesh He could not have more closely resembled her ideal if he had been made to order Thank you she said confusedly We d better hurry over to that little pavillion on the point suggested the unknown We can wait there until this shower is over It is not likely to rain so heavily very long The words were very commonplace but oh the tone And the smile which accompanied them Anne felt her heart beating strangely Together they scurried to the pavilion and sat breathlessly down under its friendly roof Anne laughingly held up her false umbrella It is when my umbrella turns inside out that I am convinced of the total depravity of inanimate things she said gaily The raindrops sparkled on her shining hair its loosened rings curled around her neck and forehead Her cheeks were flushed her eyes big and starry Her companion looked down at her admiringly She felt herself blushing under his gaze Who could he be Why there was a bit of the Redmond white and scarlet pinned to his coat lapel Yet she had thought she knew by sight at least all the Redmond students except the Freshmen And this courtly youth surely was no Freshman We are schoolmates I see he said smiling at Anne s colors That ought to be sufficient introduction My name is Royal Gardner And you are the Miss Shirley who read the Tennyson paper at the Philomathic the other evening aren t you Yes but I cannot place you at all said Anne frankly Please where DO you belong I feel as if I didn t belong anywhere yet I put in my Freshman and Sophomore years at Redmond two years ago I ve been in Europe ever since Now I ve come back to finish my Arts course This is my Junior year too said Anne So we are classmates as well as collegemates I am reconciled to the loss of the years that the locust has eaten said her companion with a world of meaning in those wonderful eyes of his The rain came steadily down for the best part of an hour But the time seemed really very short When the clouds parted and a burst of pale November sunshine fell athwart the harbor and the pines Anne and her companion walked home together By the time they had reached the gate of Patty s Place he had asked permission to call and had received it Anne went in with cheeks of flame and her heart beating to her fingertips Rusty who climbed into her lap and tried to kiss her found a very absent welcome Anne with her soul full of romantic thrills had no attention to spare just then for a crop eared pussy cat That evening a parcel was left at Patty s Place for Miss Shirley It was a box containing a dozen magnificent roses Phil pounced impertinently on the card that fell from it read the name and the poetical quotation written on the back Royal Gardner she exclaimed Why Anne I didn t know you were acquainted with Roy Gardner I met him in the park this afternoon in the rain explained Anne hurriedly My umbrella turned inside out and he came to my rescue with his Oh Phil peered curiously at Anne And is that exceedingly commonplace incident any reason why he should send us longstemmed roses by the dozen with a very sentimental rhyme Or why we should blush divinest rosy red when we look at his card Anne thy face betrayeth thee Don t talk nonsense Phil Do you know mister Gardner I ve met his two sisters and I know of him So does everybody worthwhile in Kingsport The Gardners are among the richest bluest of Bluenoses Roy is adorably handsome and clever Two years ago his mother s health failed and he had to leave college and go abroad with her his father is dead He must have been greatly disappointed to have to give up his class but they say he was perfectly sweet about it Fee fi fo fum Anne I smell romance Almost do I envy you but not quite After all Roy Gardner isn t Jonas You goose said Anne loftily But she lay long awake that night nor did she wish for sleep Her waking fancies were more alluring than any vision of dreamland Had the real Prince come at last Recalling those glorious dark eyes which had gazed so deeply into her own Anne was very strongly inclined to think he had Chapter XXVI Enter Christine The girls at Patty s Place were dressing for the reception which the Juniors were giving for the Seniors in February Anne surveyed herself in the mirror of the blue room with girlish satisfaction She had a particularly pretty gown on Originally it had been only a simple little slip of cream silk with a chiffon overdress But Phil had insisted on taking it home with her in the Christmas holidays and embroidering tiny rosebuds all over the chiffon Phil s fingers were deft and the result was a dress which was the envy of every Redmond girl Even Allie Boone whose frocks came from Paris was wont to look with longing eyes on that rosebud concoction as Anne trailed up the main staircase at Redmond in it Anne was trying the effect of a white orchid in her hair Roy Gardner had sent her white orchids for the reception and she knew no other Redmond girl would have them that night when Phil came in with admiring gaze Anne this is certainly your night for looking handsome Nine nights out of ten I can easily outshine you The tenth you blossom out suddenly into something that eclipses me altogether How do you manage it It s the dress dear Fine feathers Tisn t The last evening you flamed out into beauty you wore your old blue flannel shirtwaist that missus Lynde made you If Roy hadn t already lost head and heart about you he certainly would tonight But I don t like orchids on you Anne No it isn t jealousy Orchids don t seem to BELONG to you They re too exotic too tropical too insolent Don t put them in your hair anyway Well I won t I admit I m not fond of orchids myself I don t think they re related to me Roy doesn t often send them he knows I like flowers I can live with Orchids are only things you can visit with Jonas sent me some dear pink rosebuds for the evening but he isn t coming himself He said he had to lead a prayer meeting in the slums I don t believe he wanted to come Anne I m horribly afraid Jonas doesn t really care anything about me And I m trying to decide whether I ll pine away and die or go on and get my B A and be sensible and useful You couldn t possibly be sensible and useful Phil so you d better pine away and die said Anne cruelly Heartless Anne Silly Phil You know quite well that Jonas loves you But he won t TELL me so And I can t MAKE him He LOOKS it I ll admit But speak to me only with thine eyes isn t a really reliable reason for embroidering doilies and hemstitching tablecloths I don t want to begin such work until I m really engaged It would be tempting Fate mister Blake is afraid to ask you to marry him Phil He is poor and can t offer you a home such as you ve always had You know that is the only reason he hasn t spoken long ago I suppose so agreed Phil dolefully Well brightening up if he WON T ask me to marry him I ll ask him that s all So it s bound to come right I won t worry By the way Gilbert Blythe is going about constantly with Christine Stuart Did you know Anne was trying to fasten a little gold chain about her throat She suddenly found the clasp difficult to manage WHAT was the matter with it or with her fingers No she said carelessly Who is Christine Stuart Ronald Stuart s sister She s in Kingsport this winter studying music I haven t seen her but they say she s very pretty and that Gilbert is quite crazy over her How angry I was when you refused Gilbert Anne But Roy Gardner was foreordained for you I can see that now You were right after all Anne did not blush as she usually did when the girls assumed that her eventual marriage to Roy Gardner was a settled thing All at once she felt rather dull Phil s chatter seemed trivial and the reception a bore She boxed poor Rusty s ears Get off that cushion instantly you cat you Why don t you stay down where you belong Anne picked up her orchids and went downstairs where Aunt Jamesina was presiding over a row of coats hung before the fire to warm Roy Gardner was waiting for Anne and teasing the Sarah cat while he waited The Sarah cat did not approve of him She always turned her back on him But everybody else at Patty s Place liked him very much Aunt Jamesina carried away by his unfailing and deferential courtesy and the pleading tones of his delightful voice declared he was the nicest young man she ever knew and that Anne was a very fortunate girl Such remarks made Anne restive Roy s wooing had certainly been as romantic as girlish heart could desire but she wished Aunt Jamesina and the girls would not take things so for granted When Roy murmured a poetical compliment as he helped her on with her coat she did not blush and thrill as usual and he found her rather silent in their brief walk to Redmond He thought she looked a little pale when she came out of the coeds dressing room but as they entered the reception room her color and sparkle suddenly returned to her She turned to Roy with her gayest expression He smiled back at her with what Phil called his deep black velvety smile Yet she really did not see Roy at all She was acutely conscious that Gilbert was standing under the palms just across the room talking to a girl who must be Christine Stuart She was very handsome in the stately style destined to become rather massive in middle life A tall girl with large dark blue eyes ivory outlines and a gloss of darkness on her smooth hair She looks just as I ve always wanted to look thought Anne miserably Rose leaf complexion starry violet eyes raven hair yes she has them all It s a wonder her name isn t Cordelia Fitzgerald into the bargain But I don t believe her figure is as good as mine and her nose certainly isn t Anne felt a little comforted by this conclusion Chapter XXVII Mutual Confidences March came in that winter like the meekest and mildest of lambs bringing days that were crisp and golden and tingling each followed by a frosty pink twilight which gradually lost itself in an elfland of moonshine Over the girls at Patty s Place was falling the shadow of April examinations They were studying hard even Phil had settled down to text and notebooks with a doggedness not to be expected of her I m going to take the Johnson Scholarship in Mathematics she announced calmly I could take the one in Greek easily but I d rather take the mathematical one because I want to prove to Jonas that I m really enormously clever Jonas likes you better for your big brown eyes and your crooked smile than for all the brains you carry under your curls said Anne When I was a girl it wasn t considered lady like to know anything about Mathematics said Aunt Jamesina But times have changed I don t know that it s all for the better Can you cook Phil No I never cooked anything in my life except a gingerbread and it was a failure flat in the middle and hilly round the edges You know the kind But Aunty when I begin in good earnest to learn to cook don t you think the brains that enable me to win a mathematical scholarship will also enable me to learn cooking just as well Maybe said Aunt Jamesina cautiously I am not decrying the higher education of women My daughter is an M A She can cook too But I taught her to cook BEFORE I let a college professor teach her Mathematics In mid March came a letter from Miss Patty Spofford saying that she and Miss Maria had decided to remain abroad for another year So you may have Patty s Place next winter too she wrote Maria and I are going to run over Egypt I want to see the Sphinx once before I die Fancy those two dames running over Egypt I wonder if they ll look up at the Sphinx and knit laughed Priscilla I m so glad we can keep Patty s Place for another year said Stella I was afraid they d come back And then our jolly little nest here would be broken up and we poor callow nestlings thrown out on the cruel world of boardinghouses again I m off for a tramp in the park announced Phil tossing her book aside I think when I am eighty I ll be glad I went for a walk in the park tonight What do you mean asked Anne Come with me and I ll tell you honey They captured in their ramble all the mysteries and magics of a March evening Very still and mild it was wrapped in a great white brooding silence a silence which was yet threaded through with many little silvery sounds which you could hear if you hearkened as much with your soul as your ears The girls wandered down a long pineland aisle that seemed to lead right out into the heart of a deep red overflowing winter sunset I d go home and write a poem this blessed minute if I only knew how declared Phil pausing in an open space where a rosy light was staining the green tips of the pines It s all so wonderful here this great white stillness and those dark trees that always seem to be thinking The woods were God s first temples quoted Anne softly One can t help feeling reverent and adoring in such a place I always feel so near Him when I walk among the pines Anne I m the happiest girl in the world confessed Phil suddenly So mister Blake has asked you to marry him at last said Anne calmly Yes And I sneezed three times while he was asking me Wasn t that horrid But I said yes almost before he finished I was so afraid he might change his mind and stop I m besottedly happy I couldn t really believe before that Jonas would ever care for frivolous me Phil you re not really frivolous said Anne gravely Way down underneath that frivolous exterior of yours you ve got a dear loyal womanly little soul Why do you hide it so I can t help it Queen Anne You are right I m not frivolous at heart But there s a sort of frivolous skin over my soul and I can t take it off As missus Poyser says I d have to be hatched over again and hatched different before I could change it But Jonas knows the real me and loves me frivolity and all And I love him I never was so surprised in my life as I was when I found out I loved him I d never thought it possible to fall in love with an ugly man Fancy me coming down to one solitary beau And one named Jonas But I mean to call him Jo That s such a nice crisp little name I couldn t nickname Alonzo What about Alec and Alonzo Oh I told them at Christmas that I never could marry either of them It seems so funny now to remember that I ever thought it possible that I might They felt so badly I just cried over both of them howled But I knew there was only one man in the world I could ever marry I had made up my own mind for once and it was real easy too It s very delightful to feel so sure and know it s your own sureness and not somebody else s Do you suppose you ll be able to keep it up Making up my mind you mean I don t know but Jo has given me a splendid rule He says when I m perplexed just to do what I would wish I had done when I shall be eighty Anyhow Jo can make up his mind quickly enough and it would be uncomfortable to have too much mind in the same house What will your father and mother say Father won t say much He thinks everything I do right But mother WILL talk Oh her tongue will be as Byrney as her nose But in the end it will be all right You ll have to give up a good many things you ve always had when you marry mister Blake Phil But I ll have HIM I won t miss the other things We re to be married a year from next June Jo graduates from saint Columbia this spring you know Then he s going to take a little mission church down on Patterson Street in the slums Fancy me in the slums But I d go there or to Greenland s icy mountains with him And this is the girl who would NEVER marry a man who wasn t rich commented Anne to a young pine tree Oh don t cast up the follies of my youth to me I shall be poor as gaily as I ve been rich You ll see I m going to learn how to cook and make over dresses I ve learned how to market since I ve lived at Patty s Place and once I taught a Sunday School class for a whole summer Aunt Jamesina says I ll ruin Jo s career if I marry him But I won t I know I haven t much sense or sobriety but I ve got what is ever so much better the knack of making people like me There is a man in Bolingbroke who lisps and always testifies in prayer meeting He says If you can t thine like an electric thtar thine like a candlethtick I ll be Jo s little candlestick Phil you re incorrigible Well I love you so much that I can t make nice light congratulatory little speeches But I m heart glad of your happiness I know Those big gray eyes of yours are brimming over with real friendship Anne Some day I ll look the same way at you You re going to marry Roy aren t you Anne My dear Philippa did you ever hear of the famous Betty Baxter who refused a man before he d axed her I am not going to emulate that celebrated lady by either refusing or accepting any one before he axes me All Redmond knows that Roy is crazy about you said Phil candidly And you DO love him don t you Anne I I suppose so said Anne reluctantly She felt that she ought to be blushing while making such a confession but she was not on the other hand she always blushed hotly when any one said anything about Gilbert Blythe or Christine Stuart in her hearing Gilbert Blythe and Christine Stuart were nothing to her absolutely nothing But Anne had given up trying to analyze the reason of her blushes As for Roy of course she was in love with him madly so How could she help it Was he not her ideal Who could resist those glorious dark eyes and that pleading voice Were not half the Redmond girls wildly envious And what a charming sonnet he had sent her with a box of violets on her birthday Anne knew every word of it by heart It was very good stuff of its kind too Not exactly up to the level of Keats or Shakespeare even Anne was not so deeply in love as to think that But it was very tolerable magazine verse And it was addressed to HER not to Laura or Beatrice or the Maid of Athens but to her Anne Shirley To be told in rhythmical cadences that her eyes were stars of the morning that her cheek had the flush it stole from the sunrise that her lips were redder than the roses of Paradise was thrillingly romantic Gilbert would never have dreamed of writing a sonnet to her eyebrows But then Gilbert could see a joke She had once told Roy a funny story and he had not seen the point of it She recalled the chummy laugh she and Gilbert had had together over it and wondered uneasily if life with a man who had no sense of humor might not be somewhat uninteresting in the long run But who could expect a melancholy inscrutable hero to see the humorous side of things It would be flatly unreasonable Chapter XXVIII A June Evening I wonder what it would be like to live in a world where it was always June said Anne as she came through the spice and bloom of the twilit orchard to the front door steps where Marilla and missus Rachel were sitting talking over missus Samson Coates funeral which they had attended that day Dora sat between them diligently studying her lessons but Davy was sitting tailor fashion on the grass looking as gloomy and depressed as his single dimple would let him You d get tired of it said Marilla with a sigh I daresay but just now I feel that it would take me a long time to get tired of it if it were all as charming as today Everything loves June Davy boy why this melancholy November face in blossom time I m just sick and tired of living said the youthful pessimist At ten years Dear me how sad I m not making fun said Davy with dignity I m dis dis discouraged bringing out the big word with a valiant effort Why and wherefore asked Anne sitting down beside him Cause the new teacher that come when mister Holmes got sick give me ten sums to do for Monday It ll take me all day tomorrow to do them It isn t fair to have to work Saturdays Milty Boulter said he wouldn t do them but Marilla says I ve got to I don t like Miss Carson a bit Don t talk like that about your teacher Davy Keith said missus Rachel severely Miss Carson is a very fine girl There is no nonsense about her That doesn t sound very attractive laughed Anne I like people to have a little nonsense about them But I m inclined to have a better opinion of Miss Carson than you have I saw her in prayer meeting last night and she has a pair of eyes that can t always look sensible Now Davy boy take heart of grace Tomorrow will bring another day and I ll help you with the sums as far as in me lies Don t waste this lovely hour twixt light and dark worrying over arithmetic Well I won t said Davy brightening up If you help me with the sums I ll have em done in time to go fishing with Milty I wish old Aunt Atossa s funeral was tomorrow instead of today I wanted to go to it cause Milty said his mother said Aunt Atossa would be sure to rise up in her coffin and say sarcastic things to the folks that come to see her buried But Marilla said she didn t Poor Atossa laid in her coffin peaceful enough said missus Lynde solemnly I never saw her look so pleasant before that s what Well there weren t many tears shed over her poor old soul The Elisha Wrights are thankful to be rid of her and I can t say I blame them a mite It seems to me a most dreadful thing to go out of the world and not leave one person behind you who is sorry you are gone said Anne shuddering Nobody except her parents ever loved poor Atossa that s certain not even her husband averred missus Lynde She was his fourth wife He d sort of got into the habit of marrying He only lived a few years after he married her The doctor said he died of dyspepsia but I shall always maintain that he died of Atossa s tongue that s what Poor soul she always knew everything about her neighbors but she never was very well acquainted with herself Well she s gone anyhow and I suppose the next excitement will be Diana s wedding It seems funny and horrible to think of Diana s being married sighed Anne hugging her knees and looking through the gap in the Haunted Wood to the light that was shining in Diana s room I don t see what s horrible about it when she s doing so well said missus Lynde emphatically Fred Wright has a fine farm and he is a model young man He certainly isn t the wild dashing wicked young man Diana once wanted to marry smiled Anne Fred is extremely good That s just what he ought to be Would you want Diana to marry a wicked man Or marry one yourself Oh no I wouldn t want to marry anybody who was wicked but I think I d like it if he COULD be wicked and WOULDN T Now Fred is HOPELESSLY good You ll have more sense some day I hope said Marilla Marilla spoke rather bitterly She was grievously disappointed She knew Anne had refused Gilbert Blythe Avonlea gossip buzzed over the fact which had leaked out nobody knew how Perhaps Charlie Sloane had guessed and told his guesses for truth Perhaps Diana had betrayed it to Fred and Fred had been indiscreet At all events it was known missus Blythe no longer asked Anne in public or private if she had heard lately from Gilbert but passed her by with a frosty bow Anne who had always liked Gilbert s merry young hearted mother was grieved in secret over this Marilla said nothing but missus Lynde gave Anne many exasperated digs about it until fresh gossip reached that worthy lady through the medium of Moody Spurgeon MacPherson s mother that Anne had another beau at college who was rich and handsome and good all in one After that missus Rachel held her tongue though she still wished in her inmost heart that Anne had accepted Gilbert Riches were all very well but even missus Rachel practical soul though she was did not consider them the one essential If Anne liked the Handsome Unknown better than Gilbert there was nothing more to be said but missus Rachel was dreadfully afraid that Anne was going to make the mistake of marrying for money Marilla knew Anne too well to fear this but she felt that something in the universal scheme of things had gone sadly awry What is to be will be said missus Rachel gloomily and what isn t to be happens sometimes I can t help believing it s going to happen in Anne s case if Providence doesn t interfere that s what missus Rachel sighed She was afraid Providence wouldn t interfere and she didn t dare to Anne had wandered down to the Dryad s Bubble and was curled up among the ferns at the root of the big white birch where she and Gilbert had so often sat in summers gone by He had gone into the newspaper office again when college closed and Avonlea seemed very dull without him He never wrote to her and Anne missed the letters that never came To be sure Roy wrote twice a week his letters were exquisite compositions which would have read beautifully in a memoir or biography Anne felt herself more deeply in love with him than ever when she read them but her heart never gave the queer quick painful bound at sight of his letters which it had given one day when missus Hiram Sloane had handed her out an envelope addressed in Gilbert s black upright handwriting Anne had hurried home to the east gable and opened it eagerly to find a typewritten copy of some college society report only that and nothing more Anne flung the harmless screed across her room and sat down to write an especially nice epistle to Roy Diana was to be married in five more days The gray house at Orchard Slope was in a turmoil of baking and brewing and boiling and stewing for there was to be a big old timey wedding Anne of course was to be bridesmaid as had been arranged when they were twelve years old and Gilbert was coming from Kingsport to be best man Anne was enjoying the excitement of the various preparations but under it all she carried a little heartache She was in a sense losing her dear old chum Diana s new home would be two miles from Green Gables and the old constant companionship could never be theirs again Anne looked up at Diana s light and thought how it had beaconed to her for many years but soon it would shine through the summer twilights no more Two big painful tears welled up in her gray eyes Oh she thought how horrible it is that people have to grow up and marry and CHANGE Chapter XXIX Diana s Wedding After all the only real roses are the pink ones said Anne as she tied white ribbon around Diana s bouquet in the westward looking gable at Orchard Slope They are the flowers of love and faith Diana was standing nervously in the middle of the room arrayed in her bridal white her black curls frosted over with the film of her wedding veil Anne had draped that veil in accordance with the sentimental compact of years before It s all pretty much as I used to imagine it long ago when I wept over your inevitable marriage and our consequent parting she laughed You are the bride of my dreams Diana with the lovely misty veil and I am YOUR bridesmaid But alas I haven t the puffed sleeves though these short lace ones are even prettier Neither is my heart wholly breaking nor do I exactly hate Fred We are not really parting Anne protested Diana I m not going far away We ll love each other just as much as ever We ve always kept that oath of friendship we swore long ago haven t we Yes We ve kept it faithfully We ve had a beautiful friendship Diana We ve never marred it by one quarrel or coolness or unkind word and I hope it will always be so But things can t be quite the same after this You ll have other interests I ll just be on the outside But such is life as missus Rachel says missus Rachel has given you one of her beloved knitted quilts of the tobacco stripe pattern and she says when I am married she ll give me one too The mean thing about your getting married is that I won t be able to be your bridesmaid lamented Diana I m to be Phil s bridesmaid next June when she marries mister Blake and then I must stop for you know the proverb three times a bridesmaid never a bride said Anne peeping through the window over the pink and snow of the blossoming orchard beneath Here comes the minister Diana Oh Anne gasped Diana suddenly turning very pale and beginning to tremble Oh Anne I m so nervous I can t go through with it Anne I know I m going to faint If you do I ll drag you down to the rainwater hogshed and drop you in said Anne unsympathetically Cheer up dearest Getting married can t be so very terrible when so many people survive the ceremony See how cool and composed I am and take courage Wait till your turn comes Miss Anne Oh Anne I hear father coming upstairs Give me my bouquet Is my veil right Am I very pale You look just lovely Di darling kiss me good bye for the last time Diana Barry will never kiss me again Diana Wright will though There mother s calling Come Following the simple old fashioned way in vogue then Anne went down to the parlor on Gilbert s arm They met at the top of the stairs for the first time since they had left Kingsport for Gilbert had arrived only that day Gilbert shook hands courteously He was looking very well though as Anne instantly noted rather thin He was not pale there was a flush on his cheek that had burned into it as Anne came along the hall towards him in her soft white dress with lilies of the valley in the shining masses of her hair As they entered the crowded parlor together a little murmur of admiration ran around the room What a fine looking pair they are whispered the impressible missus Rachel to Marilla Fred ambled in alone with a very red face and then Diana swept in on her father s arm She did not faint and nothing untoward occurred to interrupt the ceremony Feasting and merry making followed then as the evening waned Fred and Diana drove away through the moonlight to their new home and Gilbert walked with Anne to Green Gables Something of their old comradeship had returned during the informal mirth of the evening Oh it was nice to be walking over that well known road with Gilbert again The night was so very still that one should have been able to hear the whisper of roses in blossom the laughter of daisies the piping of grasses many sweet sounds all tangled up together The beauty of moonlight on familiar fields irradiated the world Can t we take a ramble up Lovers Lane before you go in asked Gilbert as they crossed the bridge over the Lake of Shining Waters in which the moon lay like a great drowned blossom of gold Anne assented readily Lovers Lane was a veritable path in a fairyland that night a shimmering mysterious place full of wizardry in the white woven enchantment of moonlight There had been a time when such a walk with Gilbert through Lovers Lane would have been far too dangerous But Roy and Christine had made it very safe now Anne found herself thinking a good deal about Christine as she chatted lightly to Gilbert She had met her several times before leaving Kingsport and had been charmingly sweet to her Christine had also been charmingly sweet Indeed they were a most cordial pair But for all that their acquaintance had not ripened into friendship Evidently Christine was not a kindred spirit Are you going to be in Avonlea all summer asked Gilbert No I m going down east to Valley Road next week Esther Haythorne wants me to teach for her through July and August They have a summer term in that school and Esther isn t feeling well So I m going to substitute for her In one way I don t mind Do you know I m beginning to feel a little bit like a stranger in Avonlea now It makes me sorry but it s true It s quite appalling to see the number of children who have shot up into big boys and girls really young men and women these past two years Half of my pupils are grown up It makes me feel awfully old to see them in the places you and I and our mates used to fill Anne laughed and sighed She felt very old and mature and wise which showed how young she was She told herself that she longed greatly to go back to those dear merry days when life was seen through a rosy mist of hope and illusion and possessed an indefinable something that had passed away forever Where was it now the glory and the dream So wags the world away quoted Gilbert practically and a trifle absently Anne wondered if he were thinking of Christine Oh Avonlea was going to be so lonely now with Diana gone Chapter XXX missus Skinner s Romance Anne stepped off the train at Valley Road station and looked about to see if any one had come to meet her She was to board with a certain Miss Janet Sweet but she saw no one who answered in the least to her preconception of that lady as formed from Esther s letter The only person in sight was an elderly woman sitting in a wagon with mail bags piled around her Two hundred would have been a charitable guess at her weight her face was as round and red as a harvest moon and almost as featureless She wore a tight black cashmere dress made in the fashion of ten years ago a little dusty black straw hat trimmed with bows of yellow ribbon and faded black lace mits Here you she called waving her whip at Anne Are you the new Valley Road schoolma am Yes Well I thought so Valley Road is noted for its good looking schoolma ams just as Millersville is noted for its humly ones Janet Sweet asked me this morning if I could bring you out I said Sartin I kin if she don t mind being scrunched up some This rig of mine s kinder small for the mail bags and I m some heftier than Thomas Just wait miss till I shift these bags a bit and I ll tuck you in somehow It s only two miles to Janet s Her next door neighbor s hired boy is coming for your trunk tonight My name is Skinner Amelia Skinner Anne was eventually tucked in exchanging amused smiles with herself during the process Jog along black mare commanded missus Skinner gathering up the reins in her pudgy hands This is my first trip on the mail rowte Thomas wanted to hoe his turnips today so he asked me to come So I jest sot down and took a standing up snack and started I sorter like it O course it s rather tejus Part of the time I sits and thinks and the rest I jest sits Jog along black mare I want to git home airly Thomas is terrible lonesome when I m away You see we haven t been married very long Oh said Anne politely Just a month Thomas courted me for quite a spell though It was real romantic Anne tried to picture missus Skinner on speaking terms with romance and failed Oh she said again Yes Y see there was another man after me Jog along black mare I d been a widder so long folks had given up expecting me to marry again But when my darter she s a schoolma am like you went out West to teach I felt real lonesome and wasn t nowise sot against the idea Bime by Thomas began to come up and so did the other feller William Obadiah Seaman his name was For a long time I couldn t make up my mind which of them to take and they kep coming and coming and I kep worrying Y see W O was rich he had a fine place and carried considerable style He was by far the best match Jog along black mare Why didn t you marry him asked Anne Well y see he didn t love me answered missus Skinner solemnly Anne opened her eyes widely and looked at missus Skinner But there was not a glint of humor on that lady s face Evidently missus Skinner saw nothing amusing in her own case He d been a widder man for three yers and his sister kept house for him Then she got married and he just wanted some one to look after his house It was worth looking after too mind you that It s a handsome house Jog along black mare As for Thomas he was poor and if his house didn t leak in dry weather it was about all that could be said for it though it looks kind of pictureaskew But y see I loved Thomas and I didn t care one red cent for W O So I argued it out with myself Sarah Crowe say I my first was a Crowe you can marry your rich man if you like but you won t be happy Folks can t get along together in this world without a little bit of love You d just better tie up to Thomas for he loves you and you love him and nothing else ain t going to do you Jog along black mare So I told Thomas I d take him All the time I was getting ready I never dared drive past W O s place for fear the sight of that fine house of his would put me in the swithers again But now I never think of it at all and I m just that comfortable and happy with Thomas Jog along black mare How did William Obadiah take it queried Anne Oh he rumpussed a bit But he s going to see a skinny old maid in Millersville now and I guess she ll take him fast enough She ll make him a better wife than his first did W O never wanted to marry her He just asked her to marry him cause his father wanted him to never dreaming but that she d say no But mind you she said yes There was a predicament for you Jog along black mare She was a great housekeeper but most awful mean She wore the same bonnet for eighteen years Then she got a new one and W O met her on the road and didn t know her Jog along black mare I feel that I d a narrer escape I might have married him and been most awful miserable like my poor cousin Jane Ann Jane Ann married a rich man she didn t care anything about and she hasn t the life of a dog She come to see me last week and says says she Sarah Skinner I envy you I d rather live in a little hut on the side of the road with a man I was fond of than in my big house with the one I ve got Jane Ann s man ain t such a bad sort nuther though he s so contrary that he wears his fur coat when the thermometer s at ninety The only way to git him to do anything is to coax him to do the opposite But there ain t any love to smooth things down and it s a poor way of living Jog along black mare There s Janet s place in the hollow Wayside she calls it Quite pictureaskew ain t it I guess you ll be glad to git out of this with all them mail bags jamming round you Yes but I have enjoyed my drive with you very much said Anne sincerely Git away now said missus Skinner highly flattered Wait till I tell Thomas that He always feels dretful tickled when I git a compliment Jog along black mare Well here we are I hope you ll git on well in the school miss There s a short cut to it through the ma sh back of Janet s If you take that way be awful keerful If you once got stuck in that black mud you d be sucked right down and never seen or heard tell of again till the day of judgment like Adam Palmer s cow Jog along black mare Chapter XXXI Anne to Philippa Anne Shirley to Philippa Gordon greeting Well beloved it s high time I was writing you Here am I installed once more as a country schoolma am at Valley Road boarding at Wayside the home of Miss Janet Sweet Janet is a dear soul and very nicelooking tall but not over tall stoutish yet with a certain restraint of outline suggestive of a thrifty soul who is not going to be overlavish even in the matter of avoirdupois She has a knot of soft crimpy brown hair with a thread of gray in it a sunny face with rosy cheeks and big kind eyes as blue as forget me nots Moreover she is one of those delightful old fashioned cooks who don t care a bit if they ruin your digestion as long as they can give you feasts of fat things I like her and she likes me principally it seems because she had a sister named Anne who died young I m real glad to see you she said briskly when I landed in her yard My you don t look a mite like I expected I was sure you d be dark my sister Anne was dark And here you re redheaded For a few minutes I thought I wasn t going to like Janet as much as I had expected at first sight Then I reminded myself that I really must be more sensible than to be prejudiced against any one simply because she called my hair red Probably the word auburn was not in Janet s vocabulary at all Wayside is a dear sort of little spot The house is small and white set down in a delightful little hollow that drops away from the road Between road and house is an orchard and flower garden all mixed up together The front door walk is bordered with quahog clam shells cow hawks Janet calls them there is Virginia Creeper over the porch and moss on the roof My room is a neat little spot off the parlor just big enough for the bed and me Over the head of my bed there is a picture of Robby Burns standing at Highland Mary s grave shadowed by an enormous weeping willow tree Robby s face is so lugubrious that it is no wonder I have bad dreams Why the first night I was here I dreamed I COULDN T LAUGH The parlor is tiny and neat Its one window is so shaded by a huge willow that the room has a grotto like effect of emerald gloom There are wonderful tidies on the chairs and gay mats on the floor and books and cards carefully arranged on a round table and vases of dried grass on the mantel piece Between the vases is a cheerful decoration of preserved coffin plates five in all pertaining respectively to Janet s father and mother a brother her sister Anne and a hired man who died here once If I go suddenly insane some of these days know all men by these presents that those coffin plates have caused it But it s all delightful and I said so Janet loved me for it just as she detested poor Esther because Esther had said so much shade was unhygienic and had objected to sleeping on a feather bed Now I glory in feather beds and the more unhygienic and feathery they are the more I glory Janet says it is such a comfort to see me eat she had been so afraid I would be like Miss Haythorne who wouldn t eat anything but fruit and hot water for breakfast and tried to make Janet give up frying things Esther is really a dear girl but she is rather given to fads The trouble is that she hasn t enough imagination and HAS a tendency to indigestion Janet told me I could have the use of the parlor when any young men called I don t think there are many to call I haven t seen a young man in Valley Road yet except the next door hired boy Sam Toliver a very tall lank tow haired youth He came over one evening recently and sat for an hour on the garden fence near the front porch where Janet and I were doing fancy work The only remarks he volunteered in all that time were Hev a peppermint miss Dew now fine thing for carARRH peppermints and Powerful lot o jump grasses round here ternight Yep But there is a love affair going on here It seems to be my fortune to be mixed up more or less actively with elderly love affairs mister and missus Irving always say that I brought about their marriage missus Stephen Clark of Carmody persists in being most grateful to me for a suggestion which somebody else would probably have made if I hadn t I do really think though that Ludovic Speed would never have got any further along than placid courtship if I had not helped him and Theodora Dix out In the present affair I am only a passive spectator I ve tried once to help things along and made an awful mess of it So I shall not meddle again I ll tell you all about it when we meet Chapter XXXII Tea with missus Douglas On the first Thursday night of Anne s sojourn in Valley Road Janet asked her to go to prayer meeting Janet blossomed out like a rose to attend that prayer meeting She wore a pale blue pansy sprinkled muslin dress with more ruffles than one would ever have supposed economical Janet could be guilty of and a white leghorn hat with pink roses and three ostrich feathers on it Anne felt quite amazed Later on she found out Janet s motive in so arraying herself a motive as old as Eden Valley Road prayer meetings seemed to be essentially feminine There were thirty two women present two half grown boys and one solitary man beside the minister Anne found herself studying this man He was not handsome or young or graceful he had remarkably long legs so long that he had to keep them coiled up under his chair to dispose of them and he was stoop shouldered His hands were big his hair wanted barbering and his moustache was unkempt But Anne thought she liked his face it was kind and honest and tender there was something else in it too just what Anne found it hard to define She finally concluded that this man had suffered and been strong and it had been made manifest in his face There was a sort of patient humorous endurance in his expression which indicated that he would go to the stake if need be but would keep on looking pleasant until he really had to begin squirming When prayer meeting was over this man came up to Janet and said May I see you home Janet Janet took his arm as primly and shyly as if she were no more than sixteen having her first escort home Anne told the girls at Patty s Place later on Miss Shirley permit me to introduce mister Douglas she said stiffly mister Douglas nodded and said I was looking at you in prayer meeting miss and thinking what a nice little girl you were Such a speech from ninety nine people out of a hundred would have annoyed Anne bitterly but the way in which mister Douglas said it made her feel that she had received a very real and pleasing compliment She smiled appreciatively at him and dropped obligingly behind on the moonlit road So Janet had a beau Anne was delighted Janet would make a paragon of a wife cheery economical tolerant and a very queen of cooks It would be a flagrant waste on Nature s part to keep her a permanent old maid John Douglas asked me to take you up to see his mother said Janet the next day She s bed rid a lot of the time and never goes out of the house But she s powerful fond of company and always wants to see my boarders Can you go up this evening Anne assented but later in the day mister Douglas called on his mother s behalf to invite them up to tea on Saturday evening Oh why didn t you put on your pretty pansy dress asked Anne when they left home It was a hot day and poor Janet between her excitement and her heavy black cashmere dress looked as if she were being broiled alive Old missus Douglas would think it terrible frivolous and unsuitable I m afraid John likes that dress though she added wistfully The old Douglas homestead was half a mile from Wayside cresting a windy hill The house itself was large and comfortable old enough to be dignified and girdled with maple groves and orchards There were big trim barns behind it and everything bespoke prosperity Whatever the patient endurance in mister Douglas face had meant it hadn t so Anne reflected meant debts and duns John Douglas met them at the door and took them into the sitting room where his mother was enthroned in an armchair Anne had expected old missus Douglas to be tall and thin because mister Douglas was Instead she was a tiny scrap of a woman with soft pink cheeks mild blue eyes and a mouth like a baby s Dressed in a beautiful fashionably made black silk dress with a fluffy white shawl over her shoulders and her snowy hair surmounted by a dainty lace cap she might have posed as a grandmother doll How do you do Janet dear she said sweetly I am so glad to see you again dear She put up her pretty old face to be kissed And this is our new teacher I m delighted to meet you My son has been singing your praises until I m half jealous and I m sure Janet ought to be wholly so Poor Janet blushed Anne said something polite and conventional and then everybody sat down and made talk It was hard work even for Anne for nobody seemed at ease except old missus Douglas who certainly did not find any difficulty in talking She made Janet sit by her and stroked her hand occasionally Janet sat and smiled looking horribly uncomfortable in her hideous dress and John Douglas sat without smiling At the tea table missus Douglas gracefully asked Janet to pour the tea Janet turned redder than ever but did it Anne wrote a description of that meal to Stella We had cold tongue and chicken and strawberry preserves lemon pie and tarts and chocolate cake and raisin cookies and pound cake and fruit cake and a few other things including more pie caramel pie I think it was After I had eaten twice as much as was good for me missus Douglas sighed and said she feared she had nothing to tempt my appetite I m afraid dear Janet s cooking has spoiled you for any other she said sweetly Of course nobody in Valley Road aspires to rival HER WON T you have another piece of pie Miss Shirley You haven t eaten ANYTHING Stella I had eaten a helping of tongue and one of chicken three biscuits a generous allowance of preserves a piece of pie a tart and a square of chocolate cake After tea missus Douglas smiled benevolently and told John to take dear Janet out into the garden and get her some roses Miss Shirley will keep me company while you are out won t you she said plaintively She settled down in her armchair with a sigh I am a very frail old woman Miss Shirley For over twenty years I ve been a great sufferer For twenty long weary years I ve been dying by inches How painful said Anne trying to be sympathetic and succeeding only in feeling idiotic There have been scores of nights when they ve thought I could never live to see the dawn went on missus Douglas solemnly Nobody knows what I ve gone through nobody can know but myself Well it can t last very much longer now My weary pilgrimage will soon be over Miss Shirley It is a great comfort to me that John will have such a good wife to look after him when his mother is gone a great comfort Miss Shirley Janet is a lovely woman said Anne warmly Lovely A beautiful character assented missus Douglas And a perfect housekeeper something I never was My health would not permit it Miss Shirley I am indeed thankful that John has made such a wise choice I hope and believe that he will be happy He is my only son Miss Shirley and his happiness lies very near my heart Of course said Anne stupidly For the first time in her life she was stupid Yet she could not imagine why She seemed to have absolutely nothing to say to this sweet smiling angelic old lady who was patting her hand so kindly Come and see me soon again dear Janet said missus Douglas lovingly when they left You don t come half often enough But then I suppose John will be bringing you here to stay all the time one of these days Anne happening to glance at John Douglas as his mother spoke gave a positive start of dismay He looked as a tortured man might look when his tormentors gave the rack the last turn of possible endurance She felt sure he must be ill and hurried poor blushing Janet away Isn t old missus Douglas a sweet woman asked Janet as they went down the road M m answered Anne absently She was wondering why John Douglas had looked so She s been a terrible sufferer said Janet feelingly She takes terrible spells It keeps John all worried up He s scared to leave home for fear his mother will take a spell and nobody there but the hired girl Chapter XXXIII He Just Kept Coming and Coming Three days later Anne came home from school and found Janet crying Tears and Janet seemed so incongruous that Anne was honestly alarmed Oh what is the matter she cried anxiously I m I m forty today sobbed Janet Well you were nearly that yesterday and it didn t hurt comforted Anne trying not to smile But but went on Janet with a big gulp John Douglas won t ask me to marry him Oh but he will said Anne lamely You must give him time Janet Time said Janet with indescribable scorn He has had twenty years How much time does he want Do you mean that John Douglas has been coming to see you for twenty years He has And he has never so much as mentioned marriage to me And I don t believe he ever will now I ve never said a word to a mortal about it but it seems to me I ve just got to talk it out with some one at last or go crazy John Douglas begun to go with me twenty years ago before mother died Well he kept coming and coming and after a spell I begun making quilts and things but he never said anything about getting married only just kept coming and coming There wasn t anything I could do Mother died when we d been going together for eight years I thought he maybe would speak out then seeing as I was left alone in the world He was real kind and feeling and did everything he could for me but he never said marry And that s the way it has been going on ever since People blame ME for it They say I won t marry him because his mother is so sickly and I don t want the bother of waiting on her Why I d LOVE to wait on John s mother But I let them think so I d rather they d blame me than pity me It s so dreadful humiliating that John won t ask me And WHY won t he Seems to me if I only knew his reason I wouldn t mind it so much Perhaps his mother doesn t want him to marry anybody suggested Anne Oh she does She s told me time and again that she d love to see John settled before her time comes She s always giving him hints you heard her yourself the other day I thought I d ha gone through the floor It s beyond me said Anne helplessly She thought of Ludovic Speed But the cases were not parallel John Douglas was not a man of Ludovic s type You should show more spirit Janet she went on resolutely Why didn t you send him about his business long ago I couldn t said poor Janet pathetically You see Anne I ve always been awful fond of John He might just as well keep coming as not for there was never anybody else I d want so it didn t matter But it might have made him speak out like a man urged Anne Janet shook her head No I guess not I was afraid to try anyway for fear he d think I meant it and just go I suppose I m a poor spirited creature but that is how I feel And I can t help it Oh you COULD help it Janet It isn t too late yet Take a firm stand Let that man know you are not going to endure his shillyshallying any longer I LL back you up I dunno said Janet hopelessly I dunno if I could ever get up enough spunk Things have drifted so long But I ll think it over Anne felt that she was disappointed in John Douglas She had liked him so well and she had not thought him the sort of man who would play fast and loose with a woman s feelings for twenty years He certainly should be taught a lesson and Anne felt vindictively that she would enjoy seeing the process Therefore she was delighted when Janet told her as they were going to prayer meeting the next night that she meant to show some sperrit I ll let John Douglas see I m not going to be trodden on any longer You are perfectly right said Anne emphatically When prayer meeting was over John Douglas came up with his usual request Janet looked frightened but resolute No thank you she said icily I know the road home pretty well alone I ought to seeing I ve been traveling it for forty years So you needn t trouble yourself mister Douglas Anne was looking at John Douglas and in that brilliant moonlight she saw the last twist of the rack again Without a word he turned and strode down the road Stop Stop Anne called wildly after him not caring in the least for the other dumbfounded onlookers mister Douglas stop Come back John Douglas stopped but he did not come back Anne flew down the road caught his arm and fairly dragged him back to Janet You must come back she said imploringly It s all a mistake mister Douglas all my fault I made Janet do it She didn t want to but it s all right now isn t it Janet Without a word Janet took his arm and walked away Anne followed them meekly home and slipped in by the back door Well you are a nice person to back me up said Janet sarcastically I couldn t help it Janet said Anne repentantly I just felt as if I had stood by and seen murder done I HAD to run after him Oh I m just as glad you did When I saw John Douglas making off down that road I just felt as if every little bit of joy and happiness that was left in my life was going with him It was an awful feeling Did he ask you why you did it asked Anne No he never said a word about it replied Janet dully Chapter XXXIV John Douglas Speaks at Last Anne was not without a feeble hope that something might come of it after all But nothing did John Douglas came and took Janet driving and walked home from prayer meeting with her as he had been doing for twenty years and as he seemed likely to do for twenty years more The summer waned Anne taught her school and wrote letters and studied a little Her walks to and from school were pleasant She always went by way of the swamp it was a lovely place a boggy soil green with the greenest of mossy hillocks a silvery brook meandered through it and spruces stood erectly their boughs a trail with gray green mosses their roots overgrown with all sorts of woodland lovelinesses Nevertheless Anne found life in Valley Road a little monotonous To be sure there was one diverting incident She had not seen the lank tow headed Samuel of the peppermints since the evening of his call save for chance meetings on the road But one warm August night he appeared and solemnly seated himself on the rustic bench by the porch He wore his usual working habiliments consisting of varipatched trousers a blue jean shirt out at the elbows and a ragged straw hat He was chewing a straw and he kept on chewing it while he looked solemnly at Anne Anne laid her book aside with a sigh and took up her doily Conversation with Sam was really out of the question After a long silence Sam suddenly spoke I m leaving over there he said abruptly waving his straw in the direction of the neighboring house Oh are you said Anne politely Yep And where are you going now Wall I ve been thinking some of gitting a place of my own There s one that d suit me over at Millersville But ef I rents it I ll want a woman I suppose so said Anne vaguely Yep There was another long silence Finally Sam removed his straw again and said Will yeh hev me Wh a t gasped Anne Will yeh hev me Do you mean MARRY you queried poor Anne feebly Yep Why I m hardly acquainted with you cried Anne indignantly But yeh d git acquainted with me after we was married said Sam Anne gathered up her poor dignity Certainly I won t marry you she said haughtily Wall yeh might do worse expostulated Sam I m a good worker and I ve got some money in the bank Don t speak of this to me again Whatever put such an idea into your head said Anne her sense of humor getting the better of her wrath It was such an absurd situation Yeh re a likely looking girl and hev a right smart way o stepping said Sam I don t want no lazy woman Think it over I won t change my mind yit awhile Wall I must be gitting Gotter milk the cows Anne s illusions concerning proposals had suffered so much of late years that there were few of them left So she could laugh wholeheartedly over this one not feeling any secret sting She mimicked poor Sam to Janet that night and both of them laughed immoderately over his plunge into sentiment One afternoon when Anne s sojourn in Valley Road was drawing to a close Alec Ward came driving down to Wayside in hot haste for Janet They want you at the Douglas place quick he said I really believe old missus Douglas is going to die at last after pretending to do it for twenty years Janet ran to get her hat Anne asked if missus Douglas was worse than usual She s not half as bad said Alec solemnly and that s what makes me think it s serious Other times she d be screaming and throwing herself all over the place This time she s lying still and mum When missus Douglas is mum she is pretty sick you bet You don t like old missus Douglas said Anne curiously I like cats as IS cats I don t like cats as is women was Alec s cryptic reply Janet came home in the twilight missus Douglas is dead she said wearily She died soon after I got there She just spoke to me once I suppose you ll marry John now she said It cut me to the heart Anne To think John s own mother thought I wouldn t marry him because of her I couldn t say a word either there were other women there I was thankful John had gone out Janet began to cry drearily But Anne brewed her a hot drink of ginger tea to her comforting To be sure Anne discovered later on that she had used white pepper instead of ginger but Janet never knew the difference The evening after the funeral Janet and Anne were sitting on the front porch steps at sunset The wind had fallen asleep in the pinelands and lurid sheets of heat lightning flickered across the northern skies Janet wore her ugly black dress and looked her very worst her eyes and nose red from crying They talked little for Janet seemed faintly to resent Anne s efforts to cheer her up She plainly preferred to be miserable Suddenly the gate latch clicked and John Douglas strode into the garden He walked towards them straight over the geranium bed Janet stood up So did Anne Anne was a tall girl and wore a white dress but John Douglas did not see her Janet he said will you marry me The words burst out as if they had been wanting to be said for twenty years and MUST be uttered now before anything else Janet s face was so red from crying that it couldn t turn any redder so it turned a most unbecoming purple Why didn t you ask me before she said slowly I couldn t She made me promise not to mother made me promise not to Nineteen years ago she took a terrible spell We thought she couldn t live through it She implored me to promise not to ask you to marry me while she was alive I didn t want to promise such a thing even though we all thought she couldn t live very long the doctor only gave her six months But she begged it on her knees sick and suffering I had to promise What had your mother against me cried Janet Nothing nothing She just didn t want another woman ANY woman there while she was living She said if I didn t promise she d die right there and I d have killed her So I promised And she s held me to that promise ever since though I ve gone on my knees to her in my turn to beg her to let me off Why didn t you tell me this asked Janet chokingly If I d only KNOWN Why didn t you just tell me She made me promise I wouldn t tell a soul said John hoarsely She swore me to it on the Bible Janet I d never have done it if I d dreamed it was to be for so long Janet you ll never know what I ve suffered these nineteen years I know I ve made you suffer too but you ll marry me for all won t you Janet Oh Janet won t you I ve come as soon as I could to ask you At this moment the stupefied Anne came to her senses and realized that she had no business to be there She slipped away and did not see Janet until the next morning when the latter told her the rest of the story That cruel relentless deceitful old woman cried Anne Hush she s dead said Janet solemnly If she wasn t but she IS So we mustn t speak evil of her But I m happy at last Anne And I wouldn t have minded waiting so long a bit if I d only known why When are you to be married Next month Of course it will be very quiet I suppose people will talk terrible They ll say I made enough haste to snap John up as soon as his poor mother was out of the way John wanted to let them know the truth but I said No John after all she was your mother and we ll keep the secret between us and not cast any shadow on her memory I don t mind what people say now that I know the truth myself It don t matter a mite Let it all be buried with the dead says I to him So I coaxed him round to agree with me You re much more forgiving than I could ever be Anne said rather crossly You ll feel differently about a good many things when you get to be my age said Janet tolerantly That s one of the things we learn as we grow older how to forgive It comes easier at forty than it did at twenty Chapter XXXV The Last Redmond Year Opens Here we are all back again nicely sunburned and rejoicing as a strong man to run a race said Phil sitting down on a suitcase with a sigh of pleasure Isn t it jolly to see this dear old Patty s Place again and Aunty and the cats Rusty has lost another piece of ear hasn t he Rusty would be the nicest cat in the world if he had no ears at all declared Anne loyally from her trunk while Rusty writhed about her lap in a frenzy of welcome Aren t you glad to see us back Aunty demanded Phil Yes But I wish you d tidy things up said Aunt Jamesina plaintively looking at the wilderness of trunks and suitcases by which the four laughing chattering girls were surrounded You can talk just as well later on Work first and then play used to be my motto when I was a girl Oh we ve just reversed that in this generation Aunty OUR motto is play your play and then dig in You can do your work so much better if you ve had a good bout of play first If you are going to marry a minister said Aunt Jamesina picking up Joseph and her knitting and resigning herself to the inevitable with the charming grace that made her the queen of housemothers you will have to give up such expressions as dig in Why moaned Phil Oh why must a minister s wife be supposed to utter only prunes and prisms I shan t Everybody on Patterson Street uses slang that is to say metaphorical language and if I didn t they would think me insufferably proud and stuck up Have you broken the news to your family asked Priscilla feeding the Sarah cat bits from her lunchbasket Phil nodded How did they take it Oh mother rampaged But I stood rockfirm even I Philippa Gordon who never before could hold fast to anything Father was calmer Father s own daddy was a minister so you see he has a soft spot in his heart for the cloth I had Jo up to Mount Holly after mother grew calm and they both loved him But mother gave him some frightful hints in every conversation regarding what she had hoped for me Oh my vacation pathway hasn t been exactly strewn with roses girls dear But I ve won out and I ve got Jo Nothing else matters To you said Aunt Jamesina darkly Nor to Jo either retorted Phil You keep on pitying him Why pray I think he s to be envied He s getting brains beauty and a heart of gold in ME It s well we know how to take your speeches said Aunt Jamesina patiently I hope you don t talk like that before strangers What would they think Oh I don t want to know what they think I don t want to see myself as others see me I m sure it would be horribly uncomfortable most of the time I don t believe Burns was really sincere in that prayer either Oh I daresay we all pray for some things that we really don t want if we were only honest enough to look into our hearts owned Aunt Jamesina candidly I ve a notion that such prayers don t rise very far I used to pray that I might be enabled to forgive a certain person but I know now I really didn t want to forgive her When I finally got that I DID want to I forgave her without having to pray about it I can t picture you as being unforgiving for long said Stella Oh I used to be But holding spite doesn t seem worth while when you get along in years That reminds me said Anne and told the tale of John and Janet And now tell us about that romantic scene you hinted so darkly at in one of your letters demanded Phil Anne acted out Samuel s proposal with great spirit The girls shrieked with laughter and Aunt Jamesina smiled It isn t in good taste to make fun of your beaux she said severely but she added calmly I always did it myself Tell us about your beaux Aunty entreated Phil You must have had any number of them They re not in the past tense retorted Aunt Jamesina I ve got them yet There are three old widowers at home who have been casting sheep s eyes at me for some time You children needn t think you own all the romance in the world Widowers and sheep s eyes don t sound very romantic Aunty Well no but young folks aren t always romantic either Some of my beaux certainly weren t I used to laugh at them scandalous poor boys There was Jim Elwood he was always in a sort of day dream never seemed to sense what was going on He didn t wake up to the fact that I d said no till a year after I d said it When he did get married his wife fell out of the sleigh one night when they were driving home from church and he never missed her Then there was Dan Winston He knew too much He knew everything in this world and most of what is in the next He could give you an answer to any question even if you asked him when the Judgment Day was to be Milton Edwards was real nice and I liked him but I didn t marry him For one thing he took a week to get a joke through his head and for another he never asked me Horatio Reeve was the most interesting beau I ever had But when he told a story he dressed it up so that you couldn t see it for frills I never could decide whether he was lying or just letting his imagination run loose And what about the others Aunty Go away and unpack said Aunt Jamesina waving Joseph at them by mistake for a needle The others were too nice to make fun of I shall respect their memory There s a box of flowers in your room Anne They came about an hour ago After the first week the girls of Patty s Place settled down to a steady grind of study for this was their last year at Redmond and graduation honors must be fought for persistently Anne devoted herself to English Priscilla pored over classics and Philippa pounded away at Mathematics Sometimes they grew tired sometimes they felt discouraged sometimes nothing seemed worth the struggle for it In one such mood Stella wandered up to the blue room one rainy November evening Anne sat on the floor in a little circle of light cast by the lamp beside her amid a surrounding snow of crumpled manuscript What in the world are you doing Just looking over some old Story Club yarns I wanted something to cheer AND inebriate I d studied until the world seemed azure So I came up here and dug these out of my trunk They are so drenched in tears and tragedy that they are excruciatingly funny I m blue and discouraged myself said Stella throwing herself on the couch Nothing seems worthwhile My very thoughts are old I ve thought them all before What is the use of living after all Anne Honey it s just brain fag that makes us feel that way and the weather A pouring rainy night like this coming after a hard day s grind would squelch any one but a Mark Tapley You know it IS worthwhile to live Oh I suppose so But I can t prove it to myself just now Just think of all the great and noble souls who have lived and worked in the world said Anne dreamily Isn t it worthwhile to come after them and inherit what they won and taught Isn t it worthwhile to think we can share their inspiration And then all the great souls that will come in the future Isn t it worthwhile to work a little and prepare the way for them make just one step in their path easier Oh my mind agrees with you Anne But my soul remains doleful and uninspired I m always grubby and dingy on rainy nights Some nights I like the rain I like to lie in bed and hear it pattering on the roof and drifting through the pines I like it when it stays on the roof said Stella It doesn t always I spent a gruesome night in an old country farmhouse last summer The roof leaked and the rain came pattering down on my bed There was no poetry in THAT I had to get up in the mirk midnight and chivy round to pull the bedstead out of the drip and it was one of those solid old fashioned beds that weigh a ton more or less And then that drip drop drip drop kept up all night until my nerves just went to pieces You ve no idea what an eerie noise a great drop of rain falling with a mushy thud on a bare floor makes in the night It sounds like ghostly footsteps and all that sort of thing What are you laughing over Anne These stories As Phil would say they are killing in more senses than one for everybody died in them What dazzlingly lovely heroines we had and how we dressed them Silks satins velvets jewels laces they never wore anything else Here is one of Jane Andrews stories depicting her heroine as sleeping in a beautiful white satin nightdress trimmed with seed pearls Go on said Stella I begin to feel that life is worth living as long as there s a laugh in it Here s one I wrote My heroine is disporting herself at a ball glittering from head to foot with large diamonds of the first water But what booted beauty or rich attire The paths of glory lead but to the grave They must either be murdered or die of a broken heart There was no escape for them Let me read some of your stories Well here s my masterpiece Note its cheerful title My Graves I shed quarts of tears while writing it and the other girls shed gallons while I read it Jane Andrews mother scolded her frightfully because she had so many handkerchiefs in the wash that week It s a harrowing tale of the wanderings of a Methodist minister s wife I made her a Methodist because it was necessary that she should wander She buried a child every place she lived in There were nine of them and their graves were severed far apart ranging from Newfoundland to Vancouver I described the children pictured their several death beds and detailed their tombstones and epitaphs I had intended to bury the whole nine but when I had disposed of eight my invention of horrors gave out and I permitted the ninth to live as a hopeless cripple While Stella read My Graves punctuating its tragic paragraphs with chuckles and Rusty slept the sleep of a just cat who has been out all night curled up on a Jane Andrews tale of a beautiful maiden of fifteen who went to nurse in a leper colony of course dying of the loathsome disease finally Anne glanced over the other manuscripts and recalled the old days at Avonlea school when the members of the Story Club sitting under the spruce trees or down among the ferns by the brook had written them What fun they had had How the sunshine and mirth of those olden summers returned as she read Not all the glory that was Greece or the grandeur that was Rome could weave such wizardry as those funny tearful tales of the Story Club Among the manuscripts Anne found one written on sheets of wrapping paper A wave of laughter filled her gray eyes as she recalled the time and place of its genesis It was the sketch she had written the day she fell through the roof of the Cobb duckhouse on the Tory Road Anne glanced over it then fell to reading it intently It was a little dialogue between asters and sweet peas wild canaries in the lilac bush and the guardian spirit of the garden After she had read it she sat staring into space and when Stella had gone she smoothed out the crumpled manuscript I believe I will she said resolutely Chapter XXXVI The Gardners Call Here is a letter with an Indian stamp for you Aunt Jimsie said Phil Here are three for Stella and two for Pris and a glorious fat one for me from Jo There s nothing for you Anne except a circular Nobody noticed Anne s flush as she took the thin letter Phil tossed her carelessly But a few minutes later Phil looked up to see a transfigured Anne Honey what good thing has happened The Youth s Friend has accepted a little sketch I sent them a fortnight ago said Anne trying hard to speak as if she were accustomed to having sketches accepted every mail but not quite succeeding Anne Shirley

112_123215_000008_000002	train-clean-360	What was it 
none	none	When is it to be published Did they pay you for it Yes they ve sent a check for ten dollars and the editor writes that he would like to see more of my work Dear man he shall It was an old sketch I found in my box I re wrote it and sent it in but I never really thought it could be accepted because it had no plot said Anne recalling the bitter experience of Averil s Atonement What are you going to do with that ten dollars Anne Let s all go up town and get drunk suggested Phil I AM going to squander it in a wild soulless revel of some sort declared Anne gaily At all events it isn t tainted money like the check I got for that horrible Reliable Baking Powder story I spent IT usefully for clothes and hated them every time I put them on Think of having a real live author at Patty s Place said Priscilla It s a great responsibility said Aunt Jamesina solemnly Indeed it is agreed Pris with equal solemnity Authors are kittle cattle You never know when or how they will break out Anne may make copy of us I meant that the ability to write for the Press was a great responsibility said Aunt Jamesina severely and I hope Anne realizes it My daughter used to write stories before she went to the foreign field but now she has turned her attention to higher things She used to say her motto was Never write a line you would be ashamed to read at your own funeral You d better take that for yours Anne if you are going to embark in literature Though to be sure added Aunt Jamesina perplexedly Elizabeth always used to laugh when she said it She always laughed so much that I don t know how she ever came to decide on being a missionary I m thankful she did I prayed that she might but I wish she hadn t Then Aunt Jamesina wondered why those giddy girls all laughed Anne s eyes shone all that day literary ambitions sprouted and budded in her brain their exhilaration accompanied her to Jennie Cooper s walking party and not even the sight of Gilbert and Christine walking just ahead of her and Roy could quite subdue the sparkle of her starry hopes Nevertheless she was not so rapt from things of earth as to be unable to notice that Christine s walk was decidedly ungraceful But I suppose Gilbert looks only at her face So like a man thought Anne scornfully Shall you be home Saturday afternoon asked Roy Yes My mother and sisters are coming to call on you said Roy quietly Something went over Anne which might be described as a thrill but it was hardly a pleasant one She had never met any of Roy s family she realized the significance of his statement and it had somehow an irrevocableness about it that chilled her I shall be glad to see them she said flatly and then wondered if she really would be glad She ought to be of course But would it not be something of an ordeal Gossip had filtered to Anne regarding the light in which the Gardners viewed the infatuation of son and brother Roy must have brought pressure to bear in the matter of this call Anne knew she would be weighed in the balance From the fact that they had consented to call she understood that willingly or unwillingly they regarded her as a possible member of their clan I shall just be myself I shall not TRY to make a good impression thought Anne loftily But she was wondering what dress she would better wear Saturday afternoon and if the new style of high hair dressing would suit her better than the old and the walking party was rather spoiled for her By night she had decided that she would wear her brown chiffon on Saturday but would do her hair low Friday afternoon none of the girls had classes at Redmond Stella took the opportunity to write a paper for the Philomathic Society and was sitting at the table in the corner of the living room with an untidy litter of notes and manuscript on the floor around her Stella always vowed she never could write anything unless she threw each sheet down as she completed it Anne in her flannel blouse and serge skirt with her hair rather blown from her windy walk home was sitting squarely in the middle of the floor teasing the Sarah cat with a wishbone Joseph and Rusty were both curled up in her lap A warm plummy odor filled the whole house for Priscilla was cooking in the kitchen Presently she came in enshrouded in a huge work apron with a smudge of flour on her nose to show Aunt Jamesina the chocolate cake she had just iced At this auspicious moment the knocker sounded Nobody paid any attention to it save Phil who sprang up and opened it expecting a boy with the hat she had bought that morning On the doorstep stood missus Gardner and her daughters Anne scrambled to her feet somehow emptying two indignant cats out of her lap as she did so and mechanically shifting her wishbone from her right hand to her left Priscilla who would have had to cross the room to reach the kitchen door lost her head wildly plunged the chocolate cake under a cushion on the inglenook sofa and dashed upstairs Stella began feverishly gathering up her manuscript Only Aunt Jamesina and Phil remained normal Thanks to them everybody was soon sitting at ease even Anne Priscilla came down apronless and smudgeless Stella reduced her corner to decency and Phil saved the situation by a stream of ready small talk missus Gardner was tall and thin and handsome exquisitely gowned cordial with a cordiality that seemed a trifle forced Aline Gardner was a younger edition of her mother lacking the cordiality She endeavored to be nice but succeeded only in being haughty and patronizing Dorothy Gardner was slim and jolly and rather tomboyish Anne knew she was Roy s favorite sister and warmed to her She would have looked very much like Roy if she had had dreamy dark eyes instead of roguish hazel ones Thanks to her and Phil the call really went off very well except for a slight sense of strain in the atmosphere and two rather untoward incidents Rusty and Joseph left to themselves began a game of chase and sprang madly into missus Gardner s silken lap and out of it in their wild career missus Gardner lifted her lorgnette and gazed after their flying forms as if she had never seen cats before and Anne choking back slightly nervous laughter apologized as best she could You are fond of cats said missus Gardner with a slight intonation of tolerant wonder Anne despite her affection for Rusty was not especially fond of cats but missus Gardner s tone annoyed her Inconsequently she remembered that missus John Blythe was so fond of cats that she kept as many as her husband would allow They ARE adorable animals aren t they she said wickedly I have never liked cats said missus Gardner remotely
112_123215_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I love them said Dorothy 
none	none	They are so nice and selfish Dogs are TOO good and unselfish They make me feel uncomfortable But cats are gloriously human You have two delightful old china dogs there May I look at them closely said Aline crossing the room towards the fireplace and thereby becoming the unconscious cause of the other accident Picking up Magog she sat down on the cushion under which was secreted Priscilla s chocolate cake Priscilla and Anne exchanged agonized glances but could do nothing The stately Aline continued to sit on the cushion and discuss china dogs until the time of departure Dorothy lingered behind a moment to squeeze Anne s hand and whisper impulsively I KNOW you and I are going to be chums Oh Roy has told me all about you I m the only one of the family he tells things to poor boy nobody COULD confide in mamma and Aline you know What glorious times you girls must have here Won t you let me come often and have a share in them Come as often as you like Anne responded heartily thankful that one of Roy s sisters was likable She would never like Aline so much was certain and Aline would never like her though missus Gardner might be won Altogether Anne sighed with relief when the ordeal was over Of all sad words of tongue or pen The saddest are it might have been quoted Priscilla tragically lifting the cushion This cake is now what you might call a flat failure And the cushion is likewise ruined 
112_123215_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Never tell me that Friday isn t unlucky 
none	none	People who send word they are coming on Saturday shouldn t come on Friday said Aunt Jamesina I fancy it was Roy s mistake said Phil That boy isn t really responsible for what he says when he talks to Anne Where IS Anne Anne had gone upstairs 
112_123215_000042_000001	train-clean-360	She felt oddly like crying 
none	none	But she made herself laugh instead Rusty and Joseph had been TOO awful And Dorothy WAS a dear

none	none	 Full fledged B A s
112_123216_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish I were dead or that it were tomorrow night groaned Phil 
112_123216_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 If you live long enough both wishes will come true said Anne calmly 
112_123216_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 It s easy for you to be serene 
none	none	You re at home in Philosophy 
112_123216_000006_000002	train-clean-360	I m not and when I think of that horrible paper tomorrow I quail 
112_123216_000006_000003	train-clean-360	If I should fail in it what would Jo say 
none	none	You won t fail 
112_123216_000007_000001	train-clean-360	How did you get on in Greek today 
none	none	I don t know 
112_123216_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps it was a good paper and perhaps it was bad enough to make Homer turn over in his grave 
112_123216_000008_000002	train-clean-360	I ve studied and mulled over notebooks until I m incapable of forming an opinion of anything 
112_123216_000008_000003	train-clean-360	How thankful little Phil will be when all this examinating is over 
none	none	Examinating I never heard such a word Well haven t I as good a right to make a word as any one else demanded Phil
112_123216_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Words aren t made they grow said Anne 
none	none	Never mind I begin faintly to discern clear water ahead where no examination breakers loom Girls do you can you realize that our Redmond Life is almost over I can t said Anne sorrowfully It seems just yesterday that Pris and I were alone in that crowd of Freshmen at Redmond And now we are Seniors in our final examinations Potent wise and reverend Seniors quoted Phil Do you suppose we really are any wiser than when we came to Redmond
112_123216_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 You don t act as if you were by times said Aunt Jamesina severely 
112_123216_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Aunt Jimsie haven t we been pretty good girls take us by and large these three winters you ve mothered us pleaded Phil 
none	none	You ve been four of the dearest sweetest goodest girls that ever went together through college averred Aunt Jamesina who never spoiled a compliment by misplaced economy
112_123216_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 But I mistrust you haven t any too much sense yet 
112_123216_000018_000001	train-clean-360	It s not to be expected of course 
none	none	Experience teaches sense You can t learn it in a college course You ve been to college four years and I never was but I know heaps more than you do young ladies There are lots of things that never go by rule There s a powerful pile o knowledge That you never get at college There are heaps of things you never learn at school quoted Stella
112_123216_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you learned anything at Redmond except dead languages and geometry and such trash queried Aunt Jamesina 
none	none	Oh yes I think we have Aunty protested Anne
112_123216_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 We ve learned the truth of what Professor Woodleigh told us last Philomathic said Phil 
none	none	He said Humor is the spiciest condiment in the feast of existence Laugh at your mistakes but learn from them joke over your troubles but gather strength from them make a jest of your difficulties but overcome them Isn t that worth learning Aunt Jimsie Yes it is dearie 
112_123216_000024_000001	train-clean-360	When you ve learned to laugh at the things that should be laughed at and not to laugh at those that shouldn t you ve got wisdom and understanding 
none	none	What have you got out of your Redmond course Anne murmured Priscilla aside
112_123216_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I think said Anne slowly that I really have learned to look upon each little hindrance as a jest and each great one as the foreshadowing of victory 
112_123216_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Summing up I think that is what Redmond has given me 
none	none	I shall have to fall back on another Professor Woodleigh quotation to express what it has done for me said Priscilla You remember that he said in his address There is so much in the world for us all if we only have the eyes to see it and the heart to love it and the hand to gather it to ourselves so much in men and women so much in art and literature so much everywhere in which to delight and for which to be thankful I think Redmond has taught me that in some measure Anne
112_123216_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Judging from what you all say remarked Aunt Jamesina the sum and substance is that you can learn if you ve got natural gumption enough in four years at college what it would take about twenty years of living to teach you 
112_123216_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Well that justifies higher education in my opinion 
112_123216_000028_000002	train-clean-360	It s a matter I was always dubious about before 
112_123216_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 But what about people who haven t natural gumption Aunt Jimsie 
none	none	People who haven t natural gumption never learn retorted Aunt Jamesina neither in college nor life 
112_123216_000030_000001	train-clean-360	If they live to be a hundred they really don t know anything more than when they were born 
112_123216_000030_000002	train-clean-360	It s their misfortune not their fault poor souls 
112_123216_000030_000003	train-clean-360	But those of us who have some gumption should duly thank the Lord for it 
112_123216_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you please define what gumption is Aunt Jimsie asked Phil 
112_123216_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 No I won t young woman 
none	none	Any one who has gumption knows what it is and any one who hasn t can never know what it is 
112_123216_000032_000002	train-clean-360	So there is no need of defining it 
none	none	The busy days flew by and examinations were over Anne took High Honors in English 
112_123216_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Priscilla took Honors in Classics and Phil in Mathematics Stella obtained a good all round showing 
112_123216_000033_000003	train-clean-360	Then came Convocation 
112_123216_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 This is what I would once have called an epoch in my life said Anne as she took Roy s violets out of their box and gazed at them thoughtfully 
112_123216_000034_000001	train-clean-360	She meant to carry them of course but her eyes wandered to another box on her table 
none	none	It was filled with lilies of the valley as fresh and fragrant as those which bloomed in the Green Gables yard when June came to Avonlea Gilbert Blythe s card lay beside it Anne wondered why Gilbert should have sent her flowers for Convocation She had seen very little of him during the past winter He had come to Patty s Place only one Friday evening since the Christmas holidays and they rarely met elsewhere 
112_123216_000035_000002	train-clean-360	She knew he was studying very hard aiming at High Honors and the Cooper Prize and he took little part in the social doings of Redmond 
112_123216_000035_000003	train-clean-360	Anne s own winter had been quite gay socially She had seen a good deal of the Gardners she and Dorothy were very intimate college circles expected the announcement of her engagement to Roy any day 
none	none	Anne expected it herself 
112_123216_000035_000005	train-clean-360	Yet just before she left Patty s Place for Convocation she flung Roy s violets aside and put Gilbert s lilies of the valley in their place 
112_123216_000035_000006	train-clean-360	She could not have told why she did it 
none	none	Somehow old Avonlea days and dreams and friendships seemed very close to her in this attainment of her long cherished ambitions She and Gilbert had once picturedout merrily the day on which they should be capped and gowned graduates in Arts 
112_123216_000035_000009	train-clean-360	The wonderful day had come and Roy s violets had no place in it 
none	none	Only her old friend s flowers seemed to belong to this fruition of old blossoming hopes which he had once shared For years this day had beckoned and allured to her but when it came the one single keen abiding memory it left with her was not that of the breathless moment when the stately president of Redmond gave her cap and diploma and hailed her B A it was not of the flash in Gilbert s eyes when he saw her lilies nor the puzzled pained glance Roy gave her as he passed her on the platform It was not of Aline Gardner s condescending congratulations or Dorothy s ardent impulsive good wishes 
112_123216_000036_000002	train-clean-360	It was of one strange unaccountable pang that spoiled this long expected day for her and left in it a certain faint but enduring flavor of bitterness 
112_123216_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The Arts graduates gave a graduation dance that night 
112_123216_000037_000001	train-clean-360	When Anne dressed for it she tossed aside the pearl beads she usually wore and took from her trunk the small box that had come to Green Gables on Christmas day In it was a thread like gold chain with a tiny pink enamel heart as a pendant 
none	none	On the accompanying card was written With all good wishes from your old chum Gilbert Anne laughing over the memory the enamel heart conjured up the fatal day when Gilbert had called her Carrots and vainly tried to make his peace with a pink candy heart had written him a nice little note of thanks But she had never worn the trinket Tonight she fastened it about her white throat with a dreamy smile 
112_123216_000038_000000	train-clean-360	She and Phil walked to Redmond together 
none	none	Anne walked in silence Phil chattered of many things Suddenly she said I heard today that Gilbert Blythe s engagement to Christine Stuart was to be announced as soon as Convocation was over 
112_123216_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Did you hear anything of it 
none	none	No said Anne
112_123216_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I think it s true said Phil lightly 
none	none	Anne did not speak 
112_123216_000042_000001	train-clean-360	In the darkness she felt her face burning 
112_123216_000042_000002	train-clean-360	She slipped her hand inside her collar and caught at the gold chain 
112_123216_000042_000003	train-clean-360	One energetic twist and it gave way 
none	none	Anne thrust the broken trinket into her pocket 
112_123216_000042_000005	train-clean-360	Her hands were trembling and her eyes were smarting 
none	none	But she was the gayest of all the gay revellers that night and told Gilbert unregretfully that her card was full when he came to ask her for a dance Afterwards when she sat with the girls before the dying embers at Patty s Place removing the spring chilliness from their satin skins none chatted more blithely than she of the day s events
112_123216_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Moody Spurgeon MacPherson called here tonight after you left said Aunt Jamesina who had sat up to keep the fire on 
112_123216_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 He didn t know about the graduation dance 
112_123216_000044_000002	train-clean-360	That boy ought to sleep with a rubber band around his head to train his ears not to stick out 
none	none	I had a beau once who did that and it improved him immensely 
112_123216_000044_000004	train-clean-360	It was I who suggested it to him and he took my advice but he never forgave me for it 
none	none	Moody Spurgeon is a very serious young man yawned Priscilla He is concerned with graver matters than his ears He is going to be a minister you know Well I suppose the Lord doesn t regard the ears of a man said Aunt Jamesina gravely dropping all further criticism of Moody Spurgeon Aunt Jamesina had a proper respect for the cloth even in the case of an unfledged parson Chapter XXXVIII False Dawn Just imagine this night week I ll be in Avonlea delightful thought said Anne bending over the box in which she was packing missus Rachel Lynde s quilts But just imagine this night week I ll be gone forever from Patty s Place horrible thought I wonder if the ghost of all our laughter will echo through the maiden dreams of Miss Patty and Miss Maria speculated Phil Miss Patty and Miss Maria were coming home after having trotted over most of the habitable globe We ll be back the second week in May wrote Miss Patty I expect Patty s Place will seem rather small after the Hall of the Kings at Karnak but I never did like big places to live in And I ll be glad enough to be home again When you start traveling late in life you re apt to do too much of it because you know you haven t much time left and it s a thing that grows on you I m afraid Maria will never be contented again I shall leave here my fancies and dreams to bless the next comer said Anne looking around the blue room wistfully her pretty blue room where she had spent three such happy years She had knelt at its window to pray and had bent from it to watch the sunset behind the pines She had heard the autumn raindrops beating against it and had welcomed the spring robins at its sill She wondered if old dreams could haunt rooms if when one left forever the room where she had joyed and suffered and laughed and wept something of her intangible and invisible yet nonetheless real did not remain behind like a voiceful memory I think said Phil that a room where one dreams and grieves and rejoices and lives becomes inseparably connected with those processes and acquires a personality of its own I am sure if I came into this room fifty years from now it would say Anne Anne to me What nice times we ve had here honey What chats and jokes and good chummy jamborees Oh dear me I m to marry Jo in June and I know I will be rapturously happy But just now I feel as if I wanted this lovely Redmond life to go on forever I m unreasonable enough just now to wish that too admitted Anne No matter what deeper joys may come to us later on we ll never again have just the same delightful irresponsible existence we ve had here It s over forever Phil What are you going to do with Rusty asked Phil as that privileged pussy padded into the room I am going to take him home with me and Joseph and the Sarah cat announced Aunt Jamesina following Rusty It would be a shame to separate those cats now that they have learned to live together It s a hard lesson for cats and humans to learn I m sorry to part with Rusty said Anne regretfully but it would be no use to take him to Green Gables Marilla detests cats and Davy would tease his life out Besides I don t suppose I ll be home very long I ve been offered the principalship of the Summerside High School Are you going to accept it asked Phil I I haven t decided yet answered Anne with a confused flush Phil nodded understandingly Naturally Anne s plans could not be settled until Roy had spoken He would soon there was no doubt of that And there was no doubt that Anne would say yes when he said Will you please Anne herself regarded the state of affairs with a seldom ruffled complacency She was deeply in love with Roy True it was not just what she had imagined love to be But was anything in life Anne asked herself wearily like one s imagination of it It was the old diamond disillusion of childhood repeated the same disappointment she had felt when she had first seen the chill sparkle instead of the purple splendor she had anticipated That s not my idea of a diamond she had said But Roy was a dear fellow and they would be very happy together even if some indefinable zest was missing out of life When Roy came down that evening and asked Anne to walk in the park every one at Patty s Place knew what he had come to say and every one knew or thought they knew what Anne s answer would be Anne is a very fortunate girl said Aunt Jamesina I suppose so said Stella shrugging her shoulders Roy is a nice fellow and all that But there s really nothing in him That sounds very like a jealous remark Stella Maynard said Aunt Jamesina rebukingly It does but I am not jealous said Stella calmly I love Anne and I like Roy Everybody says she is making a brilliant match and even missus Gardner thinks her charming now It all sounds as if it were made in heaven but I have my doubts Make the most of that Aunt Jamesina Roy asked Anne to marry him in the little pavilion on the harbor shore where they had talked on the rainy day of their first meeting Anne thought it very romantic that he should have chosen that spot And his proposal was as beautifully worded as if he had copied it as one of Ruby Gillis lovers had done out of a Deportment of Courtship and Marriage The whole effect was quite flawless And it was also sincere There was no doubt that Roy meant what he said There was no false note to jar the symphony Anne felt that she ought to be thrilling from head to foot But she wasn t she was horribly cool When Roy paused for his answer she opened her lips to say her fateful yes And then she found herself trembling as if she were reeling back from a precipice To her came one of those moments when we realize as by a blinding flash of illumination more than all our previous years have taught us She pulled her hand from Roy s Oh I can t marry you I can t I can t she cried wildly Roy turned pale and also looked rather foolish He had small blame to him felt very sure What do you mean he stammered I mean that I can t marry you repeated Anne desperately I thought I could but I can t Why can t you Roy asked more calmly Because I don t care enough for you A crimson streak came into Roy s face So you ve just been amusing yourself these two years he said slowly No no I haven t gasped poor Anne Oh how could she explain She COULDN T explain There are some things that cannot be explained I did think I cared truly I did but I know now I don t You have ruined my life said Roy bitterly Forgive me pleaded Anne miserably with hot cheeks and stinging eyes Roy turned away and stood for a few minutes looking out seaward When he came back to Anne he was very pale again You can give me no hope he said Anne shook her head mutely Then good bye said Roy I can t understand it I can t believe you are not the woman I ve believed you to be But reproaches are idle between us You are the only woman I can ever love I thank you for your friendship at least Good bye Anne Good bye faltered Anne When Roy had gone she sat for a long time in the pavilion watching a white mist creeping subtly and remorselessly landward up the harbor It was her hour of humiliation and self contempt and shame Their waves went over her And yet underneath it all was a queer sense of recovered freedom She slipped into Patty s Place in the dusk and escaped to her room But Phil was there on the window seat Wait said Anne flushing to anticipate the scene Wait til you hear what I have to say Phil Roy asked me to marry him and I refused You you REFUSED him said Phil blankly Yes Anne Shirley are you in your senses I think so said Anne wearily Oh Phil don t scold me You don t understand I certainly don t understand You ve encouraged Roy Gardner in every way for two years and now you tell me you ve refused him Then you ve just been flirting scandalously with him Anne I couldn t have believed it of YOU I WASN T flirting with him I honestly thought I cared up to the last minute and then well I just knew I NEVER could marry him I suppose said Phil cruelly that you intended to marry him for his money and then your better self rose up and prevented you I DIDN T I never thought about his money Oh I can t explain it to you any more than I could to him Well I certainly think you have treated Roy shamefully said Phil in exasperation He s handsome and clever and rich and good What more do you want I want some one who BELONGS in my life He doesn t I was swept off my feet at first by his good looks and knack of paying romantic compliments and later on I thought I MUST be in love because he was my dark eyed ideal I am bad enough for not knowing my own mind but you are worse said Phil I DO know my own mind protested Anne The trouble is my mind changes and then I have to get acquainted with it all over again Well I suppose there is no use in saying anything to you There is no need Phil I m in the dust This has spoiled everything backwards I can never think of Redmond days without recalling the humiliation of this evening Roy despises me and you despise me and I despise myself You poor darling said Phil melting Just come here and let me comfort you I ve no right to scold you I d have married Alec or Alonzo if I hadn t met Jo Oh Anne things are so mixed up in real life They aren t clear cut and trimmed off as they are in novels I hope that NO one will ever again ask me to marry him as long as I live sobbed poor Anne devoutly believing that she meant it Chapter XXXIX Deals with Weddings Anne felt that life partook of the nature of an anticlimax during the first few weeks after her return to Green Gables She missed the merry comradeship of Patty s Place She had dreamed some brilliant dreams during the past winter and now they lay in the dust around her In her present mood of self disgust she could not immediately begin dreaming again And she discovered that while solitude with dreams is glorious solitude without them has few charms She had not seen Roy again after their painful parting in the park pavilion but Dorothy came to see her before she left Kingsport I m awfully sorry you won t marry Roy she said I did want you for a sister But you are quite right He would bore you to death I love him and he is a dear sweet boy but really he isn t a bit interesting He looks as if he ought to be but he isn t This won t spoil OUR friendship will it Dorothy Anne had asked wistfully No indeed You re too good to lose If I can t have you for a sister I mean to keep you as a chum anyway And don t fret over Roy He is feeling terribly just now I have to listen to his outpourings every day but he ll get over it He always does Oh ALWAYS said Anne with a slight change of voice So he has got over it before Dear me yes said Dorothy frankly Twice before And he raved to me just the same both times Not that the others actually refused him they simply announced their engagements to some one else Of course when he met you he vowed to me that he had never really loved before that the previous affairs had been merely boyish fancies But I don t think you need worry Anne decided not to worry Her feelings were a mixture of relief and resentment Roy had certainly told her she was the only one he had ever loved No doubt he believed it But it was a comfort to feel that she had not in all likelihood ruined his life There were other goddesses and Roy according to Dorothy must needs be worshipping at some shrine Nevertheless life was stripped of several more illusions and Anne began to think drearily that it seemed rather bare She came down from the porch gable on the evening of her return with a sorrowful face What has happened to the old Snow Queen Marilla Oh I knew you d feel bad over that said Marilla I felt bad myself That tree was there ever since I was a young girl It blew down in the big gale we had in March It was rotten at the core I ll miss it so grieved Anne The porch gable doesn t seem the same room without it I ll never look from its window again without a sense of loss And oh I never came home to Green Gables before that Diana wasn t here to welcome me Diana has something else to think of just now said missus Lynde significantly Well tell me all the Avonlea news said Anne sitting down on the porch steps where the evening sunshine fell over her hair in a fine golden rain There isn t much news except what we ve wrote you said missus Lynde I suppose you haven t heard that Simon Fletcher broke his leg last week It s a great thing for his family They re getting a hundred things done that they ve always wanted to do but couldn t as long as he was about the old crank He came of an aggravating family remarked Marilla Aggravating Well rather His mother used to get up in prayer meeting and tell all her children s shortcomings and ask prayers for them Course it made them mad and worse than ever You haven t told Anne the news about Jane suggested Marilla Oh Jane sniffed missus Lynde Well she conceded grudgingly Jane Andrews is home from the West came last week and she s going to be married to a Winnipeg millionaire You may be sure missus Harmon lost no time in telling it far and wide Dear old Jane I m so glad said Anne heartily She deserves the good things of life Oh I ain t saying anything against Jane She s a nice enough girl But she isn t in the millionaire class and you ll find there s not much to recommend that man but his money that s what missus Harmon says he s an Englishman who has made money in mines but I believe he ll turn out to be a Yankee He certainly must have money for he has just showered Jane with jewelry Her engagement ring is a diamond cluster so big that it looks like a plaster on Jane s fat paw missus Lynde could not keep some bitterness out of her tone Here was Jane Andrews that plain little plodder engaged to a millionaire while Anne it seemed was not yet bespoken by any one rich or poor And missus Harmon Andrews did brag insufferably What has Gilbert Blythe been doing to at college asked Marilla I saw him when he came home last week and he is so pale and thin I hardly knew him He studied very hard last winter said Anne You know he took High Honors in Classics and the Cooper Prize It hasn t been taken for five years So I think he s rather run down We re all a little tired Anyhow you re a B A and Jane Andrews isn t and never will be said missus Lynde with gloomy satisfaction A few evenings later Anne went down to see Jane but the latter was away in Charlottetown getting sewing done missus Harmon informed Anne proudly Of course an Avonlea dressmaker wouldn t do for Jane under the circumstances I ve heard something very nice about Jane said Anne Yes Jane has done pretty well even if she isn t a B A said missus Harmon with a slight toss of her head mister Inglis is worth millions and they re going to Europe on their wedding tour When they come back they ll live in a perfect mansion of marble in Winnipeg Jane has only one trouble she can cook so well and her husband won t let her cook He is so rich he hires his cooking done They re going to keep a cook and two other maids and a coachman and a man of all work But what about YOU Anne I don t hear anything of your being married after all your college going Oh laughed Anne I am going to be an old maid I really can t find any one to suit me It was rather wicked of her She deliberately meant to remind missus Andrews that if she became an old maid it was not because she had not had at least one chance of marriage But missus Harmon took swift revenge Well the over particular girls generally get left I notice And what s this I hear about Gilbert Blythe being engaged to a Miss Stuart Charlie Sloane tells me she is perfectly beautiful Is it true I don t know if it is true that he is engaged to Miss Stuart replied Anne with Spartan composure but it is certainly true that she is very lovely I once thought you and Gilbert would have made a match of it said missus Harmon If you don t take care Anne all of your beaux will slip through your fingers Anne decided not to continue her duel with missus Harmon You could not fence with an antagonist who met rapier thrust with blow of battle axe Since Jane is away she said rising haughtily I don t think I can stay longer this morning I ll come down when she comes home Do said missus Harmon effusively Jane isn t a bit proud She just means to associate with her old friends the same as ever She ll be real glad to see you Jane s millionaire arrived the last of May and carried her off in a blaze of splendor missus Lynde was spitefully gratified to find that mister Inglis was every day of forty and short and thin and grayish missus Lynde did not spare him in her enumeration of his shortcomings you may be sure It will take all his gold to gild a pill like him that s what said missus Rachel solemnly He looks kind and good hearted said Anne loyally and I m sure he thinks the world of Jane Humph said missus Rachel Phil Gordon was married the next week and Anne went over to Bolingbroke to be her bridesmaid Phil made a dainty fairy of a bride and the reverend Jo was so radiant in his happiness that nobody thought him plain We re going for a lovers saunter through the land of Evangeline said Phil and then we ll settle down on Patterson Street Mother thinks it is terrible she thinks Jo might at least take a church in a decent place But the wilderness of the Patterson slums will blossom like the rose for me if Jo is there Oh Anne I m so happy my heart aches with it Anne was always glad in the happiness of her friends but it is sometimes a little lonely to be surrounded everywhere by a happiness that is not your own And it was just the same when she went back to Avonlea This time it was Diana who was bathed in the wonderful glory that comes to a woman when her first born is laid beside her Anne looked at the white young mother with a certain awe that had never entered into her feelings for Diana before Could this pale woman with the rapture in her eyes be the little black curled rosy cheeked Diana she had played with in vanished schooldays It gave her a queer desolate feeling that she herself somehow belonged only in those past years and had no business in the present at all Isn t he perfectly beautiful said Diana proudly The little fat fellow was absurdly like Fred just as round just as red Anne really could not say conscientiously that she thought him beautiful but she vowed sincerely that he was sweet and kissable and altogether delightful Before he came I wanted a girl so that I could call her ANNE said Diana But now that little Fred is here I wouldn t exchange him for a million girls He just COULDN T have been anything but his own precious self Every little baby is the sweetest and the best quoted missus Allan gaily If little Anne HAD come you d have felt just the same about her missus Allan was visiting in Avonlea for the first time since leaving it She was as gay and sweet and sympathetic as ever Her old girl friends had welcomed her back rapturously The reigning minister s wife was an estimable lady but she was not exactly a kindred spirit I can hardly wait till he gets old enough to talk sighed Diana I just long to hear him say mother And oh I m determined that his first memory of me shall be a nice one The first memory I have of my mother is of her slapping me for something I had done I am sure I deserved it and mother was always a good mother and I love her dearly But I do wish my first memory of her was nicer I have just one memory of my mother and it is the sweetest of all my memories said missus Allan I was five years old and I had been allowed to go to school one day with my two older sisters When school came out my sisters went home in different groups each supposing I was with the other Instead I had run off with a little girl I had played with at recess We went to her home which was near the school and began making mud pies We were having a glorious time when my older sister arrived breathless and angry You naughty girl she cried snatching my reluctant hand and dragging me along with her Come home this minute Oh you re going to catch it Mother is awful cross She is going to give you a good whipping I had never been whipped Dread and terror filled my poor little heart I have never been so miserable in my life as I was on that walk home I had not meant to be naughty Phemy Cameron had asked me to go home with her and I had not known it was wrong to go And now I was to be whipped for it When we got home my sister dragged me into the kitchen where mother was sitting by the fire in the twilight My poor wee legs were trembling so that I could hardly stand And mother mother just took me up in her arms without one word of rebuke or harshness kissed me and held me close to her heart I was so frightened you were lost darling she said tenderly I could see the love shining in her eyes as she looked down on me She never scolded or reproached me for what I had done only told me I must never go away again without asking permission She died very soon afterwards That is the only memory I have of her Isn t it a beautiful one Anne felt lonelier than ever as she walked home going by way of the Birch Path and Willowmere She had not walked that way for many moons It was a darkly purple bloomy night The air was heavy with blossom fragrance almost too heavy The cloyed senses recoiled from it as from an overfull cup The birches of the path had grown from the fairy saplings of old to big trees Everything had changed Anne felt that she would be glad when the summer was over and she was away at work again Perhaps life would not seem so empty then I ve tried the world it wears no more The coloring of romance it wore sighed Anne and was straightway much comforted by the romance in the idea of the world being denuded of romance Chapter XL A Book of Revelation The Irvings came back to Echo Lodge for the summer and Anne spent a happy three weeks there in July Miss Lavendar had not changed Charlotta the Fourth was a very grown up young lady now but still adored Anne sincerely When all s said and done Miss Shirley ma am I haven t seen any one in Boston that s equal to you she said frankly Paul was almost grown up too He was sixteen his chestnut curls had given place to close cropped brown locks and he was more interested in football than fairies But the bond between him and his old teacher still held Kindred spirits alone do not change with changing years It was a wet bleak cruel evening in July when Anne came back to Green Gables One of the fierce summer storms which sometimes sweep over the gulf was ravaging the sea As Anne came in the first raindrops dashed against the panes Was that Paul who brought you home asked Marilla Why didn t you make him stay all night It s going to be a wild evening He ll reach Echo Lodge before the rain gets very heavy I think Anyway he wanted to go back tonight Well I ve had a splendid visit but I m glad to see you dear folks again East west hame s best Davy have you been growing again lately I ve growed a whole inch since you left said Davy proudly I m as tall as Milty Boulter now Ain t I glad He ll have to stop crowing about being bigger Say Anne did you know that Gilbert Blythe is dying Anne stood quite silent and motionless looking at Davy Her face had gone so white that Marilla thought she was going to faint Davy hold your tongue said missus Rachel angrily Anne don t look like that DON T LOOK LIKE THAT We didn t mean to tell you so suddenly Is it true asked Anne in a voice that was not hers Gilbert is very ill said missus Lynde gravely He took down with typhoid fever just after you left for Echo Lodge Did you never hear of it No said that unknown voice It was a very bad case from the start The doctor said he d been terribly run down They ve a trained nurse and everything s been done DON T look like that Anne While there s life there s hope mister Harrison was here this evening and he said they had no hope of him reiterated Davy Marilla looking old and worn and tired got up and marched Davy grimly out of the kitchen Oh DON T look so dear said missus Rachel putting her kind old arms about the pallid girl I haven t given up hope indeed I haven t He s got the Blythe constitution in his favor that s what Anne gently put missus Lynde s arms away from her walked blindly across the kitchen through the hall up the stairs to her old room At its window she knelt down staring out unseeingly It was very dark The rain was beating down over the shivering fields The Haunted Woods was full of the groans of mighty trees wrung in the tempest and the air throbbed with the thunderous crash of billows on the distant shore And Gilbert was dying There is a book of Revelation in every one s life as there is in the Bible Anne read hers that bitter night as she kept her agonized vigil through the hours of storm and darkness She loved Gilbert had always loved him She knew that now She knew that she could no more cast him out of her life without agony than she could have cut off her right hand and cast it from her And the knowledge had come too late too late even for the bitter solace of being with him at the last If she had not been so blind so foolish she would have had the right to go to him now But he would never know that she loved him he would go away from this life thinking that she did not care Oh the black years of emptiness stretching before her She could not live through them she could not She cowered down by her window and wished for the first time in her gay young life that she could die too If Gilbert went away from her without one word or sign or message she could not live Nothing was of any value without him She belonged to him and he to her In her hour of supreme agony she had no doubt of that He did not love Christine Stuart never had loved Christine Stuart Oh what a fool she had been not to realize what the bond was that had held her to Gilbert to think that the flattered fancy she had felt for Roy Gardner had been love And now she must pay for her folly as for a crime missus Lynde and Marilla crept to her door before they went to bed shook their heads doubtfully at each other over the silence and went away The storm raged all night but when the dawn came it was spent Anne saw a fairy fringe of light on the skirts of darkness Soon the eastern hilltops had a fire shot ruby rim The clouds rolled themselves away into great soft white masses on the horizon the sky gleamed blue and silvery A hush fell over the world Anne rose from her knees and crept downstairs The freshness of the rain wind blew against her white face as she went out into the yard and cooled her dry burning eyes A merry rollicking whistle was lilting up the lane A moment later Pacifique Buote came in sight Anne s physical strength suddenly failed her If she had not clutched at a low willow bough she would have fallen Pacifique was George Fletcher s hired man and George Fletcher lived next door to the Blythes missus Fletcher was Gilbert s aunt Pacifique would know if if Pacifique would know what there was to be known Pacifique strode sturdily on along the red lane whistling He did not see Anne She made three futile attempts to call him He was almost past before she succeeded in making her quivering lips call Pacifique Pacifique turned with a grin and a cheerful good morning Pacifique said Anne faintly did you come from George Fletcher s this morning Sure said Pacifique amiably I got de word las night dat my fader he was seeck It was so stormy dat I couldn t go den so I start vair early dis mornin I m goin troo de woods for short cut Did you hear how Gilbert Blythe was this morning Anne s desperation drove her to the question Even the worst would be more endurable than this hideous suspense He s better said Pacifique He got de turn las night De doctor say he ll be all right now dis soon while Had close shave dough Dat boy he jus keel himself at college Well I mus hurry De old man he ll be in hurry to see me Pacifique resumed his walk and his whistle Anne gazed after him with eyes where joy was driving out the strained anguish of the night He was a very lank very ragged very homely youth But in her sight he was as beautiful as those who bring good tidings on the mountains Never as long as she lived would Anne see Pacifique s brown round black eyed face without a warm remembrance of the moment when he had given to her the oil of joy for mourning Long after Pacifique s gay whistle had faded into the phantom of music and then into silence far up under the maples of Lover s Lane Anne stood under the willows tasting the poignant sweetness of life when some great dread has been removed from it The morning was a cup filled with mist and glamor In the corner near her was a rich surprise of new blown crystal dewed roses The trills and trickles of song from the birds in the big tree above her seemed in perfect accord with her mood A sentence from a very old very true very wonderful Book came to her lips Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning XLI Love Takes Up the Glass of Time I ve come up to ask you to go for one of our old time rambles through September woods and over hills where spices grow this afternoon said Gilbert coming suddenly around the porch corner Suppose we visit Hester Gray s garden Anne sitting on the stone step with her lap full of a pale filmy green stuff looked up rather blankly Oh I wish I could she said slowly but I really can t Gilbert I m going to Alice Penhallow s wedding this evening you know I ve got to do something to this dress and by the time it s finished I ll have to get ready I m so sorry I d love to go Well can you go tomorrow afternoon then asked Gilbert apparently not much disappointed Yes I think so In that case I shall hie me home at once to do something I should otherwise have to do tomorrow So Alice Penhallow is to be married tonight Three weddings for you in one summer Anne Phil s Alice s and Jane s I ll never forgive Jane for not inviting me to her wedding You really can t blame her when you think of the tremendous Andrews connection who had to be invited The house could hardly hold them all I was only bidden by grace of being Jane s old chum at least on Jane s part I think missus Harmon s motive for inviting me was to let me see Jane s surpassing gorgeousness Is it true that she wore so many diamonds that you couldn t tell where the diamonds left off and Jane began Anne laughed She certainly wore a good many What with all the diamonds and white satin and tulle and lace and roses and orange blossoms prim little Jane was almost lost to sight But she was VERY happy and so was mister Inglis and so was missus Harmon Is that the dress you re going to wear tonight asked Gilbert looking down at the fluffs and frills Yes Isn t it pretty And I shall wear starflowers in my hair The Haunted Wood is full of them this summer Gilbert had a sudden vision of Anne arrayed in a frilly green gown with the virginal curves of arms and throat slipping out of it and white stars shining against the coils of her ruddy hair The vision made him catch his breath But he turned lightly away Well I ll be up tomorrow Hope you ll have a nice time tonight Anne looked after him as he strode away and sighed Gilbert was friendly very friendly far too friendly He had come quite often to Green Gables after his recovery and something of their old comradeship had returned But Anne no longer found it satisfying The rose of love made the blossom of friendship pale and scentless by contrast And Anne had again begun to doubt if Gilbert now felt anything for her but friendship In the common light of common day her radiant certainty of that rapt morning had faded She was haunted by a miserable fear that her mistake could never be rectified It was quite likely that it was Christine whom Gilbert loved after all Perhaps he was even engaged to her Anne tried to put all unsettling hopes out of her heart and reconcile herself to a future where work and ambition must take the place of love She could do good if not noble work as a teacher and the success her little sketches were beginning to meet with in certain editorial sanctums augured well for her budding literary dreams But but Anne picked up her green dress and sighed again When Gilbert came the next afternoon he found Anne waiting for him fresh as the dawn and fair as a star after all the gaiety of the preceding night She wore a green dress not the one she had worn to the wedding but an old one which Gilbert had told her at a Redmond reception he liked especially It was just the shade of green that brought out the rich tints of her hair and the starry gray of her eyes and the iris like delicacy of her skin Gilbert glancing at her sideways as they walked along a shadowy woodpath thought she had never looked so lovely Anne glancing sideways at Gilbert now and then thought how much older he looked since his illness It was as if he had put boyhood behind him forever The day was beautiful and the way was beautiful Anne was almost sorry when they reached Hester Gray s garden and sat down on the old bench But it was beautiful there too as beautiful as it had been on the faraway day of the Golden Picnic when Diana and Jane and Priscilla and she had found it Then it had been lovely with narcissus and violets now golden rod had kindled its fairy torches in the corners and asters dotted it bluely The call of the brook came up through the woods from the valley of birches with all its old allurement the mellow air was full of the purr of the sea beyond were fields rimmed by fences bleached silvery gray in the suns of many summers and long hills scarfed with the shadows of autumnal clouds with the blowing of the west wind old dreams returned I think said Anne softly that the land where dreams come true is in the blue haze yonder over that little valley Have you any unfulfilled dreams Anne asked Gilbert Something in his tone something she had not heard since that miserable evening in the orchard at Patty s Place made Anne s heart beat wildly But she made answer lightly Of course Everybody has It wouldn t do for us to have all our dreams fulfilled We would be as good as dead if we had nothing left to dream about What a delicious aroma that low descending sun is extracting from the asters and ferns I wish we could see perfumes as well as smell them I m sure they would be very beautiful Gilbert was not to be thus sidetracked I have a dream he said slowly I persist in dreaming it although it has often seemed to me that it could never come true I dream of a home with a hearth fire in it a cat and dog the footsteps of friends and YOU Anne wanted to speak but she could find no words Happiness was breaking over her like a wave It almost frightened her I asked you a question over two years ago Anne If I ask it again today will you give me a different answer Still Anne could not speak But she lifted her eyes shining with all the love rapture of countless generations and looked into his for a moment He wanted no other answer They lingered in the old garden until twilight sweet as dusk in Eden must have been crept over it There was so much to talk over and recall things said and done and heard and thought and felt and misunderstood I thought you loved Christine Stuart Anne told him as reproachfully as if she had not given him every reason to suppose that she loved Roy Gardner Gilbert laughed boyishly Christine was engaged to somebody in her home town I knew it and she knew I knew it When her brother graduated he told me his sister was coming to Kingsport the next winter to take music and asked me if I would look after her a bit as she knew no one and would be very lonely So I did And then I liked Christine for her own sake She is one of the nicest girls I ve ever known I knew college gossip credited us with being in love with each other I didn t care Nothing mattered much to me for a time there after you told me you could never love me Anne There was nobody else there never could be anybody else for me but you I ve loved you ever since that day you broke your slate over my head in school I don t see how you could keep on loving me when I was such a little fool said Anne Well I tried to stop said Gilbert frankly not because I thought you what you call yourself but because I felt sure there was no chance for me after Gardner came on the scene But I couldn t and I can t tell you either what it s meant to me these two years to believe you were going to marry him and be told every week by some busybody that your engagement was on the point of being announced I believed it until one blessed day when I was sitting up after the fever I got a letter from Phil Gordon Phil Blake rather in which she told me there was really nothing between you and Roy and advised me to try again Well the doctor was amazed at my rapid recovery after that Anne laughed then shivered I can never forget the night I thought you were dying Gilbert Oh I knew I KNEW then and I thought it was too late But it wasn t sweetheart Oh Anne this makes up for everything doesn t it Let s resolve to keep this day sacred to perfect beauty all our lives for the gift it has given us It s the birthday of our happiness said Anne softly I ve always loved this old garden of Hester Gray s and now it will be dearer than ever But I ll have to ask you to wait a long time Anne said Gilbert sadly It will be three years before I ll finish my medical course And even then there will be no diamond sunbursts and marble halls Anne laughed I don t want sunbursts and marble halls I just want YOU You see I m quite as shameless as Phil about it Sunbursts and marble halls may be all very well but there is more scope for imagination without them And as for the waiting that doesn t matter We ll just be happy waiting and working for each other and dreaming Oh dreams will be very sweet now Gilbert drew her close to him and kissed her Then they walked home together in the dusk crowned king and queen in the bridal realm of love along winding paths fringed with the sweetest flowers that ever bloomed and over haunted meadows where winds of hope and memory blew End of Project Gutenberg s Anne Of The Island
