BARABBAS A ROMANCE OF TWO WORLDS THE MIGHTY ATOM et cetera et cetera TO THE PRESENT LIVING RE INCARNATION OF ARAXES ZISKA THE PROBLEM OF A WICKED SOUL PROLOGUE Dark against the sky towered the Great Pyramid and over its apex hung the moon Like a wreck cast ashore by some titanic storm the Sphinx reposing amid the undulating waves of grayish sand surrounding it seemed for once to drowse Its solemn visage that had impassively watched ages come and go empires rise and fall and generations of men live and die appeared for the moment to have lost its usual expression of speculative wisdom and intense disdain its cold eyes seemed to droop its stern mouth almost smiled The air was calm and sultry and not a human foot disturbed the silence But towards midnight a Voice suddenly arose as it were like a wind in the desert crying aloud Araxes Araxes and wailing past sank with a profound echo into the deep recesses of the vast Egyptian tomb Moonlight and the Hour wove their own mystery the mystery of a Shadow and a Shape that flitted out like a thin vapor from the very portals of Death s ancient temple and drifting forward a few paces resolved itself into the visionary fairness of a Woman s form a Woman whose dark hair fell about her heavily like the black remnants of a long buried corpse s wrappings a Woman whose eyes flashed with an unholy fire as she lifted her face to the white moon and waved her ghostly arms upon the air And again the wild Voice pulsated through the stillness Araxes Araxes Thou art here and I pursue thee Through life into death through death out into life again I find thee and I follow I follow Araxes Moonlight and the Hour wove their own mystery and ere the pale opal dawn flushed the sky with hues of rose and amber the Shadow had vanished the Voice was heard no more Slowly the sun lifted the edge of its golden shield above the horizon and the great Sphinx awaking from its apparent brief slumber stared in expressive and eternal scorn across the tracts of sand and tufted palm trees towards the glittering dome of El Hazar that abode of profound sanctity and learning where men still knelt and worshipped praying the Unknown to deliver them from the Unseen And one would almost have deemed that the sculptured Monster with the enigmatical Woman face and Lion form had strange thoughts in its huge granite brain for when the full day sprang in glory over the desert and illumined its large features with a burning saffron radiance its cruel lips still smiled as though yearning to speak and propound the terrible riddle of old time the Problem which killed CHAPTER I It was the full season in Cairo The ubiquitous Britisher and the no less ubiquitous American had planted their differing society standards on the sandy soil watered by the Nile and were busily engaged in the work of reducing the city formerly called Al Kahira or The Victorious to a more deplorable condition of subjection and slavery than any old world conqueror could ever have done For the heavy yoke of modern fashion has been flung on the neck of Al Kahira and the irresistible tyrannic dominion of swagger vulgarity has laid The Victorious low The swarthy children of the desert might and possibly would be ready and willing to go forth and fight men with men s weapons for the freedom to live and die unmolested in their own native land but against the blandly smiling white helmeted sun spectacled perspiring horde of Cook s cheap trippers what can they do save remain inert and well nigh speechless For nothing like the cheap tripper was ever seen in the world till our present enlightened and glorious day of progress he is a new grafted type of nomad like and yet unlike a man The Darwin theory asserts itself proudly and prominently in bristles of truth all over him in his restlessness his ape like agility and curiosity his shameless inquisitiveness his careful cleansing of himself from foreign fleas his general attention to minutiae and his always voracious appetite and where the ape ends and the man begins is somewhat difficult to discover The image of God wherewith he together with his fellows was originally supposed to be impressed in the first fresh days of Creation seems fairly blotted out for there is no touch of the Divine in his mortal composition Nor does the second created phase the copy of the Divineo namely the Heroic dignify his form or ennoble his countenance There is nothing of the heroic in the wandering biped who swings through the streets of Cairo in white flannels laughing at the staid composure of the Arabs flicking thumb and finger at the patient noses of the small hireable donkeys and other beasts of burden thrusting a warm red face of inquiry into the shadowy recesses of odoriferous bazaars and sauntering at evening in the Esbekiyeh Gardens cigar in mouth and hands in pockets looking on the scene and behaving in it as if the whole place were but a reflex of Earl s Court Exhibition History affects the cheap tripper not at all he regards the Pyramids as good building merely and the inscrutable Sphinx itself as a fine target for empty soda water bottles while perhaps his chiefest regret is that the granite whereof the ancient monster is hewn is too hard for him to inscribe his distinguished name thereon It is true that there is a punishment inflicted on any person or persons attempting such wanton work a fine or the bastinado yet neither fine nor bastinado would affect the tripper if he could only succeed in carving Arry on the Sphinx s jaw But he cannot and herein is his own misery Otherwise he comports himself in Egypt as he does at Margate with no more thought reflection or reverence than dignify the composition of his far off Simian ancestor Taking him all in all he is however no worse and in some respects better than the swagger folk who do Egypt or rather consent in a languid way to be done by Egypt These are the people who annually leave England on the plea of being unable to stand the cheery frosty and in every respect healthy winter of their native country that winter which with its wild winds its sparkling frost and snow its holly trees bright with scarlet berries its merry hunters galloping over field and moor during daylight hours and its great log fires roaring up the chimneys at evening was sufficiently good for their forefathers to thrive upon and live through contentedly up to a hale and hearty old age in the times when the fever of travelling from place to place was an unknown disease and home was indeed sweet home Infected by strange maladies of the blood and nerves to which even scientific physicians find it hard to give suitable names they shudder at the first whiff of cold and filling huge trunks with a thousand foolish things which have through luxurious habit become necessities to their pallid existences they hastily depart to the Land of the Sun carrying with them their nameless languors discontents and incurable illnesses for which Heaven itself much less Egypt could provide no remedy It is not at all to be wondered at that these physically and morally sick tribes of human kind have ceased to give any serious attention as to what may possibly become of them after death or whether there IS any after for they are in the mentally comatose condition which precedes entire wreckage of brain force existence itself has become a bore one place is like another and they repeat the same monotonous round of living in every spot where they congregate whether it be east west north or south On the Riviera they find little to do except meet at Rumpelmayer s at Cannes the London House at Nice or the Casino at Monte Carlo and in Cairo they inaugurate a miniature London season over again worked in the same groove of dinners dances drives picnics flirtations and matrimonial engagements But the Cairene season has perhaps some advantage over the London one so far as this particular set of swagger folk are concerned it is less hampered by the proprieties One can be more free you know You may take a little walk into Old Cairo and turning a corner you may catch glimpses of what Mark Twain calls Oriental simplicity namely picturesquely composed groups of dear delightful Arabs whose clothing is no more than primitive custom makes strictly necessary These kind of tableaux vivants or art studies give quite a thrill of novelty to Cairene English Society a touch of savagery a soupcon of peculiarity which is entirely lacking to fashionable London Then it must be remembered that the children of the desert have been led by gentle degrees to understand that for harboring the strange locusts imported into their land by Cook and the still stranger specimens of unclassified insect called Upper Ten which imports itself they will receive backsheesh Backsheesh is a certain source of comfort to all nations and translates itself with sweetest euphony into all languages and the desert born tribes have justice on their side when they demand as much of it as they can get rightfully or wrongfully They deserve to gain some sort of advantage out of the odd looking swarms of Western invaders who amaze them by their dress and affront them by their manners Backsheesh therefore has become the perpetual cry of the Desert Born it is the only means of offence and defence left to them and very naturally they cling to it with fervor and resolution And who shall blame them The tall majestic meditative Arab superb as mere man and standing naked footed on his sandy native soil with his one rough garment flung round his loins and his great black eyes fronting eagle like the sun merits something considerable for condescending to act as guide and servant to the Western moneyed civilian who clothes his lower limbs in straight funnel like cloth casings shaped to the strict resemblance of an elephant s legs and finishes the graceful design by enclosing the rest of his body in a stiff shirt wherein he can scarcely move and a square cut coat which divides him neatly in twain by a line immediately above the knee with the effect of lessening his height by several inches The Desert Born surveys him gravely and in civil compassion sometimes with a muttered prayer against the hideousness of him but on the whole with patience and equanimity influenced by considerations of backsheesh And the English season whirls lightly and vaporously like blown egg froth over the mystic land of the old gods the terrible land filled with dark secrets as yet unexplored the land shadowing with wings as the Bible hath it the land in which are buried tremendous histories as yet unguessed profound enigmas of the supernatural labyrinths of wonder terror and mystery all of which remain unrevealed to the giddy pated dancing dining gabbling throng of the fashionable travelling lunatics of the day the people who never think because it is too much trouble people whose one idea is to journey from hotel to hotel and compare notes with their acquaintances afterwards as to which house provided them with the best cooked food For it is a noticeable fact that with most visitors to the show places of Europe and the East food bedding and selfish personal comfort are the first considerations the scenery and the associations come last Formerly the position was reversed In the days when there were no railways and the immortal Byron wrote his Childe Harold it was customary to rate personal inconvenience lightly the beautiful or historic scene was the attraction for the traveller and not the arrangements made for his special form of digestive apparatus Byron could sleep on the deck of a sailing vessel wrapped in his cloak and feel none the worse for it his well braced mind and aspiring spirit soared above all bodily discomforts his thoughts were engrossed with the mighty teachings of time he was able to lose himself in glorious reveries on the lessons of the past and the possibilities of the future the attitude of the inspired Thinker as well as Poet was his and a crust of bread and cheese served him as sufficiently on his journeyings among the then unspoilt valleys and mountains of Switzerland as the warm greasy indigestible fare of the elaborate table d hotes at Lucerne and Interlaken serve us now But we in our superior condition pooh pooh the Byronic spirit of indifference to events and scorn of trifles we say it is melodramatic completely forgetting that our attitude towards ourselves and things in general is one of most pitiable bathos We cannot write Childe Harold but we can grumble at both bed and board in every hotel under the sun we can discover teasing midges in the air and questionable insects in the rooms and we can discuss each bill presented to us with an industrious persistence which nearly drives landlords frantic and ourselves as well In these kind of important matters we are indeed superior to Byron and other ranting dreamers of his type but we produce no Childe Harolds and we have come to the strange pass of pretending that Don Juan is improper while we pore over Zola with avidity To such a pitch has our culture brought us And like the Pharisee in the Testament we thank God we are not as others are We are glad we are not as the Arab as the African as the Hindoo we are proud of our elephant legs and our dividing coat line these things show we are civilized and that God approves of us more than any other type of creature ever created We take possession of nations not by thunder of war but by clatter of dinner plates We do not raise armies we build hotels and we settle ourselves in Egypt as we do at Homburg to dress and dine and sleep and sniff contempt on all things but ourselves to such an extent that we have actually got into the habit of calling the natives of the places we usurp foreigners WE are the foreigners but somehow we never can see it Wherever we condescend to build hotels that spot we consider ours We are surprised at the impertinence of Frankfort people who presume to visit Homburg while we are having our season there we wonder how they dare do it And of a truth they seem amazed at their own boldness and creep shyly through the Kur Garten as though fearing to be turned out by the custodians The same thing occurs in Egypt we are frequently astounded at what we call the impertinence of these foreigners i e the natives They ought to be proud to have us and our elephant legs glad to see such noble and beautiful types of civilization as the stout parvenu with his pendant paunch and his family of gawky youths and maidens of the large toothed long limbed genus glad to see the English mamma who never grows old but wears young hair in innocent curls and has her wrinkles annually massaged out by a Paris artiste in complexion The Desert Born we say should be happy and grateful to see such sights and not demand so much backsheesh In fact the Desert Born should not get so much in our way as he does he is a very good servant of course but as a man and a brother pooh Egypt may be his country and he may love it as much as we love England but our feelings are more to be considered than his and there is no connecting link of human sympathy between Elephant Legs and sun browned Nudity So at least thought Sir Chetwynd Lyle a stout gentleman of coarse build and coarser physiognomy as he sat in a deep arm chair in the great hall or lounge of the Gezireh Palace Hotel smoking after dinner in the company of two or three acquaintances with whom he had fraternized during his stay in Cairo Sir Chetwynd was fond of airing his opinions for the benefit of as many people who cared to listen to him and Sir Chetwynd had some right to his opinions inasmuch as he was the editor and proprietor of a large London newspaper His knighthood was quite a recent distinction and nobody knew exactly how he had managed to get it He had originally been known in Fleet Street by the irreverent sobriquet of greasy Chetwynd owing to his largeness oiliness and general air of blandly meaningless benevolence He had a wife and two daughters and one of his objects in wintering at Cairo was to get his cherished children married It was time for the bloom was slightly off the fair girl roses the dainty petals of the delicate buds were beginning to wither And Sir Chetwynd had heard much of Cairo he understood that there was a great deal of liberty allowed there between men and maids that they went out together on driving excursions to the Pyramids that they rode on lilliputian donkeys over the sand at moonlight that they floated about in boats at evening on the Nile and that in short there were more opportunities of marriage among the flesh pots of Egypt than in all the rush and crush of London So here he was portly and comfortable and on the whole well satisfied with his expedition there were a good many eligible bachelors about and Muriel and Dolly were really doing their best So was their mother Lady Chetwynd Lyle she allowed no eligible to escape her hawk like observation and on this particular evening she was in all her glory for there was to be a costume ball at the Gezireh Palace Hotel a superb affair organized by the proprietors for the amusement of their paying guests who certainly paid well even stiffly Owing to the preparations that were going on for this festivity the lounge with its sumptuous Egyptian decorations and luxurious modern fittings was well nigh deserted save for Sir Chetwynd and his particular group of friends to whom he was holding forth between slow cigar puffs on the squalor of the Arabs the frightful thievery of the Sheiks the incompetency of his own special dragoman and the mistake people made in thinking the Egyptians themselves a fine race They are tall certainly said Sir Chetwynd surveying his paunch which lolled comfortably and as it were by itself in front of him like a kind of waistcoated air balloon I grant you they are tall That is the majority of them are But I have seen short men among them The Khedive is not taller than I am And the Egyptian face is very deceptive The features are often fine occasionally classic but intelligent expression is totally lacking Here Sir Chetwynd waved his cigar descriptively as though he would fain suggest that a heavy jaw a fat nose with a pimple at the end and a gross mouth with black teeth inside it which were special points in his own physiognomy went further to make up intelligent expression than any well moulded straight Eastern type of sun browned countenance ever seen or imagined Well I don t quite agree with you there said a man who was lying full length on one of the divans close by and smoking These brown chaps have deuced fine eyes There doesn t seem to be any lack of expression in them And that reminds me there is at fellow arrived here to day who looks for all the world like an Egyptian of the best form He is a Frenchman though a Provencal every one knows him he is the famous painter Armand Gervase Indeed and Sir Chetwynd roused himself at the name Armand Gervase THE Armand Gervase The only one original laughed the other He s come here to make studies of Eastern women A rare old time he ll have among them I daresay He s not famous for character He ought to paint the Princess Ziska Ah by the bye I wanted to ask you about that lady Does anyone know who she is My wife is very anxious to find out whether she is well er quite the proper person you know When one has young girls one cannot be too careful Ross Courtney the man on the divan got up slowly and stretched his long athletic limbs with a lazy enjoyment in the action He was a sporting person with unhampered means and large estates in Scotland and Ireland he lived a joyous don t care life of wandering about the world in search of adventures and he had a scorn of civilized conventionalities newspapers and their editors among them And whenever Sir Chetwynd spoke of his young girls he was moved to irreverent smiling as he knew the youngest of the twain was at least thirty He also recognized and avoided the wily traps and pitfalls set for him by Lady Chetwynd Lyle in the hope that he would yield himself up a captive to the charms of Muriel or Dolly and as he thought of these two fair ones now and involuntarily compared them in his mind with the other woman just spoken of the smile that had begun to hover on his lips deepened unconsciously till his handsome face was quite illumined with its mirth Upon my word I don t think it matters who anybody is in Cairo he said with a fine carelessness The people whose families are all guaranteed respectable are more lax in their behavior than the people one knows nothing about As for the Princess Ziska her extraordinary beauty and intelligence would give her the entree anywhere even if she hadn t money to back those qualities up She s enormously wealthy I hear said young Lord Fulkeward another of the languid smokers caressing his scarcely perceptible moustache My mother thinks she is a divorcee Sir Chetwynd looked very serious and shook his fat head solemnly Well there is nothing remarkable in being divorced you know laughed Ross Courtney Nowadays it seems the natural and fitting end of marriage Sir Chetwynd looked graver still He refused to be drawn into this kind of flippant conversation He at any rate was respectably married he had no sympathy whatever with the larger majority of people whose marriages were a failure There is no Prince Ziska then he inquired The name sounds to me of Russian origin and I imagined my wife also imagined that the husband of the lady might very easily be in Russia while his wife s health might necessitate her wintering in Egypt The Russian winter climate is inclement I believe That would be a very neat arrangement yawned Lord Fulkeward But my mother thinks not My mother thinks there is not a husband at all that there never was a husband In fact my mother has very strong convictions on the subject But my mother intends to visit her all the same She does Lady Fulkeward has decided on that Oh well in THAT case and Sir Chetwynd expanded his lower chest air balloon Of course Lady Chetwynd Lyle can no longer have any scruples on the subject If Lady Fulkeward visits the Princess there can be no doubt as to her actual STATUS Oh I don t know murmured Lord Fulkeward stroking his downy lip You see my mother s rather an exceptional person When the governor was alive she hardly ever went out anywhere you know and all the people who came to our house in Yorkshire had to bring their pedigrees with them so to speak It was beastly dull But now my mother has taken to studying character don cher know she likes all sorts of people about her and the more mixed they are the more she is delighted with them Fact I assure you Quite a change has come over my mother since the poor old governor died Ross Courtney looked amused A change indeed had come over Lady Fulkeward a change sudden mysterious and amazing to many of her former distinguished friends with pedigrees In her husband s lifetime her hair had been a soft silver gray her face pale refined and serious her form full and matronly her step sober and discreet but two years after the death of the kindly and noble old lord who had cherished her as the apple of his eye and up to the last moment of his breath had thought her the most beautiful woman in England she appeared with golden tresses a peach bloom complexion and a figure which had been so massaged rubbed pressed and artistically corseted as to appear positively sylph like She danced like a fairy she who had once been called old Lady Fulkeward she smoked cigarettes she laughed like a child at every trivial thing any joke however stale flat and unprofitable was sufficient to stir her light pulses to merriment and she flirted oh heavens HOW she flirted with a skill and a grace and a knowledge and an aplomb that nearly drove Muriel and Dolly Chetwynd Lyle frantic They poor things were beaten out of the field altogether by her superior tact and art of fence and they hated her accordingly and called her in private a horrid old woman which perhaps when her maid undressed her she was But she was having a distinctly good time in Cairo she called her son who was in delicate health my poor dear little boy and he though twenty eight on his last birthday was reduced to such an abject condition of servitude by her assertiveness impudent gayety and general freedom of manner that he could not open his mouth without alluding to my mother and using my mother as a peg whereon to hang all his own opinions and emotions as well as the opinions and emotions of other people Lady Fulkeward admires the Princess very much I believe said another lounger who had not yet spoken Oh as to that and Lord Fulkeward roused himself to some faint show of energy Who wouldn t admire her By Jove Only I tell you what there s something I weird about her eyes Fact I don t like her eyes Shut up Fulke She has beautiful eyes burst out Courtney hotly then flushing suddenly he bit his lips and was silent Who is this that has beautiful eyes suddenly demanded a slow gruff voice and a little thin gentleman dressed in a kind of academic gown and cap appeared on the scene Hullo here s our F R S A exclaimed Lord Fulkeward By Jove Is that the style you have got yourself up in for tonight It looks awfully smart don cher know The personage thus complimented adjusted his spectacles and surveyed his acquaintances with a very well satisfied air In truth doctor Maxwell Dean had some reason for self satisfaction if the knowledge that he possessed one of the cleverest heads in Europe could give a man cause for pride He was apparently the only individual in the Gezireh Palace Hotel who had come to Egypt for any serious purpose A purpose he had though what it was he declined to explain Reticent often brusque and sometimes mysterious in his manner of speech there was not the slightest doubt that he was at work on something and that he also had a very trying habit of closely studying every object small or great that came under his observation He studied the natives to such an extent that he knew every differing shade of color in their skins he studied Sir Chetwynd Lyle and knew that he occasionally took bribes to put things into his paper he studied Dolly and Muriel Chetwynd Lyle and knew that they would never succeed in getting husbands he studied Lady Fulkeward and thought her very well got up for sixty he studied Ross Courtney and knew he would never do anything but kill animals all his life and he studied the working of the Gezireh Palace Hotel and saw a fortune rising out of it for the proprietors But apart from these ordinary surface things he studied other matters occult peculiarities of temperament coincidences strange occurrences generally He could read the Egyptian hieroglyphs perfectly and he understood the difference between royal cartouche scarabei and Birmingham manufactured ones He was never dull he had plenty to do and he took everything as it came in its turn Even the costume ball for which he had now attired himself did not present itself to him as a bore but as a new vein of information opening to him fresh glimpses of the genus homo as seen in a state of eccentricity I think he now said complacently that the cap and gown look well for a man of my years It is a simple garb but cool convenient and not unbecoming I had thought at first of adopting the dress of an ancient Egyptian priest but I find it difficult to secure the complete outfit I would never wear a costume of the kind that was not in every point historically correct No one smiled No one would have dared to smile at doctor Maxwell Dean when he spoke of historically correct things He had studied them as he had studied everything and he knew all about them Sir Chetwynd murmured Quite right er the ancient designs were very elaborate And symbolic finished doctor Dean Symbolic of very curious meanings I assure you But I fear I have interrupted your talk mister Courtney was speaking about somebody s beautiful eyes who is the fair one in question The Princess Ziska said Lord Fulkeward I was saying that I don t quite like the look of her eyes Why not Why not demanded the doctor with sudden asperity What s the matter with them Everything s the matter with them replied Ross Courtney with a forced laugh They are too splendid and wild for Fulke he likes the English pale blue better than the Egyptian gazelle black No I don t said Lord Fulkeward speaking more animatedly than was customary with him I hate pale blue eyes I prefer soft violet gray ones like Miss Murray s Miss Helen Murray is a very charming young lady said doctor Dean But her beauty is quite of an ordinary type while that of the Princess Ziska Is EXTRA ordinary exactly That s just what I say declared Courtney I think she is the loveliest woman I have ever seen There was a pause during which the little doctor looked with a ferret like curiosity from one man to the other Sir Chetwynd Lyle rose ponderously up from the depths of his arm chair I think said he I had better go and get into my uniform the Windsor you know I always have it with me wherever I go it comes in very useful for fancy balls such as the one we are going to have tonight when no particular period is observed in costume Isn t it about time we all got ready Upon my life I think it is agreed Lord Fulkeward I am coming out as a Neapolitan fisherman I don t believe Neapolitan fishermen ever really dress in the way I m going to make up but it s the accepted stage type don cher know Ah I daresay you will look very well in it murmured Ross Courtney vaguely Hullo here comes Denzil Murray They all turned instinctively to watch the entrance of a handsome young man attired in the picturesque garb worn by Florentine nobles during the prosperous reign of the Medicis It was a costume admirably adapted to the wearer who being grave and almost stern of feature needed the brightness of jewels and the gloss of velvet and satin to throw out the classic contour of his fine head and enhance the lustre of his brooding darkly passionate eyes Denzil Murray was a pure blooded Highlander the level brows the firm lips the straight fearless look all bespoke him a son of the heather crowned mountains and a descendant of the proud races that scorned the Sassenach and retained sufficient of the material whereof their early Phoenician ancestors were made to be capable of both the extremes of hate and love in their most potent forms He moved slowly towards the group of men awaiting his approach with a reserved air of something like hauteur it was possible he was conscious of his good looks but it was equally evident that he did not desire to be made the object of impertinent remark His friends silently recognized this and only Lord Fulkeward moved to a mild transport of admiration ventured to comment on his appearance I say Denzil you re awfully well got up Awfully well Magnificent Denzil Murray bowed with a somewhat wearied and sarcastic air When one is in Rome or Egypt one must do as Rome or Egypt does he said carelessly If hotel proprietors will give fancy balls it is necessary to rise to the occasion You look very well Doctor Why don t you other fellows go and get your toggeries on It s past ten o clock and the Princess Ziska will be here by eleven There are other people coming besides the Princess Ziska are there not mister Murray inquired Sir Chetwynd Lyle with an obtrusively bantering air Denzil Murray glanced him over disdainfully I believe there are he answered coolly Otherwise the ball would scarcely pay its expenses But as the Princess is admittedly the most beautiful woman in Cairo this season she will naturally be the centre of attraction That s why I mentioned she would be here at eleven She told you that inquired Ross Courtney She did Courtney looked up then down and seemed about to speak again but checked himself and finally strolled off followed by Lord Fulkeward I hear said doctor Dean then addressing Denzil Murray that a great celebrity has arrived at this hotel the painter Armand Gervase Denzil s face brightened instantly with a pleasant smile The dearest friend I have in the world he said Yes he is here I met him outside the door this afternoon We are very old chums I have stayed with him in Paris and he has stayed with me in Scotland A charming fellow He is very French in his ideas but he knows England well and speaks English perfectly French in his ideas echoed Sir Chetwynd Lyle who was just preparing to leave the lounge Dear me How is that He is a Frenchman said doctor Dean suavely Therefore that his ideas should be French ought not to be a matter of surprise to us my dear Sir Chetwynd Sir Chetwynd snorted He had a suspicion that he the editor and proprietor of the Daily Dial was being laughed at and he at once clambered on his high horse of British Morality Frenchman or no Frenchman he observed the ideas promulgated in France at the present day are distinctly profane and pernicious There is a lack of principle a want of rectitude in er the French Press for example that is highly deplorable And is the English Press immaculate asked Denzil languidly We hope so replied Sir Chetwynd We do our best to make it so And with that remark he took his paunch and himself away into retirement leaving doctor Dean and young Murray facing each other a singular pair enough in the contrast of their appearance and dress the one small lean and wiry in plain cut loose flowing academic gown the other tall broad and muscular clad in the rich attire of mediaeval Florence and looking for all the world like a fine picture of that period stepped out from its frame There was a silence between them for a moment then the Doctor spoke in a low tone It won t do my dear boy I assure you it won t do You will break your heart over a dream and make yourself miserable for nothing And you will break your sister s heart as well perhaps you haven t thought of that Denzil flung himself into the chair Sir Chetwynd had just vacated and gave vent to a sigh that was almost a groan Helen doesn t know anything yet he said hoarsely I know nothing myself how can I I haven t said a word to to HER If I spoke all that was in my mind I daresay she would laugh at me You are the only one who has guessed my secret You saw me last night when I when I accompanied her home But I never passed her palace gates she wouldn t let me She bade me good night outside a servant admitted her and she vanished through the portal like a witch or a ghost Sometimes I fancy she IS a ghost She is so white so light so noiseless and so lovely He turned his eyes away ashamed of the emotion that moved him doctor Maxwell Dean took off his academic cap and examined its interior as though he considered it remarkable Yes he said slowly I have thought the same thing of her myself sometimes Further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of the military band of the evening which now crossed the lounge each man carrying his instrument with him and these were followed by several groups of people in fancy dress all ready and eager for the ball Pierrots and Pierrettes monks in drooping cowls flower girls water carriers symbolic figures of Night and Morning mingled with the counterfeit presentments of dead and gone kings and queens began to flock together laughing and talking on their way to the ball room and presently among them came a man whose superior height and build combined with his eminently picturesque half savage type of beauty caused every one to turn and watch him as he passed and murmur whispering comments on the various qualities wherein he differed from themselves He was attired for the occasion as a Bedouin chief and his fierce black eyes and close curling dark hair combined with the natural olive tint of his complexion were well set off by the snowy folds of his turban and the whiteness of his entire costume which was unrelieved by any color save at the waist where a gleam of scarlet was shown in the sash which helped to fasten a murderous looking dagger and other correct weapons of attack to his belt He entered the hall with a swift and singularly light step and made straight for Denzil Murray Ah here you are he said speaking English with a slight foreign accent which was more agreeable to the ear than otherwise But my excellent boy what magnificence A Medici costume Never say to me that you are not vain you are as conscious of your good looks as any pretty woman Behold me how simple and unobtrusive I am He laughed and Murray sprang up from the chair where he had been despondently reclining Oh come I like that he exclaimed Simple and unobtrusive Why everybody is staring at you now as if you had dropped from the moon You cannot be Armand Gervase and simple and unobtrusive at the same time Why not demanded Gervase lightly Fame is capricious and her trumpet is not loud enough to be heard all over the world at once The venerable proprietor of the dirty bazaar where I managed to purchase these charming articles of Bedouin costume had never heard of me in his life Miserable man He does not know what he has missed Here his flashing black eyes lit suddenly on doctor Dean who was studying him in the same sort of pertinacious way in which that learned little man studied everything A friend of yours Denzil he inquired Yes responded Murray readily a very great friend doctor Maxwell Dean doctor Dean let me introduce to you Armand Gervase I need not explain him further You need not indeed said the doctor with a ceremonious bow The name is one of universal celebrity It is not always an advantage this universal celebrity replied Gervase Nor is it true that any celebrity is actually universal Perhaps the only living person that is universally known by name at least is Zola Mankind are at one in their appreciation of vice I cannot altogether agree with you there said doctor Dean slowly keeping his gaze fixed on the artist s bold proud features with singular curiosity The French Academy I presume are individually as appreciative of human weaknesses as most men but taken collectively some spirit higher and stronger than their own keeps them unanimous in their rejection of the notorious Realist who sacrifices all the canons of art and beauty to the discussion of topics unmentionable in decent society Gervase laughed idly Oh he will get in some day you may be sure he answered There is no spirit higher and stronger than the spirit of naturalism in man and in time when a few prejudices have died away and mawkish sentiment has been worn threadbare Zola will be enrolled as the first of the French Academicians with even more honors than if he had succeeded in the beginning That is the way of all those select bodies As Napoleon said Le monde vient a celui qui sait attendre The little Doctor s countenance now showed the most lively and eager interest You quite believe that Monsieur Gervase You are entirely sure of what you said just now What did I say I forget smiled Gervase lighting a cigarette and beginning to smoke it leisurely You said There is no spirit higher or stronger than the spirit of naturalism in man Are you positive on this point Why of course Most entirely positive And the great painter looked amused as he gave the reply Naturalism is Nature or the things appertaining to Nature and there is nothing higher or stronger than Nature everywhere and anywhere How about God inquired doctor Dean with a curious air as if he were propounding a remarkable conundrum God Gervase laughed loudly Pardon Are you a clergyman By no means and the Doctor gave a little bow and deprecating smile I am not in any way connected with the Church I am a doctor of laws and literature a humble student of philosophy and science generally Philosophy Science interrupted Gervase And you ask about God Parbleu Science and philosophy have progressed beyond Him Exactly and doctor Dean rubbed his hands together pleasantly That is your opinion Yes I thought so Science and philosophy to put it comprehensively have beaten poor God on His own ground Ha ha ha Very good very good And humorous as well Ha ha And a very droll appearance just then had this humble student of philosophy and science generally for he bent himself to and fro with laughter and his small eyes almost disappeared behind his shelving brows in the excess of his mirth And two crosslines formed themselves near his thin mouth such lines as are carven on the ancient Greek masks which indicate satire Denzil Murray flushed uncomfortably Gervase doesn t believe in anything but Art he said as though half apologizing for his friend Art is the sole object of his existence I don t believe he ever has time to think about anything else Of what else should I think mon ami exclaimed Gervase mirthfully Of life It is all Art to me and by Art I mean the idealization and transfiguration of Nature Oh if you do that sort of thing you are a romancist interposed doctor Dean emphatically Nature neither idealizes nor transfigures itself it is simply Nature and no more Matter uncontrolled by Spirit is anything but ideal Precisely answered Gervase quickly and with some warmth but my spirit idealizes it my imagination sees beyond it my soul grasps it Oh you have a soul exclaimed doctor Dean beginning to laugh again Now how did you find that out Gervase looked at him in a sudden surprise Every man has an inward self naturally he said We call it soul as a figure of speech it is really temperament merely Oh it is merely temperament Then you don t think it is likely to outlive you this soul to take new phases upon itself and go on existing an immortal being when your body is in a far worse condition because less carefully preserved than an Egyptian mummy Certainly not and Gervase flung away the end of his finished cigarette The immortality of the soul is quite an exploded theory It was always a ridiculous one We have quite enough to vex us in our present life and why men ever set about inventing another is more than I am able to understand It was a most foolish and barbaric superstition The gay sound of music now floated towards them from the ball room the strains of a graceful joyous half commanding half pleading waltz came rhythmically beating on the air like the measured movement of wings and Denzil Murray beginning to grow restless walked to and fro his eyes watching every figure that crossed and re crossed the hall But doctor Dean s interest in Armand Gervase remained intense and unabated and approaching him he laid two lean fingers delicately on the white folds of the Bedouin dress just where the heart of the man was hidden A foolish and barbaric superstition he echoed slowly and meditatively You do not believe in any possibility of there being a life or several lives after this present death through which we must all pass inevitably sooner or later Not in the least I leave such ideas to the ignorant and uneducated I should be unworthy of the progressive teachings of my time if I believed such arrant nonsense Death you consider finishes all There is nothing further no mysteries beyond and doctor Dean s eyes glittered as he stretched forth one thin slight hand and pointed into space with the word beyond an action which gave it a curious emphasis and for a fleeting second left a weird impression on even the careless mind of Gervase But he laughed it off lightly Nothing beyond Of course not My dear sir why ask such a question Nothing can be plainer or more positive than the fact that death as you say finishes all A woman s laugh low and exquisitely musical rippled on the air as he spoke delicious laughter rarer than song for women as a rule laugh too loudly and the sound of their merriment partakes more of the nature of a goose s cackle than any other sort of natural melody But this large soft and silvery was like a delicately subdued cadence played on a magic flute in the distance and suggested nothing but sweetness and at the sound of it Gervase started violently and turned sharply round upon his friend Murray with a look of wonderment and perplexity Who is that he demanded I have heard that pretty laugh before it must be some one I know But Denzil scarcely heard him Pale and with eyes full of yearning and passion he was watching the slow approach of a group of people in fancy dress who were all eagerly pressing round one central figure the figure of a woman clad in gleaming golden tissues and veiled in the old Egyptian fashion up to the eyes with jewels flashing about her waist bosom and hair a woman who moved glidingly as if she floated rather than walked and whose beauty half hidden as it was by the exigencies of the costume she had chosen was so unusual and brilliant that it seemed to create an atmosphere of bewilderment and rapture around her as she came She was preceded by a small Nubian boy in a costume of vivid scarlet who walking backwards humbly fanned her slowly with a tall fan of peacock s plumes made after the quaint designs of ancient Egypt The lustre radiating from the peacock s feathers the light of her golden garments her jewels and the marvellous black splendor of her eyes all flashed for a moment like sudden lightning on Gervase something he knew not what turned him giddy and blind hardly knowing what he did he sprang eagerly forward when all at once he felt the lean small hand of doctor Dean on his arm and stopped short embarrassed Pardon me said the little savant with a delicate half supercilious lifting of his eyebrows But do you know the Princess Ziska CHAPTER II Gervase stared at him still dazzled and confused Whom did you say the Princess Ziska 
6484-69649-0000	train-other-500	No I don t know her Yet stay Yes I think I have seen her somewhere in Paris possibly Will you introduce me I leave that duty to mister Denzil Murray said the Doctor
6484-69649-0001	train-other-500	folding his arms neatly behind his back He knows her better than I do
none	none	 And smiling his little grim cynical smile 
6484-69649-0002	train-other-500	he settled his academic cap more firmly on his head and strolled off towards the ballroom
none	none	 Gervase stood 
6484-69649-0003	train-other-500	irresolute his eyes fixed on that wondrous golden figure that floated before his eyes like an aerial vision Denzil Murray had gone forward to meet the Princess and was now talking to her
6484-69649-0004	train-other-500	his handsome face radiating with the admiration he made no attempt to conceal After a little pause
none	none	 Gervase moved towards him a step or two 
6484-69649-0005	train-other-500	and caught part of the conversation You look the very beau ideal of an Egyptian Princess Murray was saying Your costume is perfect She laughed Again that sweet rare laughter
none	none	 Gervase thrilled with the pulsation of it 
6484-69649-0006	train-other-500	it beat in his ears and smote his brain with a strange echo of familiarity Is it not she responded I am historically correct as your friend doctor Dean would say My ornaments are genuine
6484-69649-0007	train-other-500	they all came out of the same tomb I find one fault with your attire Princess said one of the male admirers who had entered with her part of your face is veiled That is a cruelty to us all
6484-69649-0008	train-other-500	She waived the compliment aside with a light gesture It was the fashion in ancient Egypt she said Love in those old days was not what it is now one glance one smile
6484-69649-0009	train-other-500	was sufficient to set the soul on fire and draw another soul towards it to consume together in the suddenly kindled flame And women veiled their faces in youth lest they should be deemed too prodigal of their charms
6484-69649-0010	train-other-500	and in age they covered themselves still more closely in order not to affront the Sun God s fairness by their wrinkles She smiled
none	none	 a dazzling smile that drew Gervase 
6484-69649-0011	train-other-500	yet a few steps closer unconsciously as though he were being magnetized
none	none	 But I am not bound to keep the veil always up and as she spoke she loosened it and let it fall 
6484-69649-0012	train-other-500	showing an exquisite face fair as a lily and of such perfect loveliness that the men who were gathered round her seemed to lose breath and speech at sight of it That pleases you better mister Murray
6484-69649-0013	train-other-500	Denzil grew very pale Bending down he murmured something to her in a low tone She raised her lovely brows with a little touch of surprise that was half disdain and looked at him straightly
6484-69649-0014	train-other-500	You say very pretty things but they do not always please me she observed However that is my fault no doubt And she began to move onwards her Nubian page preceding her as before
none	none	 Gervase stood in her path and confronted her as she came 
6484-69649-0015	train-other-500	Introduce me he said in a commanding tone to Denzil Denzil looked at him somewhat startled by the suppressed passion in his voice Certainly Princess permit me
6484-69649-0016	train-other-500	She paused a figure of silent grace and attention Allow me to present to you my friend
none	none	 Armand Gervase 
6484-69649-0017	train-other-500	the most famous artist in France
none	none	 Gervase 
6484-69649-0018	train-other-500	the Princess Ziska She raised her deep dark eyes and fixed them on his face and as he looked boldly at her in a kind of audacious admiration he felt again
6484-69649-0019	train-other-500	that strange dizzying shock which had before thrilled him through and through There was something strangely familiar about her the faint odors that seemed exhaled from her garments the gleam of the jewel winged scarabei on her breast
6484-69649-0020	train-other-500	the weird light of the emerald studded serpent in her hair and more much more familiar than these trifles was the sound of her voice dulcet penetrating grave and haunting in its tone
none	none	 At last we meet Monsieur Armand Gervase she said slowly 
6484-69649-0021	train-other-500	and with a graceful inclination of her head But I cannot look upon you as a stranger for I have known you so long in spirit She smiled a strange smile dazzling yet enigmatical
6484-69649-0022	train-other-500	and something wild and voluptuous seemed to stir in Gervase s pulses as he touched the small hand loaded with quaint Egyptian gems which she graciously extended towards him
6484-69649-0023	train-other-500	I think I have known you too he said Possibly in a dream a dream of beauty never realized till now His voice sank to an amorous whisper but she said nothing in reply
6484-69649-0024	train-other-500	nor could her looks be construed into any expression of either pleasure or offence Yet through the heart of young Denzil Murray went a sudden pang of jealousy and for the first time in his life
6484-69649-0025	train-other-500	he became conscious that even among men as well as women there may exist what is called the petty envy of a possible rival
none	none	 and the uneasy desire to outshine such an one in all points of appearance dress and manner His gaze rested broodingly on the tall muscular form of Gervase 
6484-69649-0026	train-other-500	and he noted the symmetry and supple grace of the man with an irritation of which he was ashamed He knew despite his own undeniably handsome personality
6484-69649-0027	train-other-500	which was set off to such advantage that night by the richness of the Florentine costume he had adopted
none	none	 that there was a certain fascination about Gervase 
6484-69649-0028	train-other-500	which was inborn a trick of manner which made him seem picturesque at all times and that even when the great French artist had stayed with him in Scotland and got himself up for the occasion in more or less baggy tweeds
6484-69649-0029	train-other-500	people were fond of remarking that the only man who ever succeeded in making tweeds look artistic
none	none	 was Armand Gervase 
6484-69649-0030	train-other-500	And in the white Bedouin garb he now wore he was seen at his best
none	none	 a certain restless passion betrayed in eyes and lips 
6484-69649-0031	train-other-500	made him look the savage part he had dressed for and as he bent his head over the Princess Ziska s hand and kissed it with an odd mingling of flippancy and reverence Denzil suddenly began to think
6484-69649-0032	train-other-500	how curiously alike they were these two Strong man and fair woman both had many physical points in common the same dark level brows the same half wild half tender eyes
6484-69649-0033	train-other-500	the same sinuous grace of form the same peculiar lightness of movement and yet both were different while resembling each other
none	none	 It was not what is called a family likeness 
6484-69649-0034	train-other-500	which existed between them it was the cast of countenance or type that exists between races or tribes
none	none	 and had young Murray not known his friend Gervase to be a French Provencal 
6484-69649-0035	train-other-500	and equally understood the Princess Ziska to be of Russian origin he would have declared them both natives of Egypt of the purest caste and highest breeding He was so struck by this idea that he might have spoken his thought aloud
none	none	 had he not heard Gervase boldly arranging dance after dance with the Princess 
6484-69649-0036	train-other-500	and apparently preparing to write no name but hers down the entire length of his ball programme a piece of audacity which had the effect of rousing Denzil to assert his own rights You promised me the first waltz Princess he said
6484-69649-0037	train-other-500	his face flushing as he spoke Quite true And you shall have it she replied smiling
none	none	 Monsieur Gervase will have the second 
6484-69649-0038	train-other-500	The music sounds very inviting shall we not go in We spoil the effect of your entree crowding about you like this said Denzil
none	none	 glancing somewhat sullenly at Gervase and the other men surrounding her and by the way you have never told us what character you represent to night some great queen of old time no doubt 
6484-69649-0039	train-other-500	No I lay no claim to sovereignty she answered I am for to night the living picture of a once famous and very improper person who bore half my name a dancer of old time
6484-69649-0040	train-other-500	known as Ziska Charmazel the favorite of the harem of a great Egyptian warrior described in forgotten histories as The Mighty Araxes She paused
6484-69649-0041	train-other-500	her admirers fascinated by the sound of her voice were all silent
none	none	 She fixed her eyes upon Gervase 
6484-69649-0042	train-other-500	and addressing him only continued Yes I am Charmazel she said She was as I tell you an improper person or would be so considered by the good English people
6484-69649-0043	train-other-500	Because you know she was never married to Araxes This explanation given with the demurest naivete
none	none	 caused a laugh among her listeners That wouldn t make her improper in France said Gervase gayly She would only seem more interesting Ah Then modern France is like old Egypt she queried still smiling And Frenchmen can be found perhaps who are like Araxes in the number of their loves and infidelities I should say my country is populated entirely with copies of him replied Gervase mirthfully 
6484-69649-0044	train-other-500	Was he a very distinguished personage He was Old legends say he was the greatest warrior of his time
none	none	 as you Monsieur Gervase 
6484-69649-0045	train-other-500	are the greatest artist
none	none	 Gervase bowed 
6484-69649-0046	train-other-500	You flatter me fair Charmazel he said then suddenly as the strange name passed his lips he recoiled as if he had been stung and seemed for a moment dazed The Princess turned her dark eyes on him inquiringly
none	none	 Something troubles you Monsieur Gervase she asked 
6484-69649-0047	train-other-500	His brows knitted in a perplexed frown Nothing the heat the air a trifle I assure you Will you not join the dancers Denzil the music calls you When your waltz with the Princess is ended
6484-69649-0048	train-other-500	I shall claim my turn For the moment au revoir He stood aside and let the little group pass him by the Princess Ziska moving with her floating noiseless grace Denzil Murray beside her
6484-69649-0049	train-other-500	the little Nubian boy waving the peacock plumes in front of them both and all the other enslaved admirers of this singularly attractive woman crowding together behind He watched the little cortege with strained
6484-69649-0050	train-other-500	dim sight till just at the dividing portal between the lounge and the ballroom the Princess turned and looked back at him with a smile Over all the intervening heads their eyes met
6484-69649-0051	train-other-500	in one flash of mutual comprehension then as the fair face vanished like a light absorbed into the lights beyond it
none	none	 Gervase left alone 
6484-69649-0052	train-other-500	dropped heavily into a chair and stared vaguely at the elaborate pattern of the thick carpet at his feet Passing his hand across his forehead he withdrew it wet with drops of perspiration What is wrong with me he muttered
6484-69649-0053	train-other-500	Am I sickening for a fever before I have been forty eight hours in Cairo What fool s notion is this in my brain Where have I seen her before In Paris saint Petersburg London Charmazel Charmazel
6484-69649-0054	train-other-500	What has the name to do with me Ziska Charmazel It is like the name of a romance or a gypsy tune Bah I must be dreaming Her face her eyes are perfectly familiar where where have I seen her
6484-69649-0055	train-other-500	and played the mad fool with her before Was she a model at one of the studios Have I seen her by chance thus in her days of poverty and does her image recall itself vividly now despite her changed surroundings
6484-69649-0056	train-other-500	I know the very perfume of her hair it seems to creep into my blood it intoxicates me it chokes me He sprang up with a fierce gesture then after a minute s pause sat down again and again stared at the floor
none	none	 The gay music from the ball room danced towards him on the air in sweet broken echoes he heard nothing and saw nothing My God he said at last under his breath Can it be possible that I love this woman CHAPTER III Within the ball room the tide of gayety was rising to its height It may be a very trivial matter yet it is certain that fancy dress gives a peculiar charm freedom and brightness to festivities of the kind and men who in the ordinary mournful black evening suit would be taciturn of speech and conventional in bearing throw off their customary reserve when they find themselves in the brilliant and becoming attire of some picturesque period when dress was an art as well as a fashion and not only do they look their best but they somehow manage to put on manner with costume and to become courteous witty and graceful to a degree that sometimes causes their own relatives to wonder at them and speculate as to why they have grown so suddenly interesting Few have read Sartor Resartus with either comprehension or profit and are therefore unaware as Teufelsdrockh was that Society is founded upon Cloth i e that man does adapt his manners very much to suit his clothes and that as the costume of the days of Louis Quinze or Louis Seize inspired graceful deportment and studied courtesy to women so does the costume of our nineteenth century inspire brusque demeanor and curt forms of speech which however sincere are not flattering to the fair sex More love making goes on at a fancy dress ball than at an ordinary one and numerous were the couples that strolled through the corridors and along the terraces of the Gezireh Palace Hotel when after the first dozen dances were ended it was discovered that one of the most glorious of full moons had risen over the turrets and minarets of Cairo illumining every visible object with as clear a lustre as that of day Then it was that warriors and nobles of mediaeval days were seen strolling with mythological goddesses and out of date peasants of Italy and Spain then audacious toreadors were perceived whispering in the ears of crowned queens and clowns were caught lingering amorously by the side of impossible flower girls of all nations Then it was that Sir Chetwynd Lyle with his paunch discreetly restrained within the limits of a Windsor uniform which had been made for him some two or three years since paced up and down complacently in the moonlight watching his two girls Muriel and Dolly doing business with certain eligibles then it was that Lady Fulkeward fearfully and wonderfully got up as the Duchess of Gainsborough sidled to and fro flirted with this man flouted that giggled shrugged her shoulders waved her fan and comported herself altogether as if she were a hoyden of seventeen just let loose from school for the holidays And then the worthy doctor Maxwell Dean somewhat exhausted by vigorous capering in the Lancers strolled forth to inhale the air fanning himself with his cap as he walked and listening keenly to every chance word or sentence he could hear whether it concerned himself or not He had peculiar theories and one of them was as he would tell you that if you overheard a remark apparently not intended for you you were to make yourself quite easy as it was a point of predestination that you should at that particular moment consciously or unconsciously play the eavesdropper The reason of it would he always averred be explained to you later on in your career The well known saying listeners never hear any good of themselves was he declared a most ridiculous aphorism You overhear persons talking and you listen Very well It may chance that you hear yourself abused What then Nothing can be so good for you as such abuse the instruction given is twofold it warns you against foes whom you have perhaps considered friends and it tones down any overweening conceit you may have had concerning your own importance or ability Listen to everything if you are wise I always do I am an old and practised listener And I have never listened in vain All the information I have gained through listening though apparently at first disconnected and unclassified has fitted into my work like the stray pieces of a puzzle and has proved eminently useful Wherever I am I always keep my ears well open With such views as he thus entertained life was always enormously interesting to doctor Dean he found nothing tiresome not even the conversation of the type known as Noodle The Noodle was as curious a specimen of nature to him as the emu or the crocodile And as he turned up his intellectual little physiognomy to the deep warm Egyptian sky and inhaled the air sniffingly as though it were a monster scent bottle just uncorked for his special gratification he smiled as he observed Muriel Chetwynd Lyle standing entirely alone at the end of the terrace attired as a Boulogne fish wife and looking daggers after the hastily retreating figure of a White Hussar no other than Ross Courtney How extremely droll a Boulogne fish wife looks in Egypt commented the Doctor to his inward self Remarkable The incongruity is peculiarly typical of the Chetwynd Lyles The costume of the young woman is like the knighthood of her father droll droll very droll Aloud he said Why are you not dancing Miss Muriel Oh I don t know I m tired she said petulantly Besides all the men are after that Ziska woman they seem to have lost their heads about her Ah and doctor Dean rubbed his hands Yes possibly Well she is certainly very beautiful I cannot see it and Muriel Chetwynd Lyle flushed with the inward rage which could not be spoken It s the way she dresses more than her looks Nobody knows who she is but they do not seem to care about that They are all raving like lunatics over her and that man that artist who arrived here to day Armand Gervase seems the maddest of the lot Haven t you noticed how often he has danced with her I couldn t help noticing that said the Doctor emphatically for I have never seen anything more exquisite than the way they waltz together Physically they seem made for one another Muriel laughed disdainfully You had better tell mister Denzil Murray that he is in a bad enough humor now and that remark of yours wouldn t improve it I can tell you She broke off abruptly as a slim fair girl dressed as a Greek vestal in white with a chaplet of silver myrtle leaves round her hair suddenly approached and touched doctor Dean on the arm Can I speak to you a moment she asked My dear Miss Murray Of course and the Doctor turned to her at once What is it She paced with him a few steps in silence while Muriel Chetwynd Lyle moved languidly away from the terrace and re entered the ball room What is it repeated doctor Dean You seem distressed come tell me all about it Helen Murray lifted her eyes the soft violet gray eyes that Lord Fulkeward had said he admired suffused with tears and fixed them on the old man s face I wish she said I wish we had never come to Egypt I feel as if some great misfortune were going to happen to us I do indeed Oh doctor Dean have you watched my brother this evening I have he replied and then was silent And what do you think she asked anxiously How can you account for his strangeness his roughness even to me And the tears brimmed over and fell despite her efforts to restrain them doctor Dean stopped in his walk and took her two hands in his own My dear Helen it s no use worrying yourself like this he said Nothing can stop the progress of the Inevitable I have watched Denzil I have watched the new arrival Armand Gervase I have watched the mysterious Ziska and I have watched you Well what is the result The Inevitable simply the unconquerable Inevitable Denzil is in love Gervase is in love everybody is in love except me and one other It is a whole network of mischief and I am the unhappy fly that has unconsciously fallen into the very middle of it But the spider my dear the spider who wove the web in the first instance is the Princess Ziska and she is NOT in love She is the other one She is not in love with anybody any more than I am She s got something else on her mind I don t know what it is exactly but it isn t love Excluding her and myself the whole hotel is in love YOU are in love Helen withdrew her hands from his grasp and a deep flush reddened her fair face I she stammered doctor Dean you are mistaken doctor Dean was never mistaken on love matters in his life said that self satisfied sage complacently Now my dear don t be offended I have known both you and your brother ever since you were left little orphan children together if I cannot speak plainly to you who can You are in love little Helen and very unwisely too with the man Gervase I have heard of him often but I never saw him before to night And I don t approve of him Helen grew as pale as she had been rosy and her face as the moonlight fell upon it was very sorrowful He stayed with us in Scotland two summers ago she said softly He was very agreeable Ha No doubt He made a sort of love to you then I suppose I can imagine him doing it very well There is a nice romantic glen near your house just where the river runs and where I caught a fifteen pound salmon some five years ago Ha Catching salmon is healthy work much better than falling in love No no Helen Gervase is not good enough for you you want a far better man Has he spoken to you to night Oh yes And he has danced with me Ha How often Once And how many times with the Princess Ziska Helen s fair head drooped and she answered nothing All at once the little Doctor s hand closed on her arm with a soft yet firm grip Look he whispered She raised her eyes and saw two figures step out on the terrace and stand in the full moonlight the white Bedouin dress of the one and the glittering golden robe of the other made them easily recognizable they were Gervase and the Princess Ziska Helen gave a faint quick sigh Let us go in she said Nonsense Why should we go in On the contrary let us join them Oh no and Helen shrank visibly at the very idea I cannot do not ask me I have tried you know I have tried to like the Princess but something in her I don t know what it is repels me To speak truthfully I think I am afraid of her Afraid Pooh Why should you be afraid It is true one doesn t often see a woman with the eyes of a vampire bat but there is nothing to be frightened about I have dissected the eyes of a vampire bat very interesting work very The Princess has them only of course hers are larger and finer but there is exactly the same expression in them I am fond of study you know I am studying her What Are you determined to run away I am engaged for this dance to mister Courtney said Helen nervously Well well We ll resume our conversation another time and doctor Dean took her hand and patted it pleasantly Don t fret yourself about Denzil he ll be all right And take my advice don t marry a Bedouin chief marry an honest straightforward tender hearted Englishman who ll take care of you not a nondescript savage who ll desert you And with a humorous and kindly smile doctor Dean moved off to join the two motionless and picturesque figures that stood side by side looking at the moon while Helen like a frightened bird suddenly released fled precipitately back to the ball room where Ross Courtney was already searching for her as his partner in the next waltz Upon my word mused the Doctor this is a very pretty kettle of fish The Gezireh Palace Hotel is not a hotel at all it seems to me it is a lunatic asylum What with Lady Fulkeward getting herself up as twenty at the age of sixty and Muriel and Dolly Chetwynd Lyle man hunting with more ferocity than sportsmen hunt tigers Helen in love Denzil in love Gervase in love dear me dear me What a list of subjects for a student s consideration And the Princess Ziska He broke off his meditations abruptly vaguely impressed by the strange solemnity of the night An equal solemnity seemed to surround the two figures to which he now drew nigh and as the Princess Ziska turned her eyes upon him as he came he was to his own vexation aware that something indefinable disturbed his usual equanimity and gave him an unpleasant thrill You are enjoying a moonlight stroll Doctor she inquired Her veil was now cast aside in a careless fold of soft drapery over her shoulders and her face in its ethereal delicacy of feature and brilliant coloring looked almost too beautiful to be human doctor Dean did not reply for a moment he was thinking what a singular resemblance there was between Armand Gervase and one of the figures on a certain Egyptian fresco in the British Museum Enjoying er er a what a moonlight stroll Exactly er yes Pardon me Princess my mind often wanders and I am afraid I am getting a little deaf as well Yes I find the night singularly conducive to meditation one cannot be in a land like this under a sky like this and he pointed to the shining heaven without recalling the great histories of the past I daresay they were very much like the histories of the present said Gervase smiling I should doubt that History is what man makes it and the character of man in the early days of civilization was I think more forceful more earnest more strong of purpose more bent on great achievements The principal achievement and glory being to kill as many of one s fellow creatures as possible laughed Gervase Like the famous warrior Araxes of whom the Princess has just been telling me Araxes was great but now Araxes is a forgotten hero said the Princess slowly each accent of her dulcet voice chiming on the ear like the stroke of a small silver bell None of the modern discoverers know anything about him yet They have not even found his tomb but he was buried in the Pyramids with all the honors of a king No doubt your clever men will excavate him some day I think the Pyramids have been very thoroughly explored said doctor Dean Nothing of any importance remains in them now The Princess arched her lovely eyebrows No Ah I daresay you know them better than I do and she laughed a laugh which was not mirthful so much as scornful I am very much interested in Araxes said Gervase then partly I suppose because he is as yet in the happy condition of being an interred mummy Nobody has dug him up unwound his cerements or photographed him and his ornaments have not been stolen And in the second place I am interested in him because it appears he was in love with the famous dancer of his day whom the Princess represents to night Charmazel I wish I had heard the story before I came to Cairo I would have got myself up as Araxes in person to night In order to play the lover of Charmazel queried the Doctor Exactly replied Gervase with flashing eyes I daresay I could have acted the part I should imagine you could act any part replied the Doctor blandly The role of love making comes easily to most men The Princess looked at him as he spoke and smiled The jewelled scarab set as a brooch on her bosom flashed luridly in the moon and in her black eyes there was a similar lurid gleam Come and talk to me she said laying her hand on his arm I am tired and the conversation of one s ball room partners is very banal Monsieur Gervase would like me to dance all night I imagine but I am too lazy I leave such energy to Lady Fulkeward and to all the English misses and madams I love indolence Most Russian women do I think observed the Doctor She laughed But I am not Russian I know I never thought you were he returned composedly but everyone in the hotel has come to the conclusion that you are They are all wrong What can I do to put them right she inquired with a fascinating little upward movement of her eyebrows Nothing Leave them in their ignorance I shall not enlighten them though I know your nationality You do and a curious shadow darkened her features But perhaps you are wrong also I think not said the Doctor with gentle obstinacy You are an Egyptian Born in Egypt born OF Egypt Pure Eastern There is nothing Western about you Is not it so She looked at him enigmatically You have made a near guess she replied but you are not absolutely correct Originally I am of Egypt doctor Dean nodded pleasantly Originally yes That is precisely what I mean originally Let me take you in to supper He offered his arm but Gervase made a hasty step forward Princess he began She waved him off lightly My dear Monsieur Gervase we are not in the desert where Bedouin chiefs do just as they like We are in a modern hotel in Cairo and all the good English mammas will be dreadfully shocked if I am seen too much with you I have danced with you five times remember And I will dance with you once more before I leave When our waltz begins come and find me in the upper room She moved away on doctor Dean s arm and Gervase moodily drew back and let her pass When she had gone he lit a cigarette and walked impatiently up and down the terrace a heavy frown wrinkling his brows The shadow of a man suddenly darkened the moonlight in front of him and Denzil Murray s hand fell on his shoulder Gervase he said huskily I must speak to you Gervase glanced him up and down taking note of his pale face and wild eyes with a certain good humored regret and compassion Say on my friend Denzil looked straight at him biting his lips hard and clenching his hands in the effort to keep down some evidently violent emotion The Princess Ziska he began Gervase smiled and flicked the ash off his cigarette The Princess Ziska he echoed Yes What of her She seems to be the only person talked about in Cairo Everybody in this hotel at any rate begins conversation with precisely the same words as you do the Princess Ziska Upon my life it is very amusing It is not amusing to me said Denzil bitterly To me it is a matter of life and death He paused and Gervase looked at him curiously We ve always been such good friends Gervase he continued that I should be sorry if anything came between us now so I think it is better to make a clean breast of it and speak out plainly Again he hesitated his face growing still paler then with a sudden ardent light glowing in his eyes he said Gervase I love the Princess Ziska Gervase threw away his cigarette and laughed aloud with a wild hilarity My good boy I am very sorry for you Sorry too for myself I deplore the position in which we are placed with all my heart and soul It is unfortunate but it seems inevitable You love the Princess Ziska and by all the gods of Egypt and Christendom so do I CHAPTER IV Denzil recoiled a step backward then with an impulsive movement strode close up to him his face unnaturally flushed and his eyes glittering with an evil fire You you love her What in one short hour you who have often boasted to me of having no heart no eyes for women except as models for your canvas you say now that you love a woman whom you have never seen before to night Stop returned Gervase somewhat moodily I am not so sure about that I HAVE seen her before though where I cannot tell But the fire that stirs my pulses now seems to spring from some old passion suddenly revived and the eyes of the woman we are both mad for well they do not inspire holiness my dear friend No neither in you nor in me Let us be honest with each other There is something vile in the composition of Madame la Princesse and it responds to something equally vile in ourselves We shall be dragged down by the force of it tant pis pour nous I am sorrier for you than for myself for you are a good fellow au fond you have what the world is learning to despise sentiment I have none for as I told you before I have no heart but I have passions tigerish ones which must be humored in fact I make it my business in life to humor them Do you intend to humor them in this instance Assuredly If I can Then friend as you have been you can be friend no more said Denzil fiercely My God Do you not understand My blood is as warm as yours I will not yield to you one smile one look from Ziska No I will kill you first Gervase looked at him calmly Will you Pauvre garcon You are such a boy still Denzil by the bye how old are you Ah I remember now twenty two Only twenty two and I am thirty eight So in the measure of time alone your life is more valuable to you than mine is to me If you choose therefore you can kill me now if you like I have a very convenient dagger in my belt I think it has a point which you are welcome to use for the purpose but for heaven s sake don t rant about it do it You can kill me of course you can but you cannot mark this well Denzil you cannot prevent my loving the same woman whom you love I think instead of raving about the matter here in the moonlight which has the effect of making us look like two orthodox villains in a set stage scene we d better make the best of it and resolve to abide by the lady s choice in the matter What say you You have known her for many days I have known her for two hours You have had the first innings so you cannot complain Here he playfully unfastened the Bedouin knife which hung at his belt and offered it to Denzil holding it delicately by the glittering blade One thrust my brave boy he said And you will stop the Ziska fever in my veins at once and forever But unless you deal the murderer s blow the fever will go on increasing till it reaches its extremest height and then And then echoed Denzil Then Oh God only knows what then Denzil thrust away the offered weapon with a movement of aversion You can jest he said You are always jesting But you do not know you cannot read the horrible thoughts in my mind I cannot resolve their meaning even to myself There is some truth in your light words I feel I know instinctively that the woman I love has an attraction about her which is not good but evil yet what does that matter Do not men sometimes love vile women Always replied Gervase briefly Gervase I have suffered tortures ever since I saw her face exclaimed the unhappy lad his self control suddenly giving way You cannot imagine what my life has been Her eyes make me mad the merest touch of her hand seems to drag me away invisibly To perdition finished Gervase That is the usual end of the journey we men take with beautiful women And now went on Denzil hardly heeding him as if my own despair were not sufficient you must needs add to it What evil fate I wonder sent you to Cairo Of course I have no chance with her now you are sure to win the day And can you wonder then that I feel as if I could kill you Oh I wonder at nothing said Gervase calmly except perhaps at myself And I echo your words most feelingly What evil fate sent me to Cairo I cannot tell But here I purpose to remain My dear Murray don t let us quarrel if we can help it it is such a waste of time I am not angry with you for loving la belle Ziska try therefore not to be angry with me Let the fair one herself decide as to our merits My own opinion is that she cares for neither of us and moreover that she never will care for any one except her fascinating self And certainly her charms are quite enough to engross her whole attention By the way let me ask you Denzil in this headstrong passion of yours for it is a headstrong passion just as mine is do you actually intend to make the Ziska your wife if she will have you Of course replied Murray with some haughtiness A fleeting expression of amusement flitted over Gervase s features It is very honorable of you he said very My dear boy you shall have your full chance Because I I would not make the Princess Madame Gervase for all the world She is not formed for a life of domesticity and pardon me I cannot picture her as the contented chatelaine of your grand old Scotch castle in Ross shire Why not From an artistic point of view the idea is incongruous said Gervase lazily Nevertheless I will not interfere with your wooing Denzil s face brightened You will not I will not I promise But and here Gervase paused looking his young friend full in the eyes remember if your chance falls to the ground if Madame gives you your conge if she does not consent to be a Scottish chatelaine and listen every day to the bagpipes at dinner you cannot expect me then to be indifferent to my own desires She shall not be Madame Gervase oh no She shall not be asked to attend to the pot au feu she shall act the role for which she has dressed to night she shall be another Charmazel to another Araxes though the wild days of Egypt are no more A sudden shiver ran through him as he spoke and instinctively he drew the white folds of his picturesque garb closer about him There is a chill wind sweeping in from the desert he said an evil sandy breath tasting of mummy dust blown through the crevices of the tombs of kings Let us go in Murray looked at him in a kind of dull despair And what is to be done he asked I cannot answer for myself and from what you say neither can you My dear friend or foe whichever you determine to be I can answer for myself in one particular at any rate namely that as I told you I shall not ask the Princess to marry me You on the contrary will do so Bonne chance I shall do nothing to prevent Madame from accepting the honorable position you intend to offer her And till the fiat has gone forth and the fair one has decided we will not fly at each other s throats like wolves disputing possession of a lamb we will assume composure even if we have it not He paused and laid one hand kindly on the younger man s shoulder Is it agreed Denzil gave a mute sign of resigned acquiescence Good I like you Denzil you are a charming boy Hot tempered and a trifle melodramatic in your loves and hatreds yes for that you might have been a Provencal instead of a Scot Before I knew you I had a vague idea that all Scotchmen were or needs must be ridiculous I don t know why I associated them with bagpipes short petticoats and whisky I had no idea of the type you so well represent the dark fine eyes the strong physique and the impetuous disposition which suggests the South rather than the North and to night you look so unlike the accepted cafe chantant picture of the ever dancing Highlander that you might in very truth be a Florentine in more points than the dress which so well becomes you Yes I like you and more than you I like your sister That is why I don t want to quarrel with you I wouldn t grieve Mademoiselle Helen for the world Murray gave him a quick half angry side glance You are a strange fellow Gervase Two summers ago you were almost in love with Helen Gervase sighed True Almost That s just it Almost is a very uncomfortable word I have been almost in love so many times I have never been drawn by a woman s eyes and dragged down down in a mad whirlpool of sweetness and poison intermixed I have never had my soul strangled by the coils of a woman s hair black hair black as night in the perfumed meshes of which a jewelled serpent gleams I have never felt the insidious horror of a love like strong drink mounting through the blood to the brain and there making inextricable confusion of time space eternity everything except the passion itself never never have I felt all this Denzil till to night To night Bah It is a wild night of dancing and folly and the Princess Ziska is to blame for it all Don t look so tragic my good Denzil what ails you now What ails me Good Heavens Can you ask it and Murray gave a gesture of mingled despair and impatience If you love her in this wild uncontrolled way It is the only way I know of said Gervase Love must be wild and uncontrolled to save it from banalite It must be a summer thunderstorm the heavy brooding of the clouds of thought the lightning of desire then the crash the downpour and the end in which the bland sun smiles upon a bland world of dull but wholesome routine and tame conventionality making believe that there never was such a thing known as the past storm Be consoled Denzil and trust me you shall have time to make your honorable proposal and Madame had better accept you for your love would last mine could not He spoke with a strange fierceness and irritability and his eyes were darkened by a sudden shadow of melancholy Denzil bewildered at his words and manner stared at him in a kind of helpless indignation Then you admit yourself to be cruel and unprincipled he said Gervase smiled with a little shrug of impatience Do I I was not aware of it Is inconstancy to women cruelty and want of principle If so all men must bear the brunt of the accusation with me For men were originally barbarians and always looked upon women as toys or slaves the barbaric taint is not out of us yet I assure you at any rate it is not out of me I am a pure savage I consider the love of woman as my right if I win it I enjoy it as long as I please but no longer and not all the forces of heaven and earth should bind me to any woman I had once grown weary of If that is your character said Murray stiffly it were well the Princess Ziska should know it True and Gervase laughed loudly Tell her man ami Tell her that Armand Gervase is an unprincipled villain not worth a glance from her dazzling eyes It will be the way to make her adore me My good boy do you not know that there is something very marvellous in the attraction we call love It is a pre ordained destiny and if one soul is so constituted that it must meet and mix with another nothing can hinder the operation So that believe me I am quite indifferent as to what you say of me to Madame la Princesse or to anyone else It will not be for either my looks or my character that she will love me if indeed she ever does love me it will be for something indistinct indefinable but resistless in us both which no one on earth can explain And now I must go Denzil and claim the fair one for this waltz Try and look less miserable my dear fellow I will not quarrel with you on the Princess s account nor on any other pretext if I can help it for I don t want to kill you and I am convinced your death and not mine would be the result of a fight between us His eyes flashed under his straight fierce brows with a sudden touch of imperiousness and his commanding presence became magnetic almost over powering Tormented with a dozen cross currents of feeling young Denzil Murray was mute only his breath came and went quickly and there was a certain silently declared antagonism in his very attitude Gervase saw it and smiled then turning away with his peculiarly noiseless step and grace of bearing he disappeared CHAPTER V Ten minutes later the larger number of dancers in the ball room came to a sudden pause in their gyrations and stood looking on in open mouthed reluctantly admiring wonderment at the exquisite waltz movements of the Princess Ziska as she floated past them in the arms of Gervase who as a Bedouin chief was perhaps only acting his part aright when he held her to him with so passionate and close a grip and gazed down upon her fair face with such a burning ardor in his eyes Nothing in the dancing world was ever seen like the dancing of these two nothing so languorously beautiful as the swaying grace of their well matched figures gliding to the music in as perfectly harmonious a measure as a bird s two wings beat to the pulsations of the air People noticed that as the Princess danced a tiny tinkling sound accompanied her every step and the more curious observers peeping downwards as she flew by saw that she had kept to the details of ancient Egyptian costume so exactly that she even wore sandals and that her feet perfectly shaped and lovely as perfectly shaped and lovely hands were bare save for the sandal ribbons which crossed them and which were fastened with jewels Round the slim ankles were light bands of gold also glittering with gems and furthermore adorned by little golden bells which produced the pretty tinkling music that attracted attention What a delightful creature she is said Lady Fulkeward settling her Duchess of Gainsborough hat on her powdered wig more becomingly and smiling up in the face of Ross Courtney who happened to be standing close by So sweetly unconventional Everybody here thinks her improper she may be but I like her I m not a bit of a prude Courtney smiled irreverently at this Prudery and old Lady Fulkeward were indeed wide apart Aloud he said I think whenever a woman is exceptionally beautiful she generally gets reported as improper by her own sex especially if she has a fascinating manner and dresses well So true and Lady Fulkeward simpered Exactly what I find wherever I go Poor dear Ziska She has to pay the penalty for captivating all you men in the way she does I m sure YOU have lost your heart to her quite as much as anybody else haven t you Courtney reddened I don t think so he answered I admire her very much but I haven t lost my heart Naughty boy Don t prevaricate and Lady Fulkeward smiled in the bewitching pearly manner her admirably made artificial teeth allowed her to do Every man in the hotel is in love with the Princess and I m sure I don t blame them If I belonged to your sex I should be in love with her too As it is I am in love with the new arrival that glorious creature Gervase He is superb He looks like an untamed savage I adore handsome barbarians He s scarcely a barbarian I think said Courtney with some amusement he is the great French artist the lion of Paris just now only secondary to Sarah Bernhardt Artists are always barbarians declared Lady Fulkeward enthusiastically They paint naughty people without any clothes on they never have any idea of time they never keep their appointments and they are always falling in love with the wrong person and getting into trouble which is so nice of them That s why I worship them all They are so refreshingly unlike OUR set Courtney raised his eyebrows inquiringly You know what I mean by our set went on the vivacious old Gainsborough the aristocrats whose conversation is limited to the weather and scandal and who are so frightfully dull Dull My dear Ross you know how dull they are Well upon my word they are admitted Courtney You are right there I certainly agree with you I m sure you do They have no ideas Now artists have ideas they live on ideas and sentiment Sentiment is such a beautiful thing so charming I believe that fierce looking Gervase is a creature of sentiment and how delightful that is Of course he ll paint the Princess Ziska he MUST paint her no one else could do it so well By the way have you been asked to her great party next week Yes And are you going Most assuredly So am I That absurd Chetwynd Lyle woman came to me this evening and asked me if I really thought it would be proper to take her girls there and Lady Fulkeward laughed shrilly Girls indeed I should say those two long ugly women could go anywhere with safety Do you consider the Princess a proper woman she asked and I said Certainly as proper as you are Courtney laughed outright and began to think there was some fun in Lady Fulkeward By Jove Did you tell her that I should think I did Oh I know a thing or two about the Chetwynd Lyles but I keep my mouth shut till it suits me to open it I said I was going and then of course she said she would Naturally And Courtney gave the answer vaguely for the waltz was ended and the Princess Ziska on the arm of Gervase was leaving the ball room She s going exclaimed Lady Fulkeward Dear creature Excuse me I must speak to her for a moment And with a swish of her full skirts and a toss of her huge hat and feathers the lively flirt of sixty tripped off with all the agility of sixteen leaving Courtney to follow her or remain where he was just as he chose He hesitated and during that undecided pause was joined by doctor Maxwell Dean A very brilliant and interesting evening said that individual smiling complacently I don t remember any time when I have enjoyed myself so thoroughly Really I shouldn t have thought you a man to care for fancy dress balls said Courtney Shouldn t you Ha Well some fancy dress balls I might not care for but this one has been highly productive of entertainment in every way and several incidents connected with it have opened up to me a new vista of research the possibilities of which are er very interesting and remarkable Indeed murmured Courtney indifferently his eyes fixed on the slim supple figure of the Princess Ziska as she slowly moved amid her circle of admirers out of the ball room her golden skirts gleaming sun like against the polished floor and the jewels about her flashing in vivid points of light from the hem of her robe to the snake in her hair Yes continued the Doctor smiling and rubbing his hands I think I have got the clue to a very interesting problem But I see you are absorbed and no wonder A charming woman the Princess Ziska charming Do you believe in ghosts This question was put with such unexpected abruptness that Courtney was quite taken aback Ghosts he echoed No I cannot say I do I have never seen one and I have never heard of one that did not turn out a bogus Oh I don t mean the usual sort of ghost said the Doctor drawing his shelving brows together in a meditative knot of criss cross lines over his small speculative eyes The ghost that is common to Scotch castles and English manor houses and that appears in an orthodox night gown sighs screams rattles chains and bangs doors ad libitum No no That kind of ghost is composed of indigestion aided by rats and a gust of wind No when I say ghosts I mean ghosts ghosts that do not need the midnight hour to evolve themselves into being and that by no means vanish at cock crow My ghosts are those that move about among us in social intercourse for days months sometimes years according to their several missions ghosts that talk to us imitate our customs and ways shake hands with us laugh and dance with us and altogether comport themselves like human beings Those are my kind of ghosts scientific ghosts There are hundreds aye perhaps thousands of them in the world at this very moment An uncomfortable shudder ran through Courtney s veins the Doctor s manner seemed peculiar and uncanny By Jove I hope not he involuntarily exclaimed The orthodox ghost is an infinitely better arrangement One at least knows what to expect But a scientific ghost that moves about in society resembling ourselves in every respect appearing to be actually human and yet having no humanity at all in its composition is a terrific notion indeed You don t mean to say you believe in the possibility of such an appalling creature I not only believe it answered the Doctor composedly I know it Here the band crashed out God save the Queen which as a witty Italian once remarked is the De Profundis of every English festivity But God bless my soul began Courtney No don t say that urged the Doctor Say God save the Queen It s more British Bother God save the Queen exclaimed Courtney impatiently Look here you don t mean it seriously do you I always mean everything seriously said doctor Dean even my jokes Now come no nonsense Doctor and Courtney taking his arm led him towards one of the windows opening out to the moonlit garden can you as an honest man assure me in sober earnest that there are scientific ghosts of the nature you describe The little Doctor surveyed the scenery glanced up at the moon and then at his companion s pleasant but not very intelligent face I would rather not discuss the matter he said at last with some brusqueness There are certain subjects connected with psychic phenomena on which it is best to be silent besides what interest can such things have for you You are a sportsman keep to your big game and leave ghost hunting to me That is not a fair answer to my question said Courtney I m sure I don t want to interfere with your researches in any way I only want to know if it is a fact that ghosts exist and that they are really of such a nature as to deserve the term scientific doctor Dean was silent a moment Then stretching out his small thin hand he pointed to the clear sky where the stars were almost lost to sight in the brilliance of the moon Look out there he said his voice thrilling with sudden and solemn fervor There in the limitless ether move millions of universes vast creations which our finite brains cannot estimate without reeling enormous forces always at work in the mighty movements of which our earth is nothing more than a grain of sand Yet far more marvellous than their size or number is the mathematical exactitude of their proportions the minute perfection of their balance the exquisite precision with which every one part is fitted to another part not a pin s point awry not a hair s breadth astray Well the same exactitude which rules the formation and working of Matter controls the formation and working of Spirit and this is why I know that ghosts exist and moreover that we are COMPELLED by the laws of the phenomena surrounding us to meet them every day I confess I do not follow you at all said Courtney bewildered No and doctor Dean smiled curiously I have perhaps expressed myself obscurely Yet I am generally considered a clear exponent First of all let me ask you do you believe in the existence of Matter Why of course You do Then you will no doubt admit that there is Something an Intelligent Principle or Spiritual Force which creates and controls this Matter Courtney hesitated Well I suppose there must be he said at last I m not a church goer and I m rather a free thinker but I certainly believe there is a Mind at work behind the Matter That being the case proceeded the Doctor I suppose you will not deny to this Invisible Mind the same exactitude of proportion and precise method of action already granted to Visible Matter Of course I could not deny such a reasonable proposition said Courtney Very good Pursuing the argument logically and allowing for an exactly moving Mind behind exactly working Matter it follows that there can be no such thing as injustice anywhere in the universe My dear Socrates redivivus laughed Courtney I fail to see what all this has to do with ghosts It has everything to do with them declared the Doctor emphatically I repeat that if we grant these already stated premises concerning the composition of Mind and Matter there can be no such thing as injustice Yet seemingly unjust things are done every day and seemingly go unpunished I say seemingly advisedly because the punishment is always administered And here the scientific ghosts come in Vengeance is mine saith the Lord and the ghosts I speak of are the Lord s way of doing it You mean began Courtney I mean continued the Doctor with some excitement that the sinner who imagines his sins are undiscovered is a fool who deceives himself I mean that the murderer who has secretly torn the life out of his shrieking victim in some unfrequented spot and has succeeded in hiding his crime from what we call justice cannot escape the Spiritual law of vengeance What would you say and doctor Dean laid his thin fingers on Courtney s coat sleeve with a light pressure if I told you that the soul of a murdered creature is often sent back to earth in human shape to dog its murderer down And that many a criminal undiscovered by the police is haunted by a seeming Person a man or a woman who is on terms of intimacy with him who eats at his table drinks his wine clasps his hand smiles in his face and yet is truly nothing but the ghost of his victim in human disguise sent to drag him gradually to his well deserved miserable end what would you say to such a thing Horrible exclaimed Courtney recoiling Beyond everything monstrous and horrible The Doctor smiled and withdrew his hand from his companion s arm There are a great many horrible things in the universe as well as pleasant ones he observed dryly Crime and its results are always of a disagreeable nature But we cannot alter the psychic law of equity any more than we can alter the material law of gravitation It is growing late I think if you will excuse me I will go to bed Courtney look at him puzzled and baffled Then your scientific ghosts are positive realities he began here he gave a violent start as a tall white figure suddenly moved out of the shadows in the garden and came slowly towards them Upon my life Doctor you have made me quite nervous No no surely not smiled the Doctor pleasantly not nervous Not such a brave killer of game as you are No no You don t take Monsieur Armand Gervase for a ghost do you He is too substantial far too substantial Ha ha ha And he laughed quietly the wrinkled smile still remaining on his face as Gervase approached Everybody is going to bed said the great artist lazily With the departure of the Princess Ziska the pleasures of the evening are ended She is certainly the belle of Cairo this season said Courtney but I tell you what I am rather sorry to see young Murray has lost his head about her Parbleu So am I said Gervase imperturbably it seems a pity He will get over it interposed doctor Dean placidly It s an illness like typhoid we must do all we can to keep down the temperature of the patient and we shall pull him through Keep him cool in short laughed Gervase Exactly The little Doctor smiled shrewdly You look feverish Monsieur Gervase Gervase flushed red under his dark skin I daresay I am feverish he replied irritably I find this place hot as an oven I think I should go away to morrow if I had not asked the Princess Ziska to sit to me You are going to paint her picture exclaimed Courtney By Jove I congratulate you It will be the masterpiece of the next salon Gervase bowed You flatter me The Princess is undoubtedly an attractive subject But as I said before this place stifles me I think the hotel is too near the river there is an oozy smell from the Nile that I hate and the heat is perfectly sulphureous Don t you find it so Doctor N n o I cannot say that I do Let me feel your pulse I am not a medical man but I can easily recognize any premonitions of illness Gervase held out his long brown well shaped hand and the savant s small cool fingers pressed lightly on his wrist You are quite well Monsieur Gervase he said after a pause You have a little sur excitation of the nerves certainly but it is not curable by medicine He dropped the hand he held and looked up Good night Good night responded Gervase Good night added Courtney And with an amiable salutation the Doctor went his way The ball room was now quite deserted and the hotel servants were extinguishing the lights A curious little man that Doctor observed Gervase addressing Courtney to whom as yet he had not been formally introduced Very curious was the reply I have known him for some years he is a very clever man but I have never been able quite to make him out I think he is a bit eccentric He s just been telling me he believes in ghosts Ah poor fellow and Gervase yawned as with his companion he crossed the deserted ball room Then he has what you call a screw loose I suppose it is that which makes him interesting Good night Good night And separating they went their several ways to the small cell like bedrooms which are the prime discomfort of the Gezireh Palace Hotel and soon a great silence reigned throughout the building All Cairo slept save where at an open lattice window the moon shone full on a face up turned to her silver radiance the white watchful face and dark sleepless eyes of the Princess Ziska CHAPTER VI Next day the ordinary course of things was resumed at the Gezireh Palace Hotel and the delights and flirtations of the fancy ball began to vanish into what Hans Breitmann calls the ewigkeit Men were lazier than usual and came down later to breakfast and girls looked worn and haggard with over much dancing but otherwise there was no sign to indicate that the festivity of the past evening had left tracks behind or made a lasting impression of importance on any human life Lady Chetwynd Lyle portly and pig faced sat on the terrace working at an elaborate piece of cross stitch talking scandal in the civilest tone imaginable and damning all her dear friends with that peculiar air of entire politeness and good breeding which distinguishes certain ladies when they are saying nasty things about one another Her daughters Muriel and Dolly sat dutifully near her one reading the Daily Dial as befitted the offspring of the editor and proprietor thereof the other knitting Lord Fulkeward lounged on the balustrade close by and his lovely mother attired in quite a charming and girlish costume of white foulard exquisitely cut and fitting into a waist not measuring more than twenty two inches reclined in a long deck chair looking the very pink of painted and powdered perfection You are so very lenient Lady Chetwynd Lyle was saying as she bent over her needlework So very lenient my dear Lady Fulkeward that I am afraid you do not read people s characters as correctly as I do I have had owing to my husband s position in journalism a great deal of social experience and I assure you I do NOT think the Princess Ziska a safe person She may be perfectly proper she MAY be but she is not the style we are accustomed to in London I should rather think not interrupted Lord Fulkeward hastily By Jove She wouldn t have a hair left on her head in London don cher know What do you mean inquired Muriel Chetwynd Lyle simpering You really do say such funny things Lord Fulkeward Do I and the young nobleman was so alarmed and embarrassed at the very idea of his ever saying funny things that he was rendered quite speechless for a moment Anon he took heart and resumed Er well I mean that the society women would tear her to bits in no time She d get asked nowhere but she d get blackguarded everywhere she couldn t help herself with that face and those eyes His mother laughed Dear Fulke You are such a naughty boy You shouldn t make such remarks before Lady Lyle She never says anything against anyone Dear Fulke stared Had he given vent to his feelings he would have exclaimed Oh Lord isn t the old lady a deep one But as it was he attended to his young moustache anxiously and remained silent Lady Chetwynd Lyle meanwhile flushed with annoyance she felt that Lady Fulkeward s remark was sarcastic but she could not very well resent it seeing that Lady Fulkeward was a peeress of the realm and that she herself by the strict laws of heraldry was truly only Dame Chetwynd Lyle as wife of an ordinary knight and had no business to be called her ladyship at all I should indeed be sorry she said primly if I were mistaken in my private estimate of the Princess Ziska s character but I must believe my own eyes and the evidence of my own senses and surely no one can condone the extremely fast way in which she behaved with that new man that French artist Armand Gervase last night Why she danced six times with him And she actually allowed him to walk home with her through the streets of Cairo They went off together in their fancy dresses just as they were I never heard of such a thing Oh there was nothing remarkable at all in that said Lord Fulkeward Everybody went about the place in fancy costume last night I went out in my Neapolitan dress with a girl and I met Denzil Murray coming down a street just behind here took him for a Florentine prince upon my word And I bet you Gervase never got beyond the door of the Princess s palace for that blessed old Nubian she keeps the chap with a face like a mummy bangs the gate in everybody s face and says in guttural French La Princesse ne voit per r r sonne I ve tried it I tell you it s no go Well we shall all get inside the mysterious palace next Wednesday evening said Lady Fulkeward closing her eyes with a graceful air of languor It will be charming I am sure and I daresay we shall find that there is no mystery at all about it Two months ago suddenly said a smooth voice behind them the Ziska s house or palace was uninhabited Lady Fulkeward gave a little scream and looked round Good gracious doctor Dean How you frightened me The Doctor made an apologetic bow I am very sorry I forgot you were so sensitive pray pardon me As I was saying two months ago the palace of the Princess Ziska was a deserted barrack Formerly so I hear it used to be the house of some great personage but it had been allowed to fall into decay and nobody would rent it even for the rush of the Cairene season till it was secured by the Nubian you were speaking of just now the interesting Nubian with the face like a mummy he took it and furnished it and when it was ready Madame la Princesse appeared on the scene and has resided there every since I wonder what that Nubian has to do with her said Lady Chetwynd Lyle severely Nothing at all replied the Doctor calmly He is the merest servant the kind of person who is told off to attend on the women of a harem Ah I see you have been making inquiries concerning the princess Doctor said Lady Fulkeward with a smile I have And have you found out anything about her No that is nothing of social importance except perhaps two items first that she is not a Russian secondly that she has never been married Never been married exclaimed Lady Chetwynd Lyle then suddenly turning to her daughters she said blandly Muriel Dolly go into the house my dears It is getting rather warm for you on this terrace I will join you in a few minutes The girls rose obediently with a delightfully innocent and juvenile air and fortunately for them did not notice the irreverent smile that played on young Lord Fulkeward s face which was immediately reflected on the artistically tinted countenance of his mother at the manner of their dismissal There is surely nothing improper in never having been married said doctor Dean with a mock serious air Consider my dear Lady Lyle is there not something very chaste and beautiful in the aspect of an old maid Lady Lyle looked up sharply She had an idea that both she and her daughters were being quizzed and she had some difficulty to control her rising temper Then do you call the Princess an old maid she demanded Lady Fulkeward looked amused her son laughed outright But the Doctor s face was perfectly composed I don t know what else I can call her he said with a thoughtful air She is no longer in her teens and she has too much voluptuous charm for an ingenue Still I admit you would scarcely call her old except in the parlance of the modern matrimonial market Our present day roues you know prefer their victims young and I fancy the Princess Ziska would be too old and perhaps too clever for most of them Personally speaking she does not impress me as being of any particular age but as she is not married and is so to speak a maid fully developed I am perforce obliged to call her an old maid She wouldn t thank you for the compliment said Lady Lyle with a spiteful grin I daresay not responded the Doctor blandly but I imagine she has very little personal vanity Her mind is too preoccupied with something more important than the consideration of her own good looks And what is that inquired Lady Fulkeward with some curiosity Ah there is the difficulty What is it that engrosses our fair friend more than the looking glass I should like to know but I cannot find out It is an enigma as profound as that of the sphinx Good morning Monsieur Gervase and turning round he addressed the artist who just then stepped out on the terrace carrying a paintbox and a large canvas strapped together in portable form Are you going to sketch some picturesque corner of the city No replied Gervase listlessly raising his white sun hat to the ladies present with a courteous yet somewhat indifferent grace I m going to the Princess Ziska s I shall probably get the whole outline of her features this morning A full length portrait inquired the Doctor I fancy not Not the first attempt at any rate head and shoulders only Do you know where her house is asked Lord Fulkeward If you don t I ll walk with you and show you the way Thanks you are very good I shall be obliged to you And raising his hat again he sauntered slowly off young Fulkeward walking with him and chatting to him with more animation than that exhausted and somewhat vacant minded aristocrat usually showed to anyone It is exceedingly warm said Lady Lyle rising then and putting away her cross stitch apparatus I thought of driving to the Pyramids this afternoon but really There is shade all the way suggested the Doctor I said as much to a young woman this morning who has been in the hotel for nearly two months and hasn t seen the Pyramids yet What has she been doing with herself asked Lady Fulkeward smiling Dancing with officers said doctor Dean How can Cheops compare with a moustached noodle in military uniform Good bye for the present I m going to hunt for scarabei I thought you had such a collection of them already said Lady Lyle So I have But the Princess had a remarkable one on last night and I want to find another like it It s blue very blue almost like a rare turquoise and it appears it is the sign manual of the warrior Araxes who was a kind of king in his way or desert chief which was about the same thing in those days He fought for Amenhotep and seemed from all accounts to be a greater man than Amenhotep himself The Princess Ziska is a wonderful Egyptologist I had a most interesting conversation with her last night in the supper room Then she is really a woman of culture and intelligence queried Lady Lyle The Doctor smiled I should say she would be a great deal too much for the University of Oxford as far as Oriental learning goes he said She can read the Egyptian papyri she tells me and she can decipher anything on any of the monuments I only wish I could persuade her to accompany me to Thebes and Karnak Lady Fulkeward unfurled her fan and swayed it to and fro with an elegant languor How delightful that would be she sighed So romantic and solemn all those dear old cities with those marvellous figures of the Egyptians carved and painted on the stones And Rameses dear Rameses He really has good legs everywhere Haven t you noticed that So many of these ancient sculptures represent the Egyptians with such angular bodies and such frightfully thin legs but Rameses always has good legs wherever you find him It s so refreshing DO make up a party doctor Dean we ll all go with you and I m sure the Princess Ziska will be the most charming companion possible Let us have a dahabeah I m good for half the expenses if you will only arrange everything The Doctor stroked his chin and looked dubious but he was evidently attracted by the idea I ll see about it he said at last Meanwhile I ll go and have a hunt for some traces of Amenhotep and Araxes He strolled down the terrace and Lady Chetwynd Lyle turning her back on old Lady Fulkeward went after her girls while the fascinating Fulkeward herself continued to recline comfortably in her chair and presently smiled a welcome on a youngish looking man with a fair moustache who came forward and sat down beside her talking to her in low tender and confidential tones He was the very impecunious colonel of one of the regiments then stationed in Cairo and as he never wasted time on sentiment he had been lately thinking that a marriage with a widowed peeress who had twenty thousand pounds a year in her own right might not be a half bad arrangement for him So he determined to do the agreeable and as he was a perfect adept in the art of making love without feeling it he got on very well and his prospects brightened steadily hour by hour Meanwhile young Fulkeward was escorting Armand Gervase through several narrow by streets talking to him as well as he knew how and trying in his feeble way to draw him out in which task he met with but indifferent success It must be awfully jolly and er all that sort of thing to be so famous he observed glancing up at the strong dark brooding face above him They had a picture of yours over in London once I went to see it with my mother It was called Le Poignard do you remember it Gervase shrugged his shoulders carelessly Yes I remember A poor thing at its best It was a woman with a dagger in her hand Yes awfully fine don cher know She was a very dark woman too dark for my taste and she d got a poignard clasped in in her right hand Of course she was going to murder somebody with it that was plain enough You meant it so didn t you I suppose I did She was in a sort of Eastern get up pursued Fulkeward one of your former studies in Egypt perhaps Gervase started and passed his hand across his forehead with a bewildered air No no Not a former study by any means How could it be This is my first visit to Egypt I have never been here before Haven t you Really Well you ll find it awfully interesting and all that sort of thing I don t see half as much of it as I should like I m a weak chap got something wrong with my lungs awful bother but can t be helped My mother won t let me do too much Here we are this is the Princess Ziska s They were standing in a narrow street ending in a cul de sac with tall houses on each side which cast long black melancholy shadows on the rough pavement below A vague sense of gloom and oppression stole over Gervase as he surveyed the outside of the particular dwelling Fulkeward pointed out to him a square palatial building which had no doubt once been magnificent in its exterior adornment but which now owing to long neglect had fallen into somewhat melancholy decay The sombre portal fantastically ornamented with designs copied from some of the Egyptian monuments rather resembled the gateway of a tomb than an entrance to the private residence of a beautiful living woman and Fulkeward noting his companion s silence added Not a very cheerful corner is it Some of these places are regular holes don cher know but I daresay it s all right inside You have never been inside Never And Fulkeward lowered his voice Look up there there s the beast that keeps everybody out Gervase followed his glance and perceived behind the projecting carved lattice work of one of the windows a dark wrinkled face and two gleaming eyes which even at that distance had or appeared to have a somewhat sinister expression He s the nastiest type of Nubian I have ever seen pursued Fulkeward Looks just like a galvanized corpse Gervase smiled and perceiving a long bell handle at the gateway pulled it sharply In another moment the Nubian appeared his aspect fully justifying Lord Fulkeward s description of him The parchment like skin on his face was yellowish black and wrinkled in a thousand places his lips were of a livid blue and were drawn up and down above and below the teeth in a kind of fixed grin while the dense brilliance of his eyes was so fierce and fiery as to suggest those of some savage beast athirst for prey Madame la Princesse Ziska began Gervase addressing his unfascinating object with apparent indifference to his hideousness The Nubian s grinning lips stretched themselves wider apart as in a thick snarling voice he demanded Votre nom Armand Gervase Entrez Et moi queried Fulkeward with a conciliatory smile Non Pas vous Monsieur Armand Gervase seul Fulkeward gave a resigned shrug of his shoulders Gervase looked round at him ere he crossed the threshold of the mysterious habitation I m sorry you have to walk back alone Don t mention it said Fulkeward affably You see you have come on business You re going to paint the Princess s picture and I daresay this blessed old rascal knows that I want nothing except to look at his mistress and wonder what she s made of What she s made of echoed Gervase in surprise Don t you think she s made like other women No can t say I do She seems all fire and vapor and eyes in the middle don cher know Oh I m an ass always was but that s the feeling she gives me Ta ta Wish you a pleasant morning He nodded and strolled away and Gervase hesitated yet another moment looking full at the Nubian who returned him stare for stare Maintenant he began Oui maintenant echoed the Nubian La Princesse ou est elle La and the Nubian pointed down a long dark passage beyond which there seemed to be the glimmer of green palms and other foliage Elle vous attend Monsieur Armand Gervase Entrez Suivez Slowly Gervase passed in and the great tomb like door closed upon him with a heavy clang The whole long bright day passed and he did not reappear not a human foot crossed the lonely street and nothing was seen there all through the warm sunshiny hours save the long black shadows on the pavement which grew longer and darker as the evening fell CHAPTER VII Within the palace of the Princess Ziska a strange silence reigned In whatever way the business of her household was carried on it was evidently with the most absolute noiselessness for not a sound disturbed the utter stillness environing her She herself clad in white garments that clung about her closely displaying the perfect outlines of her form stood waiting for her guest in a room that was fairly dazzling to the eye in its profusion of exquisitely assorted and harmonized colors as well as impressive to the mind in its suggestions of the past rather than of the present Quaint musical instruments of the fashion of thousands of years ago hung on the walls or lay on brackets and tables but no books such as our modern time produces were to be seen only tied up bundles of papyri and curious little tablets of clay inscribed with mysterious hieroglyphs Flowers adorned every corner many of them strange blossoms which a connoisseur would have declared to be unknown in Egypt palms and ferns and foliage of every description were banked up against the walls in graceful profusion and from the latticed windows the light filtered through colored squares giving a kind of rainbow effect to the room as though it were a scene in a dream rather than a reality And even more dream like than her surroundings was the woman who awaited the approach of her visitor her eyes turned towards the door fiery eyes filled with such ardent watchfulness as seemed to burn the very air The eyes of a hawk gleaming on its prey the eyes of a famished tiger in the dark were less fraught with terrific meaning than the eyes of Ziska as she listened attentively to the on coming footsteps through the outside corridor which told her that Gervase was near At last she whispered at last The next moment the Nubian flung the door wide open and announced Monsieur Armand Gervase She advanced with all the wonderful grace which distinguished her holding out both her slim soft hands Gervase caught them in his own and kissed them fervently whereupon the Nubian retired closing the door after him You are very welcome Monsieur Gervase said the Princess then speaking with a measured slowness that was attractive as well as soothing to the ear You have left all the dear English people well at the Gezireh Palace Lady Fulkeward was not too tired after her exertions at the ball And you But Gervase was gazing at her in a speechless confusion of mind too great for words A sudden inexplicable emotion took possession of him an emotion to which he could give no name but which stupefied him and held him mute Was it her beauty which so dazzled his senses Was it some subtle perfume in the room that awoke a dim haunting memory Or what was it that seemed so strangely familiar He struggled with himself and finally spoke out his thought I have seen you before Princess I am quite sure I have I thought I had last night but to day I am positive about it Strange isn t it I wonder where we really met Her dark eyes rested on him fully I wonder she echoed smiling The world is so small and so many people nowadays make the grand tour that it is not at all surprising we should have passed each other en route through our journey of life Gervase still hesitated glancing about him with a singularly embarrassed air while she continued to watch him intently Presently his sensations whatever they were passed off and gradually recovering his equanimity he became aware that he was quite alone with one of the most fascinating women he had ever seen His eyes flashed and he smiled I have come to paint your picture he said softly Shall I begin She had seated herself on a silken divan and her head rested against a pile of richly embroidered cushions Without waiting for her answer he threw himself down beside her and caught her hand in his Shall I paint your picture he whispered Or shall I make love to you She laughed the sweet low laugh that somehow chilled his blood while it charmed his hearing Whichever you please she answered Both performances would no doubt be works of art What do you mean Can you not understand If you paint my picture it will be a work of art If you make love to me it will equally be a work of art that is a composed thing an elaborate study Bah Love is not a composed thing said Gervase leaning closer to her It is wild and full of libertinage as the sea And equally as fickle added the Princess composedly taking a fan of feathers near her and waving it to and fro Man s idea of love is to take all he can get from a woman and give her nothing in return but misery sometimes and sometimes death You do not you cannot think that said Gervase looking at her dazzling face with a passion of admiration he made no attempt to conceal Men on the whole are not as cruel or as treacherous as women I would swear looking at you that beautiful as you are you are cruel and that is perhaps why I love you You are like a splendid tigress waiting to be tamed And you think you could tame me interposed Ziska looking at him with an inscrutable disdain in her black eyes Yes if you loved me Ah possibly But then it happens that I do not love you I love no one I have had too much of love it is a folly I have grown weary of Gervase fixed his eyes on her with an audacious look which seemed to hint that he might possibly take advantage of being alone with her to enforce his ideas of love more eloquently than was in accordance with the proprieties She perceived his humor smiled and coldly gave him back glance for glance Then rising from the divan she drew herself up to her full height and surveyed him with a kind of indulgent contempt You are an uprincipled man Armand Gervase she said and do you know I fear you always will be A cleansing of your soul through centuries of fire will be necessary for you in the next world that next world which you do not believe in But it is perhaps as well to warn you that I am not without protection in this place See and as she spoke she clapped her hands A clanging noise as of brazen bells answered her and Gervase springing up from his seat saw to his utter amazement the apparently solid walls of the room in which they were divide rapidly and form themselves in several square openings which showed a much larger and vaster apartment beyond resembling a great hall Here were assembled some twenty or thirty gorgeously costumed Arab attendants men of a dark and sinister type who appeared to be fully armed judging from the unpleasant looking daggers and other weapons they carried at their belts The Princess clapped her hands again and the walls closed in the same rapid fashion as they had opened while the beautiful mistress of this strange habitation laughed mirthfully at the complete confusion of her visitor and would be lover Paint me now she said flinging herself in a picturesque attitude on one of the sofas close by I am ready But I am not ready retorted Gervase angrily Do you take me for a child or a fool Both in one responded the Princess tranquilly being a man His breath came and went quickly Take care beautiful Ziska he said Take care how you defy me And take care Monsieur Gervase take care how you defy ME she responded with a strange quick glance at him Do you not realize what folly you are talking You are making love to me in the fashion of a brigand rather than a nineteenth century Frenchman of good standing and I I have to defend myself against you also brigand wise by showing you that I have armed servants within call It is very strange it would frighten even Lady Fulkeward and I think she is not easily frightened Pray commence your work and leave such an out of date matter as love to dreamers and pretty sentimentalists like Miss Helen Murray He was silent and busied himself in unstrapping his canvas and paint box with a great deal of almost vicious energy In a few moments he had gained sufficient composure to look full at her and taking his palette in hand he began dabbing on the colors talking between whiles Do you suppose he said keeping his voice carefully subdued that you can intimidate me by showing me a score of wretched black rascals whom you have placed on guard to defend you out there And why did you place them on guard You must have been afraid of me Pardieu I could snatch you out of their midst if I chose You do not know me if you did you would understand that not all the world armed to the teeth should balk me of my desires But I have been too hasty that I own I can wait He raised his eyes and saw that she was listening with an air of amused indifference I shall have to mix strange tints in your portrait ma belle It is difficult to find the exact hue of your skin there is rose and brown in it and there is yet another color which I must evolve while working and it is not the hue of health It is something dark and suggestive of death I hope you are not destined to an early grave And yet why not It is better that a beautiful woman should die in her beauty than live to become old and tiresome You think that interrupted the Ziska suddenly smiling somewhat coldly I do most honestly Had I lived in the early days of civilization when men were allowed to have as many women as they could provide for I would have mercifully killed any sweet favorite as soon as her beauty began to wane A lovely woman dead in her first exquisite youth how beautiful a subject for the mind to dwell upon How it suggests all manner of poetic fancies and graceful threnodies But a woman grown old who has outlived all passion and is a mere bundle of fat or a mummy of skin and bone what poetry does her existence suggest How can she appeal to art or sentiment She is a misery to herself and an eyesore to others Yes Princess believe me Love first and Death afterwards are woman s best friends You believe in Death ask the Princess looking steadily at him It is the only thing I do believe in he answered lightly It is a fact that will bear examination but not contradiction May I ask you to turn your head slightly to the left so Yes that will do if I can catch the look in your eyes that gleams there now the look of intense burning greedy cruelty which is so murderously fascinating I shall be content He seated himself opposite to her and putting down his palette took up his canvas and posing it on his knee began drawing the first rough outline of his sketch in charcoal She meanwhile leaning against heaped up cushions of amber satin remained silent You are not a vain woman he pursued or you would resent my description of your eyes Greedy cruelty is not a pretty expression nor would it be considered complimentary by the majority of the fair sex Yet from my point of view it is the highest flattery I can pay you for I adore the eyes of savage animals and the beautiful eye of the forest beast is in your head diableresse charmante comme vous etes I wonder what gives you such an insatiate love of vengeance He looked up and saw her eyes glistening and narrowing at the corners like the eyes of an angry snake If I have such a feeling she replied slowly it is probably a question of heritage Ah Your parents were perhaps barbaric in their notions of love and hatred he queried lazily working at his charcoal sketch with growing admiration for its result My parents came of a race of kings she answered All my ancestors were proud and of a temper unknown to this petty day They resented a wrong they punished falsehood and treachery and they took a life for a life YOUR generation tolerates every sin known in the calendar with a smile and a shrug you have arrived at the end of your civilization even to the denial of Deity and a future life That is not the end of our civilization Princess said Gervase working away intently with eyes fixed on the canvas as he talked That is the triumphal apex the glory the culmination of everything that is great and supreme in manhood In France man now knows himself to be the only God England good slow pacing England is approaching France in intelligence by degrees and I rejoice to see that it is possible for a newspaper like the Agnostic to exist in London Only the other day that excellent journal was discussing the possibility of teaching monkeys to read and a witty writer who adopts the nom de plume of Saladin very cleverly remarked that supposing monkeys were able to read the New Testament they would still remain monkeys in fact they would probably be greater monkeys than ever The fact of such an expression being allowed to pass muster in once pious London is an excellent sign of the times and of our progress towards the pure Age of Reason The name of Christ is no longer one to conjure with A dead silence followed his words and the peculiar stillness and heaviness of the atmosphere struck him with a vague alarm He lifted his eyes the Princess Ziska met his gaze steadily but there was something in her aspect that moved him to wonderment and a curious touch of terror The delicate rose tint of her cheeks had faded to an ashy paleness her lips were pressed together tightly and her eyes seemed to have gained a vivid and angry lustre which Medusa herself might have envied Did you ever try to conjure with that name she asked Never he replied forcing a smile and remonstrating with himself for the inexplicable nature of his emotions She went on slowly In my creed for I have a creed it is believed that those who have never taken the sacred name of Christ to their hearts as a talisman of comfort and support are left as it were in the vortex of uncertainties tossed to and fro among many whirling and mighty forces and haunted forever by the phantoms of their own evil deeds Till they learn and accept the truth of their marvellous Redemption they are the prey of wicked spirits who tempt and lead them on to divers miseries But when the great Name of Him who died upon the Cross is acknowledged then it is found to be of that transfiguring nature which turns evil to good and sometimes makes angels out of fiends Nevertheless for the hardened reprobate and unbeliever the old laws suffice Gervase had stopped the quick movement of his fusin and looked at her curiously What old laws he asked Stern justice without mercy she answered then in lighter accents she added Have you finished your first outline In reply he turned his canvas round to her showing her a head and profile boldly presented in black and white She smiled It is clever but it is not like me she said When you begin the coloring you will find that your picture and I have no resemblance to each other He flushed with a sense of wounded amour propre Pardon madame I am no novice at the art of painting he said and much as your charms dazzle and ensnare me they do not disqualify my brain and hand from perfectly delineating them upon my canvas I love you to distraction but my passion shall not hinder me from making your picture a masterpiece She laughed What an egoist you are Monsieur Gervase she said Even in your professed passion for me you count yourself first me afterwards Naturally he replied A man must always be first by natural creation When he allows himself to play second fiddle he is a fool And when he is a fool and he often is he is the first of fools said the Princess No ape no baboon hanging by its tail to a tree looks such a fool as a man fool For a man fool has had all the opportunities of education and learning bestowed upon him this great universe with its daily lessons of the natural and the supernatural is his book laid open for his reading and when he will neither read it nor consider it and moreover when he utterly denies the very Maker of it then there is no fool in all creation like him For the ape fool does at least admit that there may be a stronger beast somewhere a creature who may suddenly come upon him and end his joys of hanging by his tail to a tree and make havoc of his fruit eating and chattering while man thinks there is nothing anywhere superior to himself Gervase smiled tolerantly I am afraid I have ruffled you Princess he said I see you have religious ideas I have none Once again she laughed musically Religious ideas I Not at all I have a creed as I told you but it is an ugly one not at all sentimental or agreeable It is one I have adopted from ancient Egypt Explain it to me said Gervase I will adopt it also for your sake It is too supernatural for you she said paying no heed to the amorous tone of his voice or the expressive tenderness of his eyes Never mind Love will make me accept an army of ghosts if necessary One of the chief tenets of my faith she continued is the eternal immortality of each individual Soul Will you accept that For the moment certainly Her eyes glowed like great jewels as she proceeded The Egyptian cult I follow is very briefly explained The Soul begins in protoplasm without conscious individuality It progresses through various forms till individual consciousness is attained Once attained it is never lost but it lives on pressing towards perfection taking upon itself various phases of existence according to the passions which have most completely dominated it from the first That is all But according to this theory you might have lived in the world long ago and so might I we might even have met and for some reason or other we may have become re incarnated now A disciple of my creed would give you that as the reason why you sometimes imagine you have seen me before As she spoke the dazed and troubled sensation he had once previously experienced came upon him he laid down the canvas he held and passed his hand across his forehead bewilderedly Yes very curious and fantastic I ve heard a great deal about the doctrine of reincarnation I don t believe in it I can t believe in it But if I could if I could imagine I had ever met you in some bygone time and you were like what you are at this moment I should have loved you I MUST have loved you You see I cannot leave the subject of love alone and your re incarnation idea gives my fancy something to work upon So beautiful Ziska if your soul ever took the form of a flower I must have been its companion blossom if it ever paced the forest as a beast of prey I must have been its mate if it ever was human before then I must have been its lover Do you like such pretty follies I will talk them by the hour Here he rose and with a movement that was half fierce and half tender he knelt beside her taking her hands in his own I love you Ziska I cannot help myself I am drawn to you by some force stronger than my own will but you need not be afraid of me not yet As I said I can wait I can endure the mingled torture and rapture of this sudden passion and make no sign till my patience tires and then then I will win you if I die for it He sprang up before she could speak a word in answer and seizing his canvas again exclaimed gayly Now for the hues of morning and evening combined to paint the radiance of this wicked soul of love that so enthralls me First the raven black of midnight for the hair the lustre of the coldest brightest stars for eyes the blush rose of early dawn for lips and cheeks Ah How shall I make a real beginning of this marvel It will be difficult I fear said Ziska slowly with a faint cold smile and still more difficult perchance will be the end CHAPTER VIII The table d hote at the Gezireh Palace Hotel had already begun when Gervase entered the dining room and sat down near Lady Fulkeward and doctor Dean 
6484-69655-0000	train-other-500	You have missed the soup said her ladyship looking up at him with a sweet smile All you artists are alike you have no idea whatever of time And how have you succeeded with that charming mysterious person the Princess Ziska
none	none	 Gervase kept his gaze steadily fixed on the table cloth 
6484-69655-0001	train-other-500	He was extremely pale and had the air of one who has gone through some great mental exhaustion I have not succeeded as well as I expected he answered slowly I think my hand must have lost its cunning
6484-69655-0002	train-other-500	At any rate whatever the reason may be Art has been defeated by Nature He crumbled up the piece of bread near his plate in small portions with a kind of involuntary violence in the action
6484-69655-0003	train-other-500	and doctor Dean deliberately drawing out a pair of spectacles from their case adjusted them and surveyed him curiously You mean to say that you cannot paint the Princess s picture
none	none	 Gervase glanced up at him with a half sullen half defiant expression 
6484-69655-0004	train-other-500	I don t say that he replied I can paint something something which you can call a picture if you like but there is no resemblance to the Princess Ziska in it She is beautiful and I can get nothing of her beauty
6484-69655-0005	train-other-500	I can only get the reflection of a face which is not hers How very curious exclaimed Lady Fulkeward Quite psychological is it not Doctor It is almost creepy and she managed to produce a delicate shudder of her white shoulders
6484-69655-0006	train-other-500	without cracking the blanc de perle enamel It will be something fresh for you to study Possibly it will possibly said the Doctor
none	none	 still surveying Gervase blandly through his round glasses 
6484-69655-0007	train-other-500	but it isn t the first time I have heard of painters who unconsciously produce other faces than those of their sitters I distinctly remember a case in point A gentleman famous for his charities and general benevolence
6484-69655-0008	train-other-500	had his portrait painted by a great artist for presentation to the town hall of his native place and the artist was quite unable to avoid making him unto the likeness of a villain It was quite a distressing affair
6484-69655-0009	train-other-500	the painter was probably more distressed than anybody about it and he tried by every possible means in his power to impart a truthful and noble aspect to the countenance of the man who was known and admitted to be a benefactor to his race
6484-69655-0010	train-other-500	But it was all in vain the portrait when finished was the portrait of a stranger and a scoundrel The people for whom it was intended declared they would not have such a libel on their generous friend hung up in their town hall
6484-69655-0011	train-other-500	The painter was in despair and there was going to be a general hubbub when lo and behold the noble personage himself was suddenly arrested for a brutal murder
none	none	 committed twelve years back He was found guilty and hanged and the painter kept the portrait that had so remarkably betrayed the murderer s real nature as a curiosity ever afterwards Is that a fact inquired a man who was seated at the other side of the table and who had listened with great interest to the story A positive fact said the Doctor One of those many singular circumstances which occur in life and which are beyond all explanation Gervase moved restlessly then filling for himself a glass of claret drained it off thirstily Something of the same kind has happened to me he said with a hard mirthless laugh for out of the most perfect beauty I have only succeeded in presenting an atrocity Dear me exclaimed Lady Fulkeward What a disappointing day you must have had 
6484-69655-0012	train-other-500	But of course you will try again the Princess will surely give you another sitting
none	none	 Oh yes I shall certainly try again and yet again and ever so many times again said Gervase 
6484-69655-0013	train-other-500	with a kind of angry obstinacy in his tone the more so as she has told me I will never succeed in painting her She told you that did she put in doctor Dean with an air of lively interest Yes
6484-69655-0014	train-other-500	Just then the handing round of fresh dishes and the clatter of knives and forks effectually put a stop to the conversation for the time
none	none	 and Gervase presently glancing about him 
6484-69655-0015	train-other-500	saw that Denzil Murray and his sister were dining apart at a smaller table with young Lord Fulkeward and Ross Courtney Helen was looking her fairest and best that evening her sweet face framed in its angel aureole of bright hair
6484-69655-0016	train-other-500	had a singular look of pureness and truth expressed upon it rare to find in any woman beyond her early teens Unconsciously to himself
none	none	 Gervase sighed 
6484-69655-0017	train-other-500	as he caught a view of her delicate profile and Lady Fulkeward s sharp ears heard the sound of that sigh Isn t that a charming little party over there she asked Young people you know They always like to be together
6484-69655-0018	train-other-500	That very sweet girl Miss Murray was so much distressed about her brother to day something was the matter with him a touch of fever I believe
none	none	 that she begged me to let Fulke dine with them in order to distract mister Denzil s mind 
6484-69655-0019	train-other-500	Fulke is a dear boy you know very consoling in his ways though he says so little Then mister Courtney volunteered to join them and there they are The Chetwynd Lyles are gone to a big dinner at the Continental this evening The Chetwynd Lyles
none	none	 let me see Who are they mused Gervase aloud 
6484-69655-0020	train-other-500	Do I know them No that is you have not been formally introduced said doctor Dean Sir Chetwynd Lyle is the editor and proprietor of the London Daily Dial
none	none	 Lady Chetwynd Lyle is his wife and the two elderly youthful ladies who appeared as Boulogne fishwives last night at the ball 
6484-69655-0021	train-other-500	are his daughters Cruel man exclaimed Lady Fulkeward with a girlish giggle The idea of calling those sweet girls Muriel and Dolly elderly youthful What are they my dear madam what are they demanded the imperturbable little savant
6484-69655-0022	train-other-500	Elderly youthful is a very convenient expression and applies perfectly to people who refuse to be old and cannot possibly be young Nonsense I will not listen to you and her ladyship opened her jewelled fan and spread it before her eyes
6484-69655-0023	train-other-500	to completely screen the objectionable Doctor from view Don t you know your theories are quite out of date Nobody is old we all utterly refuse to be old Why and she shut her fan with a sudden jerk
none	none	 I shall have you calling ME old next 
6484-69655-0024	train-other-500	Never madam said doctor Dean gallantly
none	none	 laying his hand upon his heart You are quite an exception to the rule 
6484-69655-0025	train-other-500	You have passed through the furnace of marriage and come out unscathed Time has done its worst with you and now retreats baffled and powerless it can touch you no more Whether this was meant as a compliment or the reverse
6484-69655-0026	train-other-500	it would have been difficult to say but Lady Fulkeward graciously accepted it as the choicest flattery and bowed smiling and gratified Dinner was now drawing to its end and people were giving their orders for coffee to be served to them on the terrace and in the gardens
none	none	 Gervase among the rest The Doctor turned to him 
6484-69655-0027	train-other-500	I should like to see your picture of the Princess he said that is if you have no objection
none	none	 Not the least in the world replied Gervase 
6484-69655-0028	train-other-500	only it isn t the Princess it is somebody else A faint shudder passed over him The Doctor noticed it Talking of curious things went on that irrepressible savant I started hunting for a particular scarabeus to day
6484-69655-0029	train-other-500	I couldn t find it of course it generally takes years to find even a trifle that one especially wants But I came across a queer old man in one of the curiosity shops who told me that over at Karnak
none	none	 they had just discovered a large fresco in one of the tombs 
6484-69655-0030	train-other-500	describing the exploits of the very man whose track I m on Araxes
none	none	 Gervase started he knew not why 
6484-69655-0031	train-other-500	What has Araxes to do with you he demanded Oh nothing But the Princess Ziska spoke of him as a great warrior in the days of Amenhotep
none	none	 and she seems to be a great Egyptologist 
6484-69655-0032	train-other-500	and to know many things of which we are ignorant Then you know last night she adopted the costume of a dancer of that period named Ziska Charmazel Well now it appears that in one part of this fresco the scene depicted
none	none	 is this very Ziska Charmazel dancing before Araxes Gervase listened with strained attention 
6484-69655-0033	train-other-500	his heart beat thickly as though the Doctor were telling him of some horrible circumstance in which he had an active part whereas he had truly no interest at all in the matter except in so far as events of history are more or less interesting to everyone
6484-69655-0034	train-other-500	Well he said after a pause Well echoed doctor Dean There is really nothing more to say beyond that I want to find out everything I can concerning this Araxes
6484-69655-0035	train-other-500	if only for the reason that the charming Princess chose to impersonate his lady love last night One must amuse one s self in one s own fashion even in Egypt and this amuses ME
none	none	 Gervase rose feeling in his pocket for his cigarette case 
6484-69655-0036	train-other-500	Come he said briefly I will show you my picture He straightened his tall fine figure and walked slowly across the room to the table where Denzil Murray sat with his sister and friends
none	none	 Denzil he said I have made a strange portrait of the Princess Ziska 
6484-69655-0037	train-other-500	and I m going to show it to doctor Dean I should like you to see it too Will you come Denzil looked at him with a dark reproach in his eyes If you like he answered shortly I do like
none	none	 and Gervase laid his hand on the young fellow s shoulder 
6484-69655-0038	train-other-500	with a kind pressure You will find it a piece of curious disenchantment as well as a proof of my want of skill You are all welcome to come and look at it except here he hesitated except Miss Murray I think yes
6484-69655-0039	train-other-500	I think it might possibly frighten Miss Murray Helen raised her eyes to his but said nothing Oh by Jove murmured Lord Fulkeward feeling his moustache as usual Then don t you come Miss Murray We ll tell you all about it afterwards
6484-69655-0040	train-other-500	I have no curiosity on the subject she said a trifle coldly Denzil you will find me in the drawing room I have a letter to write home With a slight salute she left them
none	none	 Gervase watching the disappearance of her graceful figure 
6484-69655-0041	train-other-500	with a tinge of melancholy regret in his eyes It is evident Mademoiselle Helen does not like the Princess Ziska he observed Oh well as to that said Fulkeward hastily
6484-69655-0042	train-other-500	you know you can t expect women to lose their heads about her as men do Beside there s something rather strange in the Princess s manner and appearance and perhaps Miss Murray doesn t take to her any more than I do
6484-69655-0043	train-other-500	Oh then you are not one of her lovers queried doctor Dean smiling No are you I Good heavens my dear young sir I was never in love with a woman in my life That is not what YOU would call in love
6484-69655-0044	train-other-500	At the age of sixteen I wrote verses to a mature young damsel of forty a woman with a remarkably fine figure and plenty of it she rejected my advances with scorn and I have never loved since
6484-69655-0045	train-other-500	They all laughed even Denzil Murray s sullen features cleared for the moment into the brightness of a smile Where did you paint the Princess s picture inquired Ross Courtney suddenly
none	none	 In her own house replied Gervase 
6484-69655-0046	train-other-500	But we were not alone for the fascinating fair one had some twenty or more armed servants within call There was a movement of surprise among his listeners and he went on Yes Madame is very well protected I assure you
6484-69655-0047	train-other-500	as much so as if she were the first favorite in a harem Come now and see my sketch He led the way to a private sitting room which he had secured for himself in the hotel at almost fabulous terms It was a small apartment
6484-69655-0048	train-other-500	but it had the advantage of a long French window which opened out into the garden Here on an easel was a canvas with its back turned towards the spectator
none	none	 Sit down said Gervase abruptly addressing his guests 
6484-69655-0049	train-other-500	and be prepared for a curiosity unlike anything you have ever seen before He paused a moment looking steadily at doctor Dean
none	none	 Perhaps Doctor as you are interested in psychic phenomena 
6484-69655-0050	train-other-500	you may be able to explain how I got such a face on my canvas for I cannot explain it to myself
none	none	 He slowly turned the canvas round and scarcely heeding the exclamation of amazement that broke simultaneously from all the men present stared at it himself fascinated by a singular magnetism more potent than either horror or fear CHAPTER IX What a strange and awful face it was what a thing of distorted passion and pain What an agony was expressed in every line of the features agony in which the traces of a divine beauty lingered only to render the whole countenance more repellent and terrific A kind of sentient solemnity mingled with wrath and terror glared from the painted eyes the lips slightly parted in a cruel upward curve seemed about to utter a shriek of menace the hair drooping in black thick clusters low on the brow looked wet as with the dews of the rigor mortis and to add to the mysterious horror of the whole conception the distinct outline of a death s head was seen plainly through the rose brown flesh tints There was no real resemblance in this horrible picture to the radiant and glowing loveliness of the Princess Ziska yet at the same time there was sufficient dim likeness to make an imaginative person think it might be possible for her to assume that appearance in death Several minutes passed in utter silence then Lord Fulkeward suddenly rose I m going he said It s a beastly thing it makes me sick Grand merci said Gervase with a forced smile I really can t help it declared the young man turning his back to the picture If I am rude you must excuse it I m not very strong my mother will tell you I get put out very easily and I shall dream of this horrid face all night if I don t give it a wide berth And without any further remark he stepped out through the open window into the garden and walked off Gervase made no comment on his departure he turned his eyes towards doctor Dean who with spectacles on nose was staring hard at the picture with every sign of the deepest interest Well Doctor he said you see it is not at all like the Princess Oh yes it is returned the Doctor placidly If you could imagine the Princess s face in torture it would be like her It is the kind of expression she might wear if she suddenly met with a violent end But why should I paint her so demanded Gervase She was perfectly tranquil and her attitude was most picturesquely composed I sketched her as I thought I saw her how did this tortured head come on my canvas The Doctor scratched his chin thoughtfully It was certainly a problem He stared hard at Gervase as though searching for the clue to the mystery in the handsome artist s own face Then he turned to Denzil Murray who had not stirred or spoken What do you think of it eh Denzil he asked The young man started as from a dream I don t know what to think of it And you said the Doctor addressing Ross Courtney I Oh I am of the same opinion as Fulkeward I think it is a horrible thing And the curious part of the matter is that it is like the Princess Ziska and yet totally unlike Upon my word you know it is a very unpleasant picture doctor Dean got up and paced the room two or three times his brows knitted in a heavy frown Suddenly he stopped in front of Gervase Tell me he said have you any recollection of ever having met the Princess Ziska before Gervase looked puzzled then answered slowly No I have no actual recollection of the kind At the same time I admit to you that there is something about her which has always struck me as being familiar The tone of her voice and the peculiar cadence of her laughter particularly affect me in this way Last night when I was dancing with her I wondered whether I had ever come across her as a model in one of the studios in Paris or Rome The Doctor listened to him attentively watching him narrowly the while But he shook his head incredulously at the idea of the Princess ever having posed as a model No no that won t do he said I do not believe she was ever in the model business Think again You are now a man in the prime of life Monsieur Gervase but look back to your early youth the period when young men do wild reckless and often wicked things did you ever in that thoughtless time break a woman s heart Gervase flushed and shrugged his shoulders Pardieu I may have done Who can tell But if I did what would that have to do with this and he tapped the picture impatiently The Doctor sat down and smacked his lips with a peculiar air of enjoyment It would have a great deal to do with it he answered that is psychologically speaking I have known of such cases We will argue the point out systematically thus Suppose that you in your boyhood had wronged some woman and suppose that woman had died You might imagine you had got rid of that woman But if her love was very strong and her sense of outrage very bitter I must tell you that you have not got rid of her by any means moreover you never will get rid of her And why Because her Soul like all Souls is imperishable Now putting it as a mere supposition and for the sake of the argument that you feel a certain admiration for the Princess Ziska an admiration which might possibly deepen into something more than platonic here Denzil Murray looked up his eyes glowing with an angry pain as he fixed them on Gervase why then the Soul of the other woman you once wronged might come between you and the face of the new attraction and cause you to unconsciously paint the tortured look of the injured and unforgiving Spirit on the countenance of the lovely fascinator whose charms are just beginning to ensnare you I repeat I have known of such cases And unheeding the amazed and incredulous looks of his listeners the little Doctor folded both his short arms across his chest and hugged himself in the exquisite delight of his own strange theories The fact is he continued you cannot get rid of ghosts They are all about us everywhere Sometimes they take forms sometimes they are content to remain invisible But they never fail to make their presence felt Often during the performance of some great piece of music they drift between the air and the melody making the sounds wilder and more haunting and freezing the blood of the listener with a vague agony and chill Sometimes they come between us and our friends mysteriously forbidding any further exchange of civilities or sympathies and occasionally they meet us alone and walk and talk with us invisibly Generally they mean well but sometimes they mean ill And the only explanation I can offer you Monsieur Gervase as to the present picture problem is that a ghost must have come between you and your canvas Gervase laughed loudly My good friend you are an adept in the art of pleading the impossible You must excuse me I am a sceptic and I hope I am also in possession of my sober reason therefore you can hardly wonder at my entirely refusing to accept such preposterous theories as those you appear to believe in doctor Dean gave him a civil little bow I do not ask you to accept them my dear sir I state my facts and you can take them or leave them just as you please You yourself can offer no explanation of the singular way in which this picture has been produced I offer one which is perfectly tenable with the discoveries of psychic science and you dismiss it as preposterous That being the case I should recommend you to cut up this canvas and try your hand again on the same subject Of course I shall try again retorted Gervase But I do not think I shall destroy this first sketch It is a curiosity in its way and it has a peculiar fascination for me Do you notice how thoroughly Egyptian the features are They are the very contour of some of the faces on the recently discovered frescoes Oh I noticed that at once said the Doctor but that is not remarkable seeing that you yourself are quite of an Egyptian type though a Frenchman so much so in fact that many people in this hotel have commented on it Gervase said nothing but slowly turned the canvas round with its face to the wall You have seen enough of it I suppose he inquired of Denzil Murray More than enough Gervase smiled It ought to disenchant you he said in a lower tone But it is a libel on her beauty it is not in the least like her returned Murray coldly Not in the very least Are you sure My dear Denzil you know as well as I do that there IS a likeness combined with a dreadful unlikeness and it is that which troubles both of us I assure you my good boy I am as sorry for you as I am for myself for I feel that this woman will be the death of one or both of us Denzil made no reply and presently they all strolled out in the garden and lit their cigars and cigarettes with the exception of doctor Dean who never smoked and never drank anything stronger than water I am going to get up a party for the Nile he said as he turned his sharp ferret like eyes upwards to the clear heavens and I shall take the Princess into my confidence In fact I have written to her about it to day I hear she has a magnificent electric dahabeah and if she will let us charter it She won t said Denzil hastily unless she goes with it herself You seem to know a great deal about her observed doctor Dean indulgently and why should she not go herself She is evidently well instructed in the ancient history of Egypt and as she reads the hieroglyphs she will be a delightful guide and a most valuable assistant to me in my researches What researches are you engaged upon now inquired Courtney I am hunting down a man called Araxes answered the Doctor He lived so far as I can make out some four or five thousand years ago more or less and I want to find out what he did and how he died and when I know how he died then I mean to discover where he is buried If possible I shall excavate him I also want to find the remains of Ziska Charmazel the lady impersonated by our charming friend the Princess last night the dancer who it appears from a recently discovered fresco occupied most of her time in dancing before this same Araxes and making herself generally agreeable to him What an odd fancy exclaimed Denzil How can a man and woman dead five thousand years ago be of any interest to you What interest has Rameses demanded the Doctor politely or any of the Ptolemies Araxes like Rameses may lead to fresh discoveries in Egypt for all we know One name is as good as another and each odoriferous mummy has its own mystery They all came just then to a pause in their walk Gervase stopping to light a fresh cigarette The rays of the rising moon fell upon him as he stood a tall and stately figure against a background of palms and shone on his dark features with a touch of grayish green luminance that gave him for the moment an almost spectral appearance doctor Dean glanced at him with a smile What a figure of an Egyptian is he not he said to Courtney and Denzil Murray Look at him What height and symmetry What a world of ferocity in those black slumbrous eyes Yes Monsieur Gervase I am talking about you I am admiring you Trop d honneur murmured Gervase carefully shielding with one hand the match with which he was kindling his cigarette Yes continued the Doctor I am admiring you Being a little man myself I naturally like tall men and as an investigator of psychic forms I am immensely interested when I see a finely made body in which the soul lies torpid That is why you unconsciously compose for me a wonderful subject of study I wonder now how long this torpidity in the psychic germ has lasted in you It commenced of course originally in protoplasm but it must have continued through various low forms and met with enormous difficulties in attaining to individual consciousness as man because even now it is scarcely conscious Gervase laughed Why that beginning of the soul in protoplasm is part of a creed which the Princess Ziska was trying to teach me to day he said lightly It s all no use I don t believe in the soul if I did I should be a miserable man Why asked Murray Why Because my dear fellow I should be rather afraid of my future I should not like to live again I might have to remember certain incidents which I would rather forget There is your charming sister Mademoiselle Helen I must go and talk to her her conversation always does me good and after that picture which I have been unfortunate enough to produce her presence will be as soothing as the freshness of morning after an unpleasant nightmare He moved away Denzil Murray with Courtney followed him doctor Dean remained behind and presently sitting down in a retired corner of the garden alone he took out a small pocket book and stylographic pen and occupied himself for more than half an hour in busily writing till he had covered two or three pages with his small neat caligraphy It is the most interesting problem I ever had the chance of studying he murmured half aloud when he had finished Of course if my researches into the psychic spheres of action are worth anything it can only be one case out of thousands Thousands Aye perhaps millions Great heavens Among what terrific unseen forces we live And in exact proportion to every man s arrogant denial of the Divinity that shapes our ends so will be measured out to him the revelation of the invisible Strange that the human race has never entirely realized as yet the depth of meaning in the words describing hell Where the worm dieth not and where the flame is never quenched The worm is Retribution the flame is the immortal Spirit and the two are forever striving to escape from the other Horrible And yet there are men who believe in neither one thing nor the other and reject the Redemption that does away with both God forgive us all our sins and especially the sins of pride and presumption And with a shade of profound melancholy on his features the little Doctor put by his note book and avoiding all the hotel loungers on the terrace and elsewhere retired to his own room and went to bed CHAPTER X The next day when Armand Gervase went to call on the Princess Ziska he was refused admittance The Nubian attendant who kept watch and ward at her gates hearing the door bell ring contented himself with thrusting his ugly head through an open upper window and shouting Madame est sortie Ou donc called Gervase in answer A la campagne le desert les pyramides returned the Nubian at the same time banging the lattice to in order to prevent the possibility of any further conversation And Gervase standing in the street irresolutely for a moment fancied he heard a peal of malicious laughter in the distance Beast he muttered I must try him with a money bribe next time I get hold of him I wonder what I shall do with myself now haunted and brain ridden as I am by this woman and her picture The hot sun glared in his eyes and made them ache the rough stones of the narrow street were scorching to his feet He began to move slowly away with a curious faint sensation of giddiness and sickness upon him when the sound of music floating from the direction of the Princess Ziska s palace brought him to a sudden standstill It was a strange wild melody played on some instrument with seemingly muffled strings A voice with a deep throbbing thrill of sweetness in it began to sing Oh for the passionless peace of the Lotus Lily It floats in a waking dream on the waters chilly With its leaves unfurled To the wondering world Knowing naught of the sorrow and restless pain That burns and tortures the human brain Oh for the passionless peace of the Lotus Lily Oh for the pure cold heart of the Lotus Lily Bared to the moon on the waters dark and chilly A star above Is its only love And one brief sigh of its scented breath Is all it will ever know of Death Oh for the pure cold heart of the Lotus Lily When the song ceased Gervase raised his eyes from the ground on which he had fixed them in a kind of brooding stupor and stared at the burning blue of the sky as vaguely and wildly as a sick man in the delirium of fever God What ails me he muttered supporting himself with one hand against the black and crumbling wall near which he stood Why should that melody steal away my strength and make me think of things with which I have surely no connection What tricks my imagination plays me in this city of the Orient I might as well be hypnotized What have I to do with dreams of war and triumph and rapine and murder and what is the name of Ziska Charmazel to me He shook himself with the action of a fine brute that has been stung by some teasing insect and mastering his emotions by an effort walked away But he was so absorbed in strange thoughts that he stumbled up against Denzil Murray in a side street on the way to the Gezireh Palace Hotel without seeing him and would have passed him altogether had not Denzil somewhat fiercely said Stop Gervase looked at him bewilderedly Why Denzil is it you My dear fellow forgive me my brusquerie I believe I have got a stroke of the sun or something of the sort I assure you I hardly know what I am doing or where I am going I believe it said Denzil hoarsely You are as mad as I am for love Gervase smiled a slight incredulous smile You think so I am not sure If love makes a man as thoroughly unstrung and nervous as I am to day then love is a very bad illness It is the worst illness in the world said Denzil speaking hurriedly and wildly The most cruel and torturing And there is no cure for it save death My God Gervase You were my friend but yesterday I never should have thought it possible to hate you Yet you do hate me queried Gervase still smiling a little Hate you I could kill you You have been with HER Quietly Gervase took his arm My good Denzil you are mistaken I confess to you frankly I should have been with HER you mean the Princess Ziska of course had it been possible But she has fled the city for the moment at least according to the corpse like Nubian who acts as porter He lies exclaimed Denzil hotly I saw her this morning I hope you improved your opportunity said Gervase imperturbably Anyway at the present moment she is not visible A silence fell between them for some minutes then Denzil spoke again Gervase it is no use I cannot stand this sort of thing We must have it out What does it all mean It is difficult to explain my dear boy answered Gervase half seriously half mockingly It means I presume that we are both in love with the same woman and that we both intend to try our chances with her But as I told you the other night I do not see why we should quarrel about it Your intentions towards the Princess are honorable mine are dishonorable and I shall make no secret of them If you win her I shall He paused and there was a sudden look in his eyes which gave them a sombre darkness darker than their own natural color You shall what asked Denzil Do something desperate replied Gervase What the something will be depends on the humor of the moment A tiger balked of his prey is not an agreeable beast a strong man deprived of the woman he passionately desires is a little less agreeable even than the tiger But let us adopt the policy of laissez faire Nothing is decided the fair one cares for neither of us let us be friends until she makes her choice We cannot be friends said Denzil sternly Good Let us be foes then but courteous even in our quarrel dear boy If we must kill each other let us do it civilly To fly at each other s throats would be purely barbaric We owe a certain duty to civilization things have progressed since the days of Araxes Denzil stared at him gloomily Araxes is doctor Dean s fad he said I don t know anything about Egyptian mummies and don t want to know My matter is with the present and not with the past They had reached the hotel by this time and turned into the gardens side by side You understand repeated Denzil We cannot be friends Gervase gave him a profoundly courteous salute and the two separated Later on in the afternoon about an hour before dinner time Gervase strolling on the terrace of the hotel alone saw Helen Murray seated at a little distance under some trees with a book in her hand which she was not reading There were tears in her eyes but as he approached her she furtively dashed them away and greeted him with a poor attempt at a smile You have a moment to spare me he asked sitting down beside her She bent her head in acquiescence I am a very unhappy man Mademoiselle Helen he began looking at her with a certain compassionate tenderness as he spoke I want your sympathy but I know I do not deserve it Helen remained silent A faint flush crimsoned her cheeks but her eyes were veiled under the long lashes she thought he could not see them You remember he went on our pleasant times in Scotland Ah it is a restful place your Highland home with the beautiful purple hills rolling away in the distance and the glorious moors covered with fragrant heather and the gurgling of the river that runs between birch and fir and willow making music all day long for those who have the ears to listen and the hearts to understand the pretty love tune it sings You know Frenchmen always have more or less sympathy with the Scotch some old association perhaps with the romantic times of Mary Queen of Scots when the light and changeful fancies of Chastelard and his brother poets and lutists made havoc in the hearts of many a Highland maiden What is that bright drop on your hand Helen are you crying He waited a moment and his voice was softer and more tremulous Dear girl I am not worthy of tears I am not good enough for you He gave her time to recover her momentary emotion and then went on still softly and tenderly Listen Helen I want you to believe me and forgive me if you can I know I remember those moonlight evenings in Scotland holy and happy evenings as sweet as flower scented pages in a young girl s missal yes and I did not mean to play with you Helen or wound your gentle heart I almost loved you He spoke the words passionately and for a moment she raised her eyes and looked at him in something of fear as well as sorrow Yes I said to my self this woman so true and pure and fair is a bride for a king and if I can win her if Ah there my musings stopped But I came to Egypt chiefly to meet you again knowing that you and your brother were in Cairo How was I to know how was I to guess that this horrible thing would happen Helen gazed at him wonderingly What horrible thing she asked falteringly the rich color coming and going on her face and her heart beating violently as she put the question His eyes flashed This he answered The close and pernicious enthralment of a woman I never met till the night before last a woman whose face haunts me a woman who drags me to her side with the force of a magnet there to grovel like a brain sick fool and plead with her for a love which I already know is poison to my soul Helen Helen You do not understand you will never understand Here in the very air I breathe I fancy I can trace the perfume she shakes from her garments as she moves something indescribably fascinating yet terrible attracts me to her it is an evil attraction I know but I cannot resist it There is something wicked in every man s nature I am conscious enough that there is something detestably wicked in mine and I have not sufficient goodness to overbalance it And this woman this silent gliding glittering eyed creature that has suddenly taken possession of my fancy she overcomes me in spite of myself she makes havoc of all the good intentions of my life I admit it I confess it You are speaking of the Princess Ziska asked Helen tremblingly Of whom else should I speak he responded dreamily There is no one like her probably there never was anyone like her except perhaps Ziska Charmazel As the name passed his lips he sprang hastily up and stood amazed as though some sudden voice had called him Helen Murray looked at him in alarm Oh what is it she exclaimed He forced a laugh Nothing nothing but a madness I suppose it is all a part of my strange malady Your brother is stricken with the same fever Surely you know that Indeed I do know it Helen answered to my sorrow He regarded her intently Her face in its pure outline and quiet sadness of expression touched him more than he cared to own even to himself My dear Helen he said with an effort at composure I have been talking wildly you must forgive me Don t think about me at all I am not worth it Denzil has taken it into his head to quarrel with me on account of the Princess Ziska but I assure you I will not quarrel with him He is infatuated and so am I The best thing for all of us to do would be to leave Egypt instantly I feel that instinctively only we cannot do it Something holds us here You will never persuade Denzil to go and I I cannot persuade myself to go There is a clinging sweetness in the air for me and there are vague suggestions memories dreams histories wonderful things which hold me spell bound I wish I could analyze them recognize them or understand them But I cannot and there perhaps is their secret charm Only one thing grieves me and that is that I have perhaps unwittingly in some thoughtless way given you pain is it so Helen She rose quickly and with a quiet dignity held out her hand No Monsieur Gervase she said it is not so I am not one of those women who take every little idle word said by men in jest au grand serieux You have always been a kind and courteous friend and if you ever fancied you had a warmer feeling for me as you say I am sure you were mistaken We often delude ourselves in these matters I wish for your sake I could think the Princess Ziska worthy of the love she so readily inspires But I cannot My brother s infatuation for her is to me terrible I feel it will break his heart and mine A little half sob caught her breath and interrupted her she paused but presently went on with an effort at calmness You talk of our leaving Egypt how I wish that were possible But I spoke to Denzil about it on the night of the ball and he was furious with me for the mere suggestion It seems like an evil fate It IS an evil fate said Gervase gloomily Enfin my dear Helen we cannot escape from it at least I cannot But I never was intended for good things not even for a lasting love A lasting love I feel would bore me You look amazed you believe in lasting love So do many sweet women But do you know what symbol I as an artist would employ were I asked to give my idea of Love on my canvas Helen smiled sadly and shook her head I would paint a glowing flame said Gervase dreamily A flame leaping up from the pit of hell to the height of heaven springing in darkness lost in light and flying into the centre of that flame should be a white moth a blind soft mad thing with beating tremulous wings that should be Love Whirled into the very heart of the ravening fire crushed shrivelled out of existence in one wild rushing rapture that is what Love must be to me One cannot prolong passion over fifty years more or less of commonplace routine as marriage would have us do The very notion is absurd Love is like a choice wine of exquisite bouquet and intoxicating flavor it is the most maddening draught in the world but you cannot drink it every day No my dear Helen I am not made for a quiet life nor for a long one I fancy His voice unconsciously sank into a melancholy tone and for one moment Helen s composure nearly gave way She loved him as true women love with that sublime self sacrifice which only desires the happiness of the thing beloved yet a kind of insensate rage stirred for once in her gentle soul to think that the mere sight of a strange woman with dark eyes a woman whom no one knew anything about and who was by some people deemed a mere adventuress should have so overwhelmed this man whose genius she had deemed superior to fleeting impressions Controlling the tears that rose to her eyes and threatened to fall she said gently Good bye Monsieur Gervase He started as from a reverie Good bye Helen Some day you will think kindly of me again I think kindly of you now she answered tremulously then not trusting herself to say any more she turned swiftly and left him The flame and the moth he mused watching her slight figure till it had disappeared Yes it is the only fitting symbol Love must be always so Sudden impetuous ungovernable and then the end To stretch out the divine passion over life long breakfasts and dinners It would be intolerable to me Lord Fulkeward could do that sort of thing his chest is narrow and his sentiments are as limited as his chest He would duly kiss his wife every morning and evening and he would not analyze the fact that no special thrill of joy stirred in him at the action What should he do with thrills of joy this poor Fulkeward And yet it is likely he will marry Helen Or will it be the Courtney animal the type of man whose one idea is to arise kill and eat Ah well and he sighed She is not for me this maiden grace of womanhood If I married her I should make her miserable I am made for passion not for peace He started as he heard a step behind him and turning saw doctor Dean The worthy little savant looked worried and preoccupied I have had a letter from the Princess Ziska he said without any preliminary She has gone to secures rooms at the Mena House Hotel which is situated close to the Pyramids She regrets she cannot enter into the idea of taking a trip up the Nile She has no time she says as she is soon leaving Cairo But she suggests that we should make up a party for the Mena House while she is staying there as she can so she tells me make the Pyramids much more interesting for us by her intimate knowledge of them Now to me this is a very tempting offer but I should not care to go alone The Murrays will go I am sure murmured Gervase lazily At any rate Denzil will The Doctor looked at him narrowly If Denzil goes so will you go he said Thus there are two already booked for company And I fancy the Fulkewards might like the idea The Princess is leaving Cairo queried Gervase presently as though it were an after thought So she informs me in her letter The party which is to come off on Wednesday night is her last reception Gervase was silent a moment Then he said Have you told Denzil Not yet Better do so then and Gervase glanced up at the sky now glowing red with a fiery sunset He wants to propose you know Good God cried the Doctor sharply If he proposes to that woman Why should he not demanded Gervase Is she not as ripe for love and fit for marriage as any other of her sex Her sex echoed the Doctor grimly Her sex There for heaven s sake don t talk to me leave me alone The Princess Ziska is like no woman living she has none of the sentiments of a woman and the notion of Denzil s being such a fool as to think of proposing to her Oh leave me alone I tell you Let me worry this out And clapping his hat well down over his eyes he began to walk away in a strange condition of excitement which he evidently had some difficulty in suppressing Suddenly however he turned came back and tapped Gervase smartly on the chest YOU are the man for the Princess he said impressively There is a madness in you which you call love for her you are her fitting mate not that poor boy Denzil Murray In certain men and women spirit leaps to spirit note responds to note and if all the world were to interpose its trumpery bulk nothing could prevent such tumultuous forces rushing together Follow your destiny Monsieur Gervase but do not ruin another man s life on the way Follow your destiny complete it you are bound to do so but in the havoc and wildness to come for God s sake let the innocent go free He spoke with extraordinary solemnity and Gervase stared at him in utter bewilderment and perplexity not understanding in the least what he meant But before he could interpose a word or ask a question doctor Dean had gone CHAPTER XI The next two or three days passed without any incident of interest occurring to move the languid calm and excite the fleeting interest of the fashionable English and European visitors who were congregated at the Gezireh Palace Hotel The anxious flirtations of Dolly and Muriel Chetwynd Lyle afforded subjects of mirth to the profane the wonderfully youthful toilettes of Lady Fulkeward provided several keynotes from which to strike frivolous conversation and when the great painter Armand Gervase actually made a sketch of her ladyship for his own amusement and made her look about sixteen and girlish at that his popularity knew no bounds Everyone wanted to give him a commission particularly the elderly fair and he could have made a fortune had he chosen after the example set him by the English academicians by painting the portraits of ugly nobodies who were ready to pay any price to be turned out as handsome somebodies But he was too restless and ill at ease to apply himself steadily to work the glowing skies of Egypt the picturesque groups of natives to be seen at every turn the curious corners of old Cairo these made no impression upon his mind at all and when he was alone he passed whole half hours staring at the strange picture he had made of the Princess Ziska wherein the face of death seemed confronting him through a mask of life And he welcomed with a strong sense of relief and expectation the long looked for evening of the Princess s reception to which many of the visitors in Cairo had been invited since a fortnight and which those persons who always profess to be in the know even if they are wallowing in ignorance declared would surpass any entertainment ever given during the Cairene season The night came at last It was exceedingly sultry but bright and clear and the moon shone with effective brilliance on the gayly attired groups of people that between nine and ten o clock began to throng the narrow street in which the carved tomb like portal of the Princess Ziska s residence was the most conspicuous object Lady Chetwynd Lyle remarkable for bad taste in her dress and the disposal of her diamonds stared in haughty amazement at the Nubian who saluted her and her daughters with the grin peculiar to his uninviting cast of countenance and swept into the courtyard attended by her husband with an air as though she imagined her presence gave the necessary flavor of good style to the proceedings She was followed by Lady Fulkeward innocently clad in white and wearing a knot of lilies on her prettily enamelled left shoulder Lord Fulkeward Denzil Murray and his sister Helen also wore white but though she was in the twenties and Lady Fulkeward was in the sixties the girl had so much sadness in her face and so much tragedy in her soft eyes that she looked if anything older than the old woman Gervase and doctor Dean arrived together and found themselves in a brilliant crushing crowd of people all of different nationalities and all manifesting a good deal of impatience because they were delayed a few minutes in an open court where a couple of stone lions with wings were the only spectators of their costumes Most singular behavior said Lady Chetwynd Lyle snorting and sniffing to keep us waiting outside like this The Princess has no idea of European manners As she spoke a sudden blaze of light flamed on the scene and twenty tall Egyptian servants in white with red turbans carrying lighted torches and marching two by two crossed the court and by mute yet stately gestures invited the company to follow And the company did follow in haste with scramble and rudeness as is the way of European manners nowadays and presently having been relieved of their cloaks and wrappings stood startled and confounded in a huge hall richly adorned with silk and cloth of gold hangings where between two bronze sphinxes the Princess Ziska attired wonderfully in a dim pale rose color with flecks of jewels flashing from her draperies here and there waited to receive her guests Like a queen she stood behind her towered a giant palm and at her feet were strewn roses and lotus lilies On either side of her seated on the ground were young girls gorgeously clad and veiled to the eyes in the Egyptian fashion and as the staring heated and impetuous swarm of travelling English and Americans came face to face with her in her marvellous beauty they were for the moment stricken spellbound and could scarcely summon up the necessary assurance to advance and take the hand she outstretched to them in welcome She appeared not to see the general embarrassment and greeted all who approached her with courteous ease and composure speaking the few words which every graceful hostess deems adequate before passing on her visitors And presently music began music wild and fantastic of a character unknown to modern fashionable ears yet strangely familiar to Armand Gervase who started at the first sound of it and seemed enthralled That is not an ordinary orchestra said doctor Dean in his ear The instruments are ancient and the form of melody is barbaric Gervase answered nothing for the Princess Ziska just then approached them Come into the Red Saloon she said I am persuading my guests to pass on there I have an old bas relief on the walls which I would like you to see you especially doctor Dean for you are so learned in antiquities I hear you are trying to discover traces of Araxes I am replied the Doctor You interested me very much in his history He was a great man said the Princess slowly piloting them as she spoke without hurry and with careful courtesy through the serried ranks of the now freely chattering and animated company Much greater than any of your modern heroes But he had two faults faults which frequently accompany the plentitude of power cruelty and selfishness He betrayed and murdered the only woman that ever loved him Ziska Charmazel Murdered her exclaimed doctor Dean How Oh it is only a legend and the Princess smiled turning her dark eyes with a bewitching languor on Gervase who for some reason or other which he could not explain felt as if he were walking in a dream on the edge of a deep chasm of nothingness into which he must presently sink to utter destruction All these old histories happened so long ago that they are nothing but myths now to the present generation Time does not rob any incident of its interest to me said doctor Dean Ages hence Queen Victoria will be as much a doubtful potentate as King Lud To the wise student of things there is no time and no distance All history from the very beginning is like a wonderful chain in which no link is ever really broken and in which every part fits closely to the other part though why the chain should exist at all is a mystery we cannot solve Yet I am quite certain that even our late friend Araxes has his connection with the present if only for the reason that he lived in the past How do you argue out that theory asked Gervase with sudden interest How do you argue it The question is how can you argue at all about anything that is so plain and demonstrated a fact The doctrine of evolution proves it Everything that we were once has its part in us now Suppose if you like that we were originally no more than shells on the shore some remnant of the nature of the shell must be in us at this moment Nothing is lost nothing is wasted not even a thought I carry my theories very far pursued the Doctor looking keenly from one to the other of his silent companions as they walked beside him through a long corridor towards the Red Saloon which could be seen brilliantly lit up and thronged with people Very far indeed especially in regard to matters of love I maintain that if it is decreed that the soul of a man and the soul of a woman must meet must rush together not all the forces of the universe can hinder them aye even if they were for some conventional cause or circumstance themselves reluctant to consummate their destiny it would nevertheless despite them be consummated For mark you in some form or other they have rushed together before Whether as flames in the air or twining leaves on a tree or flowers in a field they have felt the sweetness and fitness of each other s being in former lives and the craving sense of that sweetness and fitness can never be done away with never Not as long as this present universe lasts It is a terrible thing continued the Doctor in a lower tone a terrible fatality the desire of love In some cases it is a curse in others a divine and priceless blessing The results depend entirely on the temperaments of the human creatures possessed by its fever When it kindles rises and burns towards Heaven in a steady flame of ever brightening purity and faith then it makes marriage the most perfect union on earth the sweetest and most blessed companionship but when it is a mere gust of fire bright and fierce as the sudden leaping light of a volcano then it withers everything at a touch faith honor truth and dies into dull ashes in which no spark remains to warm or inspire man s higher nature Better death than such a love for it works misery on earth but who can tell what horrors it may not create Hereafter The Princess looked at him with a strange weird gleam in her dark eyes You are right she said It is just the Hereafter that men never think of I am glad you at least acknowledge the truth of the life beyond death I am bound to acknowledge it returned the Doctor inasmuch as I know it exists Gervase glanced at him with a smile in which there was something of contempt You are very much behind the age Doctor he remarked lightly Very much behind indeed agreed doctor Dean composedly The age rushes on too rapidly for me and gives no time to the consideration of things by the way I stop I take breathing space in which to think life without thought is madness and I desire to have no part in a mad age At that moment they entered the Red Saloon a stately apartment which was entirely modelled after the most ancient forms of Egyptian architecture The centre of the vast room was quite clear of furniture so that the Princess Ziska s guests went wandering up and down to and fro entirely at their ease without crush or inconvenience and congregated in corners for conversation though if they chose they could recline on low divans and gorgeously cushioned benches ranged against the walls and sheltered by tall palms and flowering exotics The music was heard to better advantage here than in the hall where the company had first been received and as the Princess moved to a seat under the pale green frondage of a huge tropical fern and bade her two companions sit beside her sounds of the wildest most melancholy and haunting character began to palpitate upon the air in the mournful throbbing fashion in which a nightingale sings when its soul is burdened with love The passionate tremor that shakes the bird s throat at mating time seemed to shake the unseen instruments that now discoursed strange melody and Gervase listening dreamily felt a curious contraction and aching at his heart and a sense of suffocation in his throat combined with an insatiate desire to seize in his arms the mysterious Ziska with her dark fathomless eyes and slight yet voluptuous form to drag her to his breast and crush her there whispering Mine mine By all the gods of the past and present mine Who shall tear her from me who dispute my right to love her ruin her murder her if I choose She is mine The bas relief I told you of is just above us said the Princess then addressing herself to the Doctor would you like to examine it One of the servants shall bring you a lighted taper and by passing it in front of the sculpture you will be able to see the design better Ah mister Murray and she smiled as she greeted Denzil who just then approached You are in time to give us your opinion I want doctor Dean to see that very old piece of stone carving on the wall above us it will serve as a link for him in the history of Araxes Indeed murmured Denzil somewhat abstractedly The Princess glanced at his brooding face and laughed You I know are not interested at all in old history she went on The past has no attraction for you No The present is enough he replied with a glance of mingled hope and passion She smiled and signing to one of her Egyptian attendants bade him bring a lighted taper He did so and passed it slowly up and down and to the right and left of the large piece of ancient sculpture that occupied more than half the wall while doctor Dean stood by spectacles on nose to examine the carving as closely as possible Several other people attracted by what was going on paused to look also and the Princess undertook to explain the scene depicted This piece of carving is of the date of the King Amenhotep or Amenophis III of the Eighteenth Dynasty It represents the return of the warrior Araxes a favorite servant of the king s after some brilliant victory You see there is the triumphal car in which he rides drawn by winged horses and behind him are the solar deities Ra Sikar Tmu and Osiris He is supposed to be approaching his palace in triumph the gates are thrown open to receive him and coming out to meet him is the chief favorite of his harem the celebrated dancer of that period Ziska Charmazel Whom he afterwards murdered you say queried doctor Dean meditatively Yes He murdered her simply because she loved him too well and was in the way of his ambition There was nothing astonishing in his behavior not even if you consider it in the light of modern times Men always murder morally if not physically the women who love them too well You truly think that asked Denzil Murray in a low tone I not only truly think it I truly know it she answered with a disdainful flash of her eyes Of course I speak of strong men with strong passions they are the only kind of men women ever worship Of course a weak good natured man is different he would probably not harm a woman for the world or give her the least cause for pain if he could help it but that sort of man never becomes either an adept or a master in love Araxes was probably both No doubt he considered he had a perfect right to slay what he had grown weary of he thought no more than men of his type think to day that the taking of a life demands a life in exchange if not in this world then in the next The group of people near her were all silent gazing with an odd fascination at the quaint and ancient sculptured figures above them when all at once doctor Dean taking the taper from the hands of the Egyptian servant held the flame close to the features of the warrior riding in the car of triumph and said slowly Do you not see a curious resemblance Princess between this Araxes and a friend of ours here present Monsieur Armand Gervase will you kindly step forward Yes that will do turn your head slightly so Yes Now observe the outline of the features of Araxes as carven in this sculpture thousands of years ago and compare it with the outline of the features of our celebrated friend the greatest French artist of his day Am I the only one who perceives the remarkable similarity of contour and expression The Princess made no reply A smile crossed her lips but no word escaped them Several persons however pressed eagerly forward to look at and comment upon what was indeed a startling likeness The same straight fierce brows the same proud firm mouth the same almond shaped eyes were as it seemed copied from the ancient entablature and repeated in flesh and blood in the features of Gervase Even Denzil Murray absorbed though he was in conflicting thoughts of his own was struck by the coincidence It is really very remarkable he said Allowing for the peculiar style of drawing and design common to ancient Egypt the portrait of Araxes might pass for Gervase in Egyptian costume Gervase himself was silent Some mysterious emotion held him mute and he was only aware of a vague irritation that fretted him without any seemingly adequate cause doctor Dean meanwhile pursued his investigations with the lighted taper and presently turning round on the assembled little group of bystanders he said I have just discovered another singular thing The face of the woman here the dancer and favorite is the face of our charming hostess the Princess Ziska Exclamations of wonder greeted this announcement and everybody craned their necks to see And then the Princess spoke slowly and languidly Yes she murmured I was hoping you would perceive that I myself noticed how very like me is the famous Ziska Charmazel and that is just why I dressed in her fashion for the fancy ball the other evening It seemed to me the best thing to do as I wanted to choose an ancient period and then you know I bear half her name doctor Dean looked at her keenly and a somewhat grim smile wrinkled his lips You could not have done better he declared You and the dancing girl of Araxes might be twin sisters He lowered the taper he held that it might more strongly illumine her face and as the outline of her head and throat and bust was thrown into full relief Gervase staring at her was again conscious of that sudden painful emotion of familiarity which had before overwhelmed him and he felt that in all the world he had no such intimate knowledge of any woman as he had of Ziska He knew her Ah how did he NOT know her Every curve of that pliant form was to him the living memory of something once possessed and loved and he pressed his hand heavily across his eyes for a moment to shut out the sight of all the exquisite voluptuous grace which shook his self control and tempted him almost beyond man s mortal endurance Are you not well Monsieur Gervase said doctor Dean observing him closely and handing back the lighted taper to the Egyptian servant who waited to receive it The portraits on this old carving have perhaps affected you unpleasantly Yet there is really nothing of importance in such a coincidence Nothing of importance perhaps but surely something of singularity interrupted Denzil Murray especially in the resemblance between the Princess and the dancing girl of that ancient period their features are positively line for line alike The Princess laughed Yes is it not curious she said and taking the taper from her servant she sprang lightly on one of the benches near the wall and leaned her beautiful head on the entablature so that her profile stood out close against that of the once reputed Ziska Charmazel We are as doctor Dean says twins Several of the guests had now gathered together in that particular part of the room and they all looked up at her as she stood thus in silent and somewhat superstitious wonderment The fascinating dancer famed in ages past and the lovely living charmeresse of the present were the image of each other and so extraordinary was the resemblance that it was almost what some folks would term uncanny The fair Ziska did not however give her acquaintances time for much meditation or surprise concerning the matter for she soon came down from her elevation near the sculptured frieze and extinguishing the taper she held she said lightly As doctor Dean has remarked there is really nothing of importance in the coincidence Ages ago in the time of Araxes roses must have bloomed and who shall say that a rose in to day s garden is not precisely the same in size scent and color as one that Araxes himself plucked at his palace gates Thus if flowers are born alike in different ages why not women and men Very well argued Princess said the Doctor I quite agree with you Nature is bound to repeat some of her choicest patterns lest she should forget the art of making them There was now a general movement among the guests that particular kind of movement which means irritability and restlessness and implies that either supper must be immediately served or else some novel entertainment be brought in to distract attention and prevent tedium The Princess turning to Gervase said smilingly Apropos of the dancing girl of Araxes and the art of dancing generally I am going to entertain the company presently by letting them see a real old dance of Thebes If you will excuse me a moment I must just prepare them and get the rooms slightly cleared I will return to you presently She glided away with her usual noiseless grace and within a few minutes of her departure the gay crowds began to fall back against the walls and disperse themselves generally in expectant groups here and there the Egyptian servants moving in and out and evidently informing them of the entertainment in prospect Well I shall stay here said doctor Dean underneath this remarkable stone carving of your warrior prototype Monsieur Gervase You seem very much abstracted I asked you before if you were not well but you never answered me I am perfectly well replied Gervase with some irritation The heat is rather trying that is all But I attach no importance to that stone frieze One can easily imagine likenesses where there are really none True and the Doctor smiled to himself and said no more Just then a wild burst of music sounded suddenly through the apartment and he turned round in lively anticipation to watch the proceedings The middle of the room was now quite clear and presently moving with the silent grace of swans on still water came four girls closely veiled carrying quaintly shaped harps and lutes A Nubian servant followed them and spread a gold embroidered carpet upon the ground whereon they all sat down and began to thrum the strings of their instruments in a muffled dreamy manner playing a music which had nothing of melody in it and which yet vaguely suggested a passionate tune This thrumming went on for some time when all at once from a side entrance in the hall a bright apparently winged thing bounded from the outer darkness into the centre of the hall a woman clad in glistening cloth of gold and veiled entirely in misty folds of white who raising her arms gleaming with jewelled bangles high above her head remained poised on tiptoe for a moment as though about to fly Her bare feet white and dimpled sparkled with gems and glittering anklets her skirts as she moved showed fluttering flecks of white and pink like the leaves of May blossoms shaken by a summer breeze the music grew louder and wilder and a brazen clang from unseen cymbals prepared her as it seemed for flight She began her dance slowly gliding mysteriously from side to side anon turning suddenly with her head lifted as though listening for some word of love which should recall her or command then bending down again she seemed to float lazily like a creature that was dancing in a dream without conscious knowledge of her actions The brazen cymbals clashed again and then with a wild beautiful movement like that of a hunted stag leaping the brow of a hill the dancer sprang forward turned pirouetted and tossed herself round and round giddily with a marvellous and exquisite celerity as if she were nothing but a bright circle of gold spinning in clear ether Spontaneous applause broke forth from every part of the hall the guests crowded forward staring and almost breathless with amazement doctor Dean got up in a state of the greatest excitement clapping his hands involuntarily and Gervase every nerve in his body quivering advanced one or two steps feeling that he must stop this bright wild wanton thing in her incessant whirling or else die in the hunger of love which consumed his soul Denzil Murray glanced at him and after a pause left his side and disappeared Suddenly with a quick movement the dancer loosened her golden dress and misty veil and tossing them aside like falling leaves she stood confessed a marvellous glowing vision in silvery white no other than the Princess Ziska Shouts echoed from every part of the hall Ziska Ziska And at the name Lady Chetwynd Lyle rose in all her majesty from the seat she had occupied till then and in tones of virtuous indignation said to Lady Fulkeward I told you the Princess was not a proper person Now it is proved I am right To think I should have brought Dolly and Muriel here I shall really never forgive myself Come Sir Chetwynd let us leave this place instantly And stout Sir Chetwynd gloating on the exquisite beauty of the Princess Ziska s form as she still danced on in her snowy white attire her lovely face alight with mirth at the surprise she had made for her guests tried his best to look sanctimonious and signally failed in the attempt as he answered Certainly Certainly my dear Most improper most astonishing While Lady Fulkeward answered innocently Is it Do you really think so Oh dear I suppose it is improper it must be you know but it is most delightful and original And while the Chetwynd Lyles thus moved to depart in a cloud of outraged propriety followed by others who likewise thought it well to pretend to be shocked at the proceeding Gervase dizzy breathless and torn by such conflicting passions as he could never express was in a condition more mad than sane My God he muttered under his breath This this is love This is the beginning and end of life To possess her to hold her in my arms heart to heart lips to lips this is what all the eternal forces of Nature meant when they made me man And he watched with strained passionate eyes the movements of the Princess Ziska as they grew slower and slower till she seemed floating merely like a foam bell on a wave and then from some unseen quarter of the room a rich throbbing voice began to sing Oh for the passionless peace of the Lotus Lily It floats in a waking dream on the waters chilly With its leaves unfurled To the wondering world Knowing naught of the sorrow and restless pain That burns and tortures the human brain Oh for the passionless peace of the Lotus Lily Oh for the pure cold heart of the Lotus Lily Bared to the moon on the waters dark and chilly A star above Is its only love And one brief sigh of its scented breath Is all it will ever know of Death Oh for the pure cold heart of the Lotus Lily As the sound died away in a sigh rather than a note the Princess Ziska s dancing ceased altogether A shout of applause broke from all assembled and in the midst of it there was a sudden commotion and excitement and doctor Dean was seen bending over a man s prostrate figure The great French painter Armand Gervase had suddenly fainted CHAPTER XII A curious yet very general feeling of superstitious uneasiness and discomfort pervaded the Gezireh Palace Hotel the day after the Princess Ziska s reception Something had happened and no one knew what The proprieties had been outraged but no one knew why It was certainly not the custom for a hostess and a Princess to boot to dance like a wild bacchante before a crowd of her invited guests yet as doctor Dean blandly observed Where was the harm In London ladies of good birth and breeding went in for skirt dancing and no one presumed to breathe a word against their reputations why in Cairo should not a lady go in for a Theban dance without being considered improper Why indeed There seemed no adequate reason for being either surprised or offended yet surprised and offended most people were and scandal ran rife and rumor wagged all its poisonous tongues to spread evil reports against the Princess Ziska s name and fame till Denzil Murray maddened and furious rushed up to his sister in her room and swore that he would marry the Princess if he died for it They are blackguarding her downstairs the beasts he said hotly They are calling her by every bad name under the sun But I will make everything straight for her she shall be my wife If she will have me I will marry her to morrow Helen looked at him in speechless despair Oh Denzil she faltered and then could say no more for the tears that blinded her eyes Oh yes of course I know what you mean he continued marching up and down the room excitedly You are like all the others you think her an adventuress I think her the purest the noblest of women There is where we differ I spoke to her last night I told her I loved her You did and Helen gazed at him with wet tragic eyes And she She bade me be silent She told me I must not speak not yet She said she would give me her answer when we were all together at the Mena House Hotel You intend to be one of the party there then said Helen faintly Of course I do And so do you I hope No Denzil I cannot Don t ask me I will stay here with Lady Fulkeward She is not going nor are the Chetwynd Lyles I shall be quite safe with them I would rather not go to the Mena House I could not bear it Her voice gave way entirely and she broke out crying bitterly Denzil stood still and regarded her with a kind of sullen shame and remorse What a very sympathetic sister you are he observed When you see me madly in love with a woman a perfectly beautiful adorable woman you put yourself at once in the way and make out that my marriage with her will be a misery to you You surely do not expect me to remain single all my life do you No Denzil sobbed Helen but I had hoped to see you marry some sweet girl of our own land who would be your dear and true companion who would be a sister to me who there don t mind me Be happy in your own way my dear brother I have no business to interfere I can only say that if the Princess Ziska consents to marry you I will do my best to like her for your sake Well that s something at any rate said Denzil with an air of relief Don t cry Helen it bothers me As for the sweet girl you have got in view for me you will permit me to say that sweet girls are becoming uncommonly scarce in Britain What with bicycle riders and great rough tomboys generally with large hands and larger feet I confess I do not care about them I like a womanly woman a graceful woman a fascinating bewitching woman and the Princess is all that and more Surely you consider her beautiful Very beautiful indeed sighed poor Helen Too beautiful Nonsense As if any woman can be too beautiful I am sorry you won t come to the Mena House It would be a change for you and Gervase is going Is he better to day inquired Helen timidly Oh I believe he is quite well again It was the heat or the scent of the flowers or something of that sort that made him faint last night He is not acclimatized yet you know And he said that the Princess s dancing made him giddy I don t wonder at that murmured Helen It was marvellous glorious said Denzil dreamily It was like nothing else ever seen or imagined If she were your wife would you care for her to dance before people inquired Helen tremblingly Denzil turned upon her in haughty wrath How like a woman that is To insinuate a nasty suggestion to imply an innuendo without uttering it If she were my wife she would do nothing unbecoming that position Then you did think it a little unbecoming persisted Helen No I did NOT said Denzil sharply An independent woman may do many things that a married woman may not Marriage brings its own duties and responsibilities time enough to consider them when they come He turned angrily on his heel and left her and Helen burying her fair face in her hands wept long and unrestrainedly This strange woman out of Egypt had turned her brother s heart against her and stolen away her almost declared lover It was no wonder that her tears fell fast wrung from her with the pain of this double wound for Helen though quiet and undemonstrative had fine feelings and unsounded depths of passion in her nature and the fatal attraction she felt for Armand Gervase was more powerful than she had herself known Now that he had openly confessed his infatuation for another woman it seemed as though the earth had opened at her feet and shown her nothing but a grave in which to fall Life empty and blank and bare of love and tenderness stretched before her imagination she saw herself toiling along the monotonously even road of duty till her hair became gray and her face thin and wan and wrinkled and never a gleam again of the beautiful glowing romantic passion that for a short time had made her days splendid with the dreams that are sweeter than all realities Poor Helen It was little marvel that she wept as all women weep when their hearts are broken It is so easy to break a heart sometimes a mere word will do it But the vanishing of the winged Love god from the soul is even more than heart break it is utter and irretrievable loss complete and dominating chaos out of which no good thing can ever be designed or created In our days we do our best to supply the place of a reluctant Eros by the gilded grinning Mammon figure which we try to consider as superior to any silver pinioned god that ever descended in his rainbow car to sing heavenly songs to mortals but it is an unlovely substitute a hideous idol at best and grasp its golden knees and worship it as we will it gives us little or no comfort in the hours of strong temptation or trouble We have made a mistake we in our progressive generation we have banished the old sweetnesses triumphs and delights of life and we have got in exchange steam and electricity But the heart of the age clamors on unsatisfied none of our new ideas content it nothing pacifies its restless yearning it feels this great heart of human life that it is losing more than it gains hence the incessant restless aching of the time and the perpetual longing for something Science cannot teach something vague beautiful indefinable yet satisfying to every pulse of the soul and the nearest emotion to that divine solace is what we in our higher and better moments recognize as Love And Love was lost to Helen Murray the choice pearl had fallen in the vast gulf of Might have been and not all the forces of Nature would ever restore to her that priceless gem And while she wept to herself in solitude and her brother Denzil wandered about in the gardens of the hotel encouraging within himself hopes of winning the bewitching Ziska for a wife Armand Gervase shut up in his room under plea of slight indisposition reviewed the emotions of the past night and tired to analyze them Some men are born self analysts and are able to dissect their feelings by some peculiar form of mental surgery which finally leads them to cut out tenderness as though it were a cancer love as a disease and romantic aspirations as mere uncomfortable growths injurious to self interest but Gervase was not one of these Outwardly he assumed more or less the composed and careless demeanor of the modern French cynic but inwardly the man was a raging fire of fierce passions which were sometimes too strong to be held in check At the present moment he was prepared to sacrifice everything even life itself to obtain possession of the woman he coveted and he made no attempt whatever to resist the tempest of desire that was urging him on with an invincible force in a direction which for some strange and altogether inexplicable reason he dreaded Yes there was a dim sense of terror lurking behind all the wild passion that filled his soul a haunting vague idea that this sudden love with its glowing ardor and intoxicating delirium was like the brilliant red sunset which frequently prognosticates a night of storm ruin and death Yet though he felt this presentiment like a creeping shudder of cold through his blood it did not hold him back or for a moment impress him with the idea that it might be better to yield no further to this desperate love madness which enthralled him Once only he thought What if I left Egypt now at once and saw her no more And then he laughed scornfully at the impossibility proposed Leave Egypt he muttered I might as well leave the world altogether She would draw me back with those sweet wild eyes of hers she would drag me from the uttermost parts of the earth to fall at her feet in a very agony of love My God She must have her way and do with me as she will for I feel that she holds my life in her hands As he spoke these last words half aloud he sprang up from the chair in which he had been reclining and stood for a moment lost in frowning meditation My life in her hands he repeated musingly Yes it has come to that My life A great sigh broke from him My life my art my work my name In all these things I have taken pride and she she can trample them under her feet and make of me nothing more than man clamoring for woman s love What a wild world it is What a strange Force must that be which created it the Force that some men call God and others Devil A strange blind brute Force for it makes us aspire only to fall it gives a man dreams of ambition and splendid attainment only to fling him like a mad fool on a woman s breast and bid him find there and there only the bewildering sweetness which makes everything else in existence poor and tame in comparison Well well my life What is it A mere grain of sand dropped in the sea let her do with it as she will God How I felt her power upon me last night last night when her lithe figure swaying in the dance reminded me He paused startled at the turn his own thoughts were taking Of what Let me try and express to myself now what I could not express or realize last night She Ziska I thought was mine mine from her dimpled feet to her dusky hair and she danced for me alone It seemed that the jewels she wore upon her rounded arms and slender ankles were all love gifts from me every circlet of gold every starry shining gem on her fair body was the symbol of some secret joy between us joy so keen as to be almost pain And as she danced I thought I was in a vast hall of a majestic palace where open colonnades revealed wide glimpses of a burning desert and deep blue sky I heard the distant sound of rolling drums and not far off I saw the Sphinx a creature not old but new resting upon a giant pedestal and guarding the sculptured gate of some great temple which contained as I then thought all the treasures of the world I could paint the picture as I saw it then It was a fleeting impression merely conjured up by the dance that dizzied my brain And that song of the Lotus lily That was strange very strange for I thought I had heard it often before and I saw myself in the vague dream a prince a warrior almost a king and far more famous in the world than I am now He looked about him uneasily with a kind of nervous terror and his eyes rested for a moment on the easel where the picture he had painted of the Princess was placed covered from view by a fold of dark cloth Bah he exclaimed at last with a forced laugh What stupid fancies fool me It is all the vague talk of that would be learned ass doctor Dean with his ridiculous theories about life and death I shall be imagining I am his fad Araxes next This sort of thing will never do Let me reason out the matter calmly I love this woman love her to absolute madness It is not the best kind of love maybe but it is the only kind I am capable of and such as it is she possesses it all What then Well We go to morrow to the Pyramids and we join her at the Mena House I and the poor boy Denzil He will try his chance I mine If he wins I shall kill him as surely as I myself live yes even though he is Helen s brother No man shall snatch Ziska from my arms and continue to breathe If I win it is possible he may kill me and I shall respect him for trying to do it But I shall satisfy my love first Ziska will be mine mine in every sense of possession before I die Yes that must be that will have to be And afterwards why let Denzil do his worst a man can but die once He drew the cloth off his easel and stared at the strange picture of the Princess which seemed almost sentient in its half watchful half mocking expression There is a dead face and a living one on this canvas he said and the dead face seems to enthral me as much as the living Both have the same cruel smile both the same compelling magnetism of eye Only it is a singular thing that I should know the dead face even more intimately than the living that the tortured look upon it should be a kind of haunting memory horrible ghastly He flung the cloth over the easel again impatiently and tried to laugh at his own morbid imagination I know who is responsible for all this nonsense he said It is that ridiculous little half mad faddist doctor Dean He is going to the Mena House too Well he will be the witness of a comedy or a tragedy there and Heaven alone knows which it will be And to distract his thoughts from dwelling any longer on the haunting ideas that perplexed him he took up one of the latest and frothiest of French novels and began to read Some one in a room not far off was singing a French song a man with a rich baritone voice and unconsciously to himself Gervase caught the words as they rang out full and clearly on the quiet heated air O toi que j ai tant aimee Songes tu que je t aime encor Et dans ton ame alarmee Ne sens tu pas quelque remord Viens avec moi si tu m aimes Habiter dans ces deserts Nous y vivrons pour nous memes Oublies de tout l univers And something like a mist of tears clouded his aching eyes as he repeated half mechanically and dreamily O toi que j ai tant aimee Songes tu que je t aime encor CHAPTER XIII For the benefit of those among the untravelled English who have not yet broken a soda water bottle against the Sphinx or eaten sandwiches to the immortal memory of Cheops it may be as well to explain that the Mena House Hotel is a long rambling roomy building situated within five minutes walk of the Great Pyramid and happily possessed of a golfing ground and a marble swimming bath That ubiquitous nuisance the amateur photographer can there have his dark room for the development of his more or less imperfect plates and there is a resident chaplain for the piously inclined With a chaplain and a dark room what more can the aspiring soul of the modern tourist desire Some of the rooms at the Mena House are small and stuffy others large and furnished with sufficient elegance and the Princess Ziska had secured a suite of the best that could be obtained and was soon installed there with befitting luxury She left Cairo quite suddenly and without any visible preparation the morning after the reception in which she had astonished her guests by her dancing and she did not call at the Gezireh Palace Hotel to say good bye to any of her acquaintances there She was perhaps conscious that her somewhat free behavior had startled several worthy and sanctimonious persons and possibly she also thought that to take rooms in an hotel which was only an hour s distance from Cairo could scarcely be considered as absenting herself from Cairene society She was followed to her desert retreat by doctor Dean Armand Gervase and Denzil Murray who drove to the Mena House together in one carriage and were more or less all three in a sober and meditative frame of mind They arrived in time to see the Sphinx bathed in the fierce glow of an ardent sunset which turned the golden sands to crimson and made the granite monster look like a cruel idol surrounded by a sea of blood The brilliant red of the heavens flamed in its stony eyes and gave them a sentient look as of contemplated murder and the same radiance fitfully playing on the half scornful half sensual lips caused them to smile with a seeming voluptuous mockery doctor Dean stood transfixed for a while at the strange splendor of the spectacle and turning to his two silent companions said suddenly There is something after all in the unguessed riddle of the Sphinx It is not a fable it is a truth There is a problem to be solved and that monstrous creature knows it The woman s face the brute s body Spiritualism and Materialism in one It is life and more than life it is love Forever and forever it teaches the same wonderful terrible mystery We aspire yet we fall love would fain give us wings wherewith to fly but the wretched body lies prone supine it cannot soar to the Light Eternal What IS the Light Eternal queried Gervase moodily How do we know it exists We cannot prove it This world is what we see we have to do with it and ourselves Soul without body could not exist Could it not said the Doctor How then does body exist without soul This was an unexpected but fair question and Gervase found himself curiously perplexed by it He offered no reply neither did Denzil and they all three slowly entered the Mena House Hotel there to be met with deferential salutations by the urbane and affable landlord and to be assured that they would find their rooms comfortable and also that Madame la Princesse Ziska expected them to dine with her that evening At this message Denzil Murray made a sign to Gervase that he wished to speak to him alone Gervase move aside with him Give me my chance said Denzil fiercely Take it replied Gervase listlessly Let to night witness the interchange of hearts between you and the Princess I shall not interfere Denzil stared at him in sullen astonishment You will not interfere Your fancy for her is at an end Gervase raised his dark glowing eyes and fixed them on his would be rival with a strange and sombre expression My fancy for her My good boy take care what you say Don t rouse me too far for I am dangerous My fancy for her What do you know of it You are hot blooded and young but the chill of the North controls you in a fashion while I a man in the prime of manhood am of the South and the Southern fire brooks no control Have you seen a quiet ocean smooth as glass with only a dimple in the deep blue to show that perhaps should occasion serve there might arise a little wave And have you seen the wild storm breaking from a black cloud and suddenly making that quiet expanse nothing but a tourbillon of furious elements in which the very sea gull s cry is whelmed and lost in the thunder of the billows Such a storm as that may be compared to the fancy you suppose I feel for the woman who has dragged us both here to die at her feet for that I believe is what it will come to Life is not possible under the strain of emotion with which we two are living it He broke off then resumed in quieter tones I say to you Use your opportunities while you have them After dinner I will leave you alone with the Princess I will go out for a stroll with doctor Dean Take your chance Denzil for as I live it is your last It will be my turn next Give me credit for to night s patience He turned quickly away and in a moment was gone Denzil Murray stood still for a while thinking deeply and trying to review the position in which he found himself He was madly in love with a woman for whom his only sister had the most violent antipathy and that sister who had once been all in all to him had now become almost less than nothing in the headstrong passion which consumed him No consideration for her peace and ultimate happiness affected him though he was sensible of a certain remorseful pity when thinking of her gentle ways and docile yielding to his often impatient and impetuous humors but after all she was only his sister she could not understand his present condition of mind Then there was Gervase whom he had for some years looked upon as one of his most admired and intimate friends now he was nothing more or less than a rival and an enemy notwithstanding his seeming courtesy and civil self restraint As a matter of fact he Denzil was left alone to face his fate to dare the brilliant seduction of the witching eyes of Ziska to win her or to lose her forever And consider every point as he would the weary conviction was borne in upon him that whether he met with victory or defeat the result would bring more misery than joy When he entered the Princess s salon that evening he found doctor Dean and Gervase already there The Princess herself attired in a dinner dress made with quite a modern Parisian elegance received him in her usual graceful manner and expressed with much sweetness her hope that the air of the desert would prove beneficial to him after the great heats that had prevailed in Cairo Nothing but conventionalities were spoken Oh those conventionalities What a world of repressed emotions they sometimes cover How difficult it is to conceive that the man and woman who are greeting each other with calm courtesy in a crowded drawing room are the very two who standing face to face in the moonlit silence of some lonely grove of trees or shaded garden once in their lives suddenly realized the wild passion that neither dared confess Tragedies lie deepest under conventionalities such secrets are buried beneath them as sometimes might make the angels weep They are safeguards however against stronger emotions and the strange bathos of two human creatures talking politely about the weather when the soul of each is clamoring for the other has sometimes despite its absurdity saved the situation At dinner the Princess Ziska devoted herself almost entirely to the entertainment of doctor Dean and awakened his interest very keenly on the subject of the Great Pyramid It has never really been explored she said The excavators who imagine they have fathomed its secrets are completely in error The upper chambers are mere deceits to the investigator they were built and planned purposely to mislead and the secrets they hide have never even been guessed at much less discovered Are you sure of that inquired the Doctor eagerly If so would you not give your information I neither give my information nor sell it interrupted the Princess smiling coldly I am only a woman and women are supposed to know nothing With the rest of my sex I am judged illogical and imaginative you wise men would call my knowledge of history deficient my facts not proven But if you like I will tell you the story of the construction of the Great Pyramid and why it is unlikely that anyone will ever find the treasures that are buried within it You can receive the narrative with the usual incredulity common to men I shall not attempt to argue the pros and cons with you because I never argue Treat it as a fairy tale no woman is ever supposed to know anything for a fact she is too stupid Only men are wise Her dark disdainful glance flashed on Gervase and Denzil anon she smiled bewitchingly and added Is it not so Wisdom is nothing compared to beauty said Gervase A beautiful woman can turn the wisest man into a fool The Princess laughed lightly Yes and a moment afterwards he regrets his folly she said He clamors for the beautiful woman as a child might cry for the moon and when he at last possesses her he tires Satisfied with having compassed her degradation he exclaims What shall I do with this beauty which because it is mine now palls upon me Let me kill it and forget it I am aweary of love and the world is full of women That is the way of your sex Monsieur Gervase it is a brutal way but it is the one most of you follow There is such a thing as love said Denzil looking up quickly a pained flush on his handsome face In the hearts of women yes said Ziska her voice growing tremulous with strange and sudden passion Women love ah with what force and tenderness and utter abandonment of self But their love is in ninety nine cases out of a hundred utterly wasted it is a largesse flung to the ungrateful a jewel tossed in the mire If there were not some compensation in the next life for the ruin wrought on loving women the Eternal God himself would be a mockery and a jest And is he not queried Gervase ironically Fair Princess I would not willingly shake your faith in things unseen but what does the Eternal God as you call Him care as to the destiny of any individual unit on this globe of matter Does He interfere when the murderer s knife descends upon the victim And has He ever interfered He it is who created the sexes and placed between them the strong attraction that often works more evil and misery than good and what barrier has He ever interposed between woman and man her natural destroyer None save the trifling one of virtue which is a flimsy thing and often breaks down at the first temptation No my dear Princess the Eternal God if there is one does nothing but look on impassively at the universal havoc of creation And in the blindness and silence of things I cannot recognize an Eternal God at all we were evidently made to eat drink breed and die and there an end What of ambition asked doctor Dean What of the inspiration that lifts a man beyond himself and his material needs and teaches him to strive after the Highest Mere mad folly replied Gervase impetuously Take the Arts I for example dream of painting a picture that shall move the world to admiration but I seldom grasp the idea I have imagined I paint something anything and the world gapes at it and some rich fool buys it leaving me free to paint another something and so on and so on to the end of my career I ask you what satisfaction does it bring What is it to Raphael that thousands of human units cultured and silly have stared at his Madonnas and his famous Cartoons Well we do not exactly know what it may or may not be to Raphael said the Doctor meditatively According to my theories Raphael is not dead but merely removed into another form on another planet possibly and is working elsewhere You might as well ask what it is to Araxes now that he was a famous warrior once Gervase moved uneasily You have got Araxes on the brain Doctor he said with a forced smile and in our conversation we are forgetting that the Princess has promised to tell us a fairytale the story of the Great Pyramid The Princess looked at him then at Denzil Murray and lastly at doctor Dean Would you really care to hear it she asked Most certainly they all three answered She rose from the dinner table Come here to the window she said You can see the great structure now in the dusky light look at it well and try if you can to realize that deep deep down in the earth on which it stands is a connected gallery of rocky caves wherein no human foot has ever penetrated since the Deluge swept over the land and made a desert of all the old time civilization Her slight figure appeared to dilate as she spoke raising one slender hand and arm to point at the huge mass that towered up against the clear starlit sky Her listeners were silent awed and attentive One of the latest ideas concerning the Pyramids is as you know that they were built as towers of defence against the Deluge That is correct The wise men of the old days foretold the time when the waters should rise and cover the earth and these huge monuments were prepared and raised to a height which it was estimated would always appear above the level of the coming flood to show where the treasures of Egypt were hidden for safety Yes the treasures of Egypt the wisdom the science of Egypt They are all down there still And there to all intents and purposes they are likely to remain But archaeologists are of the opinion that the Pyramids have been thoroughly explored began doctor Dean with some excitement The Princess interrupted him by a slight gesture Archaeologists my dear Doctor are like the rest of this world s so called learned men they work in one groove and are generally content with it Sometimes an unusually brilliant brain conceives the erratic notion of working in several grooves and is straightway judged as mad or fanatic It is when these comet like intelligences sweep across the world s horizon that we hear of a Julius Caesar a Napoleon a Shakespeare But archaeologists are the narrowest and dryest of men they preconceive a certain system of work and follow it out by mathematical rule and plan without one touch of imagination to help them to discover new channels of interest or historical information As I told you before I began to speak you are welcome to entirely disbelieve my story of the Great Pyramid but as I have begun it you may as well hear it through She paused a moment then went on According to my information the building of the Pyramids was commenced three hundred years before the Deluge in the time of Saurid the son of Sabaloc who it is said was the first to receive a warning dream of the coming flood Saurid being convinced by his priests astrologers and soothsayers that the portent was a true one became from that time possessed of one idea which was that the vast learning of Egypt its sciences discoveries and strange traditions should not be lost and that the exploits and achievements of those who were great and famous in the land should be so recorded as never to be forgotten In those days here where you see these measureless tracts of sand there were great mountainous rocks and granite quarries and Saurid utilized these for the hollowing out of deep caverns in which to conceal treasure When these caverns were prepared to his liking he caused a floor to be made portions of which were rendered movable by means of secret springs and then leaving a hollow space of some four feet in height he started foundations for another floor above it This upper floor is what you nowadays see when you enter the Pyramid and no one imagines that under it is an open space with room to walk in and yet another floor below where everything of value is secreted doctor Dean drew a long breath of wonderment Astonishing if true The Princess smiled somewhat disdainfully and went on Saurid s work was carried on after his death by his successors and with thousands of slaves toiling night and day the Pyramids were in the course of years raised above the caverns which concealed Egypt s mysteries Everything was gradually accumulated in these underground store houses the engraved talismans the slabs of stone on which were deeply carved the geometrical and astronomical sciences indestructible glass chests containing papyri on which were written the various discoveries made in beneficial drugs swift poisons and other medicines And among these many things were thirty great jars full of precious stones some of which were marvels of the earth They are there still And some of the great men who died were interred in these caves every one in a separate chamber inlaid with gold and gems and I think here the Princess turned her dark eyes full on doctor Dean I think that if you knew the secret way of lifting the apparently immovable floor which is like the solid ground and descending through the winding galleries beneath it is more than probable you would find in the Great Pyramid the tomb of Araxes Her eyes glistened strangely in the evening light with that peculiar fiery glow which had made doctor Dean once describe them as being like the eyes of a vampire bat and there was something curiously impressive in her gesture as she once more pointed to the towering structure which loomed against the heavens with one star flashing immediately above it A sudden involuntary shudder shook Gervase as with icy cold he moved restlessly and presently remarked Well it is a safe tomb at any rate Whoever Araxes was he stands little chance of being exhumed if he lies two floors below the Great Pyramid in a sealed up rocky cavern Princess you look like an inspired prophetess so much talk of ancient and musty times makes me feel uncanny and I will with your permission have a smoke with doctor Dean in the garden to steady my nerves The mere notion of thirty vases of unclaimed precious stones hidden down yonder is enough to upset any man s equanimity The papyri would interest me more than the jewels said doctor Dean What do you say Denzil Denzil Murray woke up suddenly from a fit of abstraction Oh I don t know anything about it he answered I never was very much interested in those old times they seem to me all myth I could never link past present and future together as some people can they are to me all separate things The past is done with the present is our own to enjoy or to detest and the future no man can look into Ah Denzil you are young and reflection has not been very hard at work in that headstrong brain of yours said doctor Dean with an indulgent smile otherwise you would see that past present and future are one and indissoluble The past is as much a part of your present identity as the present and the future too lies in you in embryo The mystery of one man s life contains all mysteries and if we could only understand it from its very beginning we should find out the cause of all things and the ultimate intention of creation Well now you have all had enough serious talk said the Princess Ziska lightly so let us adjourn to the drawing room One of my waiting women shall sing to you by and by she has a very sweet voice Is it she who sings that song about the lotus lily asked Gervase suddenly The Princess smiled strangely Yes it is she doctor Dean chose a cigar from a silver box on the table Gervase did the same Won t you smoke Denzil he asked carelessly No thanks Denzil spoke hurriedly and hoarsely I think if the Princess will permit me I will stay and talk with her in the drawing room while you two have your smoke together The Princess gave a charming bow of assent to this proposition Gervase took the Doctor somewhat roughly by the arm and led him out through the open French window into the grounds beyond remarking as he went You will excuse us Princess We leave you in good company She smiled I will excuse you certainly But do not be long And she passed from the dining room into the small saloon beyond followed closely by Denzil Once out in the grounds Gervase gave vent to a boisterous fit of wild laughter so loud and fierce that little doctor Dean came to an abrupt standstill and stared at him in something of alarm as well as amazement Are you going mad Gervase he asked Yes cried Gervase that is just it I am going mad mad for love or whatever you please to call it What do you think I am made of Flesh and blood or cast iron Heavens Do you think if all the elements were to combine in a war against me they should cheat me out of this woman or rob me of her No no A thousand times no Satisfy yourself my excellent Doctor with your musty records of the past prate as you choose of the future but in the immediate burning active present my will is law And the fool Denzil thinks to thwart me I who have never been thwarted since I knew the meaning of existence He paused in a kind of breathless agitation and doctor Dean grasped his arm firmly Come come what is all this excitement for he said What are you saying about Denzil Gervase controlled himself with a violent effort and forced a smile He has got his chance I have given it to him He is alone with the Princess and he is asking her to be his wife Nonsense said the Doctor sharply If he does commit such a folly it will be no use The woman is NOT HUMAN Not human echoed Gervase his black eyes dilating with a sudden amazement What do you mean The little Doctor rubbed his nose impatiently and seemed sorry he had spoken I mean let me see What do I mean he said at last meditatively Oh well it is easy enough of explanation There are plenty of people like the Princess Ziska to whom I would apply the words not human She is all beauty and no heart Again if you follow me she is all desire and no passion which is a character like unto the beasts which perish A large majority of men are made so and some women though the women are comparatively few Now so far as the Princess Ziska is concerned continued the Doctor fixing his keen penetrative glance on Gervase as he spoke I frankly admit to you that I find in her material for a very curious and complex study That is why I have come after her here I have said she is all desire and no passion That of itself is inhuman but what I am busy about now is to try and analyze the nature of the particular desire that moves her controls her keeps her alive in short It is not love of that I feel confident and it is not hate though it is more like hate than love It is something indefinable something that is almost occult so deep seated and bewildering is the riddle You look upon me as a madman yes I know you do But mad or sane I emphatically repeat the Princess is NOT HUMAN and by this expression I wish to imply that though she has the outward appearance of a most beautiful and seductive human body she has the soul of a fiend Now do you understand me It would take Oedipus himself all his time to do that said Gervase forcing a laugh which had no mirth in it for he was conscious of a vaguely unpleasant sensation a chill as of some dark presentiment which oppressed his mind When you know I do not believe in the soul why do you talk to me about it The soul of a fiend the soul of an angel what are they Mere empty terms to me meaning nothing I think I agree with you though in one or two points concerning the Princess par exemple I do not look upon her as one of those delicately embodied purities of womanhood before whom we men instinctively bend in reverence but whom at the same time we generally avoid ashamed of our vileness No she is certainly not one of the Maiden roses left to die Because they climb so near the sky That not the boldest passer by Can pluck them from their vantage high And whether it is best to be a solitary maiden rose or a Princess Ziska who shall say And human or inhuman whatever composition she is made of you may make yourself positively certain that Denzil Murray is just now doing his best to persuade her to be a Highland chatelaine in the future Heavens what a strange fate it will be for la belle Egyptienne Oh you think she IS Egyptian then queried doctor Dean with an air of lively curiosity Of course I do She has the Egyptian type of form and countenance Consider only the resemblance between her and the dancer she chose to represent the other night the Ziska Charmazel of the antique sculpture on her walls Ay but if you grant one resemblance you must also admit another said the Doctor quickly The likeness between yourself and the old world warrior Araxes is no less remarkable Gervase moved uneasily and a sudden pallor blanched his face making it look wan and haggard in the light of the rising moon And it is rather singular went on the imperturbable savant that according to the legend or history whichever you please to consider it for in time legends become histories and histories legends Araxes should have been the lover of this very Ziska Charmazel and that you who are the living portrait of Araxes should suddenly become enamored of the equally living portrait of the dead woman You must own that to a mere onlooker and observer like myself it seems a curious coincidence Gervase smoked on in silence his level brows contracted in a musing frown Yes it seems curious he said at last but a great many curious coincidences happen in this world so many that we in our days of rush and turmoil have not time to consider them as they come or go Perhaps of all the strange things in life the sudden sympathies and the headstrong passions which spring up in a day or a night between certain men and certain women are the strangest I look upon you Doctor as a very clever fellow with just a little twist in his brain or let us say a fad about spiritual matters but in one of your more or less fantastic and extravagant theories I am half disposed to believe and that is the notion you have of the possibility of some natures male and female having met before in a previous state of existence and under different forms such as birds flowers or forest animals or even mere incorporeal breaths of air and flame It is an idea which I confess fascinates me It seems fairly reasonable too for as many scientists argue that you cannot destroy matter but only transform it there is really nothing impossible in the suggestion He paused then added slowly as he flung the end of his cigar away I have felt the force of this odd fancy of yours most strongly since I met the Princess Ziska Indeed Then the impression she gave you first is still upon you that of having known her before Gervase waited a minute or two before replying then he answered Yes And not only of having known her before but of having loved her before Love mon Dieu what a tame word it is How poorly it expresses the actual emotion Fire in the veins delirium in the brain reason gone to chaos And this madness is mildly described as love There are other words for it said the Doctor Words that are not so poetic but which perhaps are more fitting No interrupted Gervase almost fiercely There are no words which truly describe this one emotion which rules the world I know what YOU mean of course you mean evil words licentious words and yet it has nothing whatever to do with these You cannot call such an exalted state of the nerves and sensations by an evil name doctor Dean pondered the question for a few moments No I am not sure that I can he said meditatively If I did I should have to give an evil name to the Creator who designed man and woman and ordained the law of attraction which draws and often DRAGS them together I like to be fair to everybody the Creator included yet to be fair to everybody I shall appear to sanction immorality For the fact is that our civilization has upset all the original intentions of nature Nature evidently meant Love or the emotion we call Love to be the keynote of the universe But apparently Nature did not intend marriage The flowers the birds the lower animals mate afresh every spring and this is the creed that the disciples of Naturalism nowadays are anxious to force upon the attention of the world It is only men and women they say that are so foolish as to take each other for better or worse till death do them part Now I should like from the physical scientist s point of view to prove that the men and women are wrong and that the lower animals are right but spiritual science comes in and confutes me For in spiritual science I find this truth which will not be gainsaid namely that from time immemorial certain immortal forms of Nature have been created solely for one another like two halves of a circle they are intended to meet and form the perfect round and all the elements of creation spiritual and material will work their hardest to pull them together Such natures I consider should absolutely and imperatively be joined in marriage It then becomes a divine decree Even grant if you like that the natures so joined are evil and that the sympathy between them is of a more or less reprehensible character it is quite as well that they should unite and that the result of such an union should be seen The evil might come out of them in a family of criminals which the law could exterminate with advantage to the world in general Whereas on the other hand given two fine and aspiring natures with perfect sympathy between them as perfect as the two notes of a perfect chord the children of such a marriage would probably be as near gods as humanity could bring them I speak as a scientist merely Such consequences are not foreseen by the majority and marriages as a rule take place between persons who are by no means made for each other Besides a kind of devil comes into the business and often prevents the two sympathetic natures conjoining Love matters alone are quite sufficient to convince me that there IS a devil as well as a divinity that shapes our ends You speak as if you yourself had loved Doctor said Gervase with a half smile And so I have replied the Doctor calmly I have loved to the full as passionately and ardently as even you can love I thank God the woman I loved died I could never have possessed her for she was already wedded and I would not have disgraced her by robbing her from her lawful husband So Death stepped in and gave her to me forever and he raised his eyes to the solemn starlit sky Yes nothing can ever come between us now no demon tears her white soul from me she died innocent of evil and she is mine mine in every pulse of her being as we shall both know hereafter His face which was not remarkable for any beauty of feature grew rapt and almost noble in its expression and Gervase looked at him with a faint touch of ironical wonder Upon my word your morality almost outreaches your mysticism he said I see you are one of those old fashioned men who think marriage a sacred sort of thing and the only self respecting form of love Old fashioned I may be replied doctor Dean but I certainly believe in marriage for the woman s sake If the license of men were not restrained by some sort of barrier it would break all bounds Now I had I chosen could have taken the woman I loved to myself it needed but a little skilful persuasion on my part for her husband was a drink sodden ruffian And why in the name of Heaven did you not do so demanded Gervase impatiently Because I know the end of all such liaisons said the Doctor sadly A month or two of delirious happiness then years of remorse to follow The man is lowered in his own secret estimation of himself and the woman is hopelessly ruined socially and morally No Death is far better and in my case Death has proved a good friend for it has given me the spotless soul of the woman I loved which is far fairer than her body was But unfortunately intangible said Gervase satirically The Doctor looked at him keenly and coldly Do not be too sure of that my friend Never talk about what you do not understand you only wander astray The spiritual world is a blank to you so do not presume to judge of what you will never realize TILL REALIZATION IS FORCED UPON YOU He uttered the last words with slow and singular emphasis Forced upon me began Gervase What do you mean He broke off abruptly for at that moment Denzil Murray emerged from the doorway of the hotel and came towards them with an unsteady swaying step like that of a drunken man You had better go in to the Princess he said staring at Gervase with a wild smile she is waiting for you What s the matter with you Denzil inquired doctor Dean catching him by the arm as he made a movement to go on and pass them Denzil stopped frowning impatiently Matter Nothing What should be the matter Oh no offence no offence my boy and doctor Dean at once loosened his arm I only thought you looked as if you had had some upset or worry that s all Climate climate said Denzil hoarsely Egypt does not agree with me I suppose the dryness of the soil breeds fever and a touch of madness Men are not blocks of wood or monoliths of stone they are creatures of flesh and blood of nerve and muscle you cannot torture them so He interrupted himself with a kind of breathless irritation at his own speech Gervase regarded him steadily slightly smiling Torture them how Denzil asked the Doctor kindly Dear lad you are talking nonsense Come and stroll with me up and down the air is quite balmy and delightful it will cool your brain Yes it needs cooling retorted Denzil beginning to laugh with a sort of wild hilarity Too much wine too much woman too much of these musty old world records and ghastly pyramids Here he broke off adding quickly Doctor Helen and I will go back to England next week if all is well Why certainly certainly said doctor Dean soothingly I think we are all beginning to feel we have had enough of Egypt I shall probably return home with you Meanwhile come for a stroll and talk to me Monsieur Armand Gervase will perhaps go in and excuse us for a few minutes to the Princess Ziska With pleasure said Gervase then beckoning Denzil Murray aside he whispered Tell me have you won or lost Lost replied Denzil fiercely through his set teeth It is your turn now But if you win as sure as there is a God above us I will kill you SOIT But not till I am ready for killing AFTER TO MORROW NIGHT I shall be at your service not till then And smiling coldly his dark face looking singularly pale and stern in the moonlight Gervase turned away and walking with his usual light swift yet leisurely tread entered the Princess s apartment by the French window which was still open and from which the sound of sweet music came floating deliciously on the air as he disappeared CHAPTER XIV In a half reclining attitude of indolently graceful ease the Princess Ziska watched from beneath the slumbrous shadow of her long fringed eyelids the approach of her now scarcely to be controlled lover He came towards her with a certain impetuosity of movement which was so far removed from ordinary conventionality as to be wholly admirable from the purely picturesque point of view despite the fact that it expressed more passion and impatience than were in keeping with nineteenth century customs and manners He had almost reached her side before he became aware that there were two other women in the room besides the Princess silent veiled figures that sat or rather crouched on the floor holding quaintly carved and inlaid musical instruments of some antique date in their hands the only sign of life about them being their large dark glistening almond shaped eyes which were every now and then raised and fixed on Gervase with an intense and searching look of inquiry Strangely embarrassed by their glances he addressed the Princess in a low tone Will you not send away your women She smiled Yes presently if you wish it I will But you must hear some music first Sit down there and she pointed with her small jewelled hand to a low chair near her own My lutist shall sing you something in English of course for all the world is being Anglicized by degrees and there will soon be no separate nations left Something too of romantic southern passion is being gradually grafted on to English sentiment so that English songs are not so stupid as they were once I translated some stanzas from one of the old Egyptian poets into English the other day perhaps you will like them Myrmentis sing us the Song of Darkness An odd sensation of familiarity with the name of Myrmentis startled Gervase as he heard it pronounced and he looked at the girl who was so called in a kind of dread But she did not meet his questioning regard she was already bending over her lute and tuning its strings while her companion likewise prepared to accompany her on a similar though larger instrument and in an other moment her voice full and rich with a sobbing passion in it which thrilled him to the inmost soul rang out on the warm silence In the darkness what deeds are done What wild words spoken What joys are tasted what passion wasted What hearts are broken Not a glimpse of the moon shall shine Not a star shall mark The passing of night or shed its light On my Dream of the Dark On the scented and slumbrous air Strange thoughts are thronging And a blind desire more fierce than fire Fills the soul with longing Through the silence heavy and sweet Comes the panting breath Of a lover unseen from the Might Have Been Whose loving is Death In the darkness a deed was done A wild word spoken A joy was tasted a passion wasted A heart was broken Not a glimpse of the moon shall shine Not a star shall mark The passing of night or shed its light On my Dream of the Dark The song died away in a shuddering echo and before Gervase had time to raise his eyes from their brooding study of the floor the singer and her companion had noiselessly disappeared and he was left alone with the Princess Ziska He drew along breath and turning fully round in his chair looked at her steadily There was a faint smile on her lips a smile of mingled mockery and triumph her beautiful witch like eyes glittered Leaning towards her he grasped her hands suddenly in his own Now he whispered shall I speak or be silent Whichever you please she responded composedly still smiling Speech or silence rest equally with yourself I compel neither That is false he said passionately You do compel Your eyes drag my very soul out of me your touch drives me into frenzy You temptress You force me to speak though you know already what I have to say That I love you love you And that you love me That your whole life leaps to mine as mine to yours You know all this if I were stricken dumb you could read it in my face but you will have it spoken you will extort from me the whole secret of my madness yes for you to take a cruel joy in knowing that I AM mad mad for the love of you And you cannot be too often or too thoroughly assured that your own passion finds its reflex in me He paused abruptly checked in his wild words by the sound of her low sweet chill laughter She withdrew her hands from his burning grasp My dear friend she said lightly you really have a very excellent opinion of yourself excuse me for saying so My own passion Do you actually suppose I have a passion for you And rising from her chair she drew up her slim supple figure to its full height and looked at him with an amused and airy scorn You are totally mistaken No one man living can move me to love I know all men too well Their natures are uniformly composed of the same mixture of cruelty lust and selfishness and forever and forever through all the ages of the world they use the greater part of their intellectual abilities in devising new ways to condone and conceal their vices You call me temptress why The temptation if any there be emanates from yourself and your own unbridled desires I do nothing I am made as I am made if my face or my form seems fair in your eyes this is not my fault Your glance lights on me as the hawk s lights on coveted prey but think you the prey loves the hawk in response It is the mistake all men make with all women to judge them always as being of the same base material as themselves Some women there are who shame their womanhood but the majority as a rule preserve their self respect till taught by men to lose it Gervase sprang up and faced her his eyes flashing dangerously Do not make any pretence with me he said half angrily Never tell me you cannot love I HAVE loved she interrupted him As true women love once and only once It suffices not for one lifetime but many I loved and gave myself ungrudgingly and trustingly to the man my soul worshipped I was betrayed of course it is the usual story quite old quite commonplace I can tell it to you without so much as a blush of pain Since then I have not loved I have HATED and I live but for one thing Revenge Her face paled as she spoke and a something vague dark spectral and terrible seemed to enfold her like a cloud where she stood Anon she smiled sweetly and with a bewitching provocativeness Your passion you see my friend awakens rather a singular reflex in me not quite of the nature you imagined He remained for a moment inert then with an almost savage boldness threw his arm about her Have everything your own way Ziska he said in quick fierce accents I will accept all your fancies and humor all your caprices I will grant that you do not love me I will even suppose that I am repellent to you but that shall make no difference to my desire You shall be mine willing or unwilling If every kiss I take from your lips be torn from you with reluctance yet those kisses I will have you shall not escape me You you out of all women in the world I choose As your wife said Ziska slowly her dark eyes gleaming with a strange light as she dexterously withdrew herself from his embrace He uttered an impatient exclamation My wife Dieu What a banalite You with your exquisite glowing beauty and voluptuous charm you would be a wife that tiresome figure head of utterly dull respectability You with your unmatched air of wild grace and freedom would submit to be tied down in the bonds of marriage marriage which to my thinking and that of many other men of my character is one of the many curses of this idiotic nineteenth century No I offer you love Ziska ideal passionate love the glowing rapturous dream of ecstasy in which such a thing as marriage would be impossible the merest vulgar commonplace almost a profanity I understand and the Princess Ziska regarded him intently her breath coming and going and a strange smile quivering on her lips You would play the part of an Araxes over again He smiled and with all the audacity of a bold and determined nature put his arms round her and drew her close up to his breast Yes he said I would play the part of an Araxes over again As he uttered the words an indescribable sensation of horror seized him a mist darkened his sight his blood grew cold and a tremor shook him from head to foot The fair woman s face that was lifted so close to his own seemed spectral and far off and for a fleeting moment her very beauty grew into something like hideousness as if the strange effect of the picture he had painted of her was now becoming actual and apparent namely the face of death looking through the mask of life Yet he did not loosen his arms from about her waist on the contrary he clasped her even more closely and kept his eyes fixed upon her with such pertinacity that it seemed as if he expected her to vanish from his sight while he still held her To play the part of an Araxes aright she murmured then in slow and dulcet accents you would need to be cruel and remorseless and sacrifice my life or any woman s life to your own clamorous and selfish passion But you Armand Gervase educated civilized intellectual and totally unlike the barbaric Araxes could not do that could you The progress of the world the increasing intelligence of humanity the coming of the Christ these things are surely of some weight with you are they not Or are you made of the same savage and impenitent stuff as composed the once famous yet brutal warrior of old time Do you admire the character and spirit of Araxes he who if history reports him truly would snatch a woman s life as though it were a wayside flower crush out all its sweetness and delicacy and then fling it into the dust withered and dead Do you think that because a man is strong and famous he has a right to the love of woman a charter to destroy her as he pleases If you remember the story I told you Araxes murdered with his own hand Ziska Charmazel the woman who loved him He had perhaps grown weary of her said Gervase speaking with an effort and still studying the exquisite loveliness of the bewitching face that was so close to his own like a man in a dream At this she laughed and laid her two hands on his shoulders with a close and clinging clasp which thrilled him strangely Ah there is the difficulty she said What cure shall ever be found for love weariness Men are all like children they tire of their toys hence the frequent trouble and discomfort of marriage They grow weary of the same face the same caressing arms the same faithful heart You for instance would grow weary of me I think not answered Gervase And now the vague sense of uncertainty and pain which had distressed him passed away leaving him fully self possessed once more I think you are one of those exceptional women whom a man never grows weary of like a Cleopatra or any other old world enchantress you fascinate with a look you fasten with a touch and you have a singular freshness and wild attraction about you which makes you unlike any other of your sex I know well enough that I shall never get the memory of you out of my brain your face will haunt me till I die And after death she queried half closing her eyes and regarding him languorously through her silky black lashes Ah ma belle after that there is nothing to be done even in the way of love Tout est fini Considering the brevity of life and the absolute certainty of death I think that the men and women who are so foolish as to miss any opportunities of enjoyment while they are alive deserve more punishment than those who take all they can get even in the line of what is called wickedness Wickedness is a curious thing it takes different shapes in different lands and what is called wicked here is virtue in let us say the Fiji Islands There is really no strict rule of conduct in the world no fixed law of morality There is honor said the Princess slowly A code which even savages recognize He was silent For a moment he seemed to hesitate but his indecision soon passed His face flushed and anon grew pale as closing his arms more victoriously round the fair woman who just then appeared voluntarily to yield to his embrace he bent down and whispered a few words in the tiny ear white and delicate as a shell which was half hidden by the rich loose clusters of her luxuriant hair She heard and smiled and her eyes flashed with a singular ferocity which he did not see otherwise it might have startled him I will answer you to morrow she said Be patient till then And as she spoke she released herself determinedly from the clasp of his arms and withdrew to a little distance looking at him with a fixed and searching scrutiny Do not preach patience to me he exclaimed with a laugh I never had that virtue and I certainly cannot begin to cultivate it now Had you ever any virtues she asked in a playful tone of something like satire He shrugged his shoulders I do not know what you consider virtues he answered lightly If honesty is one I have that I make no pretence to be what I am not I would not pass off somebody else s picture as my own for instance But I cannot sham to be moral I could not possibly love a woman without wanting her all to myself and I have not the slightest belief in the sanctimonious humbug of a man who plays the Platonic lover only But I don t cheat and I don t lie I am what I am A man said Ziska a lurid and vindictive light dilating and firing her wonderful eyes A man the essence of all that is evil the possibility of all that is good But the essence is strong and works the possibility is a dream which dissolves in the dreaming Yes you are right ma chere he responded carelessly Goodness as the world understands goodness never makes a career for itself worth anything Even Christ who has figured as a symbol of goodness for eighteen hundred years was not devoid of the sin of ambition He wanted to reign over all Judaea You view Him in that light inquired Ziska with a keen look And as man only Why of course The idea of an incarnate God has long ago been discarded by all reasoning thinkers And what of an incarnate devil pursued Ziska her breath coming and going quickly As impossible as the other fancy he responded almost gayly There are no gods and no devils ma belle The world is ruled by ourselves alone and it behoves us to make the best of it How will you give me my answer to morrow When shall I see you Speak low and quickly doctor Dean is coming in here from the garden when when I will send for you she answered At what hour The moon rises at ten And at ten my messenger shall come for you A trustworthy messenger I hope One who knows how to be silent As silent as the grave she said looking at him fixedly As secret as the Great Pyramid and the hidden tomb of Araxes And smiling she turned to greet doctor Dean who just then entered the saloon Denzil has gone to bed he announced He begged me to excuse him to you Princess I think the boy is feverish Egypt doesn t agree with him I am sorry he is ill said the Princess with a charming air of sympathy Oh he isn t exactly ill returned the Doctor looking sharply at her beautiful face as he spoke He is simply unnerved and restless I am a little anxious about him I think he ought to go back to England or Scotland I think so too agreed Gervase And Mademoiselle Helen with him Mademoiselle Helen you consider very beautiful murmured the Princess unfurling her fan and waving it indolently to and fro No not beautiful answered the Doctor quickly But very pretty sweet and lovable and good Ah then of course some one will break her heart said the Princess calmly That is what always happens to good women And she smiled as she saw Gervase flush half with anger half with shame The little Doctor rubbed his nose crossly Not always Princess he said Sometimes it does in fact pretty often It is an unfortunate truth that virtue is seldom rewarded in this world Virtue in a woman nowadays Means no lovers and no fun said Gervase gayly And the possibility of a highly decorous marriage with a curate or a bankclerk followed by the pleasing result of a family of little curates or little bank clerks It is not a dazzling prospect The Doctor smiled grimly then after a wavering moment of indecision broke out into a chuckling laugh You have an odd way of putting things he said But I m afraid you may be right in your estimate of the position Quite as many women are as miserably sacrificed on the altar of virtue as of vice It is a mad world as Shakespeare says I hope the next life we pass into after this one will at least be sane Well if you believe in Heaven you have Testament authority for the fact that there will be neither marriage nor giving in marriage there at any rate laughed Gervase And if we wish to follow that text out truly in our present state of existence and become as the angels of God we ought at once to abolish matrimony Have done Have done exclaimed the Doctor still smiling however notwithstanding his protest You Southern Frenchmen are half barbarians you have neither religion nor morality Dieu merci said Gervase irreverently then turning to the Princess Ziska he bowed low and with a courtly grace over the hand she extended towards him in farewell Good night Princess then in a whisper he added To morrow I shall await your summons It will come without fail never fear she answered in equally soft tones I hope it may find you ready He raised his eyes and gave her one long lingering passionate look then with another Good night which included doctor Dean left the room The Doctor lingered a moment studying the face and form of the Princess with a curiously inquisitive air while she in her turn confronted him haughtily and with a touch of defiance in her aspect Well said the savant presently after a pause Now you have got him what are you going to do with him She smiled coldly but answered nothing You need not flash your beautiful eyes at me in that eminently unpleasant fashion pursued the Doctor easily You see I KNOW YOU and I am not afraid of you I only make a stand against you in one respect you shall not kill the boy Denzil He is nothing to me she said with a gesture of contempt I know he is nothing to you but you are something to him He does not recognize your nature as I do I must get him out of the reach of your spell You need not trouble yourself she interrupted him a sombre melancholy darkening her face I shall be gone to morrow Gone altogether inquired the Doctor calmly and without surprise Not to come back Not in this present generation she answered Still doctor Dean evinced no surprise Then you will have satisfied yourself he asked She bent her head For the time being yes I shall have satisfied myself There followed a silence during which the little Doctor looked at his beautiful companion with all the meditative interest of a scientist engaged in working out some intricate and deeply interesting problem I suppose I may not inquire how you propose to obtain this satisfaction he said You may inquire but you will not be answered she retorted smiling darkly Your intentions are pitiless Still smiling she said not a word You are impenitent She remained silent And worst of all you do not desire redemption You are one of those who forever and ever cry Evil be thou my good Thus for you Christ died in vain A faint tremor ran through her but she was still mute So you and creatures like you must have their way in the world until the end concluded the Doctor thoughtfully And if all the philosophers that ever lived were to pronounce you what you are they would be disbelieved and condemned as madmen Well Princess I am glad I have never at any time crossed your path till now or given you cause of offence against me We part friends I trust Good night Farewell She held out her hand He hesitated before taking it Are you afraid she queried coldly It will not harm you I am afraid of nothing he said at once clasping the white taper fingers in his own except a bad conscience That will never trouble you and the Princess looked at him full and steadily There are no dark corners in your life no mean side alleys and trap holes of deceit you have walked on the open and straight road You are a good man and a wise one But though you in your knowledge of spiritual things recognize me for what I am take my advice and be silent on the matter The world would never believe the truth even if you told it for the time is not yet ripe for men and women to recognize the avengers of their wicked deeds They are kept purposely in the dark lest the light should kill And with her sombre eyes darkening yet glowing with the inward fire that always smouldered in their dazzling depths she saluted him gravely and gracefully watching him to the last as he slowly withdrew CHAPTER XV The next day broke with a bright hot glare over the wide desert and the sky in its cloudless burning blue had more than its usual appearance of limitless and awful immensity The Sphinx and the Pyramids alone gave a shadow and a substance to the dazzling and transparent air all the rest of the visible landscape seemed naught save a far stretching ocean of glittering sand scorched by the blazing sun doctor Maxwell Dean rose early and went down to the hotel breakfast in a somewhat depressed frame of mind he had slept badly and his dreams had been unpleasant when not actually ghastly and he was considerably relieved though he could not have told why when he saw his young friend Denzil Murray seated at the breakfast table apparently enjoying an excellent meal Hullo Denzil he exclaimed cheerily I hardly expected you down yet Are you better Thanks I am perfectly well said Denzil with a careless air I thought I would breakfast early in order to drive into Cairo before the day gets too sultry Into Cairo echoed the Doctor Why aren t you going to stay here a few days No not exactly answered Denzil stirring his coffee quickly and beginning to swallow it in large gulps I shall be back to night though I m only going just to see my sister and tell her to prepare for our journey home I shan t be absent more than a few hours I thought you might possibly like to go a little further up the Nile suggested the Doctor Oh no I ve had enough of it You see when a man proposes to a woman and gets refused he can t keep on dangling round that woman as if he thought it possible she might change her mind And he forced a smile I ve got an appointment with Gervase to morrow morning and I must come back to night in order to keep it but after that I m off An appointment with Gervase repeated the Doctor slowly What sort of an appointment Denzil avoided his keen look Really Doctor you are getting awfully inquisitive he exclaimed with a hard laugh You want to know altogether too much Yes I always do it is a habit of mine responded doctor Dean calmly But in the present case it doesn t need much perspicuity to fathom your mystery The dullest clod hopper will tell you he can see through a millstone when there s a hole in it And I was always a good hand at putting two and two together and making four out of them You and Gervase are in love with the same woman the woman has rejected you and is encouraging Gervase Gervase you think will on this very night be in the position of the accepted lover for which successful fortune attending him you the rejected one propose to kill him to morrow morning if you can unless he kills you And you are going to Cairo to get your pistols or whatever weapons you have arranged to fight with and also to say good bye to your sister Denzil kept his eyes fixed studiously on the table cloth and made no answer However continued the Doctor complacently you can have it all your own way as far as I am concerned I never interfere in these sort of matters I should do no good if I attempted it Besides I haven t the slightest anxiety on your behalf not the slightest Waiter some more coffee please Upon my word exclaimed Denzil with a fretful laugh you are a most extraordinary man Doctor I hope I am retorted the Doctor To be merely ordinary would not suit my line of ambition This is very excellent coffee here he peered into the fresh pot of the fragrant beverage just set before him They make it better here than at the Gezireh Palace Well Denzil my boy when you get into Cairo give my love to Helen and tell her we ll all go home to the old country together I myself have got quite enough out of Egypt this time to satisfy my fondness for new experiences And let me assure you my good fellow that your proposed duel with Gervase will not come off It will come off said Denzil with sudden fierceness By Heaven it shall it must More wills than one have the working out of our destinies answered doctor Dean with some gravity Man is not by any means supreme He imagines he is but that is only one of his many little delusions You think you will have your way Gervase thinks he will have his way I think I will have my way but as a matter of fact there is only one person in this affair whose way will be absolute and that person is the Princess Ziska Ce que femme veut Dieu veut She has nothing whatever to do with the matter declared Denzil Pardon She has everything to do with it She is the cause of it and she knows it And as I have already told you your proposed fight will not come off And the little Doctor smiled serenely There is your carriage at the door I suppose Off with you my boy be off like a whirlwind and return here armed to the teeth if you like You have heard the expression fighting the air That is what you will do tomorrow morning And apparently in the best of all possible humors doctor Dean accompanied his young friend to the portico of the hotel and watched him drive off down the stately avenue of palm trees which now cast their refreshing shade on the entire route from the Pyramids to Cairo When he had fairly gone the thoughtful savant surveyed the different tourists who were preparing to ascend the Pyramids under the escort of their Arab guides regardless of the risks they ran of dislocated arms and broken shoulder bones and in the study of the various odd types thus presented to him he found himself fairly well amused Protoplasm mere protoplasm he murmured The germ of soul has not yet attained to individual consciousness in any one of these strange bipeds Their thoughts are as jelly their reasoning powers in embryo their intellectual faculties barely perceptible Yet they are interesting viewed in the same light and considered on the same scale as fish or insects merely As men and women of course they are misnomers laughable impossibilities Well well in the space of two or three thousand years the protoplasm may start into form out of the void and the fibres of a conscious Intellectuality may sprout but it will have to be in some other phase of existence certainly not in this one And now to shut myself up and write my memoranda for I must not lose a single detail of this singular Egyptian psychic problem The whole thing I perceive is rounding itself towards completion and catastrophe but in what way How will it how CAN it end And with a meditative frown puckering his brows doctor Dean folded his hands behind his back and retired to his own room from whence he did not emerge all day Armand Gervase in the meanwhile was making himself the life and soul of everything at the Mena House Hotel He struck up an easy acquaintance with several of the visitors staying there said pretty things to young women and pleasant things to old and in the course of a few hours succeeded in becoming the most popular personage in the place He accepted invitations to parties and agreed to share in various excursions till he engaged himself for every day in the coming week and was so gay and gallant and fascinating in manner and bearing that fair ladies lost their hearts to him at a glance and what amusement or pleasure there was at the Mena House seemed to be doubly enhanced by the mere fact of his presence In truth Gervase was in a singular mood of elation and excitation a strong inward triumph possessed him and filled his soul with an imperious pride and sense of conquest which for the time being made him feel as though he were a very king of men There was nothing in his nature of the noble tenderness which makes the lover mentally exalt his beloved as a queen before whom he is content to submit his whole soul in worship what he realized was merely this that here was one of the most beautiful and seductive women ever created in the person of the Princess Ziska and that he Gervase meant to possess that loveliest of women whatever happened in the near or distant future Of her and of the influence of his passion on her personally he did not stop to think except with the curiously blind egotism which is the heritage of most men and which led him to judge that her happiness would in some way or other be enhanced by his brief and fickle love For as a rule men do not understand love They understand desire amounting sometimes to merciless covetousness for what they cannot get this is a leading natural characteristic of the masculine nature but Love love that endures silently and faithfully through the stress of trouble and the passing of years love which sacrifices everything to the beloved and never changes or falters this is a divine passion which seldom or never sanctifies and inspires the life of a man Women are not made of such base material their love invariably springs first from the Ideal not the Sensual and if afterwards it develops into the sensual it is through the rough and coarsening touch of man alone Throughout the entire day the Princess Ziska herself never left her private apartments and towards late afternoon Gervase began to feel the hours drag along with unconscionable slowness and monotony Never did the sun seem so slow in sinking never did the night appear so far off When at last dinner was served in the hotel both Denzil Murray and doctor Dean sat next to him at table and judging from outward appearances the most friendly relations existed between all three of them At the close of the meal however Denzil made a sign to Gervase to follow him and when they had reached a quiet corner said I am aware of your victory you have won where I have lost But you know my intention Perfectly responded Gervase with a cool smile By Heaven went on the younger man in accents of suppressed fury if I yielded to the temptation which besets me when I see you standing there facing me with your easy and self satisfied demeanor when I know that you mean dishonor where I meant honor when you have had the effrontery to confess to me that you only intend to make the Princess Ziska your mistress when I would have made her my wife God I could shoot you dead at this moment Gervase looked at him steadily still smiling slightly then gradually the smile died away leaving his countenance shadowed by an intense melancholy I can quite enter into your feelings my dear boy he said And do you know I m not sure that it would not be a good thing if you were to shoot me dead My life is of no particular value to anybody certainly not to myself and I begin to think I ve been always more or less of a failure I have won fame but I have missed something but upon my word I don t quite know what He sighed heavily then suddenly held out his hand Denzil the bitterest foes shake hands before fighting each other to the death as we propose to do to morrow it is a civil custom and hurts no one I should like to part kindly from you to night Denzil hesitated then something stronger than himself made him yield to the impulsive note of strong emotion in his former friend s voice and the two men s hands met in a momentary silent grasp Then Denzil turned quickly away To morrow morning at six he said briefly close to the Sphinx Good responded Gervase The Sphinx shall second us both and see fair play Good night Denzil Good night responded Denzil coldly as he moved on and disappeared A slight shiver ran through Gervase s blood as he watched him depart Odd that I should imagine I have seen the last of him he murmured There are strange portents in the air of the desert I suppose Is he going to his death Or am I going to mine Again the cold tremor shook him and combating with his uneasy sensations he went to his own apartment there to await the expected summons of the Princess No triumph filled him now no sense of joy elated him a vague fear and dull foreboding were all the emotions he was conscious of Even his impatient desire of love had cooled and he watched the darkening of night over the desert and the stars shining out one by one in the black azure of the heavens with a gradually deepening depression A dreamy sense stole over him of remoteness or detachment from all visible things as though he were suddenly and mysteriously separated from the rest of humankind by an invisible force which he was powerless to resist He was still lost in this vague half torpor or semi conscious reverie when a light tap startled him back to the realization of earth and his earthly surroundings In response to his Entrez the tall Nubian whom he had seen in Cairo as the guardian of the Princess s household appeared his repulsive features looking if anything more ghastly and hideous than ever Madame la Princesse demande votre presence said this unlovely attendant of one of the fairest of women Suivez moi Without a moment s hesitation or loss of time Gervase obeyed and allowing his guide to precede him at a little distance followed him through the corridors of the hotel out at the hall door and beyond through the garden A clock struck ten as they passed into the warm evening air and the mellow rays of the moon were beginning to whiten the sides of the Great Pyramid A few of the people staying in the hotel were lounging about but these paid no particular heed to Gervase or his companion At about two hundred yards from the entrance of the Mena House the Nubian stopped and waited till Gervase came up with him Madame la Princesse vous aime Monsieur Gervase he said with a sarcastic grin Mais elle veut que l Amour soit toujours aveugle oui toujours C est le destin qui vous appelle il faut soumettre L Amour sans yeux oui en fin comme ca And before Gervase could utter a word of protest or demand the meaning of this strange proceeding his arms was suddenly seized and pinioned behind his back his mouth gagged and his eyes blindfolded Maintenant continued the Nubian Nous irons ensemble Choked and mad with rage Gervase for a few moments struggled furiously as well as he was able with his powerful captor All sorts of ideas surged in his brain the Princess Ziska might with all her beauty and fascination be nothing but the ruler of a band of robbers and murderers who could tell Yet reason did not wholly desert him in extremity for even while he tried to fight for his liberty he remembered that there was no good to be gained out of taking him prisoner he had neither money nor valuables nothing which could excite the cupidity of even a starving Bedouin As this thought crossed his brain he ceased his struggles abruptly and stood still panting for breath when suddenly a sound of singing floated towards him Oh for the pure cold heart of the Lotus Lily A star above Is its only love And one brief sigh of its scented breath Is all it will ever know of Death Oh for the passionless heart of the Lotus Lily He listened and all power of resistance ebbed slowly away from him he became perfectly passive almost apathetic and yielding to the somewhat rough handling of his guide allowed himself to be urged with silent rapidity onward over the thick sand till he presently became conscious that he was leaving the fresh open air and entering a building of some sort for his feet pressed hard earth and stone instead of sand All at once he was forcibly brought to a standstill and a heavy rolling noise and clang like distant muttered thunder resounded in his ears followed by dead silence Then his arm was closely grasped again and he was led on on and on along what seemed to be an interminable distance for not a glimmer of light could be seen under the tight folds of the bandage across his eyes Presently the earth shook under him some heavy substance was moved and there was another booming thunderous noise accompanied by the falling of chains C est l escalier de Madame la Princesse said the Nubian Pres de la chambre nuptiale Descendez Vite Down down Resistance was useless even had he cared to resist for he felt as though twenty pairs of hands instead of one were pushing him violently on all sides down still down he went dumb blind and helpless till at last he was allowed to stop and breathe His arms were released the bandage was taken from his eyes the gag from his mouth he was free Free yes but where Thick darkness encompassed him he stretched out his hands in the murky atmosphere and felt nothing Ziska he cried The name sprang up against the silence and struck out numberless echoes and with the echoes came a shuddering sigh that was not of them whispering Charmazel Gervase heard it and a deadly fear born of the supernatural possessed him Ziska Ziska he called again wildly Charmazel answered the penetrating unknown voice and as it thrilled upon the air like a sob of pain a dim light began to shine through the gloom waveringly at first then more steadily till it gradually spread wide illuminating with a pale and spectral light the place in which he found himself a place more weird and wondrous than any mystic scene in dream land He stumbled forward giddily utterly bewildered staring about him like a man in delirium and speechless with mingled horror and amazement He was alone utterly alone in a vast square chamber the walls and roof of which were thickly patterned and glistening with gold Squares of gold were set in the very pavement on which he trod and at the furthest end of the chamber a magnificent sarcophagus of solid gold encrusted with thousands upon thousands of jewels which were set upon it in marvellous and fantastic devices glittered and flashed with the hues of living fire Golden cups golden vases a golden suit of armor bracelets and chains of gold intermixed with gems were heaped up against the walls and scattered on the floor and a round shield of ivory inlaid with gold together with a sword in a jewelled sheath were placed in an upright position against the head of the sarcophagus from whence all the spectral and mysterious light seemed to emerge With thickly beating heart and faltering pulses Gervase still advanced gazing half entranced half terrified at the extraordinary and sumptuous splendor surrounding him muttering almost unconsciously as he moved along A king s sepulchre a warrior s tomb How came I here and why Is this a trysting place for love as well as death and will she come to me He recoiled suddenly with a violent start for there like a strange Spirit of Evil risen from the ground leaning against the great gold sarcophagus her exquisite form scarcely concealed by the misty white of her draperies her dark hair hanging like a cloud over her shoulders and her black eyes aflame with wrath menace and passion stood the mysterious Ziska CHAPTER XVI Stricken dumb with a ghastly supernatural terror which far exceeded any ordinary sense of fear he gazed at her spellbound his blood freezing his very limbs stiffening for now now she looked like the picture he had painted of her and Death Death livid tortured and horrible stared at him skull wise from the transparent covering of her exquisitely tinted seeming human flesh Larger and brighter and wilder grew her eyes as she fixed them on him and her voice rang through the silence with an unearthly resonance as she spoke and said Welcome my lover to this abode of love Welcome to these arms for whose embraces your covetous soul has thirsted unappeased Take all of me for I am yours aye so truly yours that you can never escape me never separate from me no not through a thousand thousand centuries Life of my life Soul of my soul Possess me as I possess you for our two unrepenting spirits form a dual flame in Hell which must burn on and on to all eternity Leap to my arms master and lord king and conqueror Here here and she smote her white arms against her whiter bosom Take all your fill of burning wickedness of cursed joy and then sleep as you have slept before these many thousand years Still mute and aghast he stared at her his senses swam his brain reeled and then slowly like the lifting of a curtain on the last scene of a dire tragedy a lightning thought a scorching memory sprang into his mind and overwhelmed him like a rolling wave that brings death in its track With a fierce oath he rushed towards her and seized her hands in his hands cold as ice and clammy as with the dews of the grave Ziska Woman Devil Speak before you drive me to madness What passion moves you thus what mystic fooling Into what place have I been decoyed at your bidding Why am I brought hither Speak speak or I shall murder you Nay she said and her slight swaying form dilated and grew till she seemed to rise up from the very ground and to tower above him like an enraged demon evoked from mist or flame You have done that once To murder me twice is beyond your power And as she spoke her hands slipped from his like the hands of a corpse newly dead Never again can you hurl forth my anguished soul unprepared to the outer darkness of things invisible never again For I am free free with an immortal freedom free to work out repentance or revenge even as Man is free to shape his course for good or evil He chooses evil I choose revenge What place is this you ask and with a majestic gliding motion she advanced a little and pointed upward to the sparkling gold patterned roof Above us the Great Pyramid lifts its summit to the stars and here below here where you will presently lie my lover and lord asleep in the delicate bosom of love here She paused and a low laugh broke from her lips then she added slowly and impressively Here is the tomb of Araxes As she spoke a creeping sense of coldness and horror stole into his veins like the approach of death the strange impressions he had felt the haunting and confusing memory he had always had of her face and voice the supernatural theories he had lately heard discussed all rushed at once upon his mind and he uttered a loud involuntary cry My God What frenzy is this A woman s vain trick a fool s mad scheme What is Araxes to me or I to Araxes Everything replied Ziska the vindictive demon light in her eyes blazing with a truly frightful intensity Inasmuch as ye are one and the same The same dark soul of sin unpurged uncleansed through ages of eternal fire Sensualist Voluptuary Accursed spirit of the man I loved come forth from the present Seeming of things Come forth and cling to me Cling for the whole forces of a million universes shall not separate us O Eternal Spirits of the Dead and she lifted her ghostly white arms with a wild gesture Rend ye the veil Declare to the infidel and unbeliever the truth of the life beyond death the life wherein ye and I dwell and work clamoring for late justice Here she sprang forward and caught the arm of Gervase with all the fierce eagerness of some ravenous bird of prey and as she did so he knew her grasp meant death Remember the days of old Araxes Look back look back from the present to the past and remember the crimes that are still unavenged Remember the love sought and won remember the broken heart remember the ruined life Remember the triumphs of war the glories of conquest Remember the lust of ambition the treachery the slaughter the blasphemies against high Heaven Remember the night of the Feast of Osiris the Feast of the Sun Remember how Ziska Charmazel awaited her lover singing alone for joy in blind faith and blinder love his favorite song of the Lotus Lily The moon was high as it is now the stars glittered above the Pyramids as they glitter now in the palace there was the sound of music and triumph and laughter and a whisper on the air of the fickle heart and changeful mood of Araxes of another face which charmed him though less fair than that of Ziska Charmazel Remember remember and she clung closer and closer as he staggered backward half suffocated by his own emotions and the horror of her touch Remember the fierce word the quick and murderous blow the plunge of the jewelled knife up to the hilt in the passionate white bosom of Charmazel the lonely anguish in which she died Died but to live again and pursue her murderer to track him down to his grave wherein the king strewed gold and devils strewed curses down down to the end of all his glory and conquest into the silence of yon gold encrusted clay And out of silence again into sound and light and fire ever pursuing I have followed followed through a thousand phases of existence and I will follow still through limitless space and endless time till the great Maker of this terrible wheel of life Himself shall say Stop Here ends even the law of vengeance Oh for ten thousand centuries more in which to work my passion and prove my wrong All the treasure of love despised all the hope of a life betrayed all the salvation of heaven denied Tremble Soul of Araxes for hate is eternal as love is eternal the veil is down and Memory stings She turned her face now spectral and pallid as a waning moon up to him her form grew thin and skeleton like while still retaining the transparent outline of its beauty and he realized at last that no creature of flesh and blood was this that clung to him but some mysterious bodiless horror of the Supernatural unguessed at by the outer world of men The dews of death stood thick on his forehead there was a straining agony at his heart and his breath came in quick convulsive gasps but worse than his physical torture was the overwhelming and convincing truth of the actual existence of the Spiritual Universe now so suddenly and awfully revealed What he had all his life denied was now declared a certainty where he had been deaf and blind he now heard and saw Ziska Ziska Charmazel In very truth he knew he remembered her in very truth he knew he had loved her in very truth he knew he had murdered her But another still stranger truth was forcing itself upon him now and this was that the old love of the old old days was arising within him in all its strength once more and that he loved her still Unreal and terrible as it seemed it was nevertheless a fact that as he gazed upon her tortured face her beautiful anguished eyes her phantom form he felt that he would give his own soul to rescue hers and lift her from the coils of vengeance into love again Her words awoke vibrating pulsations of thought long dormant in the innermost recesses of his spirit which like so many dagger thrusts stabbed him with a myriad recollections and as a disguising cloak may fall from the figure of a friend in a masquerade so his present seeming personality dropped from him and no longer had any substance He recognized himself as Araxes always the same Soul passing through a myriad changes and all the links of his past and present were suddenly welded together in one unbroken chain stretching over thousands of years every link of which he was able to count mark and recognize By the dreadful light of that dumb comprehension which flashes on all parting souls at the moment of dissolution he perceived at last that not the Body but the Spirit is the central secret of life not deeds but thoughts evolve creation Death That was a name merely there was no death only a change into some other form of existence What change what form would be his now This thought startled him roused him and once again the low spirit voice of his long ago betrayed and murdered love thrilled in his ears Soul of Araxes cling to my soul for this present life is swiftly passing No more scorn of the Divine can stand whither we are speeding for the Terrible and Eternal Truth overshadows us and our destinies Closed are the gates of Heaven open wide are the portals of Hell Enter with me my lover Araxes die as I died unprepared and alone Die and pass out into new life again such life as mine such torture as mine such despair as mine such hate as mine She ceased abruptly for he convinced now of the certainty of Immortality was suddenly moved to a strange access of courage and resolution Something sweet and subtle stirred in him a sense of power a hint of joy which completely overcame all dread of death Old love revived grew stronger in his soul and his gaze rested on the shadowy form beside him no longer with horror but with tenderness She was Ziska Charmazel she had been his love the dearest portion of his life once in the far off time she had been the fairest of women and more than fair she had been faithful Yes he remembered that as he remembered Her Every curve in her beautiful body had been a joy for him alone and for him alone her lips sweet and fresh as rosebuds had kept their kisses She had loved him as few women have either heart or strength to love and he had rewarded her fidelity by death and eternal torment A struggling cry escaped him and he stretched out his arms Ziska Forgive forgive As he uttered the words he saw her wan face suddenly change all the terror and torture passed from it like a passing cloud beautiful as an angel s it smiled upon him the eyes softened and flashed with love the lips trembled the spectral form glowed with a living luminance and a mystic Glory glittered above the dusky hair Filled with ecstasy at the sight of her wondrous loveliness he felt nothing of the coldness of death at his heart a divine passion inspired him and with the last effort of his failing strength he strove to gather all the spirit like beauty of her being into his embrace Love Love he cried Not Hate but Love Come back out of the darkness soul of the woman I wronged Forgive me Come back to me Hell or Heaven what matters it if we are together Come to me come Love is stronger than Hate Speech failed him the cold agony of death gripped at his heart and struck him mute but still he saw the beautiful passionate eyes of a forgiving Love turned gloriously upon him like stars in the black chaos whither he now seemed rushing Then came a solemn surging sound as of great wings beating on a tempestuous air and all the light in the tomb was suddenly extinguished One instant more he stood upright in the thick darkness then a burning knife seemed plunged into his breast and he reeled forward and fell his last hold on life being the consciousness that soft arms were clasping him and drawing him away away he knew not whither and that warm lips sweet and tender were closely pressed on his And presently out of the heavy gloom came a Voice which said Peace The old gods are best and the law is made perfect A life demands a life Love s debt must be paid by Love The woman s soul forgives the man s repents wherefore they are both released from bondage and the memory of sin Let them go hence the curse is lifted Once more the wavering ghostly light gave luminance to the splendor of the tomb and showed where fallen sideways among the golden treasures and mementoes of the past lay the dead body of Armand Gervase Above him gleamed the great jewelled sarcophagus and within touch of his passive hand was the ivory shield and gold hilted sword of Araxes The spectral radiance gleamed wandered and flitted over all things now feebly now brilliantly till finally flashing with a pale glare on the dark dead face with the proud closed lips and black level brows it flickered out and one of the many countless mysteries of the Great Pyramid was again hidden in impenetrable darkness Vainly Denzil Marray waited next morning for his rival to appear He paced up and down impatiently watching the rosy hues of sunrise spreading over the wide desert and lighting up the massive features of the Sphinx till as hour after hour passed and still Gervase did not come he hurried back to the Mena House Hotel and meeting doctor Maxwell Dean on the way to him poured out his rage and perplexity I never thought Gervase was a coward he said hotly Nor should you think so now returned the Doctor with a grave and preoccupied air Whatever his faults cowardice was not one of them You see I speak of him in the past tense I told you your intended duel would not come off and I was right Denzil I don t think you will ever see either Armand Gervase or the Princess Ziska again Denzil started violently What do you mean The Princess is here here in this very house Is she and doctor Dean sighed somewhat impatiently Well let us see Then turning to a passing waiter he inquired Is the Princess Ziska here still No sir She left quite suddenly late last night going on to Thebes I believe sir The Doctor looked meaningly at Denzil You hear But Denzil in his turn was interrogating the waiter Is mister Gervase in his room No sir He went out about ten o clock yesterday evening and I don t think he is coming back One of the Princess Ziska s servants the tall Nubian whom you may have noticed sir brought a message from him to say that his luggage was to be sent to Paris and that the money for his bill would be found on his dressing table It was all right of course but we thought it rather curious And glancing deferentially from one to the other of his questioners with a smile the waiter went on his way They have fled together said Denzil then in choked accents of fury By Heaven if I had guessed the plan already formed in his treacherous mind I would never have shaken hands with Gervase last night Oh you did shake hands queried doctor Dean meditatively Well there was no harm in that You were right You and Gervase will meet no more in this life believe me He and the Princess Ziska have undoubtedly as you say fled together but not to Thebes He paused a moment then laid his hand kindly on Denzil s shoulder Let us go back to Cairo my boy and from thence as soon as possible to England We shall all be better away from this terrible land where the dead have far more power than the living Denzil stared at him uncomprehendingly You talk in riddles he said irritably Do you think I shall let Gervase escape me I will track him wherever he has gone I daresay I shall find him in Paris doctor Dean took one or two slow turns up and down the corridor where they were conversing then stopping abruptly looked his young friend full and steadily in the eyes Come come Denzil No more of this folly he said gently Why should you entertain these ideas of vengeance against Gervase He has really done you no harm He was the natural mate of the woman you imagined you loved the response to her query the other half of her being and that she was and is his destiny and he hers should not excite your envy or hatred I say you IMAGINED you loved the Princess Ziska it was a young man s hot freak of passion for an almost matchless beauty but no more than that And if you would be frank with yourself you know that passion has already cooled I repeat you will never see Gervase or the Princess Ziska again in this life so make the best of it Perhaps you have assisted him to escape me said Denzil frigidly doctor Dean smiled That s rather a rough speech Denzil But never mind he returned Your pride is wounded and you are still sore Suspect me as you please make me out a new Pandarus if you like I shall not be offended But you know for I have often told you that I never interfere in love matters They are too explosive too vitally dangerous outsiders ought never to meddle with them And I never do Come back with me to Cairo And when we are once more safely established on the solid and unromantic isles of Britain you will forget all about the Princess Ziska or if you do remember her it will only be as a dream in the night a kind of vague shadow and uncertainty which will never seriously trouble your mind You look incredulous I tell you at your age love is little more than a vision you must wait a few years yet before it becomes a reality and then Heaven help you Denzil for you will be a troublesome fellow to deal with Meanwhile let us get back to Cairo and see Helen Somewhat soothed by the Doctor s good nature and a trifle ashamed of his wrath Denzil yielded and the evening saw them both back at the Gezireh Palace Hotel where of course the news of the sudden disappearance of Armand Gervase with the Princess Ziska created the utmost excitement Helen Murray shivered and grew pale as death when she heard it lively old Lady Fulkeward simpered and giggled and declared it was the most delightful thing she had ever heard of an elopement in the desert was so exquisitely romantic Sir Chetwynd Lyle wrote a conventional and stilted account of it for his paper and ponderously opined that the immorality of Frenchmen was absolutely beyond any decent journalist s powers of description Lady Chetwynd Lyle on the contrary said that the scandal was not the fault of Gervase it was all that horrid woman who had thrown herself at his head Ross Courtney thought the whole thing was queer and young Lord Fulkeward said there was something about it he didn t quite understand something deep which his aristocratic quality of intelligence could not fathom And society talked and gossiped till Paris and London caught the rumor and the name of the famous French artist who had so strangely vanished from the scene of his triumphs with a beautiful woman whom no one had ever heard of before was soon in everybody s mouth No trace of him or of the Princess Ziska could be discovered his portmanteau contained no letters or papers nothing but a few clothes his paint box and easel were sent on to his deserted studio in Paris and also a blank square of canvas on which as doctor Dean and others knew had once been the curiously horrible portrait of the Princess But that appalling first sketch was wiped out and clean gone as though it had never been painted and doctor Dean called Denzil s attention to the fact But Denzil thought nothing of it as he imagined that Gervase himself had obliterated it before leaving Cairo A few of the curious among the gossips went to see the house the Princess had lately occupied where she had received society and managed to shock it as well It was shut up and looked as if it had not been inhabited for years And the gossips said it was strange very strange and confessed themselves utterly mystified But the fact remained that Gervase had disappeared and the Princess Ziska with him However said Society they can t possibly hide themselves for long Two such remarkable personalities are bound to appear again somewhere I daresay we shall come across them in Paris or on the Riviera The world is much too small for the holding of a secret And presently with the approach of spring and the gradual break up of the Cairo season Denzil Murray and his sister sailed from Alexandria en route for Venice doctor Dean accompanied them so did the Fulkewards and Ross Courtney The Chetwynd Lyles went by a different steamer old Lady Fulkeward being quite too much for the patience of those sweet but still unengaged girls Muriel and Dolly One night when the great ship was speeding swiftly over a calm sea and Denzil lost in sorrowful meditation was gazing out over the trackless ocean with pained and passionate eyes which could see nothing but the witching and exquisite beauty of the Princess Ziska now possessed and enjoyed by Gervase doctor Dean touched him on the arm and said Denzil have you ever read Shakespeare Denzil started and forced a smile Why yes of course Then you know the lines There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio Than are dreamt of in your philosophy The Princess Ziska was one of those things Denzil regarded him in wonderment What do you mean Oh of course you will think me insane said the Doctor resignedly People always take refuge in thinking that those who tell them uncomfortable truths are lunatics You ve heard me talk of ghosts ghosts that walk and move about us like human beings and they are generally very brilliant and clever impersonations of humanity too and that nevertheless are NOT human Denzil assented The Princess Ziska was a ghost concluded the Doctor folding his arms very tightly across his chest and nodding defiantly Nonsense cried Denzil You are mad Precisely the remark I thought you would make and doctor Dean unfolded his arms again and smiled triumphantly Therefore my dear boy let us for the future avoid this subject I know what I know I can distinguish phantoms from reality and I am not deceived by appearances But the world prefers ignorance to knowledge and even so let it be Next time I meet a ghost I ll keep my own counsel He paused a moment then added You remember I told you I was hunting down that warrior of old time Araxes Denzil nodded a trifle impatiently Well resumed the Doctor slowly Before we left Egypt I found him But how I found him and where is my secret Society still speaks occasionally of Armand Gervase and wonders in its feeble way when he will be tired of the Egyptian beauty he ran away with or she of him Society never thinks very far or cares very much for anything long but it does certainly expect to see the once famous French artist turn up suddenly either in his old quarters in Paris or in one or the other of the fashionable resorts of the Riviera That he should be dead has never occurred to anyone except perhaps doctor Maxwell Dean But doctor Dean has grown extremely reticent almost surly and never answers any questions concerning his Scientific Theory of Ghosts a work which when published created a great deal of excitement owing to its singularity and novelty of treatment There was the usual hee hawing from the donkeys in the literary pasture who fondly imagined their brayings deserved to be considered in the light of serious opinion and then after a while the book fell into the hands of scientists only men who are beginning to understand the discretion of silence and to hold their tongues as closely as the Egyptian priests of old did aware that the great majority of men are never ripe for knowledge Quite lately doctor Dean attended two weddings one being that of old Lady Fulkeward who has married a very pretty young fellow of five and twenty whose dearest consideration in life is the shape of his shirt collar the other that of Denzil Murray who has wedded the perfectly well born well bred and virtuous if somewhat cold blooded daughter of his next door neighbor in the Highlands Concerning his Egyptian experience he never speaks he lives the ordinary life of the Scottish land owner looking after his tenantry considering the crops preserving the game and clearing fallen timber and if the glowing face of the beautiful Ziska ever floats before his memory it is only in a vague dream from which he quickly rouses himself with a troubled sigh His sister Helen has never married Lord Fulkeward proposed to her but was gently rejected whereupon the disconsolate young nobleman took a journey to the States and married the daughter of a millionaire oil merchant instead Sir Chetwynd Lyle and his pig faced spouse still thrive and grow fat on the proceeds of the Daily Dial and there is faint hope that one of their girls will wed an aspiring journalist a bold adventurer who wants a share in the paper somehow even if he has to marry Muriel or Dolly in order to get it Ross Courtney is the only man of the party once assembled at the Gezireh Palace Hotel who still goes to Cairo every winter fascinated thither by an annually recurring dim notion that he may discover traces of the lost Armand Gervase and the Princess Ziska And he frequently accompanies the numerous sight seers who season after season drive from Cairo to the Pyramids and take pleasure in staring at the Sphinx with all the impertinence common to pigmies when contemplating greatness But more riddles than that of the Sphinx are lost in the depths of the sandy desert and more unsolved problems lie in the recesses of the past than even the restless and inquiring spirit of modern times will ever discover and if it should ever chance that in days to come the secret of the movable floor of the Great Pyramid should be found and the lost treasures of Egypt brought to light there will probably be much discussion and marvel concerning the Golden Tomb of Araxes For the hieroglyphs on the jewelled sarcophagus speak of him thus and say Araxes was a Man of Might far exceeding in Strength and Beauty the common sons of men Great in War Invincible in Love he did Excel in Deeds of Courage and of Conquest and for whatsoever Sins he did in the secret Weakness of humanity commit the Gods must judge him But in all that may befit a Warrior Amenhotep The King doth give him honor and to the Spirits of Darkness and of Light his Soul is here commended to its Rest Thus much of the fierce dead hero of old time but of the mouldering corpse that lies on the golden floor of the same tomb its skeleton hand touching almost grasping the sword of Araxes what shall be said Nothing since the Old and the New the Past and the Present are but as one moment in the countings of eternity and even with a late repentance Love pardons all FINIS End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ziska by
