none	none	Gad man the last issue of Futuria Fantasia I didn t know if I was coming or going the way you heiroglyphed the sheets And I might add you re going to use even margins from here on in Okay okay okay I said slinking with flushed visage behind my stencils But from now on Futuria Fantasia will be ten cents straight an issue Ten cents straight Agreed snapped Gorgono if you are neater But you must be new neotiric different Then I flashed them the newly processed cover done by Bok Gods bellowed Gorgono That is stupendous A fine beginning mortal a very fine beginning Slith agreed by pounding vigorously on the table with his scaly rump And wait until you read Monroe s yarn I jubilantly exclaimed It s not science fiction but it s certainly a fine bit of story Yes said Gorgono this issue looks much better Glad to see you ve added two new authors Damon Knight and Joe Kelleam from Astounding I ll have to remind the fans to send in their dimes for this issue and perhaps support you a little more than they have with letters But we ll see about that He got up stretched yawned and vanished in a belching ball of flame Yes said Slith we ll see And he too vanished with a sharp pop All was quiet I went back to my stencils and my opium THE EDITOR HEIL by LYLE MONROE How dare you make such a suggestion The state physician doggedly stuck by his position I would not make it sire it your life were not at stake There is no other surgeon in the Fatherland who can transplant a pituitary gland but Doctor Lans You will operate The medico shook his head You would die Leader My skill is not adequate And unless the operation takes place at once you will certainly die The Leader stormed about the apartment He seemed about to give way to one of the girlish bursts of anger that even the inner state clique feared so much Surprisingly he capitulated Bring him here he ordered DOCTOR LANS FACED THE LEADER with inherent dignity a dignity and presence that three years of protective custody had been unable to shake The pallor and gauntness of the concentration camp lay upon him but his race was used to oppression I see he said Yes I see I can perform that operation What are your terms Terms The Leader was aghast Terms you filthy swine You are being given a chance to redeem in part the sins of your race The surgeon raised his brows Do you not think I know that you would not have sent for me had there been any other course available to you Obviously my services have become valuable You ll do as you are told You and your kind are lucky to be alive Nevertheless I shall not operate without my fee I said you were lucky to be alive The tone was an open threat Lans spread his hands Well I am an old man The Leader smiled True But I am informed that you have a a family The surgeon moistened his lips His Emma they would hurt his Emma and his little Rose But he must be brave as Emma would have him be He was playing for high stakes for all of them They cannot be worse off dead he answered firmly than they are now It was many hours before the Leader was convinced that Lans could not be budged He should have known the surgeon had learned fortitude at his mother s breast What is your fee A passport for myself and my family Good riddance My personal fortune restored to me Very well to be paid in gold before I operate The Leader started to object automatically then checked himself quickly Let the presumptuous fool think so It could be corrected after the operation And the operation to take place in a hospital on foreign soil Preposterous I must insist You do not trust me Lans stared straight back into his eyes without replying The Leader struck him hard across the mouth The surgeon made no effort to avoid the blow but took it with no change of expression YOU ARE WILLING TO GO THROUGH WITH IT SAMUEL The younger man looked at Doctor Lans without fear as he answered Certainly Doctor I can not guarantee that you will recover The Leader s pituitary gland is diseased when I exchange it for your healthy one your younger one may not be able to stand up under it that is the chance you take Besides a complete transplanting has never been done before I know it but I m out of the concentration camp Yes Yes that is true And if you do recover you are free And I will attend you myself until you are well enough to travel Samuel smiled It will be a positive joy to be sick in a country where there are no concentration camps Very well then Let us commence They returned to the silent nervous group at the other end of the room Grimly the money was counted out every penny that the famous surgeon had laid claim to before the Leader had decided that men of his religion had no need for money Lans placed half of the gold in a money belt and strapped it around his waist His wife concealed the other half somewhere about her ample person IT WAS AN hour and twenty minutes later that Lans put down the last instrument nodded to the surgeons assisting him and commenced to strip off operating gloves He took one last look at his two patients before he left the room They were anonymous under the sterile gowns and dressings Had he not known he could not have guessed dictator from oppressed Come to think of it with the exchange of those two tiny glands there was something of the dictator in his victim and something of the victim in the dictator DOCTOR LANS RETURNED TO THE hospital later in the day after seeing his wife and daughter safely settled in a first class hotel It was an extravagence in view of his uncertain prospects as a refugee but they had enjoyed no luxuries for years back there he didn t consider it his home country and it was justified this once He inquired at the office of the hospital for his second patient The clerk looked puzzled But he is not here Not here Why no He was moved at the same time as His Excellency back to your country Lans did not argue The trick was obvious it was too late to do anything for poor Samuel He thanked his God that he had had the foresight to place himself and his family beyond the reach of such brutal injustice before operating He thanked the clerk and left THE LEADER RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AT LAST His brain was confused then he recalled the events before he had gone to sleep The operation it was over And he was alive He had never admitted to anyone how terribly frightened he had been at the prospect But he had lived he had lived He groped around for the bellcord and failing to find it gradually forced his eyes to focus on the room What outrageous nonsense was this This was no sort of a room for the Leader to convalesce in He took in the dirty white washed ceiling and the bare wooden floor with distaste And the bed It was no more than a cot He shouted Someone came in a man wearing a uniform of a trooper in his favorite corps He started to give him the tongue lashing of his life before having him arrested But he was cut short Cut out the racket you unholy pig At first he was too astounded to answer then he shrieked Stand at attention when you address the Leader Salute The trooper looked dumbfounded at the sick man so totally different in appearance from the Leader then guffawed He stepped to the cot struck a pose with his right arm raised in salute He carried a rubber truncheon in it Hail to our Leader he shouted and brought his arm down smartly The truncheon crashed into the sick man s cheek bone Another trooper came in to see what the noise was while the first was still laughing at his wittcism What s up Jon Say you d better not handle that monkey too rough he s still carried on the hospital list He glanced casually at the bloody face Him Didn t you know Jon pulled him to one side and whispered The second man s eyes widened he grinned So They don t want him to get well eh Well I could use a little exercise this morning Let s get Fats the other suggested He s always so very amusing with his ideas Good idea He stepped to the door and bellowed Hey Fats They didn t really start in on him until Fats was there to help

none	none	 the phantoms by Joseph E Kellerman All day they played among the purple flowers That lay like frozen flames upon the lawn Or dreamed within the shadows of the towers Whose turret tops were painted as the dawn Bright was the garden peace went everywhere There was no breath of movement nor any sound Save butterflies that clove the heavy air Or when the bright fruit dropped slowly to the ground Then the flowers drooped from sliver thorns that tore Too soon the sun had died in amber smoke And frightened now but silent as before The phantoms watched the garden change its cloak Great sable moths flew out and one by one The towers melted with the fallen sun This is a plug Illustration one for the Voice of the IMAGI NATION price tenc from Box six thousand four hundred seventy five Met Sta Los Angeles Cal Footnote one The Art Widner otherwise is a bit better THOUGHTS ON THE WORLDSTATE by henry kuttner Illustration Sidenote The hideous mister Kuttner returns with an equally hideous tale We absolutely guarantee this story will induce nausea and slight regurgitation Lead on McKuttner I have as usual been brooding over the intricacies of modern civilization It seems to me that life is a peculiarly futile business This mood of mine may perhaps be attributed to my recent tragic encounter with a horse at the corner of forty second and Broadway I shall not dwell upon that incident save to mention briefly that horses should at least be careful of what they eat One never knows the result of the most innocent action and that by imperceptible degrees brings me to the subject of this article PLAYING FAIR WITH FANS or FANTASTIC DECENCY It has been said and very loudly too that fans fight a lot Well I do not care to refute that I happen to know that a Californian fan a mister Ackerman is in the habit of knocking down visitors and kicking them in strategic places The question naturally arises does fantasy lead to sadism I am reminded of the remarkable case of Scarlett O God an ardent fan whose tininess led to her being occasionally called by the diminutive or fanny This may seem somewhat confusing at first glance Let us therefore go hastily on to the next paragraph I should perhaps mention a mysterious white bearded gentleman called Tarboth the damned or Toby since he played a significant role in the incident It was he who listened toying at his beard idly while Scarlett feverishly upheld her position against the onslaughts of her foes Just what caused the argument I cannot recall at the moment Nor does it matter especially I believe it had something to do with Scarlett s being locked out of the Sanctuary or Washroom by previous arrivals Mocked scorned and jeered at Scarlett at first said nothing Ultimately however she lost her temper and cursed her enemies roundly I would she observed with feeling sell my soul to the devil in order to obtain vengeance At this moment the white bearded gentleman smiled unpleasently and vanished Simultaneously lightning struck the Sanctuary and demolished it to the natural discomfiture of the occupants Laughing in a triumphant manner Scarlett departed But the seeds of doom were already sown within her soul Not until she was soaked to the skin did she realize the ghastly and hideous truth Then looking up she saw that above her hovered a small black cloud from which rain was steadily descending As she realized the terror of her position black horror flooded the girl SHE HAD BECOME ALLERGIC TO WEATHER Well after that of course matters got steadily worse She was driven from home after blasting the bathtub and spoiling a valuable Angora kitten It was later made into a muff but moths got into it That however is another story and not an especially good one Poor Scarlett was excluded from all fan gatherings Sun stroke and eclipse were her constant companions She came with the deluge and was gone with the wind The girl was utterly friendless She roamed wildly here and there haggard careworn and miserable in a tattered gown made from the covers of AMAZING STORIES At night people could hear her moaning under their windows and they huddled closer to the fire whispering Fetch aft the rum Darby Evil walks abroad tonight and I feel my soul shudder in me No soda thanks Hopeless and forlorn Scarlett stowed away on a schooner out for Hong Kong But she was discovered cursed for a Jonah and set ashore on a cannibal isle in the South Seas It was a blessing in disguise The natives mistook her for a goddess They were used to bad weather and did not attribute the altered climate to Scarlett So they garlanded her with leis and made her their queen And she rained happily ever after Illustration Would you stroll with me my loved one Neath the pale Venusian Moon Where its misty orb goes drifting Waning darling all too soon Would you gaze into the rainbow Where the lunar moonbeams play Could it be you d softly answer Yes for all those things I pray If it s so my darling kick me For I d surely be a ninny Making love by Venus moonlight When you see there isn t any by J HARVEY HAGGARD THE PIPER ron reynolds Illustration LORD

none	none	The Martian boy at the feet of the old man stirred his thin reddish feet in the soil and affixed his large green eyes upon the burial hill where the Piper stood Why does he do that asked the boy
7967_117095_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah The old man s leathery face rumpled into a maze of wrinkles

none	none	Then louder higher insanely crying with shrill voice 
7967_117095_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The Piper was a tall gaunt man face as pale and wan as Martian moons eyes electrical purple standing against the soft of the dusking heaven holding his pipe to his lips playing 
7967_117095_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The Piper a silhouette a symbol a melody 
7967_117095_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Where did the Piper come from asked the Martian boy 
7967_117095_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 From Venus The old man took out his pipe and filled it 
none	none	Oh some twenty years ago or more on the projectile with the Terrestrians 
7967_117095_000010_000002	train-clean-360	I arrived on the same ship coming from Earth we shared a double seat together 
7967_117095_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 What is his name Again the boyish eager voice 
7967_117095_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t remember 
7967_117095_000012_000001	train-clean-360	I don t think I ever knew really 
7967_117095_000013_000000	train-clean-360	A vague rustling sound came into existence 
none	none	The Piper continued playing paying no heed to it 
7967_117095_000013_000002	train-clean-360	From the darkness across the star jewelled horizon came mysterious shapes creeping creeping 
none	none	Mars is
7967_117095_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 a dying world 
none	none	the old man said
7967_117095_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 Nothing ever happens of much gravity 
7967_117095_000014_000002	train-clean-360	The Piper I believe is an exile 
7967_117095_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The stars trembled like reflections in water dancing with the music 
none	none	An exile The old man continued
7967_117095_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 Something like a leper 
7967_117095_000016_000002	train-clean-360	They called him THE BRILLIANT 
7967_117095_000016_000003	train-clean-360	He was the epitome of all Venerian culture until the Earthmen came with their greedy incorporations and licentious harlots The Earthlings outlawed him sent him here to Mars to live out his days 
7967_117095_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Mars is a dying world repeated the boy 
none	none	A dying world How many Martians are there sir 
7967_117095_000018_000000	train-clean-360	The old man chuckled 
none	none	I guess maybe you are the last pure Martian alive boy But there are millions of others
7967_117095_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Where do they live 
7967_117095_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Where do they live 
7967_117095_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I have never seen them 
7967_117095_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 You are young 
7967_117095_000020_000001	train-clean-360	You have much to see much to learn 
none	none	Where do they live
7967_117095_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Out there beyond the mountains beyond the dead sea bottoms over the horizon and to the north in the caves far back in the subterrane 
none	none	Why Why 
7967_117095_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Now that s hard to say 
7967_117095_000024_000002	train-clean-360	They were a brilliant race once upon a time 
7967_117095_000024_000003	train-clean-360	But something happened to them hybrided them 
none	none	They are unintelligent creatures now cruel beasts
7967_117095_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Does Earth own Mars 
7967_117095_000025_000001	train-clean-360	The little boy s eyes were riveted upon the glowing planet overhead the green planet 
7967_117095_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes all of Mars 
none	none	Earth has three cities here each containing one thousand people The closest city is a mile from here down the road a group of small metal bubble like buildings The men from Earth move about among the buildings like ants enclosed in their space suits 
7967_117095_000026_000004	train-clean-360	They are miners 
7967_117095_000026_000005	train-clean-360	With their huge machines they rip open the bowels of our planet and dig out our precious life blood from the mineral arteries 
7967_117095_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that all 
7967_117095_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 That is all The old man shook his head sadly 
7967_117095_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 No culture no art no purpose 
7967_117095_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Greedy hopeless Earthlings 
7967_117095_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 And the other two cities where are they 
7967_117095_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 One is up the same cobbled road five miles the third is further still by some five hundred miles 
7967_117095_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 I am glad I live here with you alone The boy s head nodded sleepily I do not like the men from Terra 
7967_117095_000031_000001	train-clean-360	They are despoilers 
7967_117095_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 They have always been 
7967_117095_000032_000001	train-clean-360	But someday said the old man they will meet their doom 
7967_117095_000032_000002	train-clean-360	They have blasphemed enough have they 
none	none	They cannot own planets as they have and expect nothing but greedy luxury for their sluggishly squat bodies 
7967_117095_000032_000004	train-clean-360	Someday His voice rose high in tempo and pitch with the Piper s wild music 
none	none	Wild music insane music stirring music 
7967_117095_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Music to stir the savage into life 
7967_117095_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Music to effect man s destiny 
7967_117095_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Wild eyed Piper on the hill Crying out your rigadoons Bring the savages to kill Neath the waning Martian moons 
7967_117095_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 What is that asked the boy 
7967_117095_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 A poem said the old man 
7967_117095_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 A poem I have written in the last few days I feel something is going to happen very soon 
7967_117095_000036_000002	train-clean-360	The Piper s song is growing more insistent every night 
7967_117095_000036_000003	train-clean-360	At first twenty years ago he played on only a few nights of every year but now for the last three years he has played until dawn every night of every autumn when the planet is dying 
none	none	Bring the savages the boy sat up
7967_117095_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 What savages 
none	none	There 
7967_117095_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Along the star glimmered mountain tops a vast clustering herd of black murmuring advancing 
none	none	The music screamed higher and higher
7967_117095_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Piper pipe that song again 
7967_117095_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Piper pipe that song again So he piped I wept to hear 
7967_117095_000056_000001	train-clean-360	So he piped I wept to hear 
7967_117095_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 More of the poem asked the boy 
7967_117095_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Not my poem but a poem from Earth some seventy years ago 
7967_117095_000042_000001	train-clean-360	I learned it in school 
7967_117095_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Music is strange The little boy s eyes were scintillant with thought It warms me inside 
7967_117095_000043_000001	train-clean-360	This music makes me angry 
none	none	Why
7967_117095_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Because it is music with a purpose 
7967_117095_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 What purpose 
none	none	We shall know by dawn
7967_117095_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Music is the language of all things intelligent or not savage or educated civilian 
7967_117095_000047_000001	train-clean-360	This Piper knows his music as a god knows his heaven For twenty years he has composed his hymn of action and hate and finally tonight perhaps the finale will be reached 
7967_117095_000047_000002	train-clean-360	At first many years ago when he played he received no answer from the subterrane but the murmur of gibbering voices 
none	none	Five years ago he lured the voices and the creatures from their caves to the mountain tops 
7967_117095_000047_000004	train-clean-360	Tonight for the first time the herd of black will spill over the trails toward our hovel toward the road toward the cities of man 
7967_117095_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Music screaming higher faster insanely sending shock after macabre shock thru night air loosening the stars from their riveted stations The Piper stretched high six feet or more upon his hillock swaying back and forth his thin shape attired in brown cloth 
7967_117095_000048_000001	train-clean-360	The black mass on the mountain came down like amoebic tentacles met and coalesced muttering and mumbling 
none	none	Go inside and hide said the old man
7967_117095_000048_000003	train-clean-360	 You are young you must live to propagate the new Mars 
7967_117095_000048_000004	train-clean-360	Tonight is the end of the old tomorrow begins the new 
7967_117095_000048_000005	train-clean-360	It is death for the men of Earth Higher still and higher 
7967_117095_000048_000006	train-clean-360	 death 
7967_117095_000053_000001	train-clean-360	death 
none	none	for the men of Earth Higher still and higher Death 
7967_117095_000048_000007	train-clean-360	They come to overrun the Earthlings destroy their cities take their projectiles

none	none	The End THE ITCHING HOUR by Damon Knight Mind you I don t believe the story myself It was obvious from the start that the old man was mad Besides I was stinko at the time and I may not have got some of the details right But in its essentials the story still sticks in my mind I can see the old man now with a pair of my best socks around his neck moaning and wheezing and spitting on the floor and in between times telling his strange strange story Of course the whole thing was fantastic the old loon had probably escaped from some nut factory and yet No no the old man was booby And yet And yet The night it happened I was sitting in my study in my white silk Russian lounging robe smoking a narghile or Indian water pipe and throwing darts at a signed photograph of Sally Rand I d just pinked her neatly in the gluteus maximus when I was startled by a crash of glass and turned around to see an aged man tottering carefully thru the remains of my French windows At once the chill of horror griped me Oops I mean gripped Unable to move I stared speechlessly as the old man went directly to my chest of drawers and fumbled within the overhead light throwing his face into sombre shadow Blowing his nose on one of my dress shirts he grumbled to himself about the starch and selected a pair of lamb s wool socks and tied them around his neck This done he hobbled over to a chair facing mine sat down pulled his tattered undershirt which for some reason he was wearing as a shawl more closely around his thin shoulders stared reproachfully at me shivering at the icy blast that came in thru the shattered windows There s a draft in here and you know what you can do about it he complained Yes there is I managed to get out He nodded satisfied I thought there was he said Then dragging his chair closer he leaned over and grasping me firmly by the lapels said pleasently Ipswitch on the amscray don t you think Half stifled with terror I gasped Uh yes At once his manner was transformed Drawing himself up indignantly he sneered That s a lie That s what they all say the sniveling hypocrites They know it s a lie Then he drew nearer once again But he said I m going to tell you my story anyway You have a kind face And I I just don t have any at all He raised the rim of his hat and I saw it was true He had no face Gibbering I tried to get away to flee or scram but it was too late Taking a firmer grip on my lapels and standing heavily on my foot the old man began his story You may not believe it he began but I too was once a carefree young fan like yourself From morning til night I thot of nothing but eating sleeping sex and my fan mag PUKE In the evening I would stay up til morning splashing happily in my hecto inks and turning out pages and pages of material like mad And at last I d go to bed tired but happy knowing I had done my duty as an honest fan And then one day it happened By some unfortunate chance I got a little double strength purple hectograph ink on my face Noticing it in the mirror the next morning as I was trying to decide whether to shave this week or not I took a washcloth and tried to rub off the stain Alas poor fool that I was I recked not of the consequences With hard rubbing I managed to get some of the ink off but when I went on rubbing to remove the rest the ink I had rubbed off was transferred back to my face And so it went the adament ink going from washrag to face and from face back to washrag The ink as I have said was double strength purple undiluted and suffered nothing in the process But something had to give way The washrag by an unhappy coincidence was a brand new one and my face was some years old Only one thing could have happened It did Thus shedding a tear on the carpet the old stranger ended his weird tale Getting slowly to his feet he drew his hat down over his eyes once more tied his socks around his neck more tightly and shuffled off toward the shattered windows At the sill he turned faced the room and made one last parting shot ere he vanished in the gloom Dogs have fleas he screamed But sometimes I wonder I VE NEVER SEEN by Hannes Bok Illustration I ve never seen a Flirtenflog I ve heard that
