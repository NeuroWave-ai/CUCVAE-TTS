5660_101892_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 of course not 
none	none	There is no one except old mister and missus Barrett who keep the house and grounds in order We have it all to ourselves Margaret was silent She turned and walked slowly along the path at her mother s side On her face was a puzzled questioning To her eyes was gradually coming a frightened doubt Alone just they two with the little old man and the little old woman in the kitchen who did not take up any room at all Why back in the Alley there were Patty the twins and all the Whalens and they had only one room It was like that too everywhere all through the Alley so many many people so little room for them Yet here here was this great house all windows and doors and soft carpets and pretty pictures and only two three four people to enjoy it all Why had not her mother asked Even to herself Margaret could not say the words She shut her lips tight and threw a hurried look into the face of the woman at her side This dear dream lady this beautiful new mother as if there could be any question of her goodness and kindness Very likely anyway there were not any poor Margaret s eyes cleared suddenly She turned a radiant face on her mother Oh I know she cried in triumph There ain t any poor folks here and so you couldn t do it missus Kendall looked puzzled Poor folks Couldn t do it she questioned Yes poor folks like Patty and the Whalens and so you couldn t ask em to live with you missus Kendall sat down abruptly Near her was a garden settee She felt particularly glad of its support just then And of course you didn t know about the Whalens and Patty went on Margaret eagerly and so you couldn t ask them neither But you do now and they d just love to come I know Love to to come stammered missus Kendall gazing blankly into the glowing young face before her Of course they would nodded Margaret dancing up and down and clapping her hands Wouldn t you if you didn t have nothin but a room right down under the sidewalk and there was such a heap of folks in it Why here there s everythin everythin for em and oh I m so glad cause they was good to me so good First Mis Whalen took in Patty and the twins when the rent man dumped em out on the sidewalk and she gave em a whole corner of her kitchen And then when I runned away from the bag pasting Patty and the twins took me in And now I can pay em back for it all I can pay em back I m so glad missus Kendall fell back limply against the garden seat Twice she opened her lips and closed them again Her face flushed then paled and her hands grew cold in her lap This dancing little maid with the sunlit hair and the astounding proposition to adopt into their home two whole families from the slums of New York was Margaret her own little Margaret lost so long ago and now so miraculously restored to her As if she could refuse any request however wild from Margaret But this But sweetheart perhaps they they wouldn t want to go away forever and leave their home she remonstrated at last feebly The child frowned her finger to her lips Well anyhow we can ask them she declared after a minute her face clearing Suppose we we make it a visit first suggested missus Kendall feverishly By and by after I ve had you all to myself for a little while you shall ask them to to visit you O bully agreed Margaret in swift delight That will be nicest won t it Then they can see how they like it but there they ll like it all right They couldn t help it And how how many are there questioned missus Kendall moistening her dry lips and feeling profoundly thankful for even this respite from the proposed wholesale adoption Why let s see Margaret held up her fingers and checked off her prospective guests There s Patty she s the oldest and Arabella and Clarabella they re the twins an they re my age you know that s the Murphys And then there s all the Whalens Tom Peter Mary Jamie and oh I dunno six or eight maybe with Mis Whalen and her husband But after all it don t make so very much diff rence just how many there are does it she added with a happy little skip and jump cause there s heaps of room here for any mount of em And I never can remember just how many there are without forgettin some of em You you don t mind if I don t name em all now And she gazed earnestly into her mother s face No dear no assured missus Kendall hurriedly You you have named quite enough And now we ll go down to the brook We haven t seen half of Five Oaks yet And once more she tried to make the joyous present drive from her daughter s thoughts the grievous past 
5660_101854_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER II
none	none	 It was not long before all Houghtonsville knew the story and there was not a man woman or child in the town that did not take the liveliest interest in the little maid at Five Oaks who had passed through so amazing an experience 
5660_101854_000002_000001	train-clean-360	To be lost at five years of age in a great city to be snatched from wealth happiness and a loving mother s arms only to be thrust instantly into poverty misery and loneliness and then to be after four long years suddenly returned no wonder Houghtonsville held its breath and questioned if it all indeed were true 
5660_101854_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Bit by bit the little girl s history was related in every house in town and many a woman and some men wept over the tale of how the little fingers had sewed on buttons in the attic sweat shop and pasted bags in the ill smelling cellar 
none	none	The story of the cooperative housekeeping establishment in one corner of the basement kitchen where she together
5660_101883_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 with Patty 
none	none	and the twins divvied up the day s haul that too came in for its share of exclamatory adjectives as did the account of how she was finally discovered through her finding her own name over the little cot bed at Mont Lawn the little bed that missus Kendall had endowed in the name of her lost daughter in the children s vacation home for the poor little waifs from the city An ter think of her findin her own baby jest by givin some other woman s baby a bit of joy cried missus Merton of the old red farmhouse when the story was told to her But there 
5660_101854_000004_000002	train-clean-360	ain t that what she s always doin for folks somethin ter make em happy 
none	none	Didn t she bring my own child Sadie an the boy Bobby back from the city and ain t Sadie gettin well an strong on the farm here And it s a comfort ter me too when I remember twas Bobby who first found the little Margaret cryin in the streets there in New York an took her home ter my Sadie Twa n t much Sadie could do for the poor little lamb but she did what she could till old Sullivan got his claws on her and kept her shut up out o sight But there 
5660_101854_000004_000006	train-clean-360	what s past is past and there ain t no use frettin over it 
none	none	She s home now in her own mother s arms and I m thinkin it s the whole town that s rejoicin And the whole town did rejoice and many and various were the ways the townspeople took to show it The Houghtonsville brass band marched in full uniform to Five Oaks one evening and gave a serenade with red fire and rockets much to missus Kendall s embarrassment and Margaret s delight The Ladies Aid Society gave a tea with missus Kendall and Margaret as a kind of pivot around which the entire affair revolved this time to the embarrassment of both missus Kendall and her daughter The minister of the Methodist church appointed a day of prayer and thanksgiving in commemoration of the homecoming of the wanderer and the town poet published in the Houghtonsville Banner a forty eight line poem on The Lost and Found 
5660_101854_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Nor was this all 
none	none	To missus Kendall it seemed that almost every man woman and child in the place came to her door with inquiries and congratulations together with all sorts of offerings from flowers and frosted cakes to tidies and worked bedspreads 
5660_101854_000006_000002	train-clean-360	She was not ungrateful certainly but she was overwhelmed 
5660_101854_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Not only the cakes and the tidies however gave missus Kendall food for thought during those first few days after Margaret s return 
5660_101854_000007_000001	train-clean-360	From the very nature of the case it was of necessity a period of adjustment and to missus Kendall s consternation there was every indication of friction if not disaster 
5660_101854_000008_000000	train-clean-360	For four years now her young daughter had been away from her tender care and influence and for only one of those four years the last had she come under the influence of any sort of refinement or culture and then under only such as a city missionary and an overworked schoolteacher could afford supplemented by the two trips to Mont Lawn 
none	none	To be sure behind it all had been Margaret s careful training for the first five years of her life and it was because of this training that she had so quickly yielded to what good influences she had known in the last year The Alley however was not Five Oaks and the standards of one did not measure to those of the other 
5660_101854_000008_000002	train-clean-360	It was not easy for Mag of the Alley to become at once Margaret Kendall the dainty little daughter of a well bred fastidious mother 
none	none	To the doctor the doctor who had gone to New York and brought Margaret home and who knew her as she was missus 
5660_101854_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Kendall went for advice 
5660_101854_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 What shall I do she asked anxiously 
none	none	A hundred times a day the dear child s speech movements and actions are not what I like them to be And yet if I correct each one twill be a continual don t all day Why doctor the child will hate me As if any one could do that smiled the doctor and at the look in his eyes missus Kendall dropped her own the happiness that had come to her with this man s love was very new she had scarcely yet looked it squarely in the face
5660_101854_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 The child is so good and loving she went on a little hurriedly that it makes it all the harder but I must do something 
none	none	Only this morning she told the minister that she thought Houghtonsville was a bully place and that the people were tiptop Her table manners poor child I ran away from the table and cried like a baby the first time I saw her eat and yet perhaps the very next thing she does will be so dainty and sweet that I could declare the other was all a dream 
5660_101854_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Doctor what shall I do 
5660_101854_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I know I know nodded the man 
5660_101854_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 I have seen it myself 
none	none	But dear she ll learn she ll learn wonderfully fast 
5660_101854_000017_000004	train-clean-360	You ll see 
5660_101883_000030_000001	train-clean-360	You ll see 
5660_101854_000013_000004	train-clean-360	It s in her the gentleness and the refinement 
none	none	She ll have to be corrected some of course it s out of the question that she shouldn t be 
5660_101854_000013_000006	train-clean-360	But she ll come out straight 
5660_101854_000013_000007	train-clean-360	Her heart is all right 
5660_101854_000014_000000	train-clean-360	missus Kendall laughed softly 
5660_101854_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Her heart doctor she exclaimed 
5660_101854_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 Just there lies the greatest problem of all 
none	none	The one creed of her life is to divvy up and how I m going to teach her ordinary ideas of living without shattering all her faith in me I don t know 
5660_101854_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Why Harry missus 
none	none	Kendall s voice was tragic she gazes at me with round eyes of horror because I have two coats and two hats and two loaves of bread and haven t yet divvied up with some one who has none 
5660_101854_000015_000005	train-clean-360	So far her horror is tempered by the fact that she is sure I didn t know before that there were any people who did not have all these things 
5660_101854_000015_000006	train-clean-360	Now that she has told me of them she confidently looks to me to do my obvious duty at once 
5660_101854_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The doctor laughed 
5660_101854_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 As if you weren t always doing things for people he said fondly 
5660_101854_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Then he grew suddenly grave 
none	none	The dear child I m afraid that along with her education and civilization her altruism will get a few hard knocks But she ll get over that too You ll see 
5660_101854_000017_000005	train-clean-360	At heart she s so gentle and why what he broke off with an unspoken question his eyes widely opened at the change that had come to her face 
5660_101854_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh nothing returned missus Kendall almost despairingly only if you d seen Joe Bagley yesterday morning I m afraid you d have changed your opinion of her gentleness 
none	none	She she fought him missus Kendall stumbled over the words and flushed a painful red as she spoke them Fought him Joe Bagley gasped the doctor
5660_101854_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 Why he s almost twice her size 
5660_101854_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I know but that didn t seem to occur to Margaret returned missus Kendall 
none	none	She saw only the kitten he was tormenting and well she rescued the kitten and then administered what she deemed to be fit punishment there and then 
5660_101854_000020_000002	train-clean-360	When I arrived on the scene they were the center of an admiring crowd of children missus 
5660_101854_000020_000003	train-clean-360	Kendall shivered visibly and Margaret was just delivering herself of a final blow that sent the great bully off blubbering 
5660_101854_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Good for her it was an involuntary tribute straight from the heart 
5660_101854_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Harry gasped missus Kendall 
5660_101854_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 Good a delicate girl 
none	none	No no of course not murmured the doctor hastily though his eyes still glowed It won t do of course but you must remember her life her struggle for very existence all those years She had to train her fists to fight her way I I suppose so admitted missus Kendall faintly but she shivered again as if with a sudden chill CHAPTER III Scarcely had Houghtonsville recovered from its first shock of glad surprise at Margaret s safe return when it was shaken again to its very center by the news of missus Kendall s engagement to doctor Spencer The old Kendall estate had been for more than a generation the show place of the town Even during the years immediately following the loss of little Margaret when the great stone lions on each side of the steps had kept guard over closed doors and shuttered windows even then the place was pointed out to strangers for its beauty as well as for the tragedy that had so recently made it a living tomb to its mistress Sometimes though not often a glimpse might be caught of a slender black robed woman and always there could be seen the one unshuttered window on the second floor Every one knew the story of that window and of the sunlit room beyond where lay the little woolly dog just as the baby hands had dropped it there years before and every one knew that the black robed woman widow of Frank Kendall and mother of the lost little girl was grieving her heart out in the great lonely house Not until the last two years of Margaret s absence had there come a change and then it was so gradual that the townspeople scarcely noticed it Little by little however the air of gloom left the house One by one the blinds were thrown open to the sunlight and more and more frequently missus Kendall was seen walking in the garden or even upon the street Not until the news of the engagement had come however did Houghtonsville people realize the doctor s part in all this Then they understood It was he who had administered to her diseased body and still more diseased mind he who had roused her from her apathy of despair and he who had taught her that the world was full of other griefs even as bitter as her own Not twenty four hours after the news of the engagement became public property old Nathan town gossip and driver in chief to a generation of physicians doctor Spencer included observed triumphantly And I ain t a mite surprised neither It s a good thing too They re jest suited ter each other Ain t they been traipsin all over town tergether an ridin whar twas too fur ter foot it Ter be sure they allers went ter some one s that was sick an allers took jellies an things ter eat an read but I had eyes an I ain t a fool She done good though heaps of it an tain t no wonder the doctor fell head over heels in love with her An thar was the little gal too Didn t he go twice ter New York a huntin fur her an wa n t it through him that they finally got her Course twas Twas him that told Mis Kendall bout that ere Mont Lawn whar they sends them poor little city kids ter get a breath o fresh air an twas him that sent on the twenty one dollars for her so s she could name a bed fur little Margaret an twas him that at last went ter New York an fetched her home Gorry twas allers him Thar wa n t no way out of it I say They jest had ter get engaged It was not long before the most of Houghtonsville in sentiment if not in words came to old Nathan s opinion this prospective marriage was an ideal arrangement after all and not in the least surprising There remained now only the pleasant task of making the wedding a joyful affair befitting the traditions of the town and of the honored name of Kendall In all Houghtonsville perhaps there was only one heart that did not beat in sympathy and that one strangely enough belonged to missus Kendall s own daughter Margaret You mean you are goin to marry him and that he ll be your husband for for keeps Margaret demanded with some agitation when her mother told her of the engagement missus Kendall smiled The red mounted to her cheek Yes dear she said And he ll live here with us Margaret s voice was growing in horror Why yes dear murmured missus Kendall then quizzically Why sweetheart what s the matter Don t you like doctor Spencer It was only last week that you were begging me to ask some one here to live with us Margaret frowned anxiously But mother dear that was poor folks she explained her eyes troubled doctor Spencer ain t that kind you know You you said he d be a husband Yes And and husbands mother broke off the little girl her voice sharp with anguished love and terror He sha n t come here to beat you and bang you round he just sha n t Beat me gasped missus Kendall Margaret what in the world are you thinking of to say such a thing as that Margaret was almost crying now The old hunted look had come back to her eyes and her face looked suddenly pinched and old She came close to her mother s side and caught the soft folds of her mother s dress in cold shaking fingers But they do do it all of em she warned frenziedly Tim Sullivan an mister Whalen an Patty s father they was all husbands every one of em and there wasn t one of em but what beat their wives and banged em round
7247_101864_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 You don t know 
none	none	You hain t seen em maybe but they do do it mother they do do it For a moment missus Kendall stared speechlessly into the young old face before her then she caught the little girl in her arms You poor little dear she choked You poor forlorn little bunch of misguided pessimism Come let me tell you how really good and kind and gentle the doctor is Beat me indeed Oh Margaret Margaret CHAPTER IV In spite of missus Kendall s earnest efforts Margaret was not easily convinced that marriage might be desirable and that all husbands were not patterned after Tim Sullivan and Mike Whalen 
7584-101856-0001	train-other-500	Nor was this coming marriage the only thing that troubled Margaret Life at the Alley was still too vividly before her eyes to allow her to understand any scheme of living that did not recognize the supremacy of the sharpest tongue and the heaviest fist
7584-101856-0002	train-other-500	and this period of adjustment to the new order of things was not without its trials for herself as well as for her mother
none	none	 The beauty love and watchful care that surrounded her filled her with ecstatic rapture 
7584-101856-0003	train-other-500	but the niceties of speech and manner daily demanded of her terrified and dismayed her Why bully and bang up should be frowned upon when after all they but expressed her pleasure in something provided for her happiness
7584-101856-0004	train-other-500	she could not understand and why the handling of the absurdly large number of knives forks and spoons about her plate at dinner should be a matter of so great moment she could not see
7584-101856-0005	train-other-500	As for the big white square of folded cloth that her mother thought so necessary at every meal its dainty purity filled Margaret with dismay lest she soil or wrinkle it and for her part she would have much preferred to let it quite alone
7584-101856-0006	train-other-500	There were the callers too beautiful ladies in trailing gowns who insisted upon seeing her though why Margaret could not understand for they invariably cried and said Poor little lamb when they did see her
7584-101856-0007	train-other-500	in spite of her efforts to convince them that she was perfectly happy And there were the children they too were disconcerting They came sometimes alone and sometimes with their parents but always they stared
7584-101856-0008	train-other-500	and seemed afraid of her There were others to be sure who were not afraid of her But they never called They slipped in through the back gate at the foot of the garden and they were really very nice They were Nat and Tom and Roxy Trotter
7584-101856-0009	train-other-500	and they lived in a little house down by the river They never wore shoes nor stockings and their clothes were not at all like those of the other children Margaret suspected that the Trotters were poor
7584-101856-0010	train-other-500	and she took pains that her mother should see Nat and Tom and Roxy Her mother however did not appear to know them which did not seem so very strange to Margaret after all for of course her mother had not known there were any poor people so near
7584-101856-0011	train-other-500	otherwise she would have shared her home with them long ago At first it was Margaret s plan to rectify this little mistake immediately
none	none	 but the more she thought of it the more thoroughly was she convinced that the first chance belonged by right to Patty s family and the Whalens in New York 
7584-101856-0012	train-other-500	inasmuch as they had been so good to her She determined therefore to wait awhile before suggesting the removal of the Trotter family from their tiny inconvenient house to the more spacious and desirable Five Oaks
none	none	 Delightful as were the Trotters however even they did not quite come up to Bobby McGinnis for real comradeship Bobby lived with his mother and grandmother in the little red farmhouse farther up the hill It was he who had found Margaret crying in the streets on that first dreadful day long ago when she was lost in New York For a week she had lived in his attic home 
7584-101856-0014	train-other-500	then she had become frightened at his father s drunken rage one day and had fled to the streets never to return All this Margaret knew though she had but a faint recollection of it It made a bond of sympathy between them nevertheless
7584-101856-0015	train-other-500	and caused them to become fast friends at once It was to Bobby that she went for advice when the standards of Houghtonsville and the Alley clashed and it was to Bobby that she went for sympathy when grievous mismanagement of the knives and forks
7584-101856-0016	train-other-500	or of the folded square of cloth brought disaster to herself and tears to her mother s eyes She earnestly desired to as she expressed it to Bobby come up to the scratch and walk straight and it was to Bobby that she looked for aid and counsel
none	none	 You see you can tell just what tis ails me she argued earnestly as the two sat in their favorite perch in the apple tree You don t know Patty and the Whalens course 
7584-101856-0017	train-other-500	but you do know folks just like em and mother don t you see she knows only the kind that lives here and she she don t understand But you know both kinds
5660_101892_000026_000002	train-clean-360	 don t you see 
none	none	she knows only the kind that lives here and she she don t understand But you know both kinds and you can tell where tis that I ain t like em here And I want to be like em Bobby I do truly 
7584-101856-0018	train-other-500	They re just bang up I mean beautiful folks she corrected hastily And mother s so good to me She s just Margaret stopped suddenly A new thought seemed to have come to her Bobby she cried with sharp abruptness
7584-101856-0019	train-other-500	did you ever know any husbands that was good Husbands Good What do ye mean Did you ever know any that was good I mean that didn t beat their wives and bang em round Did you Bobby Bobby laughed
7584-101856-0020	train-other-500	He lifted his chin quizzically and gazed down from the lofty superiority of his fourteen years
none	none	 Sure an ain t ye beginnin sort o early ter worry about husbands he teased 
7584-101856-0021	train-other-500	But mebbe you ve already er picked him out eh Margaret did not seem to hear She was looking straight through a little open space in the boughs of the apple tree to the blue sky far beyond Bobby she began in a voice scarcely above a whisper
7584-101856-0022	train-other-500	if that man should be bad to my mother I think I d kill him Bobby roused himself He suddenly remembered Joe Bagley and the kitten What man he asked doctor Spencer doctor Spencer
7584-101856-0023	train-other-500	gasped Bobby Why doctor Spencer wouldn t hurt a fly He s just bully Margaret stirred restlessly She turned a grave face on her companion Bobby she reproved gently
none	none	 I don t think I d oughter hear them words if I ain t lowed to use em myself 
7584-101856-0024	train-other-500	Bobby uptilted his chin I ve heard your ma say ain t wa n t proper he observed virtuously
none	none	 I shouldn t have mentioned it 
7584-101856-0025	train-other-500	only well seein as how you re gettin so awful particular For the more telling effect he left the sentence unfinished Again Margaret did not seem to hear Again her eyes had sought the patch of blue showing through the green leaves
7584-101856-0026	train-other-500	doctor Spencer may be nice now but he ain t a husband yet she said thoughtfully There was Tim Sullivan and Patty s father and Mike Whalen she enumerated aloud And they was all
7584-101856-0027	train-other-500	Bobby was your father a good husband she demanded with a sudden turn that brought her eyes squarely round to his The boy was silent Bobby was he Slowly the boy s eyes fell Well of course sometimes dad would
7584-101856-0028	train-other-500	he began but Margaret interrupted him I knew it I just knew it I just knew there wasn t any she moaned but I can t make mother see it I just can t This was but the first of many talks between Margaret and Bobby upon the same subject
7584-101856-0029	train-other-500	and always Margaret was seeking for a possible averting of the catastrophe To convince her mother of the awfulness of the fate awaiting her and so to persuade her to abandon the idea of marriage was out of the question Margaret soon found
7584-101856-0030	train-other-500	It was then perhaps that the idea of speaking to the doctor himself first came to her If I could only get him to promise things she said to Bobby If I could only get him to promise Promise Yes to be good and kind you know
7584-101856-0031	train-other-500	nodded Margaret and not like a husband Bobby laughed then he frowned and was silent Suddenly his face changed I say you might make him sign a contract he hazarded Contract Sure
none	none	 One of them things that makes folks toe the mark whether they wants to or not 
7584-101856-0032	train-other-500	I ll draw it up for you that s what they call it he explained airily and as Margaret bubbled over with delight and thanks he added Not at all Tain t nothin
none	none	 Glad ter do it I m sure For a month now Bobby had swept the floor and dusted the books in the law office of Burt Burt to say nothing of running errands and tending door In days gone by the law as represented by the policeman on the corner was something to be avoided 
7584-101856-0034	train-other-500	but to day as represented by a frock coat a tall hat and a vocabulary bristling with big words it was something that was most alluring so alluring in fact that Bobby had determined to adopt it as his own He himself would be a lawyer
7584-101856-0035	train-other-500	tall hat frock coat big words and all Hence his readiness to undertake this little matter of drawing up a contract for Margaret his first client It was some days nevertheless before the work was ready for the doctor s signature
none	none	 The young lawyer unfortunately could not give all of his time to his own affairs there were still the trivial duties of his office to perform He found too that the big words which fell so glibly from the lips of the great Burt Burt 
7584-101856-0037	train-other-500	were anything but easily managed when he tried to put them upon paper himself Bobby was ambitious and persistent however and where knowledge failed imagination stepped boldly to the front In the end it was with no little pride
7584-101856-0038	train-other-500	that he displayed the result of his labor to his client then with her gleeful words of approval still ringing in his ears he slipped it into its envelope sealed stamped and posted it
none	none	 Thus it happened that the next day a very much amazed physician received this in his mail 
7584-101856-0039	train-other-500	To whom it may concern Whereas I the Undersigned being in my sane Mind do intend to commit Matremony I the said Undersigned do hereby solumly declare and agree to wit
none	none	 not to Beat my aforesaid Wife 
7584-101856-0040	train-other-500	Not to Bang her round Not to Falsely Wickedly and Maliciously treat her Not once Moreover I the said Undersigned do solumly Swear all this to Margaret Kendall
7584-101856-0041	train-other-500	the dorter and Lawfull Protectur of the said Wife to wit missus Kendall And whereas if I
none	none	 the aforesaid Undersigned do break and violate this my solum Oath concerning the said Wife 
7584-101856-0042	train-other-500	I do hereby Swear that she to wit Margaret Kendall may bestow upon me such Punishmunt as seems eminuntly proper to her at such time as she sees fit Whereas and whereunto I have this day set my Hand and Seal
none	none	 Here followed a space for the signature and a somewhat thumbed irregular daub of red sealing wax CHAPTER V It was a particularly warm July evening but a faint breeze from the west stirred the leaves of the Crimson Rambler that climbed over the front veranda at Five Oaks and brought the first relief from the scorching heat The great stone lions loomed out of the shadows and caught the moonlight full on their shaggy heads To the doctor sitting alone on the veranda steps they seemed almost alive and he smiled at the thought that came to him So you think you too are guarding her he chuckled quietly Pray and are you also her Lawfull Protectur A light step sounded on the floor behind him and he sprang to his feet She s asleep said missus Kendall softly She dropped asleep almost as soon as she touched the pillow Dear child Yes children are apt Amy dearest broke off the doctor sharply you are crying No no it is nothing assured missus Kendall as the doctor led her to a chair It is always this way only to night it was a a little more heart breaking than usual Always this way Heart breaking Why Amy missus Kendall smiled then raised her hand to brush away a tear You don t understand she murmured It s the bedtime prayer Margaret s then at the doctor s amazed frown she added The dear child goes over her whole day bit by bit and asks forgiveness for countless misdemeanors and it nearly breaks my heart for it shows how many times I have said don t to the poor little thing since morning And as if that were not piteous enough she must needs ask the dear Father to tell her how to handle her fork and how to sit walk and talk so s to please mother Harry what shall I do But you are doing returned the doctor You are loving her and you are surrounding her with everything good and beautiful But I want to do right myself just right And you are doing just right dear But the results they are so irregular and uneven sighed the mother despairingly One minute she is the gentle loving little girl I held in my arms five years ago and the next she is well she isn t Margaret at all No smiled the doctor She isn t Margaret at all She is Mag of the Alley dependent on her wits and her fists for life itself Don t worry sweetheart It will all come right in time it can t help it but it will take the time She tries so hard the little precious and she does love me A curious smile curved the doctor s lips She does he said dryly Why Harry what missus Kendall s eyes were questioning The doctor hesitated Then very slowly he drew from his pocket a large somewhat legal looking document I hardly know whether to share this with you or not he began still it is too good to keep to myself and it concerns you intimately moreover you may be able to assist me with some advice in the matter or at least with some possible explanation And he held out the paper missus Kendall turned in her chair so that the light from the open hall door would fall upon the round cramped handwriting To whom it may concern she read aloud Whereas I the Undersigned being in my sane Mind do intend to commit Matremony Why Harry what in the world is this she demanded Go on read returned the doctor with a nonchalant wave of his hand and missus Kendall dropped her eyes again to the paper Harry what in the world does this mean she gasped a minute later as she finished reading half laughing half crying and wholly amazed But that is exactly what I was going to ask you parried the doctor You don t mean that Margaret wrote but she couldn t besides it isn t her writing No Margaret didn t write it For that part I think I detect the earmarks of young McGinnis At all events it came from him Bobby Yes But who missus Kendall stopped abruptly A dawning comprehension came into her eyes You mean Harry she was at the bottom of it I remember now It was only a week or two ago that she used those same words to me She insisted that you would beat me and and bang me round Oh Margaret Margaret my poor little girl The doctor smiled then he shook his head gravely Poor child She hasn t seen much of conjugal felicity has she he murmured then softly It is left for us sweetheart to teach her that The color deepened in missus Kendall s cheeks Her eyes softened then danced merrily But you haven t signed this sir yet she challenged laughingly as she held out the paper He caught both paper and hands in a warm clasp But I will he declared Wait and see Not twenty hours later Bobby McGinnis halted at the great gate of the driveway at Five Oaks and gave a peculiar whistle Almost instantly Margaret flew across the lawn to meet him Oh it s jest a little matter of business greeted Bobby with careless ease I ve got that ere document here all signed I reckoned the doctor wouldn t lose no time makin sure ter do his part Bobby not the contract so soon exulted Margaret Sure Why not I told him ter please sign to once an return An he did course I reckoned he meant business in this little matter an he reckoned I did too There wa n t nothin for him ter do but sign course Margaret drew her brows together in a thoughtful frown But he might have refused she suggested Bobby gave her a scornful glance Refused an lost the chance of marryin at all Not much he asserted with emphasis Well anyhow I m glad he didn t sighed Margaret as she clutched the precious paper close to her heart I should a hated to have refused outright to let him marry her when mother Bobby mother actually seems to want to have him CHAPTER VI 
7597-101858-0000	train-other-500	Margaret had been at home four weeks when the invitation for Patty Arabella Clarabella and three of the Whalens to visit her finally left her mother s hands There had not been a day of all those four weeks that Margaret had not talked of the coming visit
7597-101858-0001	train-other-500	At first to be sure she had not called it a visit she had referred to it as the time when Patty and the Whalens come here to live Gradually however her mother had persuaded her to let them try it and see how they liked it
7597-101858-0002	train-other-500	and to this compromise Margaret finally gave a somewhat reluctant consent missus Kendall herself was distinctly uneasy over the whole affair and on one pretext and another
none	none	 had put off sending for the proposed guests until Margaret s importunities 
7597-101858-0003	train-other-500	left her no choice in the matter Not but that she was grateful to the two families that had been so good to Margaret in her hour of need but she would have preferred to show that gratitude in some way not quite so intimate as taking them into her house and home
7597-101858-0004	train-other-500	for an indefinite period Margaret however was still intent on divvying up and missus Kendall could not look into her daughter s clear blue eyes and explain why Patty Arabella Clarabella and the Whalens might not be the most
7597-101858-0005	train-other-500	desirable guests in the world It had been Margaret s intention to invite all of the Whalen family She had hesitated a little it is true over Mike Whalen the father
none	none	 You see he drinks and when he ain t asleep 
7597-101858-0006	train-other-500	he s cross mostly she explained to her mother but we can t leave just him behind
none	none	 so we ll have to ask him course 
7597-101858-0007	train-other-500	Besides if he s goin to live here why he might as well come right now at the first No certainly we couldn t leave mister Whalen behind alone missus Kendall had returned with dry lips
7597-101858-0008	train-other-500	So suppose we don t take any of the Whalens this time just devote ourselves to Patty and the twins To this however Margaret refused to give her consent What not take any of the Whalens
7597-101858-0009	train-other-500	the Whalens who had been so good as to give them one whole corner of their kitchen rent free Certainly not She agreed however after considerable discussion to take only Tom Mary
7597-101858-0010	train-other-500	and Peter of the Whalen family leaving the rest of the children and missus Whalen to keep old Mike Whalen company
none	none	 For after all as she said to her mother 
7597-101858-0011	train-other-500	if Tom and Mary and Peter like it here the rest will They always like what Tom does he makes em
none	none	 missus Kendall never thought of that speech afterward without a shudder 
7597-101858-0012	train-other-500	She even dreamed once of this all powerful Tom he stood over her with clinched fists and flashing eyes
none	none	 demanding that she divvy up to the last cent 
7597-101858-0013	train-other-500	Clearly as she understood that this was only a dream yet the vision haunted her and it was not without some apprehension that she went with Margaret to the station to meet her guests on the day appointed
7597-101858-0014	train-other-500	A letter from Margaret had gone to Patty and one from missus Kendall to Miss Murdock the city missionary who had been so good to Margaret Houghtonsville was on a main line to New York and but a few hours ride from the city
7597-101858-0015	train-other-500	missus Kendall had given full instructions as to trains and had sent the money for the six tickets She had also asked Miss Murdock to place the children in care of the conductor
7597-101858-0016	train-other-500	saying that she would meet them herself at the Houghtonsville station Promptly in return had come Miss Murdock s letter telling of the children s delighted acceptance of the invitation
7597-101858-0017	train-other-500	and almost immediately had followed Patty s elaborately flourished scrawl Much obliged for de invite an wes Acomin Tanks Clarabella Arabella an Patty at yer service
none	none	 missus Kendall thought of this letter and of Tom as she stood waiting for the long train from New York 
7597-101858-0018	train-other-500	to come to a standstill then she looked down at the sweet faced daintily gowned little maid at her side and shuddered it is one thing to carry beef tea and wheel chairs to our unfortunate fellow men
7597-101858-0019	train-other-500	and quite another to invite those same fellow men to a seat at our own table or by our own fireside Margaret and her mother had not long to wait Tom Whalen in spite of the conductor s restraining hand
7597-101858-0020	train-other-500	was on the platform before the wheels had ceased to turn Behind him tumbled Peter Mary and Clarabella while Patty carefully guiding Arabella s twisted feet brought up the rear There was an instant s pause
7597-101858-0021	train-other-500	then Tom spied Margaret and with a triumphant Come on here she is to those behind he dashed down the platform My but ain t you slick he cried admiringly stopping short before Margaret
none	none	 who had unconsciously shrunk close to her mother s side 
7597-101858-0022	train-other-500	Hi thar Patty he called hailing the gleeful children behind him
none	none	 what would the Alley say if they could see her now 
7597-101858-0023	train-other-500	There was a moment s pause Eagerly as the children had followed Tom s lead they stood abashed now before the tall beautiful woman and the pretty little girl they had once known as Mag of the Alley Almost instantly
7597-101858-0024	train-other-500	Margaret saw and understood and with all the strength of her hospitable little soul she strove to put her guests at their ease With a glad little cry she gave one after another a bear like hug then
7597-101858-0025	train-other-500	she stood back with a flourish and prepared for the introductions Unconsciously her words and manner aped those of her mother in sundry other introductions that had figured in her own experience during the last four weeks
7597-101858-0026	train-other-500	and before missus Kendall knew what was happening she found herself being ceremoniously presented to Tom Whalen late of the Alley New York Tom this is my dear mother that I lost long ago said Margaret
7597-101858-0027	train-other-500	Mother dear can t you shake hands with Tom Tom advanced His face was a fiery red and the freckles shone luridly through the glow Proud ter know ye ma am he stammered
7597-101858-0028	train-other-500	clutching frantically at the daintily gloved outstretched hand Margaret sighed with relief Tom did know how to behave after all
none	none	 She had feared he would not 
7597-101858-0029	train-other-500	And this is Mary Whalen and Peter she went on as missus Kendall clasped in turn two limp hands belonging to a white faced girl and a frightened boy And here s Patty and the twins Clarabella and Arabella
7597-101858-0030	train-other-500	and now you know em all finished Margaret beaming joyously upon her mother who was leaning with tender eyes over the little lame Arabella My dear
none	none	 how thin your poor little cheeks are missus Kendall was saying 
7597-101858-0031	train-other-500	Yes she is kind o peaked volunteered Patty Miss Murdock says as how her food don t similate
none	none	 Ye see she ain t over strong anyhow on account o dem 
7597-101858-0032	train-other-500	pointing to the little twisted feet and legs
none	none	 Mebbe Maggie told ye ma am how Arabella wa n t finished up right 
7597-101858-0033	train-other-500	an how her legs didn t go straight like ours added Patty giving her usual explanation of her sister s misfortune Yes choked missus Kendall hurriedly She told me that the little girl was lame Now my dears
7597-101858-0034	train-other-500	we we ll go home missus Kendall hesitated and looked about her You you haven t any bags or or anything she asked them Gee cried Tom turning sharply toward the track where had stood a moment before the train that brought them
7597-101858-0035	train-other-500	An if tain t gone so soon Gone the bag chorused five shrill voices Sure nodded Tom Then with a resigned air he thrust both hands into his trousers pockets
7597-101858-0036	train-other-500	Gone she is bag and baggage Oh I m so sorry murmured missus Kendall Pooh tain t a mite o matter assured Patty quickly Ye see dar wa n t nothin in it anyhow only a extry ribb n fur Arabella s hair
none	none	 Then at missus Kendall s blank look of amazement she explained 
7597-101858-0037	train-other-500	We only took it cause Katy Sovrensky said folks allers took em when they went trav lin So we fished dis out o de ash barrel an fixed it up wid strings an tacks We didn t have nothin ter put in it course
7597-101858-0038	train-other-500	All our clo s is on us We didn t need nothin else anyhow piped up Arabella for all our things is span clean We went ter bed most all day yisterday so s Patty could wash em
7597-101858-0039	train-other-500	Yes yes of course certainly agreed missus Kendall faintly as she turned and led the way to the big four seated carryall waiting for them Then we ll go home right away
7597-101858-0040	train-other-500	To Tom Peter Mary Patty Arabella and Clarabella it was all so wonderful that they fairly pinched themselves to make sure they were awake The drive through the elm bordered streets with everywhere flowers
7597-101858-0041	train-other-500	vine covered houses and velvety lawns it was all quite unbelievable It s more like Mont Lawn than anythin I ever see murmured Arabella
none	none	 Seems most as though twas heaven 
7597-101858-0042	train-other-500	And missus Kendall who heard the words reproached herself because for four long weeks she had stood jealous guard over this heaven and refused to divvy up its enjoyment The next moment she shuddered
7597-101858-0043	train-other-500	and unconsciously drew Margaret close to her side Patty had said Gee whiz Mag ain t you lucky Wis t I was a lost an founded The house with its great stone lions was hailed with an awed
none	none	 oh h of delight 
7597-101858-0044	train-other-500	as were the wide lawns and brilliant flower beds Inside the house the children blinked in amazement at the lace hung windows and gold framed pictures and Clarabella balancing herself on her toes
7597-101858-0045	train-other-500	looked fearfully at the woven pinks and roses at her feet and demanded Don t walkin on em hurt em Seems so twould she added her eyes distrustfully bent on Margaret who had laughed and by way of proving
7597-101858-0046	train-other-500	the carpet s durability was dancing up and down upon it The matter of choosing beds in the wide airy chambers was a momentous one In the boys room to be sure it was a simple matter for there were only two beds
7597-101858-0047	train-other-500	and Tom settled the question at once by unceremoniously throwing Peter on to one of them
none	none	 and pommeling him with the pillow 
7597-101858-0048	train-other-500	until he howled for mercy The girls had two rooms opening out of each other and in each room were two dainty white beds Here the matter of choosing was only settled amicably at last
7597-101858-0049	train-other-500	by a rigid system of counting out by Eeny meany miny mo and even this was not accomplished without much shouting and laughter and not a few angry words Margaret was distressed For a time she was silent
7597-101858-0050	train-other-500	then she threw herself into the discussion
none	none	 with all the ardor of one who would bring peace at any cost and it was by her suggestion that 
7597-101858-0051	train-other-500	the Eeny meany miny mo finally won the day
none	none	 In her own room that night as she went to bed she apologized to her mother I m sorry they was so rude mother I had forgot they was quite so noisy she confessed anxiously But I ll tell em to morrow to be more quiet Maybe they didn t know that little ladies and little gentlemen don t act like that CHAPTER VII 
7597-101859-0000	train-other-500	Five oaks awoke to a new existence on the first morning after the arrival of its guests from New York an existence of wild shouts gleeful laughter scampering feet and confusion
7597-101859-0001	train-other-500	In the kitchen and the garden old mister and missus Barrett no longer held full sway For some time there had been a cook a waitress a laundress and an experienced gardener as well
7597-101859-0002	train-other-500	In the barn too there was now a stalwart fellow who was coachman and chauffeur by turns according to whether the old family carriage or the new four cylinder touring car was wanted
7597-101859-0003	train-other-500	Tom Peter Mary Patty and the twins had not been at Five Oaks twenty four hours before they were fitted to new clothing throughout missus Kendall had not slept until she had interviewed the town clothier
7597-101859-0004	train-other-500	as to ways and means of immediately providing two boys and four girls with shoes stockings hats coats trousers dresses and undergarments Course tain t zactly necessary Patty had said
none	none	 upon being presented with her share of the new garments 
7597-101859-0005	train-other-500	but it s awful nice cause now we don t have ter go ter bed when ours is washed an they be awful nice Just bang up No wonder Five Oaks awoke to a new existence The wide spreading lawns knew now
7597-101859-0006	train-other-500	what it was to be pressed by a dozen little scampering feet at once and the great stone lions knew
none	none	 what it was to have two yelling boys mount their carven backs 
7597-101859-0007	train-other-500	and try to dig sharp little heels into their stone sides Within the house the attic sacred for years to cobwebs and musty memories knew what it was to yield its treasured bonnets shawls and quilted skirts
none	none	 to a swarm of noisy children who demanded them for charades Tom Peter Mary Patty Arabella and Clarabella had been at Five Oaks two weeks when one day Bobby McGinnis found Margaret 
7597-101859-0009	train-other-500	crying all alone in the old summerhouse down in the garden Gorry what s up he questioned adding cheerily Soldiers daughters don t cry it was a quotation from Margaret s own childhood s creed
7597-101859-0010	train-other-500	and one which in the old days
none	none	 seldom failed to dry her tears 
7597-101859-0011	train-other-500	Even now it was not without its effect for her head came up with a jerk I I know it she sobbed and I ain t I mean I are not going to There you see she broke off miserably
7597-101859-0012	train-other-500	falling back into her old despondent attitude Ain t should be are not always and I never can remember Pooh Is that all laughed Bobby Twould take more n a are not ter make me cry
7597-101859-0013	train-other-500	But that ain t all wailed Margaret and she did not notice that at one of her words Bobby chuckled and parted his lips only to close them again with a snap

7597-101859-0022	train-other-500	what of it retorted Bobby
none	none	 with airy unconcern 
7597-101859-0023	train-other-500	What of it wept Margaret Why Bobby don t you see I was goin to divvy up and I ought to divvy up too I ve got trees and grass and flowers and beds with sheets on em and enough to eat

7597-101859-0025	train-other-500	Bobby was silent His hands were in his pocket and his eyes were on an ant struggling with a burden almost as large as itself Don t you see Bobby it s wicked that I am awful wicked
none	none	 resumed Margaret 
7597-101859-0026	train-other-500	after a minute I want to be nice and gentle like mother wants me to be I don t want to be Mag of the Alley I I hate Mag of the Alley But if Tom and Patty and the rest stays

7597-101859-0028	train-other-500	he questioned No Mother spressly stip lated that I shouldn t say anything about their stayin always till their visit was over

7597-101859-0029	train-other-500	Then what ye cryin bout You ain t bound by no contract You don t have ter divvy up But I ought to divvy up
none	none	 Pooh Course ye hadn t

7597-101859-0031	train-other-500	why shouldn t she have some of mine Tain t fair somehow Somebody ain t playin straight I
none	none	 I m goin to ask mother And she turned slowly away and began to walk toward the house 
7597-101859-0032	train-other-500	Not once but many times during the next few days did Margaret talk with her mother on this subject that so troubled her The result of these conferences Bobby learned not five days later
7597-101859-0033	train-other-500	when Margaret ran down to meet him at the great driveway gate Back on the veranda Patty and the others were playing housekeeping and Margaret spoke low
none	none	 so that they might not hear 
7597-101859-0034	train-other-500	I am goin to divvy up she announced in triumph but not here Huh frowned Bobby
none	none	 I am goin to divvy up give em some of my things you know 
7597-101859-0035	train-other-500	explained Margaret then when they go back mother s goin with em and find a better place for em to live in
none	none	 Oh then they are goin back eh 
7597-101859-0036	train-other-500	Margaret flushed a little and threw a questioning look into Bobby s face There seemed to be a laugh in Bobby s voice though there was none on his lips Yes she nodded hurriedly You see
7597-101859-0037	train-other-500	mother thinks it s best She says that they hadn t ought to be here now with me that it s my form tive period and that everything about me ought to be just right so as to form me right See
7597-101859-0038	train-other-500	Yes I see said Bobby so crossly that Margaret opened her eyes in wonder Why Bobby you don t care cause they re goin away do you Don t I he growled Humph
7597-101859-0039	train-other-500	I s pose twill be me next that ll be sent flyin You Why you live here Well I say ain t an bully don t I he retorted aggressively
7597-101859-0040	train-other-500	Margaret stepped back Her face changed Why so you do she breathed And I never once thought of it Bobby said nothing He was standing on one foot
7597-101859-0041	train-other-500	digging the toe of the other into the graveled driveway For a time Margaret regarded him with troubled eyes then she sighed Well anyhow you don t live here all the time right in the house
none	none	 same s Patty and the rest would if they stayed I I don t want to give you up Bobby Bobby flushed red under the tan His eyes sparkled with pleasure but his chin went up and his hands executed the careless flourish that a boy of fourteen is apt to use when he wishes to hide the fact that his heart is touched Illustration FOR A TIME MARGARET REGARDED HIM WITH TROUBLED EYES Don t trouble yerself he shrugged airily It don t make a mite o diff rence ter me ye know There s plenty I can be with And he turned and hurried up the road with long strides sending back over his shoulder 
7597-101859-0042	train-other-500	a particularly joyous whistle a whistle that broke and wheezed into silence however
none	none	 the minute that the woods at the turn of the road were reached 
7597-101859-0043	train-other-500	I don t care he blustered glaring at the chipmunk that eyed him from the top rail of the fence Bully gee ain t hain t bang up There Then
none	none	 having demonstrated his right to whatever vocabulary he chose to employ 
7597-101859-0044	train-other-500	he went home to the little red farmhouse on the hill and spent an hour hunting for a certain book of his mother s in the attic When he had found it he spent another hour poring over its contents
none	none	 The book was old and yellow and dog eared and bore on the faded pasteboard cover the words A work on English Grammar and Composition CHAPTER VIII Tom Peter Mary Patty and the twins stayed at Five Oaks until the first of September then plump brown and happy they returned to New York With them went several articles of use and beauty which had hitherto belonged to Five Oaks missus Kendall greatly relieved at Margaret s somewhat surprising willingness to let the visitors go had finally consented to Margaret s proposition that the children be allowed to select something they specially liked to take back with them In giving this consent missus Kendall had made only such reservation as would insure that certain valuable and not easily duplicated treasures of her own should remain undisturbed She smiled afterward at her fears Tom selected an old bugle from the attic and Peter a scabbard that had lost its sword Mary chose a string of blue beads that Margaret sometimes wore and Clarabella a pink sash that she found in a trunk Patty before telling her choice asked timidly what would happen if it was too big ter be tooked in yer hands Upon being assured that it would be sent if it could not be carried she unhesitatingly chose the biggest easy chair the house afforded with the announcement that it was a Christmas present fur Mis Whalen For a moment missus Kendall had felt tempted to remonstrate and to ask Patty if she realized just how a green satin damask Turkish chair would look in missus Whalen s basement kitchen but after one glance at Patty s radiant face she had changed her mind and had merely said Very well dear It shall be sent the day you go Arabella only of all the six delayed her choice until the final minute Even on that last morning she was hesitating between a marble statuette and a harmonica In the end she took neither for she had spied a huge chocolate frosted cake that the cook had just made and it was that cake which finally went to the station carefully packed in a pasteboard box and triumphantly borne in Arabella s arms missus Kendall herself went to New York with the children taking Margaret with her In the Grand Central Station she shuddered a little as she passed a certain seat Involuntarily she reached for her daughter s hand And was it here that I stayed and stayed that day long ago when you got hurt and didn t come asked Margaret Yes dear right here Seems most as if I remembered murmured the little girl her eyes fixed on one of the great doors across the room I stayed and stayed and you never came at all And by and by I went out there to look for you and I walked and walked and walked And I was so tired and hungry Yes yes dear I know faltered missus Kendall tightening her clasp on the small fingers But we won t think of all that now dear It is past and gone Come we re going to take Patty and the others home you know then to morrow we are going to see if we can t find a new home for them Divvy up cried Margaret brightening We re goin to divvy up Yes dear Oh breathed Margaret ecstatically I like to divvy up And the mother smiled content for the last trace of gloomy brooding had fled from her daughter s face and left it glowing with the joy of a care free child Not two hours later a certain alley in the great city was thrown into wild confusion Out of every window leaned disheveled heads and in every doorway stood a peering questioning throng Down by the Whalens basement door the crowd was almost impassable and every inch of space in the windows opposite was filled with gesticulating men women and children Mag of the Alley had come back And as if that were not excitement enough for once with her had come Tom Mary Peter Patty and the twins to say nothing of the beautiful lady with the golden hair and the white wings on her hat An she s all dressed up fit ter kill Maggie is Katy Goldburg was calling excitedly over her shoulder Katy and Tony Valerio had the advantage over the others for they were down on their knees before the Whalens window on a level with the sidewalk The room inside was almost in darkness to be sure for the crowd outside had obscured what little daylight there was left and there was only the sputtering kerosene lamp on the table for illumination Even this however sufficed to show Katy and Tony wonders that unloosed their tongues and set them to giving copious reports She s got a white dress on an a hat with posies an shoes an stockings enumerated Katy An de lady s got di monds on her I seen em sparkle shouted Tony An de Whalen kids is all fixed up too he added An say dey ve bringed home stuff an is showin em Gee look at that sw word An thar s cake gurgled Katy Tony they re eatin choc late cake Say I am a goin in There was a sudden commotion about the Whalens door An undersized little body was worming its way through the crowd and thrusting sharp little elbows to the right and to the left The next minute Margaret Kendall standing near the Whalens table felt an imperative tug at her sleeve Hullo Say Mag give us a bite will ye Katy Why it s Katy Goldburg cried Margaret in joyous recognition Mother here s Katy The first touch of Margaret s hand on Katy s shoulder swept like an electric shock through the waiting throng around the door It was the signal for a general onslaught In a moment the Whalen kitchen swarmed with boys girls and women all shouting all talking at once and all struggling to reach the beautiful blue eyed golden haired little girl they had known as Mag of the Alley Step by step Margaret fell back until she was quite against the wall Her eyes grew wide and terror filled yet she made a brave attempt to smile and to respond politely to the noisy greetings Across the room missus Kendall struggled to reach her daughter s side but the onrushing tide of humanity flung her back and left her helpless and alone It was then that missus Whalen s powerful fist and strident voice came to the rescue In three minutes the room was cleared and Margaret was sobbing in her mother s arms You see mother you see how tis she cried hysterically as soon as she could speak There s such lots and lots of them and they re all so poor Did you see how ragged and bad their clothes were and how they grabbed for the cake We ve got to divvy up mother we ve got to divvy up Yes dear I know and we will soothed missus Kendall hurriedly We ll begin right away to morrow darling But now we ll go back to the hotel and go to bed My little girl is tired and needs rest CHAPTER IX doctor Spencer met missus Kendall and her daughter at the Houghtonsville station on the night they returned from New York His lips were smiling and his eyes were joyous as befitted a lover who is to behold for the first time in nine long days his dear one s face The eager words of welcome died on his lips however at sight of the weariness and misery in the two dear faces before him Why Amy dearest he began anxiously but her upraised hand silenced him To night not now she murmured with a quick glance at Margaret Then aloud to her daughter she said See dear here s doctor Spencer and he s brought the ponies to carry us home What a delightful drive we will have Oh has he For an instant Margaret s face glowed with animation then the light died out as suddenly as it had come But mother I I think I d rather walk she said You know Patty and the rest can t ride The doctor frowned and gave a sudden exclamation under his breath missus Kendall paled a little and turned to her daughter Yes I know she said gently But you are very tired and mother thinks it best you should ride After all dearie you know it won t make Patty and the rest ride even if you do walk Don t you see Yes I I suppose so admitted Margaret but she sighed as she climbed into the carriage and all the way home her eyes were troubled Not until after Margaret had gone to bed that night did missus Kendall answer the questions that had trembled all the evening on the doctor s lips then she told him the story of those nine days in New York beginning with Margaret s visit to the Alley and her overwhelming reception in the Whalens basement home I m afraid the whole thing has been a mistake she said despondently when she had finished Instead of making Margaret happy it has made her miserable But I don t see protested the doctor As near as I can make out you did just what she wanted you er divvied up missus Kendall sighed Why of course to a certain extent but even Margaret child though she is saw the hopelessness of the task when once we set about it There were so many so pitifully many Her few weeks of luxurious living here at home have opened her eyes to the difference between her life and theirs and I thought the child would cry herself sick over it all But you helped them some of them Again missus Kendall sighed Yes oh yes we helped them I think if Margaret could have had her way we should have marched through the streets to the tune of See the conquering hero comes distributing new dresses and frosted cakes with unstinted hands but I finally convinced her that such assistance was perhaps not the wisest way of going about what we wanted to do At last I had to keep her away from the Alley altogether it affected her so I got her interested in looking up a new home for the Whalens and so filled her mind with that Oh then the Whalens have a new home Well I m sure Margaret must have liked that missus Kendall smiled wearily Margaret did she said and at the emphasis the doctor raised his eyebrows But surely the Whalens Did not supplied missus Kendall Did not cried the doctor Well twas this way laughed missus Kendall It was my idea to find a nice little place outside the city where perhaps mister Whalen could raise vegetables and missus Whalen do some sort of work that paid better than flower making Perhaps Margaret s insistence upon grass and trees influenced me At any rate I found the place and in high feather told the Whalens of the good fortune in store for them What was my surprise to be met with blank silence save only one wild whoop of glee from the children An sure then an it s in the country is it missus Whalen asked finally Yes I said With a yard some flower beds and a big garden for vegetables I was just warming to my subject once more when mister Whalen demanded Is it fur from the Alley Well to make a long story short they at last kindly consented to view the place but after one glance they would have none of it But why queried the doctor Various reasons Twas lonesome too far from the Alley they didn t care to raise vegetables any way and mister Whalen considered it quite too much work to kape up a place like that According to my private opinion however the man had an eye out for a saloon and he didn t see it consequently the result Well we came back to town and the basement kitchen Margaret was inconsolable when she heard the decision The Whalen children too were disappointed but mister Whalen and his wife were deaf to their entreaties In the end I persuaded them to move to rooms that at least had the sun and air though they were still in the Alley and there I left them with a well stocked larder and wardrobe and with the rent paid six months in advance I shall keep my eye on them of course for Margaret s sake and I hope to do something really worth while for the children Patty and the twins are still with them at present But wasn t Margaret satisfied with that asked the doctor Yes so far as it went but there were still the others Harry that child has the whole Alley on her heart I m at my wits end to know what to do You heard her this afternoon she didn t want to ride home because Patty must walk in New York She looks askance at the frosting on her cake and questions her right to wear anything but rags Harry what can I do The man was silent I don t know dear he said slowly at last We must think and think hard Hers is not a common case There is no precedent to determine our course Small girls of five that have been reared in luxury are not often thrust into the streets and sweat shops of a great city and there forced to spend four years of their life thank God That those four years should have had a tremendous influence is certain She can t be the same girl she would have been had she spent those years at her mother s knee One thing is sure however seems to me In her present nervous condition if there is such a thing as getting her mind off those four years of her life and everything connected with it it should be done The doctor paused and at that instant a step sounded on the graveled driveway A moment later a boy s face flashed into the light that streamed through the open door Why Bobby is that you cried missus Kendall Yes ma am it s me please Did Mag I mean Margaret come home please Yes she came to night Bobby hesitated He stood first on one foot then on the other At last very slowly he dragged his right hand from behind his back I been makin it for her he said presenting a small but very elaborate basket composed of peach stones Mebbe if she ain t er are not awake you ll give it to her in the mornin Er thank ye Much obliged Good evenin ma am And he turned and fled down the walk For a time there was silence on the veranda missus Kendall was turning the basket over and over in her hands Suddenly she raised her head You are right Harry she sighed Her mind must be taken off those four years of her life and off everything connected with it everything and everybody Yes echoed the doctor everything and everybody Er let me see his basket please Four days later missus Kendall and her daughter Margaret left Houghtonsville for a month s stay in the White Mountains From the rear window of a certain law office in town a boy of fourteen disconsolately watched the long train that was rapidly bearing them out of sight An I hain t seen her but once since I give her the basket he was muttering an then I couldn t speak to her her mother whisked her off so quick Plague take that basket wish t I d never see it An I worked so hard over it cause she said she liked em made out o peach stones She said she did CHAPTER X It was the day before Christmas For eight weeks Margaret had been at Elmhurst Miss Dole s school in the Berkshires School Miss Dole s school had been something of a surprise to Margaret and Margaret had been decidedly a surprise to the school Margaret was not used to young misses who fared sumptuously every day and who yet complained because a favorite ice cream or a pet kind of cake was not always forthcoming and Miss Dole s pupils were not used to a little girl who questioned their right to be well fed and well clothed and who supplemented this questioning with distressing stories of other little girls who had little to wear and less to eat day after day and week after week Margaret had not gone to Elmhurst without a struggle on the part of her mother To missus Kendall it seemed cruel to be separated so soon from the little daughter who had but just been restored to her hungry arms after four long years of almost hopeless waiting On the other hand there were Margaret s own interests to be thought of School certainly was a necessity unless there should be a governess at home and of this last missus Kendall did not approve She particularly wished Margaret to have the companionship of happy well bred girls of her own age The Houghtonsville public school was hardly the place in missus Kendall s opinion for a little maid with Margaret s somewhat peculiar ideas as to matters and things There was Bobby too Bobby the constant reminder in word and deed of the city streets and misery that missus Kendall particularly wished forgotten Yes there certainly was Bobby to be thought of and to be avoided It was because of all this therefore that Margaret had been sent to Elmhurst She had gone there straight from the great hotel in the mountains where she and her mother had been spending a few weeks so she had not seen Houghtonsville since September It was the Christmas vacation now and she was going back back to the house with the stone lions and the big play room where had lain for so long the little woolly dog of her babyhood It was not of the stone lions nor the play room that Margaret was thinking however it was of something much more important and more delightful the girls said At all events it was wonderfully exciting and promised all sorts of charming possibilities in the way of music pretty clothes and good things to eat again according to the girls It was a wedding Margaret s idea of marriage had undergone a decided change in the last few weeks The envious delight of the girls over the fact that she was to be so intimately connected with a wedding together with their absorbing interest in every detail had been far more convincing than all of missus Kendall s anxious teachings marriage might not be such a calamity after all It had come as somewhat of a shock to Margaret this envious delight of her companions She had looked upon her mother s marriage as something to be deplored something to be tolerated to be sure since for some unaccountable reason her mother wanted it but still nevertheless an evil There was the contract to be sure and the doctor had signed it without a murmur but Margaret doubted the efficacy of even that at times it would take something more than a contract certainly if the doctor should prove to be anything like Mike Whalen for a husband The doctor would not be like Mike Whalen however so the girls said They had never seen any husbands that were like him for that matter They knew nothing whatever about husbands that shook and beat their wives and banged them around All this they declared unhesitatingly and with no little indignation in response to Margaret s somewhat doubting questions There were the story books too The girls all had them and each book was full of fair ladies and brave knights and of beautiful princesses who married the king and who wanted to marry him too and who would have felt very badly if they could not have married him In the face of so overwhelming an array of evidence Margaret almost lost her fears marriage might be very desirable after all And so it was a very happy little girl that left Elmhurst on the day before Christmas and in care of one of the teachers journeyed toward Houghtonsville where were waiting the play room the great stone lions and the wonderful wedding to say nothing of the dear loving mother herself It was not quite the same Margaret that had left Houghtonsville a few months before Even those short weeks had not been without their influence Margaret in accordance with missus Kendall s urgent request had been the special charge of every teacher at Elmhurst and every teacher knew the story of the little girl s life as well as just what they all had now to battle against Everything that was good and beautiful was kept constantly before her eyes and so far as was possible everything that was the reverse of all this was kept from her sight and from being discussed in her presence She learned of wonderful countries across the sea and of the people who lived in them She studied about high mountains and great rivers and she was shown pictures of kings and queens and palaces Systematically and persistently she was led along a way that did not know the Alley and that did not recognize that there was in the world any human creature who was poor or sick or hungry It is little wonder then that she came to question less and less the luxury all about her that she wore the pretty dresses and dainty shoes and ate the food provided with a resignation that was strangely like content and that she talked less and less of Patty the twins and the Alley CHAPTER XI Christmas was a wonderful day at Five Oaks certainly to Margaret First there was the joy of skipping bare toed across the room to where the long black stockings hung from the mantel In the gray dawn of the early morning its bulging knobbiness looked delightfully mysterious and never were presents half so entrancing as those drawn from its black depths by Margaret s small eager fingers Later in the morning came the sleigh ride behind the doctor s span of bays and then there was the delicious dinner followed by the games and the frolics and the quiet hour with mother Still later the house began to fill with guests and then came the wedding with missus Kendall all in soft gray and looking radiantly happy on the doctor s arm It was a simple ceremony and soon over and then came the long line of beaming friends and neighbors to wish the bride and groom joy and God speed Margaret standing a little apart by the dining room door felt a sudden pull at her sleeve She turned quickly and looked straight into Bobby McGinnis s eyes Bobby why Bobby she welcomed joyously but Bobby put his finger to his lips Sh h he cautioned then peremptorily Come And he led the way through the deserted dining room to a little room off the sidehall where the gloom made his presence almost indiscernible There he sighed in relief I fetched ye didn t I Margaret frowned But Bobby she remonstrated why what are you doing out here all in the dark Seein you Seeing me But I was in there where twas all light and pretty and you could see me lots better there Yes but I wa n t there retorted Bobby grimly then he added Twa n t my party ye see an I wa n t invited But I wanted ter see ye an I did too Margaret was silent Mebbe ye want ter go back now yerself observed Bobby gloomily after a time Tain t so pretty here I ll own Margaret did want to go back and she almost said so but something in the boy s voice silenced the words on her lips Oh I ll stay course she murmured shifting about uneasily on her little white slippered feet Bobby roused himself Here take a chair he proposed pushing toward her a low stool an I ll set here on the winder sill Nice night ain t it Yes tis Margaret sat down carefully spreading her skirts There was a long silence Through the half open door came a shaft of light and the sound of distant voices Bobby was biting his finger nails and Margaret was wondering just how she could get back to the drawing room without hurting the feelings of her unbidden guest At last the boy spoke Mebbe when we re grown up we ll get married too he blurted out saying the one thing he had intended not to say He bit his tongue angrily but the next minute he almost fell off the window sill in his amazement the little girl had sprung to her feet and clapped her hands Bobby could we she cried Sure rejoined Bobby with easy nonchalance Why not And there d be flowers and music and lots of people to see us Heaps promised Bobby Oh h sighed Margaret ecstatically And then we ll go traveling way over to London and Paris and Egypt and see the Alps Huh The voice of the prospective young bridegroom sounded a little uncertain We ll go traveling to see things you know reiterated Margaret There s such a lot of things I want to see Oh yes we ll go travelin assured Bobby promptly wondering all the while if he could remember just where his mother s geography was He should have need of it after he got home that night London Paris Egypt and the Alps it might be well to look up the way to get there at all events I think maybe now I ll go back said Margaret with sudden stiffness They might be looking for me Good bye Oh I say Maggie called Bobby eagerly when folks is engaged they But only the swish of white skirts answered him and there was nothing for him to do but disconsolately to let himself out the side door before any one came and found him And I m going to get married too said Margaret to her mother half an hour later You re going to get married Yes to Bobby you know The newly made bride sat down suddenly and threw a quick look at her husband To Bobby she exclaimed Why when where Bobby wasn t here No smiled Margaret He said he wasn t invited but he came We fixed it all up a little while ago We re going to London and Paris and Egypt and see the Alps

7247_101864_000007_000000	train-clean-360	The great dining room at Hilcrest the old Spencer homestead was perhaps the pleasantest room in the house 
7247_101864_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The house itself crowned the highest hill that overlooked the town and its dining room windows and the veranda without commanded a view of the river for miles just where the valley was the greenest and the most beautiful 
7247_101864_000007_000002	train-clean-360	On the other side of the veranda which ran around three sides of the house one might see the town with its myriad roofs and tall chimneys but although these same tall chimneys represented the wealth that made possible the great Spencer estate yet it was the side of the veranda overlooking the green valley that was the most popular with the family 
7247_101864_000007_000003	train-clean-360	It was said to be sure that old Jacob Spencer who built the house and who laid the foundations for the Spencer millions had preferred the side that overlooked the town and that he spent long hours gloating over the visible results of his thrift and enterprise 
none	none	But old Jacob was dead now and his son s sons reigned instead and his son s sons no matter how much they might value the whiz and whir and smoke of the town preferred when at rest to gaze upon green hills and far reaching meadows 
7247_101864_000007_000005	train-clean-360	This was indeed typical of the Spencer code the farther away they could get from the oil that made the machinery of life run easily and noiselessly the better pleased they were 
7247_101864_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The dining room looked particularly pleasant this July evening 
7247_101864_000008_000001	train-clean-360	A gentle breeze stirred the curtains at the open windows and the setting sun peeped through the vines outside and glistened on the old family plate Three generations of Spencers looked down from the walls on the two men and the woman sitting at the great mahogany table 
7247_101864_000008_000002	train-clean-360	The two men and the woman however were not looking at the sunlight the vines or the swaying curtains they were looking at each other and their eyes were troubled and questioning 
7247_101864_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 You say she is coming next week asked the younger man glancing at the letter in the other s hand 
none	none	Yes 
7247_101864_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Tuesday afternoon 
7247_101864_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 But Frank this is so sudden remonstrated the young fellow laughing a little as he uttered the trite phrase 
none	none	How does it happen that I ve heard so little of this young lady who is to be so unceremoniously dropped into our midst next Tuesday 
7247_101864_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Frank Spencer made an impatient gesture that showed how great was his perturbation 
7247_101864_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Come come Ned don t be foolish he protested 
7247_101864_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 You know very well that your brother s stepdaughter has been my ward for a dozen years 
7247_101864_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but that is all I know rejoined the young man quietly 
none	none	I have never seen her and scarcely ever heard of her and yet you expect me to take as a matter of course this strange young woman who is none of our kith nor kin and yet who is to be one of us from henceforth forevermore
7247_101864_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 The boy is right interposed the low voice of the woman across the table 
7247_101864_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 Ned doesn t know anything about her 
7247_101864_000015_000002	train-clean-360	He was a mere child himself when it all happened and he s been away from home most of the time since 
7247_101864_000015_000003	train-clean-360	For that matter we don t know much about her ourselves 
7247_101864_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 We certainly don t sighed Frank Spencer then he raised his head and squared his shoulders 
7247_101864_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 See here good people this will never do in the world he asserted with sudden authority 
7247_101864_000016_000002	train-clean-360	 I have offered the hospitality of this house to a homeless orphan girl and she has accepted it 
7247_101864_000016_000003	train-clean-360	There is nothing for us to do now but to try to make her happy 
7247_101864_000016_000004	train-clean-360	After all we needn t worry it may turn out that she will make us happy 
none	none	But what is she 
7247_101864_000017_000001	train-clean-360	How does she look catechized Ned 
7247_101864_000018_000000	train-clean-360	His brother shook his head 
7247_101864_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know he replied simply 
none	none	You don t know 
7247_101864_000020_000001	train-clean-360	But surely you have seen her 
none	none	Yes oh yes I have seen her once or twice but Margaret Kendall is not a girl whom to see is to know besides the circumstances were such that well I might as well tell the story from the beginning particularly as you know so little of it yourself 
7247_101864_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Frank paused and looked at the letter in his hand 
7247_101864_000022_000001	train-clean-360	After a minute he laid it gently down 
7247_101864_000022_000002	train-clean-360	When he spoke his voice was not quite steady 
none	none	Our brother Harry was a physician as you know Ned 
7247_101864_000023_000001	train-clean-360	You were twelve years old when he married a widow by the name of Kendall who lived in Houghtonsville where he had been practising 
7247_101864_000023_000002	train-clean-360	As it chanced none of us went to the wedding 
7247_101864_000023_000003	train-clean-360	You were taken suddenly ill and neither Della nor myself would leave you and father was in Bermuda that winter for his health 
7247_101864_000023_000004	train-clean-360	missus Kendall had a daughter Margaret about ten years old who was at school somewhere in the Berkshires 
7247_101864_000023_000005	train-clean-360	It was to that school that I went when the terrible news came that Harry and his new wife had lost their lives in that awful railroad accident 
7247_101864_000023_000006	train-clean-360	That was the first time that I saw Margaret 
7247_101864_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 The poor child was of course heartbroken and inconsolable but her grief took a peculiar turn 
7247_101864_000024_000001	train-clean-360	The mere sight of me drove her almost into hysterics 
7247_101864_000024_000002	train-clean-360	She would have nothing whatever to do with me or with any of her stepfather s people 
7247_101864_000024_000003	train-clean-360	She reasoned that if her mother had not married there would have been no wedding journey and if there had been no wedding journey there would have been no accident and that her mother would then have been alive and well 
7247_101864_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Arguments pleadings and entreaties were in vain 
7247_101864_000025_000001	train-clean-360	She would not listen to me or even see me 
7247_101864_000025_000002	train-clean-360	She held her hands before her face and screamed if I so much as came into the room 
7247_101864_000025_000003	train-clean-360	She was nothing but a child of course and not even a normal one at that for she had had a very strange life 
7247_101864_000025_000004	train-clean-360	At five she was lost in New York City and for four years she lived on the streets and in the sweat shops enduring almost unbelievable poverty and hardships 
7247_101864_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 By Jove exclaimed Ned under his breath 
7247_101864_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 It was only seven or eight months before the wedding that she was found went on Frank and of course the influence of the wild life she had led was still with her more or less and made her not easily subject to control 
7247_101864_000027_000001	train-clean-360	There was nothing for me to do but to leave the poor little thing where she was particularly as there seemed to be no other place for her 
7247_101864_000027_000002	train-clean-360	She would not come with me and she had no people of her own to whom she could turn for love and sympathy 
7247_101864_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 As you know poor Harry was conscious for some hours after the accident long enough to make his will and dictate the letter to me leaving Margaret to my care boy though I was 
7247_101864_000028_000001	train-clean-360	I was only twenty you see but really there was no one else to whom he could leave her 
7247_101864_000028_000002	train-clean-360	That was something over thirteen years ago 
7247_101864_000028_000003	train-clean-360	Margaret must be about twenty three now 
7247_101864_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 And you ve not seen her since There was keen reproach in Ned s voice 
7247_101864_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Frank smiled 
7247_101864_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I ve seen her twice he replied 
7247_101864_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 And of course I ve written to her many times and have always kept in touch with those she was with She stayed at the Berkshire school five years then with some fear and trembling I own I went to see her 
7247_101864_000031_000002	train-clean-360	I found a grave eyed little miss who answered my questions with studied politeness and who agreed without comment to the proposition that I place her in a school where she might remain until she was ready for college should she elect to go to college 
7247_101864_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 But her vacations did she never come then questioned Ned 
none	none	No 
7247_101864_000033_000001	train-clean-360	At first I did not ask her of course 
7247_101864_000033_000002	train-clean-360	It was out of the question as she was feeling 
7247_101864_000033_000003	train-clean-360	Some one of her teachers always looked out for her They all pitied her and naturally did everything they could for her as did her mates at school 
none	none	Later when I did dare to ask her to come here she always refused 
7247_101864_000033_000005	train-clean-360	She wrote me stiff little notes in which she informed me that she was to spend the holidays with some Blanche or Dorothy or Mabel of her acquaintance 
7247_101864_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 She was nineteen when I saw her again 
7247_101864_000034_000001	train-clean-360	I found now a charming graceful girl with peculiarly haunting blue eyes and heavy coils of bronze gold hair that kinked and curled about her little pink ears in a most distracting fashion 
7247_101864_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Even now though she would not come to my home She was going abroad with friends 
7247_101864_000034_000003	train-clean-360	The party included an irreproachable chaperon so of course I had nothing to say while as for money she had all of her mother s not inconsiderable fortune besides everything that had been her stepfather s so of course there was no question on that score 
none	none	In the fall she entered college and there she has been ever since spending her vacations as usual with friends generally traveling 
7247_101864_000035_000001	train-clean-360	When she came of age she specially requested me to make no change in her affairs but to regard herself as my ward for the present just as she had been 
7247_101864_000035_000002	train-clean-360	So I still call myself her guardian 
7247_101864_000035_000003	train-clean-360	This June was her graduation 
7247_101864_000035_000004	train-clean-360	I had forgotten the fact until I received the little engraved invitation a week or two ago 
7247_101864_000035_000005	train-clean-360	I thought of running down for it but I couldn t get away very well and well I didn t go that s all But I did write and ask her to make this house her home and here is her reply 
7247_101864_000035_000006	train-clean-360	She thanks me and will come next Tuesday 
7247_101864_000035_000007	train-clean-360	There now you have it 
7247_101864_000035_000008	train-clean-360	You know all that I do And Frank Spencer leaned back in his chair with a long sigh 
none	none	But I don t know yet what she s like objected Ned
7247_101864_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Neither do I 
7247_101864_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh but you ve seen her 
7247_101864_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and how 
7247_101864_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Do you suppose that those two or three meetings were very illuminating 
none	none	No 
7247_101864_000039_000003	train-clean-360	I ve been told this however he added 
none	none	It seems that immediately after her return to her mother s home she had the most absurd quixotic notions about sharing all she had with every ragamuffin in New York 
7247_101864_000039_000005	train-clean-360	She even carried her distress over their condition to such an extent that her mother really feared for her reason 
7247_101864_000039_000006	train-clean-360	All her teachers therefore were instructed to keep from her all further knowledge of poverty and trouble and particularly to instil into her mind the fact that there was really in the world a great deal of pleasure and happiness 
7247_101864_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Over across the table missus Merideth shivered a little 
7247_101864_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Dear me she sighed 
7247_101864_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 I do hope the child is well over those notions I shouldn t want her to mix up here with the mill people 
7247_101864_000041_000002	train-clean-360	I never did quite like those settlement women anyway and only think what might happen with one in one s own family 
7247_101864_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think I should worry sister sweet laughed Frank 
7247_101864_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 I haven t seen much of the young lady but I think I have seen enough for that 
none	none	I fancy the teachers succeeded in their mission 
7247_101864_000042_000003	train-clean-360	As near as I can judge Miss Margaret Kendall does not resemble your dreaded settlement worker in the least 
none	none	However we ll wait and see CHAPTER XIII There was something of the precision of clockwork in matters and things at Hilcrest A large corps of well trained servants in charge of an excellent housekeeper left missus Merideth free to go and come and entertain as she liked For fifteen years now she had been mistress of Hilcrest ever since her mother had died in fact Widowed herself at twenty two after a year of married life and the only daughter in a family of four children she had been like a second mother to her two younger brothers Harry the eldest brother had early left the home roof to study medicine Frank barely twenty when his brother Harry lost his life had even then pleased his father by electing the mills as his life work And now five years after that father s death Ned was sharing his brother Frank s care and responsibility in keeping the great wheels turning and the great chimneys smoking in the town below Della Merideth was essentially a woman who liked and who usually obtained the strawberries and cream of life Always accustomed to luxury she demanded as a matter of course rich clothing and dainty food That there were people in the world whose clothing was coarse and whose food was scanty she well knew and knowing this she was careful that her donations to the Home Missionary Society and the Woman s Guild were prompt and liberal Beyond this her duty did not extend she was sure As for any personal interest in the recipients of her alms she had none whatever and would indeed have deemed it both unnecessary and unladylike that she should have had such interest Her eyes were always on the hills and meadows on the west side of the house and even her way to and from Hilcrest was carefully planned so that she might avoid so far as was possible the narrow ill smelling streets of the town on the other side of the hill Frank Spencer was a hard headed far seeing man of business inside the office of Spencer Spencer outside he was a delightful gentleman a little grave perhaps for his thirty three years but none the less a favorite particularly with anxious mothers having marriageable but rather light headed daughters on their hands His eyes were brown his nose was straight and long and his mouth firm and clean cut His whole appearance was that of a man sure of himself and of others To Frank Spencer the vast interests of Spencer Spencer as represented by the huge mills that lined the river bank were merely one big machine and the hundreds of men women and children that dragged their weary way in and out the great doors were but so many cogs in the wheels That the cogs had hearts that ached and heads that throbbed did not occur to him He was interested only in the smooth and silent running of the wheels themselves Ned was the baby of the house In spite of his length of limb and breadth of shoulder he was still looked upon by his brother and sister as little more than a boy School college and a year of travel had trained his brain toughened his muscles and browned his skin and left him full of enthusiasm for his chosen work which just now meant helping to push Spencer Spencer to the top notch of power and prosperity For five years the two brothers and the widowed sister in the great house that crowned Prospect Hill had been by themselves save for the servants and the occasional guests and the Spencers were a clannish family so people said However that might have been there certainly was not one of the three that was not conscious of a vague fear and a well defined regret whenever there came the thought of this strange young woman who was so soon to enter their lives To be a Spencer was to be hospitable however and the preparations for the expected guest were prompt and generous By Tuesday the entire house even to its inmates was ready with a cordial welcome for the orphan girl In his big touring car Frank Spencer went to the station to meet his ward With him was missus Merideth and her eyes fully as anxiously as his swept the crowd of passengers alighting from the long train Almost simultaneously they saw the tall young woman in gray and missus Merideth sighed with relief as Frank gave a quick exclamation and hurried forward At least she looks like a lady missus Merideth murmured as she followed her brother You are Margaret Kendall I am sure Frank was saying and missus Merideth saw the light leap to the girl s eyes as she gave him her hand And you are mister Spencer my guardian Uncle Frank Am I still to call you Uncle Frank missus Merideth heard a clear voice say The next moment she found herself looking into what she instantly thought were the most wonderful eyes she had ever seen And I am missus Merideth my dear Aunt Della I hope she said gently before her brother could speak Thank you and it will be Aunt Della I m sure smiled the girl and again missus Merideth marveled at the curious charm of the eyes that met her own CHAPTER XIV The big touring car skirted the edge of the town avoiding as usual the narrower streets and turning as soon as possible into a wide elm bordered avenue We have to climb to reach Hilcrest called Frank over his shoulder as the car began a steep ascent Then you must have a view as a reward rejoined Margaret We do declared missus Merideth but not here she laughed as the car plunged into the depths of a miniature forest It was a silent drive in the main The man in front had the car to guide The two women in the tonneau dropped an occasional word but for the most part their eyes were fixed on bird or flower or on the shifting gleams of sunlight through the trees The very fact that there was no constraint in this silence argued well for the place the orphan girl had already found in the hearts of her two companions Not until the top of the hill was reached and the car swung around the broad curve of the driveway did the full beauty of the panorama before her burst on Margaret s eyes She gave a low cry of delight Oh how beautiful how wonderfully wonderfully beautiful she exclaimed Her eyes were on the silver sheen of the river trailing along the green velvet of the valley far below she had turned her back on the red roofed town with its smoking chimneys The sun was just setting when a little later she walked across the lawn to where a rustic seat marked the abrupt descent of the hill Far below the river turned sharply On the left it flowed through a canyon of many windowed walls and under a pall of smoke On the right it washed the shores of flowering meadows and mirrored the sunset sky in its depths So absorbed was Margaret in the beauty of the scene that she did not notice the figure of a man coming up the winding path at her left Even Ned Spencer himself did not see the girl until he was almost upon her Then he stopped short his lips breaking into a noiseless Well by Jove A twig snapped under his foot at his next step and the girl turned Oh it s you she said absorbedly I couldn t wait I came right out to see it she finished her eyes once more on the valley below The brothers at first glance looked wonderfully alike and Margaret had unhesitatingly taken Ned to be Frank Ned did not speak He too like his sister an hour before had fallen under the spell of a pair of wondrous blue eyes It seems to me said the girl slowly that nothing in the world would ever trouble me if I had that to look at It seems so to me too agreed Ned but he was not looking at the view The girl turned sharply She gave a little cry of dismay The embarrassed red flew to her cheeks Oh you you are not Uncle Frank at all she stammered A sudden light of comprehension broke over Ned s face And so this was Margaret How stupid of him not to have known at once He laughed lightly and made a low bow I have not that honor he confessed But you you must be Miss Kendall And you I Ned smiled quizzically I Oh I am your Uncle Ned he announced and his voice and his emphasis told her that he fully appreciated his privilege in being twenty five and uncle to a niece of twenty three CHAPTER XV By the end of the month the family at Hilcrest wondered how they had ever lived before they saw the world and everything in it through the blue eyes of Margaret Kendall the world and everything in it seemed so much more beautiful now Never were the long mornings in the garden or on the veranda so delightful to missus Merideth as now with a bright sympathetic girl to laugh chat or keep silent as the whim of the moment dictated and never were the summer evenings so charming to Frank as now when one might lie back in one s chair or hammock and listen to a dreamy nocturne or a rippling waltz song and realize that the musician was no bird of passage but that she was one s own beloved ward and was even now at home As for Ned never were the golf links in so fine a shape nor the tennis court and croquet ground so alluring and never had he known before how many really delightful trips there were within a day s run for his motor car And yet Della do you think Margaret is happy asked Frank one day as he and his sister and Ned were watching the sunset from the west veranda Margaret had gone into the house pleading a headache as an excuse for leaving them Della was silent It was Ned who answered indignantly Why Frank of course she s happy I m not so sure hesitated Frank Then missus Merideth spoke She s happy yes but she s restless Frank leaned forward That s it exactly he declared with conviction She s restless and what s the matter That s what I want to know Nonsense it s just high spirits cut in Ned with an impatient gesture Margaret s perfectly happy Doesn t she laugh and sing and motor and play tennis all day Yes retorted his brother she does but behind it all there s a curious something that I can t get at It is as if she were were trying to get away from something something within herself missus Merideth nodded her head I know she said I ve seen it too Ah you have Frank turned to his sister with a troubled frown Well what is it I don t know missus Merideth paused her eyes on the distant sky line I have thought once or twice she resumed slowly that Margaret might be in love In love cried two voices in shocked amazement Had missus Merideth been observant she might have seen the sudden paling of a smooth shaven face and the quick clinching of a strong white hand that rested on the arm of a chair near her but she was not observant in this case at least and she went on quietly Yes but on the whole I m inclined to doubt that now Oh you are laughed Ned a little nervously His brother did not speak Yes repeated missus Merideth but I haven t decided yet what it is Well I for one don t believe it s anything declared Ned stubbornly To me she seems happy and I believe she is Frank shook his head No he said By her own confession she has been flitting from one place to another all over the world and though perhaps she does not realize it herself I believe her coming here was merely another effort on her part to get away from this something this something that while within herself perhaps is none the less pursuing her and making her restless and unhappy But what can it be argued Ned She s not so different from other girls only nicer She likes good times and pretty clothes and is always ready for any fun that s going I m sure it isn t anything about those socialistic notions that Della used to worry about he added laughingly She s got well over those if she ever had them indeed I don t believe she s looked toward the mills since she s been here much less wanted to know anything about the people that work in them No it isn t that agreed Frank Perhaps it isn t anything broke in Della with sudden cheeriness Maybe it is a little dull here for her after all her gay friends and interesting travels Perhaps she is a little homesick but is trying to make us think everything is all right and she overdoes it Anyway we ll ask some nice people up for a week or two I fancy we all need livening up We re getting morbid Come whom shall we have CHAPTER XVI It had been a particularly delightful day with the Hilcrest house party They had gone early in the morning to Silver Lake for a picnic A sail on the lake a delicious luncheon and a climb up Hilltop had filled every hour with enjoyment until five o clock when they had started for home Two of the guests had brought their own motor cars to Hilcrest and it was in one of these that Miss Kendall was making the homeward trip And you call this a runabout mister Brandon she laughed gaily as the huge car darted forward I should as soon think of having an elephant for an errand boy Brandon laughed But just wait until you see the elephant get over the ground he retorted And after all the car isn t so big when you compare it with Harlow s or Frank s It only seats two you know but its engine is quite as powerful as either of theirs I want you to see what it can do he finished as he began gradually to increase their speed For some time neither spoke The road ran straight ahead in a narrowing band of white that lost itself in a thicket of green far in the distance Yet almost immediately it seemed to Margaret the green was at their right and their left and the road had unwound another white length of ribbon that flung itself across the valley and up the opposite hill to the sky line Houses trees barns and bushes rushed by like specters and the soft August air swept by her cheeks like a November gale Not until the opposite hill was reached however did Brandon slacken speed You see he exulted we can just annihilate space with this You certainly can laughed Margaret a little hysterically And you may count yourself lucky if you don t annihilate anything else Brandon brought the car almost to a stop I was a brute I frightened you he cried with quick contrition The girl shook her head A strange light came to her eyes No I liked it she answered I liked it too well Do you know I never dare to run a car by myself very much I learned how and had a little runabout of my own at college and I run one now sometimes But it came over me one day the power there was under my fingers Almost involuntarily I began to let it out I went faster and faster and yet I did not go half fast enough Something seemed to be pushing me on urging me to even greater and greater speed I wanted to get away away Then I came to myself I was miles from where I should have been and in a locality I knew nothing about I had no little difficulty in getting back to where I belonged besides having a fine or two to pay I believe I was frightened and ashamed for everywhere I heard of stories of terrified men women children and animals and of how I had narrowly escaped having death itself to answer for as a result of my mad race through the country And yet even now to day I felt that wild exhilaration of motion I did not want to stop I wanted to go on and on She paused suddenly and fell back in her seat You see she laughed with a complete change of manner I am not to be trusted as a chauffeur I see nodded Brandon a little soberly then with a whimsical smile Perhaps I should want the brakes shifted to my side of the car if I rode with you But after all when you come right down to the solid comfort of motoring you can take it best by jogging along like this at a good sensible rate of speed that will let you see something of the country you are passing through Look at those clouds We shall have a gorgeous sunset to night It was almost an hour later that Brandon stopped his car where two roads crossed and looked behind him By George where are those people he queried But we started first and we came rapidly for a time reminded the girl I know but we ve been simply creeping for the last mile or two returned the man I slowed up purposely to fall in behind the rest I m not so sure I know the way from here but perhaps you do And he turned his eyes questioningly to hers Not I she laughed But I thought you did So did I he grumbled I ve been over this road enough in times past Oh I can get back to Hilcrest all right he added reassuringly It s only that I don t remember which is the best way One road takes us through the town and is not so pleasant I wanted to avoid that if possible Never mind let s go on proposed the girl It s getting late and we might miss them even if we waited They may have taken another road farther back If they thought you knew the way they wouldn t feel in duty bound to keep track of us and they may have already reached home I don t mind a bit which road we take All right acquiesced Brandon Just as you say I think this is the one Anyhow we ll try it And he turned his car to the left The sun had dipped behind the hills and the quick chill of an August evening was in the air Margaret shivered and reached for her coat The road wound in and out through a scrubby growth of trees then turned sharply and skirted the base of a steep hill Beyond the next turn it dropped in a gentle descent and ran between wide open fields A house appeared then another and another A man and a woman walked along the edge of the road and stopped while the automobile passed The houses grew more frequent and children and small dogs scurried across the road to a point of safety By George I believe we ve got the wrong road now muttered Brandon with a frown Shall we go back No no demurred the girl What does it matter It s only another way around and perhaps no longer than the other The road turned and dropped again The hill was steeper now The air grew heavy and fanned Margaret s cheek with a warm breath as if from an oven Unconsciously she loosened the coat at her throat Why how warm it is she exclaimed Yes I fancy there s no doubt now where we are frowned Brandon I thought as much he finished as the car swung around a curve Straight ahead the road ran between lines of squat brown houses with men women and children swarming on the door steps or hanging on the fences Beyond rose tier upon tier of red and brown roofs flanked on the left by the towering chimneys of the mills Still farther beyond and a little to the right just where the sky was reddest rose the terraced slopes of Prospect Hill crowned by the towers and turrets of Hilcrest We can at least see where we want to be laughed Brandon Fine old place shows up great against that sky doesn t it The girl at his side did not answer Her eyes had widened a little and her cheeks had lost their bright color She was not looking at the pile of brick and stone on top of Prospect Hill but at the ragged little urchins and pallid women that fell back from the roadway before the car The boys yelled derisively and a baby cried Margaret shrank back in her seat and Brandon turning quickly saw the look on her face His own jaw set into determined lines We ll be out of this soon Miss Kendall he assured her You mustn t mind them As if it wasn t bad enough to come here anyway but that I must needs come now just when the day shift is getting home The day shift Yes the hands who work days you know But don t they all work days Brandon laughed Hardly You mean they work nights Yes He threw a quizzical smile into her startled eyes By the way he observed you d better not ask Frank in that tone of voice if they work nights That night shift is a special pet of his He says it s one great secret of the mills prosperity having two shifts Not that his are the only mills that run nights of course there are plenty more Margaret s lips parted but before she could speak there came a hoarse shout and a quick cry of terror The next instant the car under Brandon s skilful hands swerved sharply and just avoided a collision with a boy on a bicycle Narrow shave that muttered Brandon He wasn t even looking where he was going Margaret shuddered She turned her gaze to the right and to the left Everywhere were wan faces and sunken eyes With a little cry she clutched Brandon s arm Can t we go faster faster she moaned I want to get away away For answer came the sharp honk honk of the horn and the car bounded forward With a shout the crowd fell back and with another honk honk Brandon took the first turn to the right I think we re out of the worst of it he cried in Margaret s ear If we keep to the right we ll go through only the edge of the town Even as he spoke the way cleared more and more before them and the houses grew farther apart The town was almost behind them and their speed had considerably lessened when Margaret gave a scream of horror Almost instantly Brandon brought the car to a stop and leaped to the ground Close by one of the big rimmed wheels lay a huddled little heap of soiled and ragged pink calico but before Brandon could reach it the heap stirred and lifted itself From beneath a tangled thatch of brown curls looked out two big brown eyes I reckon mebbe I felled down said a cheery voice that yet sounded a little dazed I reckon I did Good heavens baby I reckon you did breathed the man in glad relief And you may thank your lucky stars twas no worse T ank lucky stars What are lucky stars demanded the small girl interestedly Eh Oh lucky stars why they re what are lucky stars Miss Kendall Margaret did not answer She did not seem to hear With eyes that carried a fascinated terror in their blue depths she was looking at the dirty little feet and the ragged dress of the child before her T ank lucky stars murmured the little girl again putting out a cautious finger and just touching the fat rubber tire of the wheel that had almost crushed out her life Brandon shuddered involuntarily and drew the child away What s your name little girl he asked gently Maggie How old are you I m most five goin on six an I ll be twelve ter morrer Brandon smiled And where do you live he continued A thin little claw of a finger pointed to an unpainted shabby looking cottage across the street At that moment a shrill voice called Maggie Maggie what ye doin Come here child And a tall gaunt woman appeared in the doorway Maggie turned slowly but scarcely had the little bare feet taken one step when the girl in the automobile stirred as if waking from sleep Here quick little girl take this she cried tearing open the little jeweled purse at her belt and thrusting all its contents into the small grimy hands Maggie stared in wonder Then her whole face lighted up Lucky stars she cried gleefully her eyes on the shining coins T ank lucky stars And she turned and ran with all her small might toward the house Quick come let us go begged Margaret before the mother sees the money And Brandon smiling indulgently at the generosity that was so fearful of receiving thanks lost no time in putting a long stretch of roadway between themselves and the tall gaunt woman behind them CHAPTER XVII Stars t ank lucky stars Maggie was still shouting gleefully when she reached her mother s side missus Durgin bent keen eyes on her young daughter s face Maggie what was they sayin to ye she began pulling the little girl into the house Suddenly her jaw dropped She stooped and clutched the child s hands Why Maggie it s money stacks of it she exclaimed prying open the small fingers Stars lucky stars cooed Maggie Maggie liked new words and phrases and she always said them over and over until they were new no longer missus Durgin shook her daughter gently yet determinedly Her small black eyes looked almost large so wide were they with amazement Maggie Maggie tell me what did they say to ye she demanded again Why did they give ye all this money Maggie was silent Her brow was drawn into a thoughtful frown But Maggie think there must a been somethin What did ye do There wa n t insisted the child I jest felled down an got up an they said it Said what T ank lucky stars A sudden thought sent a quick flash of fear to missus Durgin s eyes Maggie they didn t hurt ye she cried dropping on her knees and running swift anxious fingers over the thin little arms and legs and body They didn t hurt ye Maggie shook her head At that moment a shadow darkened the doorway and the kneeling woman glanced up hastily Oh it s you Mis Magoon she said to the small tired looking woman in the doorway Yes it s me sighed the woman dragging herself across the room to a chair What time did Nellie leave here Why I dunno mebbe four o clock Why The woman s face contracted with a sharp spasm of pain She wa n t within half a mile of the mill when I met her yet she was pantin an all out o breath then She ll be late course an you know what that means Yes I know sighed missus Durgin sympathetically She she hadn t orter gone Across the room missus Magoon s head came up with a jerk Don t ye s pose I know that The child s sick an I know it But what diff rence does that make She works don t she For a moment missus Durgin did not speak Gradually her eyes drifted back to Maggie and the little pile of coins on the table Mis Magoon see she cried eagerly what the lady give Maggie They was in one o them nauty mobiles as Maggie calls em an Maggie felled down in the road She wa n t hurt a mite not even scratched but they give her all this money The woman on the other side of the room sniffed disdainfully Well what of it They d oughter give it to her she asserted But they wa n t ter blame an they didn t hurt her none not a mite argued the other No thanks ter them I ll warrant snapped missus Magoon For my part I wouldn t tech their old money Then crossly but with undeniable interest she asked How much was it missus Durgin laughed Never you mind she retorted as she gathered up the coins from the table but thar s enough so s I m goin ter get them cough drops fur Nellie anyhow So And she turned her back and pretended not to hear the faint remonstrances from the woman over by the window Later when she had bought the medicine and had placed it in missus Magoon s hands the remonstrances were repeated in a higher key and were accompanied again with an angry snarl against the world in general and automobiles in particular But why do ye hate em so demanded missus Durgin them autymobiles They hain t one of em teched ye as I knows of

em I tell ye an it makes me realize how I ain t comfortable like they be nor Nellie ain t neither But they ain t all bad rich folks argued the thin black eyed woman earnestly Some of em is good The other shook her head I hain t had the pleasure o meetin that kind she rejoined grimly Well I have retorted Maggie s mother with some spirit Look at that lady ter night what give Maggie all that money There was no answer and after a moment missus Durgin went on Her voice was lower now and not quite clear Thar was another one too an she was jest like a angel out o heaven It was years ago much as twelve or fourteen when I lived in New York She was the mother of the nicest an prettiest little girl I ever see the one I named my Maggie for An she asked us ter her home an we stayed weeks an rode in her carriages an ate ter her table an lived right with her jest as she did An when we come back ter New York she come with us an took us out of the cellar an found a beautiful place fur us all sun

missus Durgin sharply She wa n t the kind what gives up She s sick or dead or somethin I know she is But thar s others what has lasted That Mont Lawn I was tellin ye of whar I learned them songs we

autymobiles missus Magoon stared then she shrugged her shoulders Mebbe she admitted grudgingly Say er Mis Durgin how much was that money Maggie got eh CHAPTER XVIII Margaret Kendall did not sleep well the night after the picnic at Silver Lake She was restless and she tossed from side to side finding nowhere a position that brought ease of mind and body She closed her eyes and tried to sleep but her active brain painted the dark with a panorama of the day s happenings and whether her eyes were open or closed she was forced to see it There were the lake the mountain and the dainty luncheon spread on the grass and there were the faces of the merry friends who had accompanied her There were the shifting scenes of the homeward ride too with the towers of Hilcrest showing dark and clear cut against a blood red sky But everywhere from the lake the mountain and even from Hilcrest itself looked out strange wan faces with hollow cheeks and mournful eyes and everywhere fluttered the ragged skirts of a child s pink calico dress It was two o clock when Margaret arose thrust her feet into a pair of bed slippers and her arms into the sleeves of a long loose dressing gown There was no moon but a starlit sky could be seen through the open windows and Margaret easily found her way across the room to the door that led to the balcony Margaret s room like the dining room below looked toward the west and the far reaching meadows but from the turn of the balcony where it curved to the left one might see the town and it was toward this curve that Margaret walked now Once there she stopped and stood motionless her slender hands on the balcony rail The night was wonderfully clear The wide dome of the sky twinkled with a myriad of stars and seemed to laugh at the town below with its puny little lights blinking up out of the dark where the streets crossed and recrossed Over by the river where the mills pointed big black fingers at the sky however the lights did not blink They blazed in tier upon tier and line upon line of windows and they glowed with a never ending glare that sent a shudder to the watching girl on the balcony And they re working now now she almost sobbed then she turned with a little cry and ran down the balcony toward her room where was waiting the cool soft bed with the lavender scented sheets In spite of the restless night she had spent Margaret arose early the next morning The house was very quiet when she came down stairs and only the subdued rustle of the parlor maid s skirts broke the silence of the great hall which was also the living room at Hilcrest Good morning Betty Good morning Miss courtesied the girl Miss Kendall had almost reached the outer hall door when she turned abruptly Betty you you don t know a little child named er Maggie do you she asked Ma am Betty almost dropped the vase she was dusting Maggie a little girl named Maggie She s one of the the mill people s children I think Betty drew herself erect No Miss I don t she said crisply No of course not murmured Miss Kendall unconsciously acknowledging the reproach in Betty s voice Then she turned and went out the wide hall door Twice she walked from end to end of the long veranda but not once did she look toward the mills and when she sat down a little later her chair was so placed that it did not command a view of the red and brown roofs of the town Miss Kendall was restless that day She rode and drove and sang and played and won at golf and tennis but behind it all was a feverish gayety that came sometimes perilously near to recklessness Frank Spencer and his sister watched her with troubled eyes and even Ned gave an anxious frown once or twice Just before dinner Brandon came upon her alone in the music room where she was racing her fingers through the runs and trills of an impromptu at an almost impossible speed If you take me motoring with you to night Miss Kendall he said whimsically when the music had ceased with a crashing chord if you take me to night I shall make sure that the brakes are on my side of the car The girl laughed then grew suddenly grave You would need to she acceded but I shall not take you or any one else motoring to night In the early evening after dinner Margaret sought her guardian He was at his desk in his own special den out of the library and the door was open May I come in she asked Spencer sprang to his feet By all means he cried as he placed a chair You don t often honor me like this But this is where you do business when at home isn t it she inquired And I I have come to do business The man laughed So it s business just plain sordid business to which I am indebted for this he bemoaned playfully Well and what is it Income too small for expenses He chuckled a little and he could afford to Margaret had made no mistake in asking him still to have the handling of her property The results had been eminently satisfactory both to his pride and her pocketbook No no it s not that it s the mills The mills Yes Is it quite quite necessary to work nights For a moment the man stared wordlessly then he fell back in his chair Why Margaret what in the world he stopped from sheer inability to proceed He had suddenly remembered the stories he had heard of the early life of this girl before him and of her childhood s horror at the difference between the lot of the rich and the poor Last night we we came through the town explained Margaret a little feverishly and mister Brandon happened to mention that they worked nights The man at the desk roused himself Yes I see he said kindly You were surprised of course But don t worry my child or let it fret you a moment It s nothing new They are used to it They have done it for years But at night all night it doesn t seem right And it must be so hard Must they do it Why of course Other mills run nights why shouldn t ours They expect it Margaret Besides they are paid for it Come come dear girl just look at it sensibly Why it s the night work that helps to swell your dividends Margaret winced I I think I d prefer them smaller she faltered She hesitated then spoke again There s another thing too I wanted to ask you about There was a little girl Maggie She lives in one of those shabby unpainted houses at the foot of the hill I want to do something for her Will you see that this reaches her mother please And she held out a fat roll of closely folded bills Now don t please don t she cried as she saw the man s remonstrative gesture Please don t say you can t and that indiscriminate giving encourages pauperism I used to hear that so often at school whenever I wanted to give something and I I hated it If you could have seen that poor little girl yesterday you will see that she gets it won t you But Margaret began the man helplessly I don t know the child there are so many he stopped and Margaret picked up the dropped thread But you can find out she urged You must find out Her name s Maggie You can inquire some one will know But don t you see the man s face cleared suddenly I ll give it to Della he broke off in quick relief She runs the charity part and she ll know just what to do with it Meanwhile let me thank you No no interrupted Margaret rising to go It is you I have to thank for doing it for me she finished as she hurried from the room By George muttered the man as he looked at the denominations of the bills in his fingers I m not so sure but we may have our hands full after all certainly if she keeps on as she s begun CHAPTER XIX It was after eight o clock The morning for so early in September was raw and cold A tall young fellow with alert gray eyes and a square chin hurried around the corner of one of the great mills and almost knocked down a small girl who was coming toward him with head bent to the wind Heigh ho he cried then stopped short The child had fallen back and was leaning against the side of the building in a paroxysm of coughing She was thin and pale and looked as if she might be eleven years old Well well he exclaimed as soon as the child caught her breath I reckon there s room for both of us in the world after all Then kindly Where were you going Home sir He threw a keen look into her face Are you one of the mill girls Yes sir Night shift She nodded But it s late it s after eight o clock Why didn t you go home with the rest The child hesitated Her eyes swerved from his gaze She looked as if she wanted to run away Come come he urged kindly Answer me I won t hurt you I may help you Let us go around here where the wind doesn t blow so And he led the way to the sheltered side of the building Now tell us all about it Why didn t you go home with the rest I did start to sir but I was so tired an an I coughed so I stopped to rest It was nice an cool out here an I was so hot in there She jerked her thumb toward the mill Yes yes I know he said hastily and his lips set into stern lines as he thought of the hundreds of other little girls that found the raw morning nice and cool after the hot moist air of the mills But don t you see he protested earnestly that that s the very time you mustn t stop and rest You take cold and that s what makes you cough You shouldn t be he stopped abruptly What s your name he asked Nellie Magoon How old are you The thin little face before him grew suddenly drawn and old and the eyes met his with a look that was half shrewd half terrified and wholly defiant I m thirteen sir How old were you when you began to work here Twelve sir The answer was prompt and sure The child had evidently been well trained Where do you live Over on the Prospect Hill road But that s a long way from here Yes sir I does get tired And you ve walked it a good many times too haven t you said the man quietly Let s see how long is it that you ve worked at the mills Two years sir A single word came sharply from between the man s close shut teeth and Nellie wondered why the kind young man with the pleasant eyes should suddenly look so very cross and stern At that moment too she remembered something she had seen this man many times about the mills Why was he questioning her Perhaps he was not going to let her work any more and if he did not let her work what would her mother say and do Please sir I must go quick she cried suddenly starting forward I m all well now an I ain t tired a mite I ll be back ter night Jest remember I m thirteen an I likes ter work in the mills I likes ter sir she shouted back at him Humph muttered the man as he watched the frail little figure disappear down the street I thought as much Then he turned and strode into the mill Oh mister Spencer I d like to speak to you please sir he called hurrying forward as he caught sight of the younger member of the firm of Spencer Spencer Fifteen minutes later Ned Spencer entered his brother s office and dropped into the nearest chair Well he began wearily McGinnis is on the war path again Frank smiled So What s up now Oh same old thing children working under age By his own story the girl herself swears she s thirteen but he says she isn t Frank shrugged his shoulders Perhaps he knows better than the girl s parents he observed dryly He d better look her up on our registers or he might ask to see her certificate Ned laughed He made an impatient gesture Good heavens Frank he snapped as if twas our fault that they lie so about the kids ages They d put a babe in arms at the frames if they could But McGinnis by the way where did you get that fellow and how long have you had him I can t remember when he wasn t here He acts as if he owned the whole concern and had a personal interest in every bobbin in it That s exactly it laughed Frank He has a personal interest and that s why I keep him and put up with some of his meddling that s not quite so pleasant He s as honest as the daylight and as faithful as the sun Where did you get him He must have been here ages Ages Well for twelve maybe thirteen years to be exact He was a mere boy fourteen or fifteen when he came He said he was from Houghtonsville and that he had known doctor Harry Spencer He asked for work any kind and brought good references We used him about the office for awhile then gradually worked him into the mills He was bright and capable and untiring in his efforts to please so we pushed him ahead rapidly He went to night school at once and has taken one or two of those correspondence courses until he s acquired really a good education He s practically indispensable to me now anyhow I found out that he was when he was laid up for a month last winter He stands between me and the hands like a strong tower and takes any amount of responsibility off my shoulders You ll see for yourself when you ve been here longer The hands like him and will do anything for him That s why I put up with some of his notions They re getting pretty frequent of late however and he s becoming a little too meddlesome I may have to call him down a peg You d think so I fancy if you had heard him run on about this mill girl half an hour ago laughed Ned He said he should speak to you Very good Then I can speak to him retorted the other grimly CHAPTER XX Early in the second week of September the houseful of guests at Hilcrest went away leaving the family once more alone It seems good doesn t it just by ourselves said Margaret that first morning at breakfast As she spoke three pairs of eyes flashed a message of exultant thankfulness to each other and three heads nodded an I told you so when Margaret s gaze was turned away Later missus Merideth put the sentiment into words as she followed her brothers to the door You see I was right she declared Margaret only needed livening up She s all right now and will be contented here with us Sure agreed Ned as he stepped out on to the veranda Frank paused a moment Has she ever been to you again Della with money or or anything he asked in a low voice No never replied missus Merideth She asked once if I d found the child Maggie to give the money to and I evaded a direct reply I told her I had put the money into the hands of the Guild and that they were in constant touch with all cases of need I got her interested in talking of something else and she did not say anything more about it Good It s the best way You know her history and how morbid she got when she was a child It won t do to run any chances of that happening again and I fear twouldn t take much to bring it back She was not a little excited when she brought the money in to me that night We must watch out sharp he finished as he passed through the door and hurried down the steps after his brother Back in the dining room Margaret had wandered listlessly to the window It had been some weeks since she had seen a long day before her with no plans to check off the time into hours and half hours of expected happenings She told herself that it was a relief and that she liked it but her fingers tapped idly upon the window and her eyes gazed absent mindedly at a cloud sailing across a deep blue sky After a time she turned to the door near by and stepped out upon the veranda She could hear voices from around the corner and aimlessly she wandered toward them But before she had reached the turn the voices had ceased and a minute later she saw Frank and Ned step into the waiting automobile and whir rapidly down the driveway missus Merideth had disappeared into the house and Margaret found herself alone Slowly she walked toward the railing and looked at the town far below The roofs showed red and brown and gray in the sunlight and were packed close together save at the outer edges where they thinned into a straggling fringe of small cottages and dilapidated shanties Margaret shivered with repulsion How dreadful it must be to live like that no air no sun no view of the sky and of the cool green valley And there were so many of them those poor creatures down there with their wasted forms and sunken eyes She shuddered again as she thought of how they had thronged the road on the day of the picnic at Silver Lake and then she turned and walked with resolute steps to the farther side of the veranda where only the valley and the hills met her eyes It had been like this with Margaret every day since that memorable ride home with mister Brandon Always her steps her eyes and her thoughts had turned toward the town and always with uncompromising determination they had been turned about again by sheer force of will until they looked toward the valley with its impersonal green and silver Until now there had been gay companions and absorbing pastimes to make this turning easy and effectual now there was only the long unbroken day of idleness in prospect and the turning was neither so easy nor so effectual The huddled roofs and dilapidated shanties of the town looked up at her even from the green of the valley and the wasted forms and hollow eyes of the mill workers blurred the sheen of the river I ll go down there she cried aloud with sudden impulsiveness I ll go back through the way we came up then perhaps I ll be cured And she hurried away to order the runabout to be brought to the door for her use To Margaret it was all very clear She needed but a sane daylight ride through those streets down there to drive away forever the morbid fancies that had haunted her so long She told herself that it was the hour the atmosphere the half light that had painted the picture of horror for her Under the clear light of the sun those swarming multitudes would be merely men women and children not haunting ghosts of misery There was the child Maggie too Perhaps she might be found and it would be delightful indeed to see for herself the comforting results of the spending of that roll of money she had put into her guardian s hands some time before Of all this Margaret thought and it was therefore with not unpleasant anticipations that she stepped into the runabout a little later and waved a good bye to missus Merideth with a cheery I m off for a little spin Aunt Della I ll be back before luncheon Margaret was very sure that she knew the way and some distance below the house she made the turn that would lead to what was known as the town road The air was fresh and sweet and the sun flickered through the trees in dancing little flecks of light that set the girl s pulses to throbbing in sympathy and caused her to send the car bounding forward as if it too had red blood in its veins Far down the hill the woods thinned rapidly and a house or two appeared Margaret went more slowly now Somewhere was the home of little Maggie and she did not want to miss it Houses and more houses appeared and the trees were left behind There was now only the glaring sunlight showing up in all their barrenness the shabby little cottages with their dooryards strewn with tin cans and bits of paper and swarming with half clothed crying babies From somewhere came running a saucy faced barefooted urchin then another and another until the road seemed lined with them Hi thar look at de buz wagon wid de gal in it shrieked a gleeful voice and instantly the cry was taken up and echoed from across the street with shrill catcalls and derisive laughter Margaret was frightened She tooted her horn furiously and tried to forge ahead but the children reading aright the terror in her eyes swarmed about her until she was forced to bring the car almost to a stop lest she run over the small squirming bodies With shrieks of delight the children instantly saw their advantage and lost no time in making the most of it They leaped upon the low step and clung to the sides and front of the car like leeches Two larger boys climbed to the back and hung there with swinging feet their jeering lips close to Miss Kendall s shrinking ears A third boy still more venturesome had almost reached the vacant seat at Miss Kendall s side when above the din of hoots and laughter sounded an angry voice and a sharp command CHAPTER XXI It had been young McGinnis s intention to look up the home and the parents of the little mill girl Nellie Magoon at once and see if something could not be done to keep for a time at least that frail bit of humanity out of the mills Some days had elapsed however since he had talked with the child and not until now had he found the time to carry out his plan He was hurrying with frowning brow along the lower end of Prospect Hill road when suddenly his ears were assailed by the unmistakable evidence that somewhere a mob of small boys had found an object upon which to vent their wildest mischief The next moment a turn of the road revealed the almost motionless runabout with its living freight of shrieking urchins and its one white faced terrified girl With a low breathed Margaret McGinnis sprang forward Illustration A MOB OF SMALL BOYS HAD FOUND AN OBJECT UPON WHICH TO VENT THEIR WILDEST MISCHIEF It was all done so quickly that even the girl herself could not have told how it happened Almost unconsciously she slipped over into the vacant seat and gave her place to the fearless square jawed man who seemingly had risen from the ground An apparently impossible number of long arms shot out to the right and to the left and the squirming urchins dropped to the ground sprawling on all fours and howling with surprise and chagrin Then came a warning cry and a sharp honk honk honk from the horn The next moment the car bounded forward on a roadway that opened clear and straight before it Not until he had left the town quite behind him did McGinnis bring the car to a halt in the shade of a great tree by the roadside Then he turned an anxious face to the girl at his side You re not hurt I hope Miss Kendall he began I didn t like to stop before to ask I hope you didn t mind being thrust so unceremoniously out of your place and run away with he finished a faint twinkle coming into his gray eyes Margaret flushed Before she spoke she put both hands to her head and straightened her hat No I I m not hurt she said faintly but I was frightened You you were very good to run away with me she added the red deepening in her cheeks I m sure I don t know what I should have done if you hadn t The man s face darkened The little rascals he cried They deserve a sound thrashing every one of them But I d done nothing I d not spoken to them she protested I don t see why they should have molested me Pure mischief to begin with probably returned the man then they saw that you were frightened and that set them wild with delight All is I m glad I was there he concluded with grim finality Margaret turned quickly And so am I she said and yet I don t even know whom to thank though you evidently know me You seemed to come from the ground and you handled the car as if it were your own With a sudden exclamation the man stepped to the ground then he turned and faced her hat in hand And I m acting now as if it were my own too he said almost bitterly I beg your pardon Miss Kendall I have run it many times for mister Spencer that explains my familiarity with it And you are she paused expectantly The man hesitated It was almost on his tongue s end to say One of the mill hands then something in the bright face the pleasant smile the half outstretched hand sent a strange light to his eyes I am Miss Kendall I have half a mind to tell you who I am She threw a quick look into his face and drew back a little but she said graciously Of course you will tell me who you are There was a moment s silence then slowly he asked Do you remember Bobby McGinnis Bobby Bobby McGinnis The blue eyes half closed and seemed to be looking far into the past Suddenly they opened wide and flashed a glad recognition into his face And are you Bobby McGinnis Yes Why of course I remember Bobby McGinnis she cried with outstretched hand It was you that found me when I was a wee bit of a girl and lost in New York though that I don t remember But we used to play together there in Houghtonsville and it was you that got me the contract She stopped abruptly and turned her face away The man saw her lips and chin tremble I can t speak of it even now she said brokenly after a moment Then gently Tell me of yourself How came you here I came here at once from Houghtonsville McGinnis s voice too was not quite steady She nodded and he went on without explaining the at once he had thought she would understand I went to work in the mills and I have been here ever since That is all he said simply But how happened it that you came here A dull red flushed the man s cheeks His eyes swerved from her level gaze then came back suddenly with the old boyish twinkle in their depths I came he began slowly well to look after your affairs My affairs Yes I was fifteen I deemed somehow that I was the one remaining friend who had your best interests at heart I couldn t look after you naturally in a girls school so I did the next best thing I looked after your inheritance Dear old Bobby murmured the girl And the man who heard knew in spite of a conscious throb of joy that it was the fifteen year old lad that Margaret Kendall saw before her not the man grown standing at her side I suppose I thought he resumed after a moment that if I were not here some one might pick up the mills and run off with them And now She was back in the present and her eyes were merry And now Well now I come nearer realizing my limitations perhaps he laughed At any rate I learned long ago that your interests were in excellent hands and that my presence could do very little good even if they had not been in such fine shape But I am keeping you he broke off suddenly backing away from the car Are you can you you do not need me any longer to run the machine You ll not go back through the town of course No I shall not go back through the town shuddered the girl And I can drive very well by myself now I am sure she declared And he did not know that for a moment she had been tempted to give quite the opposite answer I shall go on to the next turn and then around home by the other way But I shall see you soon again you will come to see me she finished as she held out her hand McGinnis shook his head Miss Kendall in the kindness of her heart forgets he reminded her quietly Bobby McGinnis is not on Hilcrest s calling list But Bobby McGinnis is my friend retorted Miss Kendall with a bright smile and Hilcrest always welcomes my friends Still standing under the shadow of the great tree McGinnis watched the runabout until a turn of the road hid it from sight I thought twould be easier after I d met her once face to face and spoken to her he was murmuring softly but it s going to be harder I m afraid harder than when I just caught a glimpse of her once in a while and knew that she was here CHAPTER XXII Margaret s morning ride through the town did not have quite the effect she had hoped it would By daylight the place looked even worse than by the softening twilight But she was haunted now not so much by the wan faces of the workers as by the jeering countenances of a mob of mischievous boys To be sure the unexpected meeting with Bobby McGinnis had in a measure blurred the vision but it was still there and at night she awoke sometimes with those horrid shouts in her ears Of one thing it had cured her however she no longer wished to see for herself the shabby cottages and the people in them She gave money promptly and liberally so liberally in fact that missus Merideth quite caught her breath at the size of the bills that the young woman stuffed into her hands But my dear so much she had remonstrated No no take it do Margaret had pleaded Give it to that society to do as they like with it And when it s gone there ll be more missus Merideth had taken the money then without more ado The one thing she wished particularly to avoid in the matter was controversy for controversy meant interest There had been one other result of that morning s experience a result which to Frank Spencer was perhaps quite as startling as had been the roll of bills to his sister I met your mister Robert McGinnis when I was out this morning Margaret had said that night at dinner What sort of man is he Before Frank could reply Ned had answered for him He s a little tin god on wheels Margaret that can do no wrong That s what he is Ned remonstrated missus Merideth in a horror that was not all playful Then to Margaret He is a very faithful fellow and an efficient workman my dear who is a great help to Frank But how and where did you see him Margaret laughed I ll tell you she promised in response to missus Merideth s question but I haven t heard yet from the head of the house I can add little to what has been said declared Frank with a smile He is all that they pictured him He is the king pin the keystone anything you please But why Nothing only I know him He is an old friend You know him a friend The three voices were one in shocked amazement Yes long ago in Houghtonsville smiled Margaret He knew me still longer ago than that but that part I remember only as it has been told to me He was the little boy who found me crying in the streets of New York and took me home to his mother There was a stunned silence around the table It was the first time the Spencers had ever heard Margaret speak voluntarily of her childhood and it frightened them It seemed to bring into the perfumed air of the dining room the visible presence of poverty and misery They feared too for Margaret this was the one thing that must be guarded against the possible return to the morbid fancies of her youth And this man Why how strange murmured missus Merideth breaking the pause But then after all he ll not annoy you I fancy Of course not cut in Ned McGinnis is no fool and he knows his place Most assuredly declared Frank with a sudden tightening of his lips You ll not see him again I fancy If he annoys you let me know Oh but twon t be an annoyance smiled Margaret I asked him to come and see me You asked him to come To the Spencers it was as if she had taken one of the big black wheels from the mills and suggested its desirability for the drawing room You asked him to come Was there a slight lifting of the delicately moulded chin opposite the least possible dilation of the sensitive nostrils Perhaps Yet Margaret s voice when she answered was clear and sweet Yes I told him that Hilcrest would always welcome my friends I was sure And wasn t I right Of course certainly three almost inaudible voices had murmured And that had been the end of it except that the two brothers and the sister had talked it over in low distressed voices after Margaret had gone up stairs to bed Two weeks had passed now however since that memorable night and the veranda of Hilcrest had not yet echoed to the sound of young McGinnis s feet The Spencers breathed a little more freely in consequence It might be possible after all thought they that McGinnis had some sense and the emphasis was eloquent CHAPTER XXIII Miss Kendall was sitting alone before the great fireplace in the hall at Hilcrest when Betty the parlor maid found her Betty s nose always inclined to an upward tilt was even more disdainful than usual this morning In fact Betty s whole self from cap to dainty shoes radiated strong disapproval There s a young person a very impertinent young person at the side door Miss who insists upon seeing you she said severely Me Seeing me Who is it Betty I don t know Miss She looks like a mill girl Even Betty s voice seemed to shrink from the mill as if it feared contamination A mill girl Then it must be missus Merideth or mister Spencer that she wants to see She said you Miss She said she wanted to see Betty stopped looking a little frightened Yes go on Betty That that she wanted to see Miss Maggie Kendall blurted out the horrified Betty Mag of the Alley Miss Kendall sprang to her feet Bring the girl here Betty she directed quickly I will see her at once Just what and whom she expected to see Margaret could not have told For the first surprised instant it seemed that some dimly remembered Patty or Clarabella or Arabella from the past must be waiting out there at the door the next moment she knew that this was impossible for time even in the Alley could not have stood still and Patty and the twins must be women grown now Out at the side door the impertinent young person received Betty s order to come in with an airy toss of her head and a jeering There what d I tell ye but once in the subdued luxury of soft rugs and silken hangings and face to face with a beauteous vision in a trailing pale blue gown she became at once only a very much frightened little girl about eleven years old At a sign from Miss Kendall Betty withdrew and left the two alone What is your name little girl asked Miss Kendall gently The child swallowed and choked a little Nellie Magoon ma am if you please thank you she stammered Where do you live Down on the Prospect Hill road Who sent you to me Mis Durgin Miss Kendall frowned and paused a moment As yet there had not been a name that she recognized nor could she find in the child s face the slightest resemblance to any one she had ever seen before But I don t understand she protested Who is this missus Durgin What did she tell you to say to me She said Tell her Patty is in trouble an wants ter see Mag of the Alley murmured the child as if reciting a lesson Patty Patty Not Patty Murphy cried Miss Kendall starting forward and grasping the child s arm Nellie drew back half frightened Yes ma am No ma am I don t know ma am she stammered But how came she to send for me Who told her I was here The boss The boss Yes mister McGinnis ye know He said as how you was here Bobby cried Miss Kendall releasing the child s arm and falling back a step Why of course it s Patty it must be Patty I ll go to her at once Wait here while I dress And she hurried across the hall and up the broad stairway Back by the door Nellie watched the disappearing blue draperies with wistful eyes that bore also a trace of resentment Go and dress indeed As if there could be anything more altogether to be desired than that beautiful trailing blue gown She was even more dissatisfied ten minutes later when Miss Kendall came back in the trim brown suit and walking hat it would have been so much more delightful to usher into missus Durgin s presence that sumptuous robe of blue She forgot her disappointment however a little later in the excitement of rolling along at Miss Kendall s side in the Hilcrest carriage with the imposing looking coachman in the Spencer livery towering above her on the seat in front It had been Miss Kendall s first thought to order the runabout but a sudden remembrance of her morning s experience a few weeks before caused her to think that the stalwart John and the horses might be better so John somewhat to his consternation it must be confessed had been summoned to take his orders from Nellie as to roads and turns He now sat stern and dignified in the driver s seat showing by the very lines of his stiffly held body his entire disapproval of the whole affair Nor were John and Betty the only ones at Hilcrest who were conscious of keen disapproval that morning The mistress herself from an upper window watched with dismayed eyes the departure of the carriage I ve found Patty the little girl who was so good to me in New York Margaret had explained breathlessly flying into the room three minutes before She s in trouble and has sent for me I m taking John and the horses so I ll be all right Don t worry And with that she was gone leaving behind her a woman too dazed to reply by so much as a word Hilcrest was not out of sight before Margaret turned to the child at her side You said she was in trouble my friend Patty What is it she questioned It s little Maggie She s sick Maggie Not the Maggie the little brown eyed girl in the pink calico dress who fell down almost in front of our auto Nellie turned abruptly her thin little face alight Gee Was that you Did you give her the money Say now ain t that queer Then it is Maggie and she s Patty s little girl cried Margaret And to think I was so near and didn t know But tell me about her What is the matter CHAPTER XXIV Down in the shabby little cottage on the Hill road missus Durgin walked the floor vibrating between the window and the low bed in the corner By the stove sat missus Magoon mending a pair of trousers and talking To those who knew missus Magoon it was never necessary to add that last if missus Magoon was there so also was the talking It don t do no good ter watch the pot twon t b ile no quicker she was saying now her eyes on the woman who was anxiously scanning the road from the window Yes I know murmured missus Durgin resolutely turning her back on the window and going over to the bed Sixty seconds later however she was again in her old position at the window craning her neck to look far up the road How s Maggie doin now asked missus Magoon She s asleep Well she better be awake retorted missus Magoon so s ter keep her ma out o mischief Come come Mis Durgin why don t ye settle down an do somethin Jest call it she ain t a comin then twill be all the more happyfyin surprise if she does But she is a comin How do ye know she is Cause she s Maggie Kendall an she was Mag of the Alley an Mag of the Alley don t go back on her friends But she s rich now I know she is an you don t think rich folks is any good but I do an thar s the diff rence mister McGinnis has seen her an he says she s jest as nice as ever Mebbe she is nice ter folks o her sort but even mister McGinnis don t know that you ve sent fur her ter come way off down here I know it but Mis Magoon she s come broke off missus Durgin and something in her face and voice made the woman by the stove drop her work and run to the window Drawn up before the broken hinged half open gate were the Spencers famous span of thoroughbreds prancing arching their handsome necks and apparently giving the mighty personage on the driver s seat all that he wanted to do to hold them Behind in the luxurious carriage sat a ragged little girl and what to Patty Durgin was a wonderful vision in golden brown missus Durgin was thoroughly frightened She she had summoned this glorious creature to come to her because indeed her little girl Maggie was sick And where in the vision before her was there a trace of Mag of the Alley Just what she had expected to see missus Durgin did not know but certainly not this and she fairly shook in her shoes as the visible evidence of her audacity in the shape of the vision in golden brown walked up the little path from the gate It was missus Magoon who had to go to the door The young woman on the door step started eagerly forward but fell back with a murmured Oh but you can t be Patty Over by the window the tall black eyed woman stirred then as if by sheer force of will No no it s me that s Patty she began hurriedly An I hadn t oughter sent fur ye but her words were silenced by a pair of brown clad arms that were flung around her neck Patty it is Patty cried an eager voice and missus Durgin found herself looking into the well remembered blue eyes of the old time Mag of the Alley Later when missus Magoon had taken herself and her amazed ejaculations together with her round eyed daughter home which was after all merely the other side of the shabby little house Patty and Margaret sat down to talk In the bed in the corner little Maggie still slept and they lowered their voices that they might not wake her Now tell me everything commanded Margaret I want to know everything that s happened Patty shook her head Thar ain t much an what thar is ain t interestin she said We jest lived an we re livin now Nothin much happens But you married Patty flushed Her eyes fell Yes And your husband he s living Yes Margaret hesitated This was plainly an unpleasant subject yet if she were to give any help that was help Patty saw the hesitation and divined its cause You you better leave Sam out she said miserably He has ter be left out o most things Sam drinks Oh but we aren t going to leave Sam out retorted Margaret brightly and at the cheery tone Patty raised her head He didn t used ter be left out once when I married him eight years ago she declared We worked in the mill both of us an done well Here Patty turned her eyes away All the animation fled from her face and left it gray and pinched No We hain t been here but two years We jest kind of drifted here from the last place We don t never stay long in one place And the twins where are they A spasm of pain tightened Patty s lips I don t know she said You don t know No They lived with us at first an worked some in the mill Arabella couldn t much you know she was lame After Sam got worse he didn t like ter have em round an course they found it out One night he struck Arabella an course that settled things Clarabella wouldn t let her stay thar another minute an an I wouldn t neither Jest think an her lame an we always treatin her so gentle I give em what little money I had an they left fore mornin I couldn t go My little Maggie wa n t but three days old But you heard from them you knew where they went Yes once or twice They started fur New York an got thar all right We was down in Jersey then an twa n t fur They found the Whalens an went back ter them After that I didn t hear You know the twins wa n t much fur writin an well we left whar we was anyhow I ve wrote twice but thar hain t nothin come of it But I hadn t oughter run on so she broke off suddenly You was so good ter come Mis Magoon said you you wouldn t want to Want to Of course I wanted to I know but it had been so long an we hadn t never heard from you since you got the Whalens their new that is she stopped a painful red dyeing her cheeks Yes I know said Margaret gently You thought we had forgotten you and no wonder But you know now Bobby told you that her voice broke and she did not finish her sentence Patty nodded her eyes averted She could not speak Those years afterward were never very clear to me went on Margaret unsteadily It was all so terrible so lonely I know I begged to go back to the Alley and I talked of you and the others constantly But they kept everything from me They never spoke of those years in New York and they surrounded me with all sorts of beautiful interesting things and did everything in the world to make me happy In time they succeeded in a way But I think I never quite forgot There was always something somewhere behind things yet after a while it seemed like a dream or like a life that some one else had lived Margaret had almost forgotten Patty s presence Her eyes were on the broken hinged gate out the window and her voice was so low as to be almost inaudible It was a cry from little Maggie that roused her and together with Patty she sprang toward the bed My lucky stars murmured the child a little later in dim recollection as she gazed into the visitor s face You precious baby And it shall be lucky stars you ll see cried Margaret CHAPTER XXV 
7597-101877-0000	train-other-500	It was indeed lucky stars as little Maggie soon found out Others found it out too but to some of these it was not lucky stars At the dinner table on that first night after the visit to Patty s house
7597-101877-0001	train-other-500	Margaret threw the family into no little consternation by abruptly asking How do you go to work to get men and things to put houses into livable shape I don t suppose I did word it in a very businesslike manner she added laughingly
7597-101877-0002	train-other-500	in response to Frank Spencer s amazed ejaculation But what perhaps I don t quite understand he murmured No of course you don t replied Margaret and no wonder I ll explain
7597-101877-0003	train-other-500	You see I ve found another of my friends It s the little girl Patty with whom I lived three years in New York She s down in one of the mill cottages and it leaks and is in bad shape generally I want to fix it up
7597-101877-0004	train-other-500	There was a dazed silence then Frank Spencer recovered his wits and his voice By all means he rejoined hastily It shall be attended to at once
7597-101877-0005	train-other-500	Just give me your directions and I will send the men around there right away Thank you then I ll meet them there and tell them just what I want done Frank Spencer moistened his lips which had grown unaccountably dry But
7597-101877-0006	train-other-500	my dear Margaret he remonstrated surely it isn t necessary that you yourself should be subjected to such annoyance I can attend to all that is necessary Oh but I don t mind a bit returned Margaret brightly
7597-101877-0007	train-other-500	I want to do it It s for Patty you know And Frank Spencer could only fall back in his chair with an uneasy glance at his sister Before the week was out
none	none	 there seemed to be a good many things that were for Patty you know 
7597-101877-0008	train-other-500	There was the skilled physician summoned to prescribe for Maggie and there was the strong capable woman hired to care for her and to give the worn out mother a much needed rest There were the large baskets of fruit and vegetables
7597-101877-0009	train-other-500	and the boxes of beautiful flowers In fact there seemed to be almost nothing throughout the whole week that was not for Patty you know Even Margaret s time that too was given to Patty
7597-101877-0010	train-other-500	The golf links and the tennis court were deserted Neither Ned nor the beautiful October weather could tempt Margaret to a single game The music room too was silent and the piano was closed
7597-101877-0011	train-other-500	Down in the little house on the Prospect Hill road however a radiant young woman was superintending the work
none	none	 that was fast putting the cottage into a shape that was very much livable Meanwhile this same radiant young woman was getting acquainted with her namesake 
7597-101877-0012	train-other-500	Lucky Stars as the child insisted upon calling her and Maggie were firm friends Good food and proper care were fast bringing the little girl back to health
none	none	 and there was nothing she so loved to do as to play with the beautiful young lady 
7597-101877-0013	train-other-500	who had never yet failed to bring toy or game or flower for her delight And how old are you now Margaret would laughingly ask each day just to hear the prompt response I m most five goin on six
7597-101877-0014	train-other-500	an I ll be twelve ter morrow Margaret always chuckled over this retort and never tired of hearing it until one day Patty sharply interfered Don t please don t
7597-101877-0015	train-other-500	I can t bear it when you don t half know what it means When I don t know what it means Why Patty exclaimed Margaret Yes It s Sam He learned it to her Well Margaret s eyes were still puzzled
7597-101877-0016	train-other-500	He likes it He wants her ter be twelve ye know explained Patty with an effort Then as she saw her meaning was still not clear she added miserably She can work then in the mills
7597-101877-0017	train-other-500	In the mills at twelve years old That s the age ye know when they can git their papers that is if it s summer vacation time
none	none	 an they looks out that tis summer most generally 
7597-101877-0018	train-other-500	when they does gits em After that it don t count they jest works lots of em summer or winter school or no school
none	none	 The age 
7597-101877-0019	train-other-500	Do you mean that they let mere children twelve years old work in those mills For a moment Patty stared silently Then she shook her head I reckon mebbe ye don t know much about it she said wearily
none	none	 They don t wait till they s twelve They jest says they s twelve Nellie Magoon s eleven an Bess is ten an Susie McDermot ain t but nine but they s all twelve on the mill books 
7597-101877-0021	train-other-500	Sam s jest a learnin Maggie ter say she s twelve even now an the minute she s big enough ter work she will be twelve It makes me jest sick an that s why I can t bear ter hear her say it Margaret shuddered
7597-101877-0022	train-other-500	Her face lost a little of its radiant glow and her hand trembled as she raised it to her head You are right I did not know she said faintly There must be something that can be done There must be
7597-101877-0023	train-other-500	I will see And she did see
none	none	 That night she once more followed her guardian into the little den off the library 
7597-101877-0024	train-other-500	It s business again she began smiling faintly and it s the mills May I speak to you a moment Of course you may
none	none	 cried the man trying to make his voice so cordial that there should be visible in his manner no trace of his real dismay at her request 
7597-101877-0025	train-other-500	What is it Margaret did not answer at once Her head drooped forward a little She had seated herself near the desk and her left hand and arm rested along the edge of its smooth flat top
7597-101877-0026	train-other-500	The man s gaze drifted from her face to the arm the slender wrist and the tapering fingers so clearly outlined in all their fairness against the dark mahogany and so plainly all unfitted for strife or struggle With a sudden movement
7597-101877-0027	train-other-500	he leaned forward and covered the slim fingers with his own warm clasping hand Margaret dear child don t he begged It breaks my heart to see you like this You are carrying the whole world on those two frail shoulders of yours
7597-101877-0028	train-other-500	No no it s not the whole world at all protested the girl It s only a wee small part of it and such a defenseless little part too It s the children down at the mills Unconsciously the man straightened himself
7597-101877-0029	train-other-500	His clasp on the outstretched hand loosened until Margaret as if in answer to the stern determination of his face drew her hand away and raised her head until her eyes met his unfalteringly
7597-101877-0030	train-other-500	It is useless of course to pretend not to understand he began stiffly
none	none	 I suppose that that altogether too officious young McGinnis has been asking your help for some of his pet schemes On the contrary mister McGinnis has not spoken to me of the mill workers corrected Margaret quietly 
7597-101877-0032	train-other-500	but with a curious little thrill that resolved itself into a silent exultation that there was then at least one at the mills on whose aid she might count I have not seen him indeed since that first morning I met him she finished coldly
none	none	 Though Margaret would not own it to herself the fact that she had not seen the young man Robert McGinnis had surprised and disappointed her not a little Margaret Kendall was not used to having her presence and her gracious invitations ignored 
7597-101877-0034	train-other-500	Oh then you haven t seen him murmured her guardian and there was a curious intonation of relief in his voice Who then has been talking to you No one in the way you mean Patty inadvertently mentioned it to day
7597-101877-0035	train-other-500	and I questioned her I was shocked and distressed Those little children just think of it twelve years old and working in the mills The man made a troubled gesture But my dear Margaret
7597-101877-0036	train-other-500	I did not put them there Their parents did it But you could refuse to take them Why should I he shrugged They would merely go into some other man s mill But you don t know the worst of it moaned the girl They ve lied to you
7597-101877-0037	train-other-500	They aren t even twelve some of them They re babies of nine and ten She paused expectantly but he did not speak He only turned his head so that she could not see his eyes
none	none	 You did not know it of course 
7597-101877-0038	train-other-500	she went on feverishly But you do now And surely now now you can do something Still he was silent Then he turned sharply Margaret
7597-101877-0039	train-other-500	I beg of you to believe me when I say that you do not understand the matter at all Those people are poor They need the money You would deprive some of the families of two thirds of their means of support if you took away what the children earn Help them
7597-101877-0040	train-other-500	pity them be as charitable as you like That is well and good but Margaret don t for heaven s sake let your heart run away with your head when it comes to the business part of it Business with babies nine years old
7597-101877-0041	train-other-500	The man sprang to his feet and walked twice the length of the room then he turned about and faced the scornful eyes of the girl by the desk Margaret don t look at me as if you thought I was a fiend incarnate
7597-101877-0042	train-other-500	I regret this sort of thing as much as you do Indeed I do But my hands are tied I am simply a part of a great machine a gigantic system and I must run my mills as other men do Surely you must see that
7597-101877-0043	train-other-500	Just think it over and give me the credit at least for knowing a little more of the business than you do when I and my father before me have been here as many years as you have days Come please don t let us talk of this thing any more to night
7597-101877-0044	train-other-500	You are tired and overwrought
none	none	 and I don t think you realize yourself what you are asking Very well I will go sighed Margaret rising wearily to her feet But I can t forget it There must be some way out of it There must be some way out of it somehow some time CHAPTER XXVI There came a day when there seemed to be nothing left to do for Patty Maggie was well and at play again in the tiny yard The yard itself was no longer strewn with tin cans and bits of paper nor did the gate hang half hinged in slovenly decrepitude The house rejoiced in new paper paint and window glass and the roof showed a spotted surface that would defy the heaviest shower Within before a cheery fire Patty sewed industriously on garments which Miss Kendall no wise needed but for which Miss Kendall would pay much money Patty did not work in the mills now Margaret had refused to let her go back saying that she wanted lots of sewing done and Patty could do that instead Patty s own wardrobe as well as that of the child Maggie was supplied for a year ahead and the pantry and the storeroom of the little house fairly groaned with good things to eat Even Sam true to Margaret s promise was not left out as was shown by his appearance Sam stirred by the girl s cheery encouragement and tactful confidence held up his head sometimes now with a trace of his old manliness and had even been known to keep sober for two whole days at a time There did indeed seem nothing left to do for Patty and Margaret found herself with the old idleness on her hands At Hilcrest missus Merideth and her brothers were doing everything in their power to make Margaret happy They were frightened and dismayed at the girl s infatuation for that mill woman as they termed Margaret s interest in Patty and they had ever before them the haunting vision of the girl s childhood morbidness which they so feared to see return To the Spencers happiness for Margaret meant pleasure excitement and as Ned expressed it something doing At the first hint then of leisure on the part of Margaret these three vied with each other to fill that leisure to the brim Two or three guests were invited just enough to break the monotony of the familiar faces though not enough to spoil the intimacy and render outside interests easy It was December and too late for picnics but it was yet early in the month and driving and motoring were still possible and even enjoyable The goal now was not a lake or a mountain to be sure but might be a not too distant city with a matinee or a luncheon to give zest to the trip Ned in particular was indefatigable in his efforts to please and Margaret could scarcely move that she did not find him at her elbow with some suggestion for her gratification ranging all the way from a dinner party to a footstool Margaret was not quite at ease about Ned There was an exclusiveness in his devotions and a tenderness in his ministrations that made her a little restless in his presence particularly if she found herself alone with him Ned was her good friend her comrade She was very sure that she did not wish him to be anything else and if he should try to be there would be an end to the comradeship at all events if not to the friendship By way of defense against these possibilities she adopted a playful air of whimsicality and fell to calling him the name by which he had introduced himself on that first day when she had seen him at the head of the hillside path Uncle Ned She did not do this many times however for one day he turned upon her a white face working with emotion I am not your uncle he burst out and Margaret scarcely knew whether to laugh or to cry he threw so much tragedy into the simple words No she managed to return lightly Oh but you said you were you know and when a man says But I say otherwise now he cut in leaning toward her until his breath stirred the hair at her temples Margaret he murmured tremulously it s not uncle but there s something else a name that Oh but I couldn t learn another interrupted Margaret with nervous precipitation as she rose hurriedly to her feet so soon as this you know Why you ve just cast me off as a niece and it takes time for me to realize the full force of that blow she finished gayly as she hurried away In her own room she drew a deep breath of relief but all day and for many days afterward she was haunted by the hurt look in Ned s eyes as she had turned away It reminded her of the expression she had seen once in the pictured eyes of a dog that had been painted by a great artist She remembered too the title of the picture Wounded in the house of his friends and it distressed her not a little and yet Ned was her comrade and her very good friend and that was what he must be Not only this however caused Margaret restless days and troubled nights there were those children down in the mills those little children nine ten twelve years old It was too cold now to stay long on the veranda but there was many a day and there were some nights when Margaret looked out of the east windows of Hilcrest and gazed with fascinated yet shrinking eyes at the mills She was growing morbid she owned that to herself She knew nothing at all of the mills and she had never seen a child at work in them yet she pictured great black wheels relentlessly crushing out young lives and she recoiled from the touch of her trailing silks they seemed alive with shrunken little forms and wasted fingers Day after day she turned over in her mind the most visionary projects for stopping those wheels or for removing those children beyond their reach Even though her eyes might be on the merry throngs of a gay city street her thoughts were still back in the mill town with the children and even though her body might be flying from home at the rate of thirty or forty miles an hour in Frank s big six cylinder Speeder her real self was back at Hilcrest with the mills always in sight Once again she appealed to her guardian but five minutes talk showed her the uselessness of anything she could say it was true she did not know anything about it It was that very fact perhaps which first sent her thoughts in a new direction If as was true she did not know anything about it how better could she remedy the situation than by finding out something about it And almost instantly came the memory of her guardian s words I suppose that that altogether too officious young McGinnis has been asking your help for some of his schemes Bobby knew Bobby had schemes Bobby was the one to help her By all means she would send for Bobby That night in a cramped little room in one of the mill boarding houses a square jawed gray eyed young man received a note that sent the blood in a tide of red to his face and made his hands shake until the paper in his long sinewy fingers fluttered like an aspen leaf in a breeze Yet the note was very simple It read Will you come please to see me to morrow night I want to ask some questions about the children at the mills And it was signed Margaret Kendall CHAPTER XXVII With a relief which she did not attempt to hide from herself Margaret saw the male members of the family at Hilcrest leave early the next morning on a trip from which they could not return until the next day and with a reluctance which she could not hide from either herself or missus Merideth she said that afternoon mister McGinnis is coming to see me this evening Aunt Della I sent for him You know I am interested in the children at the mills and I wanted to ask him some questions missus Merideth was dumb with dismay For some days Margaret s apparent inactivity had lulled her into a feeling of security And now with her brothers away the blow which they had so dreaded for weeks had fallen McGinnis was coming Summoning all her strength missus Merideth finally managed to murmur a faint remonstrance that Margaret should trouble herself over a matter that could not be helped then with an earnest request that Margaret should not commit herself to any foolish promises she fled to her own room fearful lest in her perturbation she should say something which she would afterward regret When Miss Kendall came down stairs at eight o clock that night she found waiting for her in the drawing room into which McGinnis had been shown by her express orders a young man whose dress attitude and expression radiated impersonality and business in spite of his sumptuous surroundings In directing that the young man should be shown into the drawing room instead of into the more informal library or living room Margaret had vaguely intended to convey to him the impression that he was a highly prized friend and as such was entitled to all honor but she had scarcely looked into the cold gray eyes or touched the half reluctantly extended fingers before she knew that all such efforts had been without avail The young man had not come to pay a visit he was an employee who had obeyed the command of one in authority McGinnis stood just inside the door hat in hand His face was white and his jaw stern set His manner was quiet and his voice when he spoke was steady There was nothing about him to tell the girl who was vainly trying to thaw the stiff frigidity of his reserve that he had spent all day and half the night in lashing himself into just this manner that so displeased her
5660_101884_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 You sent for me he asked 
none	none	quietly Yes smiled the girl And doesn t your conscience prick you sir because I had to send for you when you should have come long ago of your own accord to see me she demanded playfully motioning him to a seat Then before he could reply she went on hurriedly I wanted to see you very much By something that mister Spencer said the other evening I suspected that you were interested in the children who work in the mills particularly interested And you are Yes much interested And you know them lots of them You know their parents and how they live Yes I know them well too well He added the last softly almost involuntarily The girl heard and threw a quick look of sympathy into his eyes Good You are just the one I want then she cried And you will help me won t you McGinnis hesitated An eager light had leaped to his eyes For a moment he dared not speak lest his voice break through the lines of stern control he had set for it I shall be glad to give you any help I can he said at last steadily but mister Spencer of course knows he paused leaving his sentence unfinished But that is exactly it interposed Margaret earnestly mister Spencer does not know at least he does not know personally about the mill people I mean He told me long ago that you stood between him and them and had for a long time It is you who must tell me Very well I will do my best Just what do you want to know Everything And I want not only to be told but to see for myself I want you to take me through the mills and afterward I want to visit some of the houses where the children live Miss Kendall The distressed consternation in the man s voice was unmistakable Is it so bad as that questioned the girl You don t want me to see all these things All the more reason why I should then If conditions are bad help is needed but before help can be effectual or even given at all the conditions must be understood That is what I mean to do understand the conditions How many children are there employed in the mills please McGinnis hesitated Well there are some hundreds he acknowledged Of course many of them are twelve and fourteen and fifteen and that is bad enough but there are others younger You see the age limit of this state is lower than some Many parents bring their children here to live so that they can put them into the mills Margaret shuddered Then it is true as Patty said There are children there nine and ten years old Yes even younger than that I fear Only last week I turned away a man who brought a puny little thing with a request for work He swore she was twelve I d hate to tell you how old or rather how young she really looked I sent him home with a few remarks which I hope he will remember She was only one however out of many I am not always able to do what I would like to do in such cases I am not the only man at the mills You must realize that Yes I realize it and I understand why you can t always do what you wish But just suppose you tell me now some of the things you would like to do if you could And she smiled encouragement straight into his eyes until in spite of his stern resolve he forgot himself and his surroundings and began to talk Robert McGinnis was no silver tongued orator but he knew his subject and his heart was in it For long months he had been battling alone against the evils that had little by little filled his soul with horror Accustomed heretofore only to rebuffs and angry denunciations of his officious meddling he now suddenly found a tenderly sympathetic ear eagerly awaiting his story and a pair of luminous blue eyes already glistening with unshed tears No wonder McGinnis talked and talked well He seemed to be speaking to the Maggie of long ago the little girl who stood ready and anxious to divvy up with all the world Then suddenly his eyes fell on the rich folds of the girl s dress and on the velvety pile of the rug beneath her feet I have said too much he broke off sharply springing to his feet I forgot myself On the contrary you have not said half enough declared the girl rising too and I mean to go over the mills at once if you ll be so good as to take me I ll let you know when And come to see me again please without being sent for she suggested merrily adding with a pretty touch of earnestness We are a committee of two and to do good work the committee must meet McGinnis never knew exactly how he got home that night The earth was beneath him but he did not seem to touch it The sky was above him he was nearer that But in spite of this nearness the stars seemed dim he was thinking of the light in a pair of glorious blue eyes McGinnis told himself that it was because of his mill people this elation that possessed him He was grateful that they had found a friend He did not ask himself later whether it was also because of his mill people that he sat up until far into the morning with his eyes dreamily fixed on the note in his hand signed Margaret Kendall CHAPTER XXVIII Frank Spencer found the mental atmosphere of Hilcrest in confusion when he returned from his two days trip Margaret had repeated to missus Merideth the substance of what McGinnis had told her drawing a vivid picture of the little children wearing out their lives in plain sight of the windows of Hilcrest missus Merideth had been shocked and dismayed though she hardly knew which she deplored the more that such conditions existed or that Margaret should know of them At Margaret s avowed determination to go over the mills and into the operatives houses she lifted her hands in horrified protest and begged her to report the matter to the Woman s Guild and leave the whole thing in charge of the committee But don t you see that they can t reach the seat of the trouble Margaret had objected Why even that money which I intended for little Maggie went into a general fund and never reached its specified destination And missus Merideth could only sigh and murmur But my dear it s so unnecessary and so dreadful for you to mix yourself up personally with such people When her brother came home missus Merideth went to him Frank was a man surely Frank could do something But Frank merely grew white and stern and went off into his own den shutting himself up away from everybody The next morning after a fifteen minute talk with Margaret he sought his sister His face was drawn into deep lines and his eyes looked as if he had not slept Say no more to Margaret he entreated It is useless She is her own mistress of course in spite of her insistence that I am still her guardian and she must be allowed to do as she likes in this matter Make her home here happy and do not trouble her We must not make her quite hate us His voice broke over the last two words and he was gone before missus Merideth could make any reply Some twenty four hours later young McGinnis at the mills was summoned to the telephone If you are not too busy called a voice that sent a quick throb of joy to the young man s pulse the other half of the committee would like to begin work May she come down to the mills this afternoon at three o clock By all means cried McGinnis Come He tried to say more but while he was searching for just the right words the voice murmured Thank you and then came the click of the receiver against the hook at the other end of the line The clock had not struck three that afternoon when Margaret was ushered into the inner office of Spencer Spencer Only Frank was there for which Margaret was thankful She avoided Ned these days when she could There was still that haunting reproach in his eyes whenever they met hers Frank was expecting her and only a peculiar tightening of his lips betrayed his disquietude as he turned to his desk and pressed the button that would summon McGinnis to the office Miss Kendall would like to go over one of the mills he said quietly as the young man entered in response to his ring Perhaps you will be her escort Margaret gave her guardian a grateful look as she left the office She thought she knew just how much the calm acceptance of the situation had cost him and she appreciated his unflinching determination to give her actions the sanction of his apparent consent It was for this that she gave him the grateful glance but he did not see it His head was turned away And what shall I show you asked McGinnis as the office door closed behind them Everything you can returned Margaret everything But particularly the children From the first deafening click clack of the rattling machines she drew back in consternation They don t work there the children she cried For answer he pointed to a little girl not far away She was standing on a stool that she might reach her work Her face was thin and drawn looking with deep shadows under her eyes and little hollows where the roses should have been in her cheeks Her hair was braided and wound tightly about her small head though at the temples and behind her ears it kinked into rebellious curls that showed what it would like to do if it had a chance Her ragged little skirts were bound round and round with a stout cord so that the hungry jaws of the machine might not snap at any flying fold or tatter She did not look up as Margaret paused beside her She dared not Her eyes were glued to the whizzing whirring clattering thing before her watching for broken threads or loose ends the neglect of which might bring down upon her head a snarling reprimand from de boss of her department Margaret learned many things during the next two hours Conversation was not easy in the clattering din but some few things her guide explained and a word or two spoke volumes sometimes She saw what it meant to be a doffer a reeler a silk twister She saw what it might mean if the tiny hand that thrust the empty bobbin over the buzzing spindle point should slip or lose its skill She saw a little maid of twelve who earned two whole dollars a week and she saw a smaller girl of ten who McGinnis said was with her sister the only support of an invalid mother at home She saw more much more until her mind refused to grasp details and the whole scene became one blurred vision of horror Later after a brief rest she had insisted upon staying she saw the day shift swarm out into the chill December night and the night shift come shivering in to take their places and she grew faint and sick when she saw among them the scores of puny little forms with tired looking faces and dragging feet And they re only beginning she moaned as McGinnis hurried her away And they ve got to work all night all night CHAPTER XXIX Margaret did not sleep well in her lavender scented sheets that night Always she heard the roar and the click clack of the mills and everywhere she saw the weary little workers with their closely bound skirts and their strained anxious faces She came down to breakfast with dark circles under her eyes and she ate almost nothing to the great though silent distress of the family The Spencers were alone now There would be no more guests for a week then would come a merry half dozen for the Christmas holidays New Year s was the signal for a general breaking up The family seldom stayed at Hilcrest long after that though the house was not quite closed being always in readiness for the brothers when either one or both came down for a week s business It was always more or less of a debatable question just where the family should go There was the town house in New York frequently opened for a month or two of gaiety and there were the allurements of some Southern resort or of a trip abroad to be considered Sometimes it was merely a succession of visits that occupied the first few weeks after New Year s particularly for missus Merideth and Ned and sometimes it was only a quiet rest under some sunny sky entirely away from Society with a capital S The time was drawing near now for the annual change and the family were discussing the various possibilities when Margaret came into the breakfast room They appealed to her at once and asked her opinion and advice but without avail There seemed to be not one plan that interested her to the point of possessing either merits or demerits I am going down to Patty s she said a little hurriedly to missus Merideth when breakfast was over I got some names and addresses of the mill children yesterday from mister McGinnis and I shall ask Patty to go with me to see them I want to talk with the parents But my dear you don t know what you are doing protested missus Merideth They are so rough those people Miss Alby our visiting home missionary told me only last week how dreadful they were so rude and intemperate and and ill odored She has been among them She knows Yes but don t you see those are the very people that need help then returned Margaret wearily They don t know what they are doing to their little children and I must tell them I must tell them I shall have Patty with me Don t worry And missus Merideth could only sigh and sigh again and hurry away up stairs to devise an altogether more delightful plan for the winter months than any that had yet been proposed a plan so overwhelmingly delightful that Margaret could not help being interested Of one thing however missus Merideth was certain if there was a place distant enough to silence the roar of the mills in Margaret s ears that place should be chosen if it were Egypt itself Patty Durgin hesitated visibly when Margaret told her what she wanted to do until Margaret exclaimed in surprise and with a little reproach in her voice Why Patty don t you want to help me Yes yes you don t understand protested Patty It ain t that I want ter do it all If you have money for em let me give it to em Margaret was silent Her eyes were still hurt still rebellious I I don t want you ter see them stammered Patty then I don t want you ter feel so so bad Margaret s face cleared Oh but I m feeling bad now she asserted cheerily and after I see them I ll feel better I want to talk to them don t you see They don t realize what they are doing to their children to let them work so and I am going to tell them Patty sighed Ye don t understand she began then stopped her eyes on the determined young face opposite All right I ll go she finished but she shivered a little as she spoke And they did go not only on that day but on the next and the next Margaret almost forgot the mills so filled was her vision with drunken men untidy women wretched babies and cheerless homes Sometimes her presence and her questions were resented and always they were looked upon with distrust Her money if she gave that was welcome usually but her remonstrances and her warnings fell upon deaf if not angry ears And then Margaret perceived why Patty had said she did not understand there was no such thing as making a successful appeal to the parents She might have spared herself the effort Sometimes she did not understand the words of the dark browed men and the slovenly women there were many nationalities among the operatives but always she understood their black looks and their almost threatening gestures Occasionally to be sure she found a sick woman or a discouraged man who welcomed her warmly and who listened to her and agreed with what she had to say but with them there was always the excuse of poverty though their Sue and Bess and Teddy might not earn but twenty thirty forty cents a day yet that twenty thirty and forty cents would buy meat and bread and meant all the difference between a full and an empty stomach perhaps for every member of the family at times Margaret did what she could She spent her time and her money without stint and went from house to house untiringly She summoned young McGinnis to her aid and arranged for a monster Christmas tree to be placed in the largest hall in town and she herself ordered the books toys candies and games for it besides the candles and tinsel stars to make it a vision of delight to the weary little eyes all unaccustomed to such glory And yet to Margaret it seemed that nothing that she did counted in the least against the much there was to be done It was as if a child with a teaspoon and a bowl of sand were set to filling up a big chasm her spoonful of sand had not even struck bottom in that pit of horror CHAPTER XXX The house party at Hilcrest was not an entire success that Christmas 
7584-101882-0000	train-other-500	Even the guests felt a subtle something in the air
none	none	 that was not conducive to ease 
7584-101882-0001	train-other-500	while missus Merideth and her brothers were plainly fighting a losing contest against a restlessness that sent a haunting fear to their eyes Margaret
7584-101882-0002	train-other-500	though scrupulously careful to show every attention to the guests that courtesy demanded was strangely quiet and not at all like the merry high spirited girl that most of them knew Brandon who was again at the house
7584-101882-0003	train-other-500	sought her out one day and said low in her ear If it were June and not December and if we were out in the auto instead of here by the fire I m wondering would I need to watch out for those brakes The girl winced
7584-101882-0004	train-other-500	No no she cried never I think I should simply crawl for fear that under the wheels somewhere would be a child a dog a chicken or even a helpless worm something that moved and that I might hurt
7584-101882-0005	train-other-500	There is already so much suffering Brandon laughed uneasily and drew back a puzzled frown on his face He had not meant that she should take his jest so seriously It was on the day after New Year s when all the guests had gone
7584-101882-0006	train-other-500	that Margaret once more said to her guardian that she wished to speak to him and on business Frank Spencer told himself that he was used to this sort of thing now and that he was resigned to the inevitable
7584-101882-0007	train-other-500	but his eyes were troubled and his lips were close shut as he motioned the girl to precede him into the den I thought I ought to tell you she began plunging into her subject with an abruptness that betrayed her nervousness
7584-101882-0008	train-other-500	I thought I ought to tell you at once that I I cannot go with you when you all go away next week You cannot go with us No I must stay here Here
7584-101882-0009	train-other-500	Why Margaret child that is impossible here in this great house with only the servants No no you don t understand not here at Hilcrest I shall be down in the town with Patty Margaret
7584-101882-0010	train-other-500	The man was too dismayed to say more I know it seems strange to you of course rejoined the girl hastily but you will see you will understand when I explain I have thought of it in all its bearings
7584-101882-0011	train-other-500	and it is the only way I could not go with you and sing and laugh and dance and all the while remember that my people back here were suffering Your people Dear child
7584-101882-0012	train-other-500	they are not your people nor my people they are their own people They come and go as they like If not in my mills they work in some other man s mills You are not responsible for their welfare Besides
7584-101882-0013	train-other-500	you have already done more for their comfort and happiness than any human being could expect of you I know but you do not understand It is in a peculiar way that they are my people not because they are here
7584-101882-0014	train-other-500	but because they are poor and unhappy Margaret hesitated and then went on her eyes turned away from her guardian s face I don t know as I can make you understand as I do There are people lots of them
7584-101882-0015	train-other-500	who are generous and kind to the poor But they are on one side of the line and the poor are on the other They merely pass things over the line they never go themselves And that is all right
7584-101882-0016	train-other-500	They could not cross the line if they wanted to perhaps They would not know how All their lives they have been surrounded with tender care and luxury they do not know what it means to be hungry and cold and homeless
none	none	 They do not know what it means to fight the world alone with only empty hands 
7584-101882-0017	train-other-500	Margaret paused her eyes still averted then suddenly she turned and faced the man sitting in silent dismay at the desk Don t you see she cried I have crossed the line
7584-101882-0018	train-other-500	I crossed it long ago when I was a little girl I do know what it means to be hungry and cold and homeless I do know what it means to fight the world with only two small empty hands
none	none	 In doing for these people I am doing for my own 
7584-101882-0019	train-other-500	They are my people For a moment there was silence in the little room To the man at the desk the bottom seemed suddenly to have dropped out of his world For some time it had been growing on him the knowledge of how much the presence of this fair haired
7584-101882-0020	train-other-500	winsome girl meant to him It came to him now with the staggering force of a blow in the face and she was going away To Frank Spencer the days suddenly stretched ahead in empty uselessness
7584-101882-0021	train-other-500	there seemed to be nothing left worth while But my dear Margaret he said at last unsteadily we tried we all tried to make you forget those terrible days You were so keenly sensitive
7584-101882-0022	train-other-500	they weighed too heavily on your heart You you were morbid my dear I know she said I understand better now Every one tried to interest me to amuse me to make me forget
7584-101882-0023	train-other-500	I was kept from everything unpleasant and from everybody that suffered It comes to me very vividly now how careful every one was that I should know of only happiness We wanted you to forget
7584-101882-0024	train-other-500	But I never did forget quite Even when years and years had passed and I could go everywhere and see all the beautiful things and places I had read about and when I was with my friends
7584-101882-0025	train-other-500	there was always something somewhere behind things Those four years in New York were vague and elusive as time passed They seemed like a dream or like a life that some one else had lived
none	none	 But I know now 
7584-101882-0026	train-other-500	they were not a dream and they were not a life that some one else lived They were my life I lived them myself Don t you see now Margaret s eyes were luminous with feeling Her lips trembled
7584-101882-0027	train-other-500	but her face glowed with a strange exaltation of happiness But what do you mean to do faltered the man Margaret flushed and leaned forward eagerly I am going to do all that I can
7584-101882-0028	train-other-500	and I hope it will be a great deal I am going down there to live To live not to live child Yes Oh I know now she went on hurriedly I have been among them Some are wicked and some are thoughtless
7584-101882-0029	train-other-500	but all of them need teaching I am going to live there among them to show them the better way The man at the desk left his chair abruptly He walked over to the window and looked out The moon shone clear and bright in the sky
7584-101882-0030	train-other-500	Down in the valley the countless gleaming windows and the tall black chimneys showed where the mill workers still toiled those mill workers whom the man had come almost to hate it was because of them that Margaret was going
7584-101882-0031	train-other-500	He turned slowly and walked back to the girl Margaret
none	none	 he began in a voice that shook a little 
7584-101882-0032	train-other-500	I had not thought to speak of this at least not now Perhaps it would be better if I never spoke of it but I am almost forced to say it now I can t let you go like this and not know
7584-101882-0033	train-other-500	I must make one effort to keep you If you knew that there was some one here who loved you who loved you with the whole strength of his being
none	none	 and if you knew that to him your going 
7584-101882-0034	train-other-500	meant everything that was loneliness and grief would you could you stay Margaret started She would not look into the eyes that were so earnestly seeking hers
7584-101882-0035	train-other-500	It was of Ned of course that he was speaking Of that she was sure In some way he had discovered Ned s feeling for her had perhaps even been asked to plead his cause with her
7584-101882-0036	train-other-500	Did you ever think began Spencer again softly did you ever think that if you did stay you might find even here some one to whom you could show the better way That even here
7584-101882-0037	train-other-500	you might do all these things you long to do and with some one close by your side to help you Margaret thought of Ned of his impulsiveness his light heartedness
7584-101882-0038	train-other-500	his utter want of sympathy with everything she had been doing the last few weeks and involuntarily she shuddered Spencer saw the sensitive quiver and drew back touched to the quick Margaret struggled to her feet
7584-101882-0039	train-other-500	No no she cried still refusing to meet his eyes I I cannot stay I am sorry believe me to give you pain but I I cannot stay
7584-101882-0040	train-other-500	And she hurried from the room The man dropped back in his chair his face white She does not love me and no wonder
none	none	 he sighed bitterly and he went over word by word what had been said though even then he did not find syllable or gesture that told him the truth that she supposed him merely to be playing John Alden to his brother s Miles Standish CHAPTER XXXI 
5660_101883_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The household at Hilcrest did not break up as early as usual that year A few days were consumed in horrified remonstrances and tearful pleadings on the part of missus Merideth and Ned when Margaret s plans became known 
none	none	Then several more days were needed for necessary arrangements when the stoical calm of despair had brought something like peace to the family
5660_101883_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 It is not so dreadful at all Margaret had assured them 
5660_101883_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 I have taken a large house not far from the mills and I am having it papered and painted and put into very comfortable shape 
5660_101883_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Patty and her family will live with me and we are going to open classes in simple little things that will help toward better living 
5660_101883_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 But that is regular settlement work sighed missus Merideth 
none	none	Is it smiled Margaret a little wearily
5660_101883_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 Well perhaps it is Anyway I hope that just the presence of one clean beautiful home among them will do some good 
5660_101883_000008_000002	train-clean-360	I mean to try it at all events 
5660_101883_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 But are you going to do nothing but that all the time just teach those dreadful creatures and and live there 
5660_101883_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly not declared Margaret with a bright smile 
5660_101883_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 I ve planned a trip to New York 
5660_101883_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 To New York missus Merideth sat up suddenly her face alight 
5660_101883_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh that will be fine lovely 
5660_101883_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Why didn t you tell us 
5660_101883_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Poor dear you ll need a rest all right I m thinking and we ll keep you just as long as we can too With lightning rapidity missus Merideth had changed their plans in her mind 
5660_101883_000011_000004	train-clean-360	They would go to New York not Egypt 
5660_101883_000011_000005	train-clean-360	Egypt had seemed desirable but if Margaret was going to New York that altered the case 
5660_101883_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh but I thought you weren t going to New York laughed Margaret Besides I m going with Patty 
none	none	With Patty If it had not been tragical it would have been comical missus Merideth s shocked recoil at the girl s words Yes After we get everything nicely to running we shall have teachers to help us you know Patty and I are going to New York to see if we can t find her sisters Arabella and Clarabella
5660_101883_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 What absurd names missus Merideth spoke sharply 
none	none	In reality she had no interest whether they were or were not absurd but they chanced at the moment to be a convenient scapegoat for her anger and discomfiture
5660_101883_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Patty doesn t think them absurd laughed Margaret 
none	none	She would tell you that she named them herself out of a piece of a book she found in the ash barrel long ago when they were children 
5660_101883_000016_000002	train-clean-360	You should hear Patty say it really to appreciate it 
none	none	She used to preface it by some such remark as Names ain t like measles an relations ye know Ye don t have ter have em if ye don t want em you can change em
5660_101883_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Ugh shuddered missus Merideth 
5660_101883_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 Margaret how can you laugh 
5660_101883_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Why it s funny I think laughed Margaret again as she turned away 
5660_101883_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Even the most urgent entreaties on the part of Margaret failed to start the Spencers on their trip and not until she finally threatened to make the first move herself and go down to the town did they consent to go 
none	none	But that absurd house of yours isn t ready yet protested missus Merideth I know but I shall stay with Patty until it is returned Margaret
5660_101883_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 I would rather wait until you go as you seem so worried about the break as you insist upon calling it but if you won t why I must that is all 
none	none	I must be there to superintend matters Then I suppose I shall have to go moaned missus Merideth for I simply will not have you leave us here and go down there to live and I shall tell everybody everybody she added firmly that it is merely for this winter and that we allowed you to do it only on that one condition 
5660_101883_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Margaret smiled but she made no comment it was enough to fight present battles without trying to win future ones 
none	none	On the day the rest of the family left Hilcrest Margaret moved to Patty s little house on the Hill road Her tiny room up under the eaves looked woefully small and inconvenient to eyes that were accustomed to luxurious Hilcrest and the supper which to Patty was sumptuous in the extravagance she had allowed herself in her visitor s honor did not tempt her appetite in the least 
5660_101883_000024_000002	train-clean-360	She told herself however that all this was well and good and she ate the supper and laid herself down upon the hard bed with an exaltation that rendered her oblivious to taste and feeling 
5660_101883_000025_000000	train-clean-360	In due time the Mill House as Margaret called her new home was ready for occupancy and the family moved in 
5660_101883_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Naming the place had given Margaret no little food for thought 
none	none	I want something simple and plain she had said to Patty something that the people will like and feel an interest in But I don t want any Refuges or Havens or Rests or Homes about it It is a home but not the kind that begins with a capital letter 
5660_101883_000026_000003	train-clean-360	It is just one of the mill houses 
none	none	Well why don t ye call it the Mill House then an done with it demanded Patty Patty you re a genius 
5660_101883_000028_000001	train-clean-360	I will cried Margaret 
5660_101883_000028_000002	train-clean-360	And the Mill House it was from that day 
5660_101883_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Margaret s task was not an easy one 
5660_101883_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Both she and her house were looked upon with suspicion and she had some trouble in finding the two or three teachers of just the right sort to help her 
none	none	Even when she had found these teachers and opened her classes in sewing cooking and the care of children only a few enrolled themselves as pupils
5660_101883_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind said Margaret we shall grow 
none	none	You ll see 
5660_101883_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The mill people however were not the only ones that learned something during the next few months 
5660_101883_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Margaret herself learned much 
none	none	She learned that while there were men who purposely idled their time away and drank up their children s hard earned wages there were others who tramped the streets in vain in search of work I hain t got nothin ter do yit Miss one such said to Margaret in answer to her sympathetic inquiries
5660_101883_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 But thar ain t a boss but what said if I d got kids I might send them along 
none	none	They was short o kids I been tryin ter keep Rosy an Katy ter school I was cal latin ter make somethin of em more n their dad an their mammy is but I reckon as how I ll have ter set em ter work Oh but you mustn t remonstrated Margaret
5660_101883_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 That would spoil everything 
none	none	Don t you see that you mustn t 
5660_101883_000033_000003	train-clean-360	They must go to school get an education 
none	none	The man gazed at her with dull eyes
5660_101883_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 They got ter eat first he said 
5660_101883_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes yes I know interposed Margaret eagerly 
5660_101883_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 I understand all that and I ll help about that part 
none	none	I ll give you money until you get something to do 
5660_101883_000037_000000	train-clean-360	A sudden flash came into the man s eyes 
5660_101883_000037_000001	train-clean-360	His shoulders straightened 
none	none	Thank ye Miss 
5660_101883_000038_000001	train-clean-360	We be n t charity folks And he turned away 
5660_101883_000039_000000	train-clean-360	A week later Margaret learned that Rosy and Katy were out of school When she looked them up she found them at work in the mills 
5660_101883_000040_000000	train-clean-360	This matter of the school question was a great puzzle to Margaret 
5660_101883_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Very early in her efforts she had sought out the public school teachers and asked their help and advice 
5660_101883_000040_000002	train-clean-360	She was appalled at the number of children who appeared scarcely to understand that there was such a thing as school 
5660_101883_000040_000003	train-clean-360	This state of affairs she could not seem to remedy however in spite of her earnest efforts 
5660_101883_000040_000004	train-clean-360	The parents in many cases were indifferent and the children more so 
5660_101883_000040_000005	train-clean-360	Some of the children in the mills indeed were there solely according to the parents version because they could not get on in school 
5660_101883_000040_000006	train-clean-360	Conscious that there must be a school law Margaret went vigorously to work to find and enforce it 
5660_101883_000040_000007	train-clean-360	Then and not until then did she realize the seriousness of even this one phase of the problem she had undertaken to solve 
5660_101883_000041_000000	train-clean-360	There were other phases too 
none	none	It was not always poverty Margaret found that was responsible for setting the children to work 
5660_101883_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Sometimes it was ambition 
none	none	There were men who could not even speak the language of their adopted country intelligibly yet who had ever before them the one end and aim money 
5660_101883_000041_000004	train-clean-360	To this end and aim were sacrificed all the life and strength of whatever was theirs 
none	none	The minute such a man s boys and girls were big enough and tall enough to be sworn in he got the papers and set them to work and never after that as long as they could move one dragging little foot after the other did they cease to pour into the hungry treasury of his hand the pitiful dimes and pennies that represented all they knew of childhood CHAPTER XXXII The winter passed and the spring came The Mill House even to the most skeptical observer showed signs of being a success Even already a visible influence had radiated from its shining windows and orderly yard and the neighboring houses with their obvious attempt at slickin up reminded one of a small boy who has been told to wash his face for company was coming The classes boasted a larger attendance and the stomachs and the babies of many a family in the town were feeling the beneficial results of the lessons 
5660_101884_000002_000000	train-clean-360	To Margaret however the whole thing seemed hopelessly small there was so much to do so little done 
5660_101884_000002_000001	train-clean-360	She was still the little girl with the teaspoon and the bowl of sand and the chasm yawned as wide as ever 
5660_101884_000002_000002	train-clean-360	To tell the truth Margaret was tired discouraged and homesick 
5660_101884_000002_000003	train-clean-360	For months her strength time nerves and sympathies had been taxed to the utmost and now that there had come a breathing space when the intricate machinery of her scheme could run for a moment without her hand at the throttle she was left weak and nerveless 
5660_101884_000002_000004	train-clean-360	She was in fact perilously near a breakdown 
5660_101884_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Added to all this she was lonely 
none	none	More than she would own to herself she missed her friends her home life at Hilcrest and the tender care and sympathetic interest that had been lavished upon her for so many years 
5660_101884_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Here she was the head the strong tower of defense the one to whom everybody came with troubles perplexities and griefs 
5660_101884_000003_000003	train-clean-360	There was no human being to whom she could turn for comfort 
5660_101884_000003_000004	train-clean-360	They all looked to her 
5660_101884_000003_000005	train-clean-360	Even Bobby McGinnis when she saw him at all which was seldom treated her with a frigid deference that was inexpressibly annoying to her 
5660_101884_000004_000000	train-clean-360	From the Spencers she heard irregularly 
none	none	Earlier in the winter the letters had been more frequent nervously anxious epistles of some length from missus Merideth stilted notes half protesting half pleading from Ned and short but wonderfully sympathetic communications from Frank Later Frank had fallen very ill with a fever of some sort and missus Merideth and Ned had written only hurried little bulletins from the sick room 
5660_101884_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Then had come the good news that Frank was out of danger though still far too weak to undertake the long journey home 
5660_101884_000004_000004	train-clean-360	Their letters showed unmistakably their impatience at the delay and questioned her as to her health and welfare but could set no date for their return 
5660_101884_000004_000005	train-clean-360	Frank in particular was disturbed they said 
none	none	He had not planned to leave either herself or the mills so long it being his intention when he went away merely to take a short trip with his sister and brother and then hurry back to America alone 
5660_101884_000004_000007	train-clean-360	As for Frank himself he had not written her since his illness 
none	none	Margaret was thinking of all this and was feeling specially forlorn as she sat alone in the little sitting room at the Mill House one evening in early April She held a book before her but she was not reading and she looked up at once when Patty entered the room I m sorry ter trouble ye began Patty hesitatingly but Bobby McGinnis is here an wanted me ter ask ye 
5660_101884_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Margaret raised an imperious hand 
none	none	That s all right Patty she said so sharply that Patty opened wide her eyes but suppose you just ask Bobby McGinnis to come here to me and ask his question direct 
5660_101884_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I will see him now And Patty wondering vaguely what had come to her gentle eyed gentle voiced mistress as she insisted upon calling Margaret fled precipitately 
5660_101884_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Two minutes later Bobby McGinnis himself stood tall and straight just inside the door 
none	none	You sent for me he asked 
5660_101884_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Margaret sprang to her feet 
5660_101884_000011_000001	train-clean-360	All the pent loneliness of the past weeks and months burst forth in a stinging whip of retort 
5660_101884_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I sent for you She paused but the man did not speak and in a moment she went on hurriedly feverishly 
5660_101884_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 I always send for you if I see you at all and yet you know how hard I m trying to help these people and that you are the only one here that can help me 
5660_101884_000013_000000	train-clean-360	She paused again and again the man was silent 
5660_101884_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t you know what I m trying to do she asked 
5660_101884_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes The lips closed firmly over the single word 
5660_101884_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Didn t I ask you to help me 
5660_101884_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Didn t I appoint us a committee of two to do the work Her voice shook and her chin trembled like that of a grieved child 
5660_101884_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Again that strained almost harsh monosyllable 
5660_101884_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Margaret made an impatient gesture 
5660_101884_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Bobby McGinnis why don t you help me she demanded tearfully 
none	none	Why do you stand aloof and send to me 
5660_101884_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Why don t you come to me frankly and freely and tell me the best way to deal with these people 
none	none	There was no answer 
5660_101884_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The man had half turned his face so that only his profile showed clean cut and square chinned against the close shut door 
5660_101884_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t you know that I am alone here that I have no friends but you and Patty she went on tremulously 
none	none	Do you think it kind of you to let me struggle along alone like this 
5660_101884_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Sometimes it seems almost as if you were afraid 
5660_101884_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I am afraid cut in a voice shaken with emotion 
5660_101884_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Bobby breathed Margaret in surprised dismay falling back before the fire in the eyes that suddenly turned and flashed straight into hers Why Bobby 
5660_101884_000024_000000	train-clean-360	If the man heard he did not heed 
none	none	The bonds of his self control had snapped and the torrent of words came with a force that told how great had been the pressure 
5660_101884_000024_000002	train-clean-360	He had stepped forward as she fell back and his eyes still blazed into hers 
none	none	I am afraid I m afraid of myself he cried
5660_101884_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t dare to trust myself within sight of your dear eyes or within touch of your dear hands though all the while I m hungry for both 
5660_101884_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Perhaps I do let you send for me instead of coming of my own free will but I m never without the thought of you and the hope of catching somewhere a glimpse of even your dress 
none	none	Perhaps I do stand aloof but many s the night I ve walked the street outside watching the light at your window and many s the night I ve not gone home until dawn lest some harm come to the woman I loved so good God what am I saying he broke off hoarsely dropping his face into his hands and sinking into the chair behind him 
5660_101884_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Over by the table Margaret stood silent motionless her eyes on the bowed figure of the man before her 
5660_101884_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Gradually her confused senses were coming into something like order 
5660_101884_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Slowly her dazed thoughts were taking shape 
5660_101884_000027_000000	train-clean-360	It was her own fault 
5660_101884_000027_000001	train-clean-360	She had brought this thing upon herself 
5660_101884_000027_000002	train-clean-360	She should have seen have understood 
none	none	And now she had caused all this sorrow to this dear friend of her childhood the little boy who had befriended her when she was alone and hungry and lost 
5660_101884_000027_000004	train-clean-360	But after all why should he not love her 
5660_101884_000027_000005	train-clean-360	And why should she not love him 
5660_101884_000027_000006	train-clean-360	He was good and true and noble and for years he had loved her she remembered now their childish compact and she bitterly reproached herself for not thinking of it before it might have saved her this 
5660_101884_000027_000007	train-clean-360	Still did she want to save herself this 
5660_101884_000027_000008	train-clean-360	Was it not after all the very best thing that could have happened 
5660_101884_000027_000009	train-clean-360	Where and how could she do more good in the world than right here with this strong loving heart to help her 
none	none	She loved him too she was sure she did though she had never realized it before Doubtless that was half the cause of her present restlessness and unhappiness she had loved him all the time and did not know it Surely there was no one in the world who could so wisely help her in her dear work 
5660_101884_000027_000012	train-clean-360	Of course she loved him 
5660_101884_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Very softly Margaret crossed the room and touched the man s shoulder 
5660_101884_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Bobby I did not understand I did not know she said gently 
none	none	You
5660_101884_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 won t have to stay away 
none	none	any more Won t have to stay away The man was on his feet incredulous wonder in his eyes No 
5660_101884_000031_000001	train-clean-360	We we will do it together this work 
5660_101884_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 But you don t mean you can t mean McGinnis paused his breath suspended 
none	none	But I do she answered the quick red flying to her cheeks Then half laughing half crying she faltered And and I shouldn t think you d make me ask you
5660_101884_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Margaret choked the man as he fell on his knees and caught the girl s two hands to his lips 
none	none	Illustration MARGARET CROSSED THE ROOM AND TOUCHED THE MAN S SHOULDER CHAPTER XXXIII Ned Spencer returned alone to Hilcrest about the middle of April In spite of their able corps of managers the Spencers did not often leave the mills for so long a time without the occasional presence of one or the other of the firm though Ned frequently declared that the mills were like a clock that winds itself so admirably adjusted was the intricate machinery of their management It was not without some little embarrassment and effort that Ned sought out the Mill House immediately upon his return and called on Margaret I left Della and Frank to come more slowly he said after the greetings were over Frank poor chap isn t half strong yet but he was impatient that some one should be here For that matter I found things in such fine shape that I told them I was going away again We made more money when I wasn t round than when I was Margaret smiled but very faintly She understood only too well that behind all this lay the reasons why her urgent requests and pleas regarding some of the children had been so ignored in the office of Spencer Spencer during the last few months She almost said as much to Ned but she changed her mind and questioned him about Frank s health and their trip instead The call was not an unqualified success at least it was not a success so far as Margaret was concerned The young man was plainly displeased with the cane seated chair in which he sat and with his hostess s simple toilet The reproachful look had gone from his eyes it was true but in its place was one of annoyed disapproval that was scarcely less unpleasant to encounter There were long pauses in the conversation which neither participant seemed able to fill Once Margaret tried to tell her visitor of her work but he was so clearly unsympathetic that she cut it short and introduced another subject Of McGinnis she did not speak time enough for that when Frank Spencer should return and the engagement would have to be known She did tell him however of her plans to go to New York later in search of the twins I shall take Patty with me she explained and we shall make it a sort of vacation We both need the change and the well it won t be exactly a rest perhaps No I fear not Ned returned grimly I do hope Margaret that when Della gets home you ll take a real rest and change at Hilcrest Surely by that time you ll be ready to cut loose from all this sort of thing Margaret laughed merrily though her eyes were wistful We ll wait and see how rested New York makes me she said But Margaret you surely are going to come to Hilcrest then appealed Ned whether you need rest or not We ll see Ned we ll see was all she would say but this time her voice had lost its merriment Ned though he did not know it and though Margaret was loth to acknowledge it even to herself had touched upon a tender point She did long for Hilcrest its rest its quiet and the tender care that its people had always given her She longed for even one day in which she would have no problems to solve no misery to try to alleviate one day in which she might be the old care free Margaret She reproached herself bitterly for all this however and accused herself of being false to her work and her dear people but in the next breath she would deny the accusation and say that it was only because she was worn out and dead tired When the people do get home she said to Bobby McGinnis one day when the people do get home we ll take a rest you and I We ll go up to Hilcrest and just play for a day or two It will do us good To Hilcrest I cried the man Certainly why not returned Margaret quickly a little disturbed at the surprise in her lover s voice Surely you don t think that the man I m expecting to marry can stay away from Hilcrest do you N no of course not murmured McGinnis but his eyes were troubled and Margaret noticed that he did not speak again for some time It was this perhaps that set her own thoughts into a new channel When after all had she thought of them before together Bobby and Hilcrest It had always been Bobby and the work CHAPTER XXXIV It was on a particularly beautiful morning in June that Margaret and Patty started for New York so beautiful that Margaret declared it to be a good omen We ll find them you ll see she cried Little Maggie had been left at the Mill House with the teachers and for the first time for years Patty found herself care free and at liberty to enjoy herself to the full I hain t had sech a grand time since I was a little girl an went ter Mont Lawn she exulted as the train bore them swiftly toward their destination Even when Sam an me was married we didn t stop fur no play day We jest worked An say did ye see how grand Sam was doin now she broke off jubilantly He wa n t drunk once last week Thar couldn t no one made him do it only you Seems how I never could thank ye fur all you ve done she added wistfully But you do thank me Patty every day of your life contended Margaret brightly You thank me by just helping me as you do at the Mill House Pooh As if that was anything compared ter what you does fur me scoffed Patty Sides don t I git pay money fur bein matron In New York Margaret went immediately to a quiet but conveniently located hotel where the rooms she had engaged were waiting for them To Patty even this unpretentious hostelry was palatial as were the service and the dinner in the great dining room that evening I don t wonder folks likes ter be rich she observed after a silent survey of the merry well dressed throng about her I s pose mebbe Mis Magoon d say this was worse than them autymobiles she hates ter see so an it don t look quite fair does it I wonder now do ye s pose any one of em ever thought of divvyin up A dreamy far away look came into the blue eyes opposite Perhaps who knows murmured Margaret Still they haven t ever crossed the line perhaps so they don t know Huh Margaret smiled Nothing Patty I only meant that they hadn t lived in missus Whalen s kitchen and kept all their wealth in a tin cup No they hain t said Patty her eyes on the sparkle of a diamond on the plump white finger of a woman near by Margaret and Patty lost no time the next morning in beginning their search for the twins There was very little after all that Patty knew of her sisters since she had last seen them but that little was treasured and analyzed and carefully weighed The twins were at the Whalens when last heard from The Whalens therefore must be the first ones to be looked up and to the Whalens as represented by the address in Clarabella s last letter the searchers proposed immediately to go An ter think that you was bein looked fur jest like this once remarked Patty as they turned the corner of a narrow dingy street Poor dear mother how she must have suffered murmured Margaret her eyes shrinking from the squalor and misery all about them I think perhaps never until now did I realize it quite she added softly her eyes moist with tears Ye see the Whalens ain t whar they was when you left em in that nice place you got fur em began Patty after a moment consulting the paper in her hand They couldn t keep that course but Clarabella wrote they wa n t more n one or two blocks from the Alley The Alley Oh how I should love to see the Alley cried Margaret And we will Patty we ll go there surely before we return home But first we ll find the Whalens and the twins The Whalens and the twins however did not prove to be so easily found They certainly were not at the address given in Clarabella s letter The place was occupied by strangers people who had never heard the name of Whalen It took two days of time and innumerable questions to find anybody in the neighborhood in fact who had heard the name of Whalen but at last patience and diligence were rewarded and early on the third morning Margaret and Patty started out to follow up a clew given them by a woman who had known the Whalens and who remembered them well Even this however promising as it was did not lead to immediate success and it was not until the afternoon of the fifth day that Margaret and Patty toiled up four flights of stairs and found a little bent old woman sitting in a green satin damask chair that neither Margaret nor Patty could fail to recognize Do I remember Maggie Mag of the Alley quavered the old woman excitedly in response to Margaret s questions Sure an of course I do She was the tirror of the hull place till she was that turned about that she got ter be a blissed angel straight from Hiven As if I could iver forgit th swate face of Mag of the Alley Oh but you have laughed Margaret for I myself am she Go way wid ye an ye ain t that now cried the old woman peering over and through her glasses and finally snatching them off altogether But I am And this is missus Durgin who used to be Patty Murphy Don t you remember Patty Murphy missus Whalen fell back in her chair Saints of Hiven an is it the both of yez all growed up ter be sich foine young ladies as ye be Who d a thought it It is and we ve come to you for help rejoined Margaret Do you remember Patty Murphy s sisters the twins We are trying to find them and we thought perhaps you could tell us where they are missus Whalen shook her head I knows em but I don t know whar they be now But you did know interposed Patty You must a known four five years ago for my little Maggie was jest born when the twins come ter New York an found ye They wrote how they was livin with ye The old woman nodded her head I know she said I know We was livin over by the Alley But they didn t stay My old man he died an we broke up Sure an I m nothin but a wanderer on the face of the airth iver since an I m grown old before my time I am But missus Whalen just think just remember urged Margaret Where did they go Surely you can tell that Again missus Whalen shook her head Mike died an Tom an Mary they got married an Jamie sure an he got his leg broke an they tuk him ter the horspital bad cess to em An twas all that upsettin that I didn t know nothin what did happen I seen em then I didn t seen em an that s all thar was to it An it s the truth I m a tellin yez It was with heavy hearts that Margaret and Patty left the little attic room half an hour later They had no clew now upon which to work and the accomplishment of their purpose seemed almost impossible In the little attic room behind them however they left nothing but rejoicing Margaret s gifts had been liberal and her promises for the future even more than that The little bent old woman could look straight ahead now to days when there would be no bare cupboards and empty coal scuttles to fill her soul with apprehension and her body with discomfort Back to the hotel went Margaret and Patty for a much needed night s rest hoping that daylight and the morning sun would urge them to new efforts and give them fresh courage in spite of the unpromising outlook Nor were their hopes unfulfilled The morning sun did bring fresh courage and determined to make a fresh start they turned their steps to the Alley The Alley never forgot that visit nor the days that immediately followed it There were men and women who remembered Mag of the Alley and Patty Murphy but there were more who did not There were none however that did not know who they were before the week was out and that had not heard the story of Margaret s own childhood s experience in that same Alley years before As for the Alley it did not know itself It had heard to be sure of Christmas It had even experienced it in a way with tickets for a Salvation Army tree or dinner But all this occurred in the winter when it was cold and snowy and it was spring now It was not Christmas of course and yet The entire Alley from one end to the other was flooded with good things to eat and with innumerable things to wear There was not a child that did not boast a new toy nor a sick room that did not display fruit and flowers Even the cats and the dogs stopped their fighting and lay full stomached and content in the sun No wonder the Alley rubbed its eyes and failed to recognize its own face The Alley received but did not give Nowhere was there a trace of the twins and after a two weeks search and a fruitless following of clews that were no clews at all even Margaret was forced sorrowfully to acknowledge defeat On the evening before the day they had set to go home Patty timidly said I hadn t oughter ask it after all you ve done but do ye s pose could we mebbe jest jest go ter Mont Lawn fur a minute jest ter look at it Mont Lawn Yes We was so happy thar once went on Patty earnestly You an me an the twins I hain t never forgot it nor what they learnt me thar All the good thar was in me till you come was from them I thought mebbe if I could jest see it once twould make it easier bout the other that we can t find the twins ye know See it Of course we ll see it cried Margaret I should love to go there myself You know I owe it everything too It was not for home therefore that Margaret and Patty left New York the next morning but for Mont Lawn The trip to Tarrytown and across the Hudson was soon over as was the short drive in the fresh morning air Almost before the two travelers realized where they were the beautiful buildings and grounds of Mont Lawn appeared before their eyes Margaret had only to tell that they too had once been happy little guests in the years gone by to make their welcome a doubly cordial one and it was not long before they were wandering about the place with eyes and ears alert for familiar sights and sounds In the big pavilion where their own hungry little stomachs had been filled were now numerous other little stomachs experiencing the same delight and in the long dormitories where their own tired little bodies had rested were the same long rows of little white beds waiting for other weary little limbs and heads Margaret s eyes grew moist here as she thought of that dear mother who years before had placed over just such a little bed the pictured face of her lost little girl and of how that same little girl had seen it and had thus found the dear mother arms waiting for her It was just as Margaret and Patty turned to leave the grounds that they saw a young woman not twenty feet away leading two small children Patty gave a sudden cry The next moment she bounded forward and caught the young woman by the shoulders Clarabella Clarabella I jest know you re Clarabella Murphy It was a joyous half hour then indeed a half hour of tears laughter questions and ejaculations At the end of it Margaret and Patty hurried away with a bit of paper on which was the address of a certain city missionary All the way back to New York they talked it over the story of the twins life during all those years of how after months of hardship they had found the good city missionary and of how she had helped them and they had helped her until now Clarabella had gone to Mont Lawn as one of the caretakers for the summer and Arabella had remained behind at the missionary s home to help what she could in the missionary s daily work And we ll go now and see Arabella cried Patty as they stepped from the train at New York An ain t it jest wonderful wonderful ter think that we are a goin ter see Arabella CHAPTER XXXV When Margaret and Patty went home three days later they were accompanied by a beautiful girl whose dark eyes carried a peculiar appeal in their velvety depths Some of the passengers in the car that day wondered at such an expression on the face of one so young and so lovely but when the girl rose and moved down the aisle they wondered no longer She was lame and in every movement her slender form seemed to shrink from curious eyes Margaret had found her little friend far from strong Arabella had been taxing her strength to the utmost assisting the missionary through the day and attending night school in the evening She had worked and studied hard and the strain was telling on her already frail constitution All this Margaret saw at once and declared that Arabella must come home with them to the Mill House But I couldn t the girl had objected I couldn t be a burden to you and Patty Oh but you won t be Margaret had returned promptly You re going to be a help to Patty and me The Mill House needs you The work is increasing and we haven t teachers enough Oh then I ll come the girl had sighed contentedly nor did she know that before night Margaret had found and engaged still another teacher lest Arabella when she joined the Mill House family should find too much to do Almost the first piece of news that Margaret heard upon her return was that the family were back at Hilcrest and that missus Merideth had already driven down to the Mill House three times in hopes to get tidings of Margaret s coming When missus Merideth drove down the fourth time Margaret herself was there and went back with her to Hilcrest My dear child how dreadfully you look missus Merideth had exclaimed You are worn out and no wonder You must come straight home with me and rest And because missus Merideth had been tactful enough to say rest and not stay Margaret had gone willingly and thankfully She was tired and she did need a rest but she was not a little concerned to find how really hungry she was for the cool quiet of the west veranda and how eagerly she listened to the low sweet voices of her friends in pleasant chat it had been so long since she had heard low sweet voices in pleasant chat The thin cheeks and hollow eyes of Frank Spencer shocked her greatly She had not supposed a few short months could so change a strong man into the mere shadow of his former self There was a look too in his eyes that stirred her curiously and true to her usual sympathetic response to trouble wherever she found it she set herself now to the task of driving that look away To this end in spite of her own weariness she played and sang and devoted herself untiringly to the amusement of the man who was not yet strong enough to go down to the mills It had been planned that immediately upon Frank Spencer s return McGinnis should go to him with the story of his love for Margaret This plan was abandoned however when Margaret saw how weak and ill her guardian was We must wait until he is better she said to Bobby when he called as had been arranged on the second evening after her arrival He may not be quite pleased at first you know she went on frankly and I don t want to cause him sorrow just now Then twill be better if I don t come up again just yet stammered Bobby miserably his longing eyes on her face Yes I ll let you know when he s well enough to see you returned Margaret and she smiled brightly Nor did it occur to her that for a young woman who has but recently become engaged she was accepting with extraordinary equanimity the fact that she should not see her lover again for some days It did occur to Bobby however and his eyes were troubled They were still troubled as he sat up far into the night thinking in the shabby little room he called home One by one the days passed At Hilcrest Margaret was fast regaining her old buoyant health and was beginning to talk of taking up her work again much to the distress of the family Frank Spencer too was better though in spite of Margaret s earnest efforts the curiously somber look was not gone from his eyes It even seemed deeper and more noticeable than ever sometimes Margaret thought Never before had Margaret known quite so well the man who had so carefully guarded her since childhood She suddenly began to appreciate what he had done for her all those years She realized too with almost the shock of a surprise how young he had been when the charge was intrusted to him and what it must have meant to a youth of twenty to have a strange hysterical little girl ten years old thrust upon him so unceremoniously She realized it all the more fully now that the pleasant intercourse of the last two weeks had seemed to strip from him the ten years difference in their ages They were good friends comrades Day after day they had read and sung and walked together and she knew that he had exerted every effort to make her happy More keenly than ever now she regretted that she must bring sorrow to him in acknowledging her engagement to Bobby She knew very well that he would not approve of the marriage Had he not already pleaded with her to stay there at Hilcrest as Ned s wife And had he not always disapproved of her having much to say to McGinnis It was hard indeed in the face of all this to tell him But it must be done In two days now he was going back to the mills There was really no excuse for any further delay She must send for Bobby There was a thunder storm on the night Bobby McGinnis came to Hilcrest The young man arrived just before the storm broke and was ushered at once by Margaret herself to the little den where Frank Spencer sat alone missus Merideth had gone to bed with a headache and Ned was out of town so Margaret had the house to herself For a time she wandered aimlessly about the living room and the great drawing room then she sat down in a shadowy corner which commanded a view of the library and of the door of the den She shivered at every clap of thunder and sent a furtive glance toward that close shut door wondering if the storm outside were typical of the one which even then might be breaking over Bobby s head It was very late when McGinnis came out of the den and closed the door behind him so late that he could stop for only a few words with the girl who hurried across the room to meet him His face was gray white and his whole appearance showed the strain he had been under for the last two hours mister Spencer was very kind he said huskily in response to the question in Margaret s eyes At first of course he but never mind that part He has been very kind but I I can t tell you now all that he said to me Perhaps some other time McGinnis was plainly very much moved His words came brokenly and with long pauses For some time after her lover had gone Margaret waited for Frank Spencer to come out and speak to her But the door of the den remained fast shut and she finally went up stairs without seeing him The next few days at Hilcrest were hard for all concerned Before Margaret had come down stairs on the morning following McGinnis s call Frank Spencer had told his sister of the engagement and after the first shock of the news was over he had said constrainedly and with averted eyes There is just one thing for us to do Della or rather for us not to do We must not drive Margaret away from us She has full right to marry the man she loves of course and if if we are too censorious it will result only in our losing her altogether It isn t what we want to do but what we must do We must accept him or lose her I I m afraid I forgot myself at first last night went on Frank hurriedly and said some pretty harsh things I didn t realize what I was saying until I saw the look on his face McGinnis is a straightforward manly young fellow we must not forget that Della But think of his po position moaned missus Merideth Frank winced I know he said But we must do our best to remedy that I shall advance him and increase his pay at once of course and eventually he will become one of the firm if Margaret marries him missus Merideth burst into tears How can you take it so calmly Frank she sobbed You don t seem to care at all Frank Spencer s lips parted then closed again Perhaps it was just as well after all that she should not know just how much he did care It may not be myself I m thinking of he said at last quietly I want Margaret happy And he turned away Margaret was not happy however as the days passed In spite of everybody s effort to act as if everything was as usual nobody succeeded in doing it and at last Margaret announced her determination to go back to the Mill House She agreed however to call it a visit for missus Merideth had cried tragically But Margaret dear if we are going to lose you altogether by and by surely you will give us all your time now that you can CHAPTER XXXVI Bobby McGinnis wondered sometimes that summer why he was not happier Viewed from the standpoint of an outsider he surely had enough to make any man happy He was young strong and in a position of trust and profit He was moreover engaged to the girl he loved and that girl was everything that was good and beautiful and he saw her almost every day All this Bobby knew and still he wondered He saw a good deal of Margaret these days Their engagement had come to be an accepted fact and the first flurry of surprise and comment had passed The Mill House with Patty in charge was steadily progressing Margaret had taken up her work again with fresh zest but true to her promise to missus Merideth she spent many a day and sometimes two or three days at Hilcrest All this however did not interfere with Bobby s seeing her for he too went to Hilcrest in accordance with Margaret s express wishes But Bobby Margaret had said in response to his troubled remonstrances are you not going to be my husband Of course you are Then you must come to meet my friends And Bobby went Bobby McGinnis found himself in a new position then He was mister Robert McGinnis the accepted suitor of Miss Margaret Kendall and as such he was introduced to Margaret s friends It was just here perhaps that misery began for Bobby He was not more at ease in his new well fitting evening clothes than he would have been in the garb of Sing Sing nor did he feel less conspicuous among the gay throng about Margaret s chair than he would if he had indeed worn the prison stripes As Bobby saw it he was in prison beyond the four walls of which lay a world he had never seen a world of beautiful music and fine pictures a world of great books and famous men a world of travel ease and pleasure He could but dimly guess the meaning of half of what was said and the conversation might as well have been conducted in a foreign language so far as there being any possibility of his participating in it Big tall and silent he stood as if apart And because he was apart he watched He began to understand then why he was unhappy yet he was not watching himself he was watching Margaret She knew this world this world that was outside his prison walls and she was at home in it There was a light in her eye that he had never brought there though he had seen it sometimes when she had been particularly interested in her work at the Mill House As he watched her now he caught the quick play of color on her cheeks and heard the ring of enthusiasm in her voice One subject after another was introduced and for each she had question comment or jest Not once did she appeal to him But why should she he asked himself bitterly They those others near her knew this world He did not know it Sometimes the mills were spoken of and she was questioned about her work Then indeed she turned to him but he was not the only one to whom she turned she turned quite as frequently to the man who was seldom far away from the sound of her voice when she was at Hilcrest Frank Spencer McGinnis had a new object for his brooding eyes then and it was not long before he saw that it was to this same Frank Spencer that Margaret turned when subjects other than the mills were under discussion There seemed to be times indeed when she apparently heard only his voice and recognized only his presence so intimate was the sympathy between them McGinnis saw something else too he saw the look in Frank Spencer s eyes and after that he did not question again the cause of his own misery Sometimes McGinnis would forget all this or would call it the silly fears of a jealous man who sees nothing but adoration in every eye turned upon his love Such times were always when Margaret was back at the Mill House and when it seemed as if she too were inside his prison walls with him leaving that hated unknown world shut forever out Then would come Hilcrest and the reaction She does not love me he would moan night after night as he tossed in sleepless misery She does not love me but she does not know it yet She is everything that is good and beautiful and kind but I never never can make her happy I might have known I might have known CHAPTER XXXVII The Spencers remained at Hilcrest nearly all summer with only a short trip or two on the part of missus Merideth and Ned The place was particularly cool and delightful in summer and this season it was more so than usual House parties had always been popular at Hilcrest and never more so than now So popular indeed were they that Margaret suspected them to be sometimes merely an excuse to gain her own presence at Hilcrest There were no guests however on the Monday night that the mills caught fire Even Margaret was down at the Mill House missus Merideth always a light sleeper was roused by the first shrill blast of the whistle From her bed she could see the lurid glow of the sky and with a cry of terror she ran to the window The next moment she threw a bath robe over her shoulders and ran to Frank Spencer s room across the hall Frank it s the mills they re all afire she called frenziedly Oh Frank it s awful From behind the closed door came a sudden stir and the sound of bare feet striking the floor then Frank s voice I ll be out at once And Della see if Ned s awake and if you can call up Peters please We shall want a motor car missus Merideth wrung her hands Frank Frank I can t have you go I can t have you go she moaned hysterically yet all the while she was hurrying to the telephone that would give the alarm and order the car that would take him In five minutes the house was astir from end to end Lights flashed here and there and terrified voices and hurried footsteps echoed through the great halls Down in the town the whistles were still shrieking their frenzied summons and up in the sky the lurid glow of the flames was deepening and spreading Then came a hurried word from McGinnis over the telephone The fire had caught in one of the buildings that had been closed for repairs which accounted for the great headway it had gained before it was discovered There was a strong east wind and the fire was rapidly spreading and had already attacked the next building on the west The operatives were in a panic There was danger of great loss of life and all help possible was needed missus Merideth who heard could only wring her hands and moan again I can t have them go I can t have them go Yet five minutes later she sent them off both Frank and Ned with a fervid God keep you ringing in their ears Down in the Mill House all was commotion Margaret was everywhere alert capable and untiring We can do the most good by staying right here and keeping the house open she said We are so near that they may want to bring some of the children here if there should be any that are hurt or overcome At all events we ll have everything ready and we ll have hot coffee for the men Almost immediately they came those limp unconscious little forms borne in strong tender arms Some of the children had only fainted others had been crushed and bruised in the mad rush for safety Before an hour had passed the Mill House looked like a hospital and every available helper was pressed into service as a nurse Toward morning a small boy breathless and white faced rushed into the main hall They re in there they re in there they hain t come out yet an the roof has caved in he panted They ll be burned up they ll be burned up Margaret sprang forward But I thought they were all out she cried We heard that every one was out Who s in there What do you mean The boy gasped for breath The boss Bobby McGinnis an mister Spencer mister Frank Spencer They went With a sharp cry Margaret turned and ran through the open door to the street nor did she slacken her pace until she had reached the surging crowds at the mills From a score of trembling lips she learned the story told in sobbing broken scraps of words Frank and Ned Spencer together with McGinnis had worked side by side with the firemen in clearing the mills of the frightened men women and children It was not until after word came that all were out that Frank Spencer and McGinnis were reported to be still in the burning building Five minutes later there came a terrific crash and a roar of flames as a portion of the walls and the roof caved in Since then neither one of the two men had been seen There was more much more tales of brave rescues and stories of children restored to frantically outstretched arms but Margaret did not hear With terror glazed eyes and numbed senses she shrank back from the crowd clasping and unclasping her hands in helpless misery There Ned found her Margaret you and here No no you must not You can do no good Let me take you home do dear he implored Margaret shook her head Ned he can t be dead not dead she moaned Ned s face grew white For an instant he was almost angry with the girl who had so plainly shown that to her there was but one man that had gone down into the shadow of death Then his eyes softened After all it was natural perhaps that she should think of her lover and of him only in this first agonized moment Margaret dear come home he pleaded Ned he isn t dead not dead moaned the girl again Why don t you tell me he isn t dead Ned shuddered His eyes turned toward the blackened blazing pile before him as if a man could be there and live Margaret followed his gaze and understood But he he may not have gone in again Ned He may not have gone in again she cried feverishly He he is out here somewhere We will find him Come Come we must find him And she tugged at his arm Ned caught at the straw No no not you you could do nothing here but I ll go he said And I ll promise to bring you the very first word that I can Come now you ll go home surely Margaret gazed about her Everywhere were men confusion smoke and water The fire was clearly under control and the flames were fast hissing into silence Over in the east the sun was rising A new day had begun a day of She suddenly remembered the sufferers back at the Mill House She turned about sharply Yes I ll go she choked I ll go back to the Mill House I can do something there and I can t do anything here But Ned you will bring me word soon won t you soon And before Ned could attempt to follow her she had turned and was lost in the crowd CHAPTER XXXVIII Tuesday was a day that was not soon forgotten at the mills Scarcely waiting for the smoking timbers to cool swarms of workmen attacked the ruins and attempted to clear their way to the point where Spencer and McGinnis had last been seen Fortunately that portion of the building had only been touched by the fire and it was evident that the floors and roof had been carried down with the fall of those nearest to it For this reason there was the more hope of finding the bodies unharmed by fire perhaps even of finding a spark of life in one or both of them This last hope however was sorrowfully abandoned when hour after hour passed with no sign of the missing men All night they worked by the aid of numerous electric lights hastily placed to illuminate the scene and when Wednesday morning came a new shift of workers took up the task that had come to be now merely a search for the dead So convinced was every one of this that the men gazed with blanched faces into each other s eyes when there came a distinct rapping on a projecting timber near them In the dazed silence that followed a faint cry came from beneath their feet With a shout and a ringing cheer the men fell to work it was no ghost but a living human voice that had called They labored more cautiously now lest their very zeal for rescue should bring defeat in the shape of falling brick or timber Ned Spencer who had not left the mills all night heard the cheer and hurried forward It was he who when the men paused again called Frank are you there Yes Ned The voice was faint but distinctly audible And McGinnis There was a moment s hesitation The listeners held their breath perhaps after all they had been dreaming and there was no voice Then it came again Yes He s lying beside me but he s unconscious or dead The last word was almost inaudible so faint was it but the tightening of Ned s lips showed that he had heard it none the less In a moment he stooped again Keep up your courage old fellow We ll have you out of that soon Then he stepped aside and gave the signal for the men to fall to work again Rapidly eagerly but oh so cautiously they worked At the next pause the voice was nearer so near that they could drop through a small hole a rubber tube four feet long lowering it until Spencer could put his mouth to it Through this tube he was given a stimulant and a cup of strong coffee They learned then a little more of what had happened The two men were on the fourth floor when the crash came They had been swept down and had been caught between the timbers in such a way that as they lay where they had been flung a roof three feet above their heads supported the crushing weight above Spencer could remember nothing after the first crash until he regained consciousness long afterward and heard the workmen far above him It was then that he had tapped his signal on the projecting timber He had tapped three times before he had been heard At first it was dark he said and he could not see but he knew that McGinnis was near him McGinnis had spoken once then had apparently dropped into unconsciousness At all events he had said nothing since Still Spencer did not think he was dead Once more the rescuers fell to work and it was then that Ned Spencer hurried away to send a message of hope and comfort to missus Merideth who had long since left the great house on the hill and had come down to the Mill House to be with Margaret To Margaret Ned wrote the one word Come and as he expected he had not long to wait You have found him cried the girl hurrying toward him Ned he isn t dead Ned smiled and put out a steadying hand We hope not and we think not But he is unconscious Margaret Don t get your hopes too high I had to send for you I thought you ought to know what we know But where is he Have you seen him Ned shook his head No but Frank says Frank But you said Frank was unconscious No no they aren t both unconscious it is only McGinnis It is Frank who told us the story He why Margaret But Margaret was gone and as Ned watched her flying form disappear toward the Mill House he wondered if after all the last hours of horror had turned her brain In no other way could he account for her words and for this most extraordinary flight just at the critical moment when she might learn the best and the worst of what had come to her lover To Ned it seemed that the girl must be mad He could not know that in Margaret s little room at the Mill House some minutes later a girl went down on her knees and sobbed To think that twasn t Bobby at all that I was thinking of twasn t Bobby at all Twas never Bobby that had my first thought Twas always Even to herself Margaret would not say the name and only her sobs finished the sentence CHAPTER XXXIX Robert McGinnis was not dead when he was tenderly lifted from his box like prison but he was still unconscious In spite of their marvelous escape from death both he and his employer were suffering from breaks and bruises that would call for the best of care and nursing for weeks to come and it seemed best for all concerned that this care and nursing should be given at the Mill House A removal to Hilcrest in their present condition would not be wise the physicians said and the little town hospital was already overflowing with patients There was really no place but the Mill House and to the Mill House they were carried At the Mill House everything possible was done for their comfort Two large airy rooms were given up to their use and the entire household was devoted to their service The children that had been brought there the night of the fire were gone and there was no one with whom the two injured men must share the care and attention that were lavished upon them Trained nurses were promptly sent for and installed in their positions Aside from these soft stepping whitecapped women Margaret and the little lame Arabella were the most frequently seen in the sickrooms We re the ornamental part Margaret would say brightly We do the reading and the singing and the amusing Arabella was a born nurse so both the patients said There was something peculiarly soothing in the soft touch of her hands and in the low tones of her voice She was happy in it too Her eyes almost lost their wistful look sometimes so absorbed would she be in her self appointed task As for Margaret Margaret was a born nurse too and both the patients said that though one of the patients it is true complained sometimes that she did not give him half a chance to know it Margaret certainly did not divide her time evenly Any one could see that No one however not even Frank Spencer himself could really question the propriety of her devoting herself more exclusively to young McGinnis the man she had promised to marry Margaret was particularly bright and cheerful these days but to a close observer there was something a little forced about it No one seemed to notice it however except McGinnis He watched her sometimes with somber eyes but even he said nothing until the day before he was to leave the Mill House Then he spoke Margaret he began gently there is something I want to say to you I am going to be quite frank with you and I want you to be so with me Will you Why of of course faltered Margaret nervously her eyes carefully avoiding his steady gaze Then hopefully But Bobby really I don t think you should talk to day not not about anything that that needs that tone of voice Let s let s read something Bobby shook his head decidedly No I m quite strong enough to talk to day In fact I ve wanted to say this for some time but I ve waited until to day so I could say it Margaret you you don t love me any longer Oh Bobby Why Bobby There was dismayed distress in Margaret s voice When one has for some weeks been trying to lash one s self into a certain state of mind and heart for the express sake of some other one it is distressing to have that other one so abruptly and so positively show that one s labor has been worse than useless You do not Margaret you know that you do not Why Bobby what what makes you say such a dreadful thing cried the girl reaching blindly out for some support that would not fail As if I didn t know my own mind Bobby was silent When he spoke again his voice shook a little I will tell you what makes me say it For some time I ve suspected it that you did not love me but after the fire I I knew it You knew it Yes When a girl loves a man and that man has come back almost from the dead she goes to him first if she loves him When Frank Spencer and I were brought into the hall down stairs that Wednesday morning the jar or something brought back my senses for a moment just long enough for me to hear your cry of Frank and to see you hurry to his side Margaret caught her breath sharply Her face grew white But Bobby you you were unconscious I supposed she stammered faintly I didn t think you could answer me if if I did go to you But you did not come to see The words were spoken gently tenderly sorrowfully Margaret gave a low cry and covered her face with her hands A look that was almost relief came to the man s face There he sighed Now you admit it We can talk sensibly and reasonably Margaret why have you tried to keep it up all these weeks when it was just killing you I wanted to make you happy came miserably from behind the hands And did you think I could be made happy that way by your wretchedness There was no answer I ve seen it coming for a long time he went on gently and I did not blame you I could never have made you happy and I knew it almost from the first I wasn t happy either because I couldn t make you so Perhaps now I I shall be happier who knows he asked with a wan little smile Margaret sobbed It was so like Bobby to belittle his own grief just to make it easier for her You see it was for only the work that you cared for me resumed the man after a minute You loved that and you thought you loved me But it was only the work all the time dear I understand that now You see I watched you and I watched him Him Margaret s hands were down and she was looking at Bobby with startled eyes Yes I used to think he loved you even then but after the fire and I heard your cry of Frank Margaret sprang to her feet Bobby Bobby you don t know what you are saying she cried agitatedly mister Spencer does not love me and he never loved me Why Bobby he couldn t He even pleaded with me to marry another man He pleaded with you Bobby s eyes were puzzled Yes Now Bobby surely you understand that he doesn t love me Surely you must see Bobby threw a quick look into the flushed quivering face then hastily turned his eyes away Yes I see he said almost savagely And he did see more than he wanted to But he did not understand how a man could have the love of Margaret Kendall and not want it was beyond the wildest flights of his fancy CHAPTER XL 
5660_101892_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Frank Spencer had already left the Mill House and gone to Hilcrest when McGinnis was well enough to go back to his place in the mills 
none	none	The mills in spite of the loss of the two buildings which were being rapidly rebuilt were running full time and needed him greatly particularly as the senior member of the firm had not entirely regained his old health and strength 
5660_101892_000006_000000	train-clean-360	For some time after McGinnis went away Margaret remained at the Mill House but she was restless and unhappy in the position in which she found herself 
5660_101892_000006_000001	train-clean-360	McGinnis taught an evening class at the Mill House and she knew that it could not be easy for him to see her so frequently now that the engagement was broken 
none	none	Margaret blamed herself bitterly not for the broken engagement but for the fact that there had ever been any engagement at all She told herself that she ought to have known that the feeling she had for Bobby was not love and she asked herself scornfully what she thought of a young woman who could give that love all unsought to a man who was so very indifferent as to beg her favor for another 
5660_101892_000006_000004	train-clean-360	Those long hours of misery when the mills burned had opened Margaret s eyes and now that her eyes were opened she was frightened and ashamed 
none	none	It seemed to Margaret as she thought of it that there was no way for her to turn but to leave both the Mill House and Hilcrest for a time Bobby would be happier with her away and the Mill House did not need her Clarabella had come from New York and had materially strengthened the teaching force 
5660_101892_000007_000001	train-clean-360	As for Hilcrest she certainly would not stay at Hilcrest anyway now 
5660_101892_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Later when she had come to her senses perhaps but not now 
5660_101892_000008_000000	train-clean-360	It did not take much persuasion on the part of Margaret to convince missus Merideth that a winter abroad would be delightful just they two together 
5660_101892_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The news of Margaret s broken engagement had been received at Hilcrest with a joyous relief that was nevertheless carefully subdued in the presence of Margaret herself but missus Merideth could not conceal her joy that she was to take Margaret away from the whole unfortunate affair as she expressed it to her brothers 
5660_101892_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Frank Spencer however was not so pleased at the proposed absence 
5660_101892_000008_000003	train-clean-360	He could see no reason for Margaret s going and one evening when they were alone together in the library he spoke of it 
5660_101892_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 But Margaret I don t see why you must go he protested 
5660_101892_000010_000000	train-clean-360	For a moment the girl was silent then she turned swiftly and faced him 
5660_101892_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Frank Bobby McGinnis was my good friend 
5660_101892_000011_000001	train-clean-360	From the time when I was a tiny little girl he has been that 
5660_101892_000011_000002	train-clean-360	He is good and true and noble but I have brought him nothing but sorrow 
5660_101892_000011_000003	train-clean-360	He will be happier now if I am quite out of his sight at present 
5660_101892_000011_000004	train-clean-360	I am going away 
5660_101892_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Frank Spencer stirred uneasily 
5660_101892_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 But you will be away from him if you are here he suggested 
none	none	Oh but if I m here I shall be there contested Margaret with a haste that refused to consider logic then as she saw the whimsical smile come into the man s eyes she added brokenly Besides I want to get away quite away from my work 
5660_101892_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Spencer grew sober instantly 
none	none	The whimsical look in his eyes gave place to one of tender sympathy
5660_101892_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 You poor child of course you do and no wonder 
none	none	You are worn out with the strain Margaret 
5660_101892_000017_000000	train-clean-360	She raised a protesting hand 
5660_101892_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 No no you do not understand 
5660_101892_000018_000001	train-clean-360	I I have made a failure of it 
5660_101892_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 a failure of it 
none	none	A failure of it Yes I want to get away to look at it from a distance and see if I can t find out what is the trouble with it just as as artists do you know when they paint a picture There was a feverishness in Margaret s manner and a tremulousness in her voice that came perilously near to tears But my dear Margaret argued the man there s nothing the matter with it 
5660_101892_000021_000001	train-clean-360	It s no failure at all 
5660_101892_000021_000002	train-clean-360	You ve done wonders down there at the Mill House 
5660_101892_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Margaret shook her head slowly 
5660_101892_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 It s so little so very little compared to what ought to be done she sighed 
5660_101892_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 The Mill House is good and does good I acknowledge but it s so puny after all 
5660_101892_000023_000002	train-clean-360	It s like a tiny little oasis in a huge desert of poverty and distress 
5660_101892_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 But what what more could you do ventured the man 
5660_101892_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Margaret rose and moved restlessly around the room 
none	none	I don t know she said at last
5660_101892_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 That s what I mean to find out She stopped suddenly facing him 
none	none	Don t you see 
5660_101892_000026_000003	train-clean-360	I touch only the surface The great cause behind things I never reach 
5660_101892_000026_000004	train-clean-360	Sometimes it seems as if it were like that old picture where was it 
5660_101892_000026_000005	train-clean-360	in Pilgrim s Progress of the fire 
5660_101892_000026_000006	train-clean-360	On one side is the man trying to put it out on the other is the evil one pouring on oil 
5660_101892_000026_000007	train-clean-360	My two hands are the two men 
5660_101892_000026_000008	train-clean-360	With one I feed a hungry child or nurse a sick woman with the other I make more children hungry and more women sick 
5660_101892_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Margaret are you mad 
5660_101892_000027_000001	train-clean-360	What can you mean 
5660_101892_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Merely this 
5660_101892_000028_000001	train-clean-360	It is very simple after all 
5660_101892_000028_000002	train-clean-360	With one hand I relieve the children s suffering with the other I take dividends from the very mills that make the children suffer 
none	none	A long time ago I wanted to divvy up with Patty and Bobby and the rest I have even thought lately that I would still like to divvy up and well you can see the way I am divvying up now with my people down there at the mills And her voice rang with self scorn 
5660_101892_000029_000000	train-clean-360	The man frowned 
5660_101892_000029_000001	train-clean-360	He too got to his feet and walked nervously up and down the room 
5660_101892_000029_000002	train-clean-360	When he came back the girl had sat down again 
5660_101892_000029_000003	train-clean-360	Her elbows were on the table and her linked fingers were shielding her eyes Involuntarily the man reached his hand toward the bowed head 
none	none	But he drew it back before it had touched a thread of the bronze gold hair
5660_101892_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I do see Margaret he began gently and you are right 
none	none	It is at the mills themselves that the first start must be made the first beginning of the divvying up Perhaps if there were some one to show us he paused then went on unsteadily I suppose it s useless to say again what I said that day months ago that if you stayed here and showed him the man who loves you the better way Margaret started 
5660_101892_000031_000001	train-clean-360	She gave a nervous little laugh and picked up a bit of paper from the floor 
5660_101892_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course it is useless she retorted in what she hoped was a merry voice 
5660_101892_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 And he doesn t even love me now besides 
none	none	He doesn t love you Frank Spencer s eyes and voice were amazed Of course not 
5660_101892_000034_000001	train-clean-360	He never did for that matter 
5660_101892_000034_000002	train-clean-360	 Twas only the fancy of a moment 
5660_101892_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Why Frank Ned never cared for me that way 
none	none	Ned 
5660_101892_000035_000001	train-clean-360	The tone and the one word were enough 
5660_101892_000035_000002	train-clean-360	For one moment Margaret gazed into the man s face with startled eyes then she turned and covered her own telltale face with her hands and because it was a telltale face Spencer took a long stride toward her 
none	none	Margaret 
5660_101892_000036_000001	train-clean-360	And did you think it was Ned I was pleading for when all the while it was I who was hungering for you with a love that sent me across the seas to rid myself of it 
5660_101892_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Did you Margaret 
none	none	There was no answer Margaret look at me let me see your eyes There was a note of triumphant joy in his voice now 
5660_101892_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Still no answer 
5660_101892_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Margaret it did not go that love 
5660_101892_000040_000001	train-clean-360	It stayed with me day after day and month after month and it only grew stronger and deeper until there was nothing left me in all this world but you just you 
5660_101892_000040_000002	train-clean-360	And now Margaret my Margaret he said softly and very tenderly 
none	none	You are my Margaret And his arms closed about her CHAPTER XLI In spite of protests and pleadings Margaret spent the winter abroad As if I d stay here and flaunt my happiness in poor Bobby s face she said indignantly to her lover Neither would she consent to a formal engagement Even missus Merideth and Ned were not to know It is to be just as it was before she had declared decidedly only well you may write to me she had conceded I refuse to stay here and and be just happy yet I ve been unkind and thoughtless and have brought sorrow to my dear good friend I m going away I deserve it and Bobby deserves it too And in spite of Frank Spencer s efforts to make her see matters in a different light she still adhered to her purpose All through the long winter Frank contented himself with writing voluminous letters and telling her of the plans he was making to divvy up at the mills as he always called it I shall make mistakes of course dear he wrote It is a big problem altogether more so than perhaps you realize Of course the mills must still be a business not a philanthropy otherwise we should defeat our own ends But I shall have your clear head and warm heart to aid me and little by little we shall win success Already I have introduced two or three small changes to prepare the way for the larger ones later on Even Ned is getting interested and seems to approve of my work somewhat to my surprise I will own I m thinking however that I m not the only one in the house sweetheart to whom you and your unselfishness have shown the better way Month by month the winter passed and spring came bringing missus Merideth but no Margaret She has stopped to visit friends in New York explained missus Merideth in reply to her brother s anxious questions She may go on west with them She said she would write you Margaret did go on west and it was while she was still in the west that she received a letter from Patty a portion of which ran thus Mebbe youd like to know about Bobby McGinnis Bobby is goin to get married She seemed to comfort him lots after you went Shes that pretty and sympathizing in her ways you know I think he was kind of surprised hisself but the first thing he knew he was in love with her I think he felt kind of bad at first on account of you But I told him that was all nonsense and that I knew youd want him to do it I think his feelins for you was more worship than love anyhow He didn t never seem happy even when he was engaged to you But hes happy now and Arabella thinks hes jest perfect Oh I told you twas Arabella didn t I Well tis And say its her thats been learnin me to spell Ain t it jest grand Not very many days later Frank Spencer at Hilcrest received a small card on which had been written missus Patty Durgin announces the engagement of her sister Arabella Murphy to mister Robert McGinnis Beneath in very fine letters was I m coming home the eighteenth Please tell Della and you may tell her anything else that you like Margaret For a moment the man stared at the card with puzzled eyes then he suddenly understood Della he cried joyously a minute later Della she s coming the eighteenth Who s coming the eighteenth Frank hesitated A light that was half serious half whimsical and wholly tender came into his eyes My wife he said Your wife Oh you know her as Margaret Kendall retorted Frank with an airiness that was intended to hide the shake in his voice But she will be my wife before she leaves here again Frank cried missus Merideth joyfully you don t mean But Frank was gone Over his shoulder however he had tossed a smile and a reassuring nod missus Merideth sank back with a sigh of content It s exactly what I always hoped would happen she said THE END Popular Copyright Novels AT MODERATE PRICES Ask Your Dealer for a
