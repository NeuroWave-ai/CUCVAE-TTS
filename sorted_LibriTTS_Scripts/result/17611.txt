not only to teach the proficient but also to instruct beginners according to the Apostle As Unto Little Ones in Christ I Gave You Milk to Drink Not Meat one Cor iii one two we purpose in this book to treat of whatever belongs to the Christian Religion in such a way as may tend to the instruction of beginners We have considered that students in this Science have not seldom been hampered by what they have found written by other authors partly on account of the multiplication of useless questions articles and arguments partly also because those things that are needful for them to know are not taught according to the order of the subject matter but according as the plan of the book might require or the occasion of the argument offer partly too because frequent repetition brought weariness and confusion to the minds of the readers Endeavoring to avoid these and other like faults we shall try by God s help to set forth whatever is included in this Sacred Science as briefly and clearly as the matter itself may allow SUMMA THEOLOGICA FIRST PART I Prima Pars QUESTION one THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF SACRED DOCTRINE in Ten Articles To place our purpose within proper limits we first endeavor to investigate the nature and extent of this sacred doctrine Concerning this there are ten points of inquiry one Whether it is necessary two Whether it is a science three Whether it is one or many four Whether it is speculative or practical five How it is compared with other sciences six Whether it is the same as wisdom seven Whether God is its subject matter eight Whether it is a matter of argument nine Whether it rightly employs metaphors and similes ten Whether the Sacred Scripture of this doctrine may be expounded in different senses FIRST ARTICLE I Q one Art one Whether besides Philosophy any Further Doctrine Is Required Objection one It seems that besides philosophical science we have no need of any further knowledge For man should not seek to know what is above reason Seek not the things that are too high for thee Ecclus three twenty two But whatever is not above reason is fully treated of in philosophical science Therefore any other knowledge besides philosophical science is superfluous Obj two Further knowledge can be concerned only with being for nothing can be known save what is true and all that is is true But everything that is is treated of in philosophical science even God Himself so that there is a part of philosophy called theology or the divine science as Aristotle has proved Metaph vi Therefore besides philosophical science there is no need of any further knowledge On the contrary It is written two Tim three sixteen All Scripture inspired of God is profitable to teach to reprove to correct to instruct in justice Now Scripture inspired of God is no part of philosophical science which has been built up by human reason Therefore it is useful that besides philosophical science there should be other knowledge i e inspired of God I answer that It was necessary for man s salvation that there should be a knowledge revealed by God besides philosophical science built up by human reason Firstly indeed because man is directed to God as to an end that surpasses the grasp of his reason The eye hath not seen O God besides Thee what things Thou hast prepared for them that wait for Thee Isa sixty six four But the end must first be known by men who are to direct their thoughts and actions to the end Hence it was necessary for the salvation of man that certain truths which exceed human reason should be made known to him by divine revelation Even as regards those truths about God which human reason could have discovered it was necessary that man should be taught by a divine revelation because the truth about God such as reason could discover would only be known by a few and that after a long time and with the admixture of many errors Whereas man s whole salvation which is in God depends upon the knowledge of this truth Therefore in order that the salvation of men might be brought about more fitly and more surely it was necessary that they should be taught divine truths by divine revelation It was therefore necessary that besides philosophical science built up by reason there should be a sacred science learned through revelation Reply Obj one Although those things which are beyond man s knowledge may not be sought for by man through his reason nevertheless once they are revealed by God they must be accepted by faith Hence the sacred text continues For many things are shown to thee above the understanding of man Ecclus three twenty five And in this the sacred science consists Reply Obj two Sciences are differentiated according to the various means through which knowledge is obtained For the astronomer and the physicist both may prove the same conclusion that the earth for instance is round the astronomer by means of mathematics i e abstracting from matter but the physicist by means of matter itself Hence there is no reason why those things which may be learned from philosophical science so far as they can be known by natural reason may not also be taught us by another science so far as they fall within revelation Hence theology included in sacred doctrine differs in kind from that theology which is part of philosophy SECOND ARTICLE I Q one Art two Whether Sacred Doctrine Is a Science Objection one It seems that sacred doctrine is not a science For every science proceeds from self evident principles But sacred doctrine proceeds from articles of faith which are not self evident since their truth is not admitted by all For all men have not faith two Thess three two Therefore sacred doctrine is not a science Obj two Further no science deals with individual facts But this sacred science treats of individual facts such as the deeds of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and such like Therefore sacred doctrine is not a science On the contrary Augustine says De Trin xiv one to this science alone belongs that whereby saving faith is begotten nourished protected and strengthened But this can be said of no science except sacred doctrine Therefore sacred doctrine is a science I answer that Sacred doctrine is a science We must bear in mind that there are two kinds of sciences There are some which proceed from a principle known by the natural light of intelligence such as arithmetic and geometry and the like There are some which proceed from principles known by the light of a higher science thus the science of perspective proceeds from principles established by geometry and music from principles established by arithmetic So it is that sacred doctrine is a science because it proceeds from principles established by the light of a higher science namely the science of God and the blessed Hence just as the musician accepts on authority the principles taught him by the mathematician so sacred science is established on principles revealed by God Reply Obj one The principles of any science are either in themselves self evident or reducible to the conclusions of a higher science and such as we have said are the principles of sacred doctrine Reply Obj two Individual facts are treated of in sacred doctrine not because it is concerned with them principally but they are introduced rather both as examples to be followed in our lives as in moral sciences and in order to establish the authority of those men through whom the divine revelation on which this sacred scripture or doctrine is based has come down to us THIRD ARTICLE I Q one Art three Whether Sacred Doctrine Is One Science Objection one It seems that sacred doctrine is not one science for according to the Philosopher Poster i that science is one which treats only of one class of subjects But the creator and the creature both of whom are treated of in sacred doctrine cannot be grouped together under one class of subjects Therefore sacred doctrine is not one science Obj two Further in sacred doctrine we treat of angels corporeal creatures and human morality But these belong to separate philosophical sciences Therefore sacred doctrine cannot be one science On the contrary Holy Scripture speaks of it as one science Wisdom gave him the knowledge scientiam of holy things Wis ten ten I answer that Sacred doctrine is one science The unity of a faculty or habit is to be gauged by its object not indeed in its material aspect but as regards the precise formality under which it is an object For example man ass stone agree in the one precise formality of being colored and color is the formal object of sight Therefore because Sacred Scripture considers things precisely under the formality of being divinely revealed whatever has been divinely revealed possesses the one precise formality of the object of this science and therefore is included under sacred doctrine as under one science Reply Obj one Sacred doctrine does not treat of God and creatures equally but of God primarily and of creatures only so far as they are referable to God as their beginning or end Hence the unity of this science is not impaired Reply Obj two Nothing prevents inferior faculties or habits from being differentiated by something which falls under a higher faculty or habit as well because the higher faculty or habit regards the object in its more universal formality as the object of the common sense is whatever affects the senses including therefore whatever is visible or audible Hence the common sense although one faculty extends to all the objects of the five senses Similarly objects which are the subject matter of different philosophical sciences can yet be treated of by this one single sacred science under one aspect precisely so far as they can be included in revelation So that in this way sacred doctrine bears as it were the stamp of the divine science which is one and simple yet extends to everything FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one Art four Whether Sacred Doctrine Is a Practical Science Objection one It seems that sacred doctrine is a practical science for a practical science is that which ends in action according to the Philosopher Metaph ii But sacred doctrine is ordained to action Be ye doers of the word and not hearers only James one twenty two Therefore sacred doctrine is a practical science Obj two Further sacred doctrine is divided into the Old and the New Law But law implies a moral science which is a practical science Therefore sacred doctrine is a practical science On the contrary Every practical science is concerned with human operations as moral science is concerned with human acts and architecture with buildings But sacred doctrine is chiefly concerned with God whose handiwork is especially man Therefore it is not a practical but a speculative science I answer that Sacred doctrine being one extends to things which belong to different philosophical sciences because it considers in each the same formal aspect namely so far as they can be known through divine revelation Hence although among the philosophical sciences one is speculative and another practical nevertheless sacred doctrine includes both as God by one and the same science knows both Himself and His works Still it is speculative rather than practical because it is more concerned with divine things than with human acts though it does treat even of these latter inasmuch as man is ordained by them to the perfect knowledge of God in which consists eternal bliss This is a sufficient answer to the Objections FIFTH ARTICLE I Q one Art five Whether Sacred Doctrine Is Nobler than Other Sciences Objection one It seems that sacred doctrine is not nobler than other sciences for the nobility of a science depends on the certitude it establishes But other sciences the principles of which cannot be doubted seem to be more certain than sacred doctrine for its principles namely articles of faith can be doubted Therefore other sciences seem to be nobler Obj two Further it is the sign of a lower science to depend upon a higher as music depends on arithmetic But sacred doctrine does in a sense depend upon philosophical sciences for Jerome observes in his Epistle to Magnus that the ancient doctors so enriched their books with the ideas and phrases of the philosophers that thou knowest not what more to admire in them their profane erudition or their scriptural learning Therefore sacred doctrine is inferior to other sciences On the contrary Other sciences are called the handmaidens of this one Wisdom sent her maids to invite to the tower Prov nine three I answer that Since this science is partly speculative and partly practical it transcends all others speculative and practical Now one speculative science is said to be nobler than another either by reason of its greater certitude or by reason of the higher worth of its subject matter In both these respects this science surpasses other speculative sciences in point of greater certitude because other sciences derive their certitude from the natural light of human reason which can err whereas this derives its certitude from the light of divine knowledge which cannot be misled in point of the higher worth of its subject matter because this science treats chiefly of those things which by their sublimity transcend human reason while other sciences consider only those things which are within reason s grasp Of the practical sciences that one is nobler which is ordained to a further purpose as political science is nobler than military science for the good of the army is directed to the good of the State But the purpose of this science in so far as it is practical is eternal bliss to which as to an ultimate end the purposes of every practical science are directed Hence it is clear that from every standpoint it is nobler than other sciences Reply Obj one It may well happen that what is in itself the more certain may seem to us the less certain on account of the weakness of our intelligence which is dazzled by the clearest objects of nature as the owl is dazzled by the light of the sun Metaph ii lect i Hence the fact that some happen to doubt about articles of faith is not due to the uncertain nature of the truths but to the weakness of human intelligence yet the slenderest knowledge that may be obtained of the highest things is more desirable than the most certain knowledge obtained of lesser things as is said in de Animalibus xi Reply Obj two This science can in a sense depend upon the philosophical sciences not as though it stood in need of them but only in order to make its teaching clearer For it accepts its principles not from other sciences but immediately from God by revelation Therefore it does not depend upon other sciences as upon the higher but makes use of them as of the lesser and as handmaidens even so the master sciences make use of the sciences that supply their materials as political of military science That it thus uses them is not due to its own defect or insufficiency but to the defect of our intelligence which is more easily led by what is known through natural reason from which proceed the other sciences to that which is above reason such as are the teachings of this science SIXTH ARTICLE I Q one Art six Whether This Doctrine Is the Same as Wisdom Objection one It seems that this doctrine is not the same as wisdom For no doctrine which borrows its principles is worthy of the name of wisdom seeing that the wise man directs and is not directed Metaph i But this doctrine borrows its principles Therefore this science is not wisdom Obj two Further it is a part of wisdom to prove the principles of other sciences Hence it is called the chief of sciences as is clear in Ethic vi But this doctrine does not prove the principles of other sciences Therefore it is not the same as wisdom Obj three Further this doctrine is acquired by study whereas wisdom is acquired by God s inspiration so that it is numbered among the gifts of the Holy Spirit Isa eleven two Therefore this doctrine is not the same as wisdom On the contrary It is written Deut four six This is your wisdom and understanding in the sight of nations I answer that This doctrine is wisdom above all human wisdom not merely in any one order but absolutely For since it is the part of a wise man to arrange and to judge and since lesser matters should be judged in the light of some higher principle he is said to be wise in any one order who considers the highest principle in that order thus in the order of building he who plans the form of the house is called wise and architect in opposition to the inferior laborers who trim the wood and make ready the stones As a wise architect I have laid the foundation one Cor three ten Again in the order of all human life the prudent man is called wise inasmuch as he directs his acts to a fitting end Wisdom is prudence to a man Prov ten twenty three Therefore he who considers absolutely the highest cause of the whole universe namely God is most of all called wise Hence wisdom is said to be the knowledge of divine things as Augustine says De Trin xii fourteen But sacred doctrine essentially treats of God viewed as the highest cause not only so far as He can be known through creatures just as philosophers knew Him That which is known of God is manifest in them Rom one nineteen but also as far as He is known to Himself alone and revealed to others Hence sacred doctrine is especially called wisdom Reply Obj one Sacred doctrine derives its principles not from any human knowledge but from the divine knowledge through which as through the highest wisdom all our knowledge is set in order Reply Obj two The principles of other sciences either are evident and cannot be proved or are proved by natural reason through some other science But the knowledge proper to this science comes through revelation and not through natural reason Therefore it has no concern to prove the principles of other sciences but only to judge of them Whatsoever is found in other sciences contrary to any truth of this science must be condemned as false Destroying counsels and every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God two Cor ten four five Reply Obj three Since judgment appertains to wisdom the twofold manner of judging produces a twofold wisdom A man may judge in one way by inclination as whoever has the habit of a virtue judges rightly of what concerns that virtue by his very inclination towards it Hence it is the virtuous man as we read who is the measure and rule of human acts In another way by knowledge just as a man learned in moral science might be able to judge rightly about virtuous acts though he had not the virtue The first manner of judging divine things belongs to that wisdom which is set down among the gifts of the Holy Ghost The spiritual man judgeth all things one Cor two fifteen And Dionysius says Div Nom ii Hierotheus is taught not by mere learning but by experience of divine things The second manner of judging belongs to this doctrine which is acquired by study though its principles are obtained by revelation SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q one Art seven Whether God Is the Object of This Science Objection one It seems that God is not the object of this science For in every science the nature of its object is presupposed But this science cannot presuppose the essence of God for Damascene says De Fide Orth i iv It is impossible to define the essence of God Therefore God is not the object of this science Obj two Further whatever conclusions are reached in any science must be comprehended under the object of the science But in Holy Writ we reach conclusions not only concerning God but concerning many other things such as creatures and human morality Therefore God is not the object of this science On the contrary The object of the science is that of which it principally treats But in this science the treatment is mainly about God for it is called theology as treating of God Therefore God is the object of this science I answer that God is the object of this science The relation between a science and its object is the same as that between a habit or faculty and its object Now properly speaking the object of a faculty or habit is the thing under the aspect of which all things are referred to that faculty or habit as man and stone are referred to the faculty of sight in that they are colored Hence colored things are the proper objects of sight But in sacred science all things are treated of under the aspect of God either because they are God Himself or because they refer to God as their beginning and end Hence it follows that God is in very truth the object of this science This is clear also from the principles of this science namely the articles of faith for faith is about God The object of the principles and of the whole science must be the same since the whole science is contained virtually in its principles Some however looking to what is treated of in this science and not to the aspect under which it is treated have asserted the object of this science to be something other than God that is either things and signs or the works of salvation or the whole Christ as the head and members Of all these things in truth we treat in this science but so far as they have reference to God Reply Obj one Although we cannot know in what consists the essence of God nevertheless in this science we make use of His effects either of nature or of grace in place of a definition in regard to whatever is treated of in this science concerning God even as in some philosophical sciences we demonstrate something about a cause from its effect by taking the effect in place of a definition of the cause Reply Obj two Whatever other conclusions are reached in this sacred science are comprehended under God not as parts or species or accidents but as in some way related to Him EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q one Art eight Whether Sacred Doctrine is a Matter of Argument Objection one It seems this doctrine is not a matter of argument For Ambrose says De Fide one Put arguments aside where faith is sought But in this doctrine faith especially is sought But these things are written that you may believe John twenty thirty one Therefore sacred doctrine is not a matter of argument Obj two Further if it is a matter of argument the argument is either from authority or from reason If it is from authority it seems unbefitting its dignity for the proof from authority is the weakest form of proof But if it is from reason this is unbefitting its end because according to Gregory Hom twenty six faith has no merit in those things of which human reason brings its own experience Therefore sacred doctrine is not a matter of argument On the contrary The Scripture says that a bishop should embrace that faithful word which is according to doctrine that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the gainsayers Titus one nine I answer that As other sciences do not argue in proof of their principles but argue from their principles to demonstrate other truths in these sciences so this doctrine does not argue in proof of its principles which are the articles of faith but from them it goes on to prove something else as the Apostle from the resurrection of Christ argues in proof of the general resurrection one Cor fifteen However it is to be borne in mind in regard to the philosophical sciences that the inferior sciences neither prove their principles nor dispute with those who deny them but leave this to a higher science whereas the highest of them viz metaphysics can dispute with one who denies its principles if only the opponent will make some concession but if he concede nothing it can have no dispute with him though it can answer his objections Hence Sacred Scripture since it has no science above itself can dispute with one who denies its principles only if the opponent admits some at least of the truths obtained through divine revelation thus we can argue with heretics from texts in Holy Writ and against those who deny one article of faith we can argue from another If our opponent believes nothing of divine revelation there is no longer any means of proving the articles of faith by reasoning but only of answering his objections if he has any against faith Since faith rests upon infallible truth and since the contrary of a truth can never be demonstrated it is clear that the arguments brought against faith cannot be demonstrations but are difficulties that can be answered Reply Obj one Although arguments from human reason cannot avail to prove what must be received on faith nevertheless this doctrine argues from articles of faith to other truths Reply Obj two This doctrine is especially based upon arguments from authority inasmuch as its principles are obtained by revelation thus we ought to believe on the authority of those to whom the revelation has been made Nor does this take away from the dignity of this doctrine for although the argument from authority based on human reason is the weakest yet the argument from authority based on divine revelation is the strongest But sacred doctrine makes use even of human reason not indeed to prove faith for thereby the merit of faith would come to an end but to make clear other things that are put forward in this doctrine Since therefore grace does not destroy nature but perfects it natural reason should minister to faith as the natural bent of the will ministers to charity Hence the Apostle says Bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ two Cor ten five Hence sacred doctrine makes use also of the authority of philosophers in those questions in which they were able to know the truth by natural reason as Paul quotes a saying of Aratus As some also of your own poets said For we are also His offspring Acts seventeen twenty eight Nevertheless sacred doctrine makes use of these authorities as extrinsic and probable arguments but properly uses the authority of the canonical Scriptures as an incontrovertible proof and the authority of the doctors of the Church as one that may properly be used yet merely as probable For our faith rests upon the revelation made to the apostles and prophets who wrote the canonical books and not on the revelations if any such there are made to other doctors Hence Augustine says Epis ad Hieron xix one Only those books of Scripture which are called canonical have I learned to hold in such honor as to believe their authors have not erred in any way in writing them But other authors I so read as not to deem everything in their works to be true merely on account of their having so thought and written whatever may have been their holiness and learning NINTH ARTICLE I Q one Art nine Whether Holy Scripture Should Use Metaphors Objection one It seems that Holy Scripture should not use metaphors For that which is proper to the lowest science seems not to befit this science which holds the highest place of all But to proceed by the aid of various similitudes and figures is proper to poetry the least of all the sciences Therefore it is not fitting that this science should make use of such similitudes Obj two Further this doctrine seems to be intended to make truth clear Hence a reward is held out to those who manifest it They that explain me shall have life everlasting Ecclus twenty four thirty one But by such similitudes truth is obscured Therefore to put forward divine truths by likening them to corporeal things does not befit this science Obj three Further the higher creatures are the nearer they approach to the divine likeness If therefore any creature be taken to represent God this representation ought chiefly to be taken from the higher creatures and not from the lower yet this is often found in Scriptures On the contrary It is written Osee twelve ten I have multiplied visions and I have used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets But to put forward anything by means of similitudes is to use metaphors Therefore this sacred science may use metaphors I answer that It is befitting Holy Writ to put forward divine and spiritual truths by means of comparisons with material things For God provides for everything according to the capacity of its nature Now it is natural to man to attain to intellectual truths through sensible objects because all our knowledge originates from sense Hence in Holy Writ spiritual truths are fittingly taught under the likeness of material things This is what Dionysius says Coel Hier i We cannot be enlightened by the divine rays except they be hidden within the covering of many sacred veils It is also befitting Holy Writ which is proposed to all without distinction of persons To the wise and to the unwise I am a debtor Rom one fourteen that spiritual truths be expounded by means of figures taken from corporeal things in order that thereby even the simple who are unable by themselves to grasp intellectual things may be able to understand it Reply Obj one Poetry makes use of metaphors to produce a representation for it is natural to man to be pleased with representations But sacred doctrine makes use of metaphors as both necessary and useful Reply Obj two The ray of divine revelation is not extinguished by the sensible imagery wherewith it is veiled as Dionysius says Coel Hier i and its truth so far remains that it does not allow the minds of those to whom the revelation has been made to rest in the metaphors but raises them to the knowledge of truths and through those to whom the revelation has been made others also may receive instruction in these matters Hence those things that are taught metaphorically in one part of Scripture in other parts are taught more openly The very hiding of truth in figures is useful for the exercise of thoughtful minds and as a defense against the ridicule of the impious according to the words Give not that which is holy to dogs Matt seven six Reply Obj three As Dionysius says Coel Hier i it is more fitting that divine truths should be expounded under the figure of less noble than of nobler bodies and this for three reasons Firstly because thereby men s minds are the better preserved from error For then it is clear that these things are not literal descriptions of divine truths which might have been open to doubt had they been expressed under the figure of nobler bodies especially for those who could think of nothing nobler than bodies Secondly because this is more befitting the knowledge of God that we have in this life For what He is not is clearer to us than what He is Therefore similitudes drawn from things farthest away from God form within us a truer estimate that God is above whatsoever we may say or think of Him Thirdly because thereby divine truths are the better hidden from the unworthy TENTH ARTICLE I Q one Art ten Whether in Holy Scripture a Word may have Several Senses Objection one It seems that in Holy Writ a word cannot have several senses historical or literal allegorical tropological or moral and anagogical For many different senses in one text produce confusion and deception and destroy all force of argument Hence no argument but only fallacies can be deduced from a multiplicity of propositions But Holy Writ ought to be able to state the truth without any fallacy Therefore in it there cannot be several senses to a word Obj two Further Augustine says De util cred iii that the Old Testament has a fourfold division as to history etiology analogy and allegory Now these four seem altogether different from the four divisions mentioned in the first objection Therefore it does not seem fitting to explain the same word of Holy Writ according to the four different senses mentioned above Obj three Further besides these senses there is the parabolical which is not one of these four On the contrary Gregory says Moral xx one Holy Writ by the manner of its speech transcends every science because in one and the same sentence while it describes a fact it reveals a mystery I answer that The author of Holy Writ is God in whose power it is to signify His meaning not by words only as man also can do but also by things themselves So whereas in every other science things are signified by words this science has the property that the things signified by the words have themselves also a signification Therefore that first signification whereby words signify things belongs to the first sense the historical or literal That signification whereby things signified by words have themselves also a signification is called the spiritual sense which is based on the literal and presupposes it Now this spiritual sense has a threefold division For as the Apostle says Heb ten one the Old Law is a figure of the New Law and Dionysius says Coel Hier i the New Law itself is a figure of future glory Again in the New Law whatever our Head has done is a type of what we ought to do Therefore so far as the things of the Old Law signify the things of the New Law there is the allegorical sense so far as the things done in Christ or so far as the things which signify Christ are types of what we ought to do there is the moral sense But so far as they signify what relates to eternal glory there is the anagogical sense Since the literal sense is that which the author intends and since the author of Holy Writ is God Who by one act comprehends all things by His intellect it is not unfitting as Augustine says Confess xii if even according to the literal sense one word in Holy Writ should have several senses Reply Obj one The multiplicity of these senses does not produce equivocation or any other kind of multiplicity seeing that these senses are not multiplied because one word signifies several things but because the things signified by the words can be themselves types of other things Thus in Holy Writ no confusion results for all the senses are founded on one the literal from which alone can any argument be drawn and not from those intended in allegory as Augustine says Epis forty eight Nevertheless nothing of Holy Scripture perishes on account of this since nothing necessary to faith is contained under the spiritual sense which is not elsewhere put forward by the Scripture in its literal sense Reply Obj two These three history etiology analogy are grouped under the literal sense For it is called history as Augustine expounds Epis forty eight whenever anything is simply related it is called etiology when its cause is assigned as when Our Lord gave the reason why Moses allowed the putting away of wives namely on account of the hardness of men s hearts it is called analogy whenever the truth of one text of Scripture is shown not to contradict the truth of another Of these four allegory alone stands for the three spiritual senses Thus Hugh of saint Victor Sacram iv four Prolog includes the anagogical under the allegorical sense laying down three senses only the historical the allegorical and the tropological Reply Obj three The parabolical sense is contained in the literal for by words things are signified properly and figuratively Nor is the figure itself but that which is figured the literal sense When Scripture speaks of God s arm the literal sense is not that God has such a member but only what is signified by this member namely operative power Hence it is plain that nothing false can ever underlie the literal sense of Holy Writ QUESTION two THE EXISTENCE OF GOD In Three Articles Because the chief aim of sacred doctrine is to teach the knowledge of God not only as He is in Himself but also as He is the beginning of things and their last end and especially of rational creatures as is clear from what has been already said therefore in our endeavor to expound this science we shall treat one Of God two Of the rational creature s advance towards God three Of Christ Who as man is our way to God In treating of God there will be a threefold division for we shall consider one Whatever concerns the Divine Essence two Whatever concerns the distinctions of Persons three Whatever concerns the procession of creatures from Him Concerning the Divine Essence we must consider one Whether God exists two The manner of His existence or rather what is not the manner of His existence three Whatever concerns His operations namely His knowledge will power Concerning the first there are three points of inquiry one Whether the proposition God exists is self evident two Whether it is demonstrable three Whether God exists FIRST ARTICLE I Q two Art one Whether the Existence of God Is Self Evident Objection one It seems that the existence of God is self evident Now those things are said to be self evident to us the knowledge of which is naturally implanted in us as we can see in regard to first principles But as Damascene says De Fide Orth i thirteen the knowledge of God is naturally implanted in all Therefore the existence of God is self evident Obj two Further those things are said to be self evident which are known as soon as the terms are known which the Philosopher one Poster iii says is true of the first principles of demonstration Thus when the nature of a whole and of a part is known it is at once recognized that every whole is greater than its part But as soon as the signification of the word God is understood it is at once seen that God exists For by this word is signified that thing than which nothing greater can be conceived But that which exists actually and mentally is greater than that which exists only mentally Therefore since as soon as the word God is understood it exists mentally it also follows that it exists actually Therefore the proposition God exists is self evident Obj three Further the existence of truth is self evident For whoever denies the existence of truth grants that truth does not exist and if truth does not exist then the proposition Truth does not exist is true and if there is anything true there must be truth But God is truth itself I am the way the truth and the life John fourteen six Therefore God exists is self evident On the contrary No one can mentally admit the opposite of what is self evident as the Philosopher Metaph iv lect vi states concerning the first principles of demonstration But the opposite of the proposition God is can be mentally admitted The fool said in his heart There is no God Ps fifty two one Therefore that God exists is not self evident I answer that A thing can be self evident in either of two ways on the one hand self evident in itself though not to us on the other self evident in itself and to us A proposition is self evident because the predicate is included in the essence of the subject as Man is an animal for animal is contained in the essence of man If therefore the essence of the predicate and subject be known to all the proposition will be self evident to all as is clear with regard to the first principles of demonstration the terms of which are common things that no one is ignorant of such as being and non being whole and part and such like If however there are some to whom the essence of the predicate and subject is unknown the proposition will be self evident in itself but not to those who do not know the meaning of the predicate and subject of the proposition Therefore it happens as Boethius says Hebdom the title of which is Whether all that is is good that there are some mental concepts self evident only to the learned as that incorporeal substances are not in space Therefore I say that this proposition God exists of itself is self evident for the predicate is the same as the subject because God is His own existence as will be hereafter shown Q three Art four Now because we do not know the essence of God the proposition is not self evident to us but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us though less known in their nature namely by effects Reply Obj one To know that God exists in a general and confused way is implanted in us by nature inasmuch as God is man s beatitude For man naturally desires happiness and what is naturally desired by man must be naturally known to him This however is not to know absolutely that God exists just as to know that someone is approaching is not the same as to know that Peter is approaching even though it is Peter who is approaching for many there are who imagine that man s perfect good which is happiness consists in riches and others in pleasures and others in something else Reply Obj two Perhaps not everyone who hears this word God understands it to signify something than which nothing greater can be thought seeing that some have believed God to be a body Yet granted that everyone understands that by this word God is signified something than which nothing greater can be thought nevertheless it does not therefore follow that he understands that what the word signifies exists actually but only that it exists mentally Nor can it be argued that it actually exists unless it be admitted that there actually exists something than which nothing greater can be thought and this precisely is not admitted by those who hold that God does not exist Reply Obj three The existence of truth in general is self evident but the existence of a Primal Truth is not self evident to us SECOND ARTICLE I Q two Art two Whether It Can Be Demonstrated That God Exists Objection one It seems that the existence of God cannot be demonstrated For it is an article of faith that God exists But what is of faith cannot be demonstrated because a demonstration produces scientific knowledge whereas faith is of the unseen Heb eleven one Therefore it cannot be demonstrated that God exists Obj two Further the essence is the middle term of demonstration But we cannot know in what God s essence consists but solely in what it does not consist as Damascene says De Fide Orth i four Therefore we cannot demonstrate that God exists Obj three Further if the existence of God were demonstrated this could only be from His effects But His effects are not proportionate to Him since He is infinite and His effects are finite and between the finite and infinite there is no proportion Therefore since a cause cannot be demonstrated by an effect not proportionate to it it seems that the existence of God cannot be demonstrated On the contrary The Apostle says The invisible things of Him are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made Rom one twenty But this would not be unless the existence of God could be demonstrated through the things that are made for the first thing we must know of anything is whether it exists I answer that Demonstration can be made in two ways One is through the cause and is called a priori and this is to argue from what is prior absolutely The other is through the effect and is called a demonstration a posteriori this is to argue from what is prior relatively only to us When an effect is better known to us than its cause from the effect we proceed to the knowledge of the cause And from every effect the existence of its proper cause can be demonstrated so long as its effects are better known to us because since every effect depends upon its cause if the effect exists the cause must pre exist Hence the existence of God in so far as it is not self evident to us can be demonstrated from those of His effects which are known to us Reply Obj one The existence of God and other like truths about God which can be known by natural reason are not articles of faith but are preambles to the articles for faith presupposes natural knowledge even as grace presupposes nature and perfection supposes something that can be perfected Nevertheless there is nothing to prevent a man who cannot grasp a proof accepting as a matter of faith something which in itself is capable of being scientifically known and demonstrated Reply Obj two When the existence of a cause is demonstrated from an effect this effect takes the place of the definition of the cause in proof of the cause s existence This is especially the case in regard to God because in order to prove the existence of anything it is necessary to accept as a middle term the meaning of the word and not its essence for the question of its essence follows on the question of its existence Now the names given to God are derived from His effects consequently in demonstrating the existence of God from His effects we may take for the middle term the meaning of the word God Reply Obj three From effects not proportionate to the cause no perfect knowledge of that cause can be obtained Yet from every effect the existence of the cause can be clearly demonstrated and so we can demonstrate the existence of God from His effects though from them we cannot perfectly know God as He is in His essence THIRD ARTICLE I Q two Art three Whether God Exists Objection one It seems that God does not exist because if one of two contraries be infinite the other would be altogether destroyed But the word God means that He is infinite goodness If therefore God existed there would be no evil discoverable but there is evil in the world Therefore God does not exist Obj two Further it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles supposing God did not exist For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason or will Therefore there is no need to suppose God s existence On the contrary It is said in the person of God I am Who am Ex three fourteen I answer that The existence of God can be proved in five ways The first and more manifest way is the argument from motion It is certain and evident to our senses that in the world some things are in motion Now whatever is in motion is put in motion by another for nothing can be in motion except it is in potentiality to that towards which it is in motion whereas a thing moves inasmuch as it is in act For motion is nothing else than the reduction of something from potentiality to actuality But nothing can be reduced from potentiality to actuality except by something in a state of actuality Thus that which is actually hot as fire makes wood which is potentially hot to be actually hot and thereby moves and changes it Now it is not possible that the same thing should be at once in actuality and potentiality in the same respect but only in different respects For what is actually hot cannot simultaneously be potentially hot but it is simultaneously potentially cold It is therefore impossible that in the same respect and in the same way a thing should be both mover and moved i e that it should move itself Therefore whatever is in motion must be put in motion by another If that by which it is put in motion be itself put in motion then this also must needs be put in motion by another and that by another again But this cannot go on to infinity because then there would be no first mover and consequently no other mover seeing that subsequent movers move only inasmuch as they are put in motion by the first mover as the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover put in motion by no other and this everyone understands to be God The second way is from the nature of the efficient cause In the world of sense we find there is an order of efficient causes There is no case known neither is it indeed possible in which a thing is found to be the efficient cause of itself for so it would be prior to itself which is impossible Now in efficient causes it is not possible to go on to infinity because in all efficient causes following in order the first is the cause of the intermediate cause and the intermediate is the cause of the ultimate cause whether the intermediate cause be several or only one Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect Therefore if there be no first cause among efficient causes there will be no ultimate nor any intermediate cause But if in efficient causes it is possible to go on to infinity there will be no first efficient cause neither will there be an ultimate effect nor any intermediate efficient causes all of which is plainly false Therefore it is necessary to admit a first efficient cause to which everyone gives the name of God The third way is taken from possibility and necessity and runs thus We find in nature things that are possible to be and not to be since they are found to be generated and to corrupt and consequently they are possible to be and not to be But it is impossible for these always to exist for that which is possible not to be at some time is not Therefore if everything is possible not to be then at one time there could have been nothing in existence Now if this were true even now there would be nothing in existence because that which does not exist only begins to exist by something already existing Therefore if at one time nothing was in existence it would have been impossible for anything to have begun to exist and thus even now nothing would be in existence which is absurd Therefore not all beings are merely possible but there must exist something the existence of which is necessary But every necessary thing either has its necessity caused by another or not Now it is impossible to go on to infinity in necessary things which have their necessity caused by another as has been already proved in regard to efficient causes Therefore we cannot but postulate the existence of some being having of itself its own necessity and not receiving it from another but rather causing in others their necessity This all men speak of as God The fourth way is taken from the gradation to be found in things Among beings there are some more and some less good true noble and the like But more and less are predicated of different things according as they resemble in their different ways something which is the maximum as a thing is said to be hotter according as it more nearly resembles that which is hottest so that there is something which is truest something best something noblest and consequently something which is uttermost being for those things that are greatest in truth are greatest in being as it is written in Metaph ii Now the maximum in any genus is the cause of all in that genus as fire which is the maximum heat is the cause of all hot things Therefore there must also be something which is to all beings the cause of their being goodness and every other perfection and this we call God The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world We see that things which lack intelligence such as natural bodies act for an end and this is evident from their acting always or nearly always in the same way so as to obtain the best result Hence it is plain that not fortuitously but designedly do they achieve their end Now whatever lacks intelligence cannot move towards an end unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence as the arrow is shot to its mark by the archer Therefore some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end and this being we call God Reply Obj one As Augustine says Enchiridion xi Since God is the highest good He would not allow any evil to exist in His works unless His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring good even out of evil This is part of the infinite goodness of God that He should allow evil to exist and out of it produce good Reply Obj two Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God as to its first cause So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will since these can change or fail for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self necessary first principle as was shown in the body of the Article QUESTION three OF THE SIMPLICITY OF GOD In Eight Articles When the existence of a thing has been ascertained there remains the further question of the manner of its existence in order that we may know its essence Now because we cannot know what God is but rather what He is not we have no means for considering how God is but rather how He is not Therefore we must consider one How He is not two How He is known by us three How He is named Now it can be shown how God is not by denying Him whatever is opposed to the idea of Him viz composition motion and the like Therefore one we must discuss His simplicity whereby we deny composition in Him and because whatever is simple in material things is imperfect and a part of something else we shall discuss two His perfection three His infinity four His immutability five His unity Concerning His simplicity there are eight points of inquiry one Whether God is a body two Whether He is composed of matter and form three Whether in Him there is composition of quiddity essence or nature and subject four Whether He is composed of essence and existence five Whether He is composed of genus and difference six Whether He is composed of subject and accident seven Whether He is in any way composite or wholly simple eight Whether He enters into composition with other things FIRST ARTICLE I Q three Art one Whether God Is a Body Objection one It seems that God is a body For a body is that which has the three dimensions But Holy Scripture attributes the three dimensions to God for it is written He is higher than Heaven and what wilt thou do He is deeper than Hell and how wilt thou know The measure of Him is longer than the earth and broader than the sea Job eleven eight nine Therefore God is a body Obj two Further everything that has figure is a body since figure is a quality of quantity But God seems to have figure for it is written Let us make man to our image and likeness general one twenty six Now a figure is called an image according to the text Who being the brightness of His glory and the figure i e the image of His substance Heb one three Therefore God is a body Obj three Further whatever has corporeal parts is a body Now Scripture attributes corporeal parts to God Hast thou an arm like God Job forty four and The eyes of the Lord are upon the just Ps thirty three sixteen and The right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength Ps one hundred seventeen sixteen Therefore God is a body Obj four Further posture belongs only to bodies But something which supposes posture is said of God in the Scriptures I saw the Lord sitting Isa six one and He standeth up to judge Isa three thirteen Therefore God is a body Obj five Further only bodies or things corporeal can be a local term wherefrom or whereto But in the Scriptures God is spoken of as a local term whereto according to the words Come ye to Him and be enlightened Ps thirty three six and as a term wherefrom All they that depart from Thee shall be written in the earth Jer seventeen thirteen Therefore God is a body On the contrary It is written in the Gospel of saint John John four twenty four God is a spirit I answer that It is absolutely true that God is not a body and this can be shown in three ways First because no body is in motion unless it be put in motion as is evident from induction Now it has been already proved Q two A three that God is the First Mover and is Himself unmoved Therefore it is clear that God is not a body Secondly because the first being must of necessity be in act and in no way in potentiality For although in any single thing that passes from potentiality to actuality the potentiality is prior in time to the actuality nevertheless absolutely speaking actuality is prior to potentiality for whatever is in potentiality can be reduced into actuality only by some being in actuality Now it has been already proved that God is the First Being It is therefore impossible that in God there should be any potentiality But every body is in potentiality because the continuous as such is divisible to infinity it is therefore impossible that God should be a body Thirdly because God is the most noble of beings Now it is impossible for a body to be the most noble of beings for a body must be either animate or inanimate and an animate body is manifestly nobler than any inanimate body But an animate body is not animate precisely as body otherwise all bodies would be animate Therefore its animation depends upon some other thing as our body depends for its animation on the soul Hence that by which a body becomes animated must be nobler than the body Therefore it is impossible that God should be a body Reply Obj one As we have said above Q one A nine Holy Writ puts before us spiritual and divine things under the comparison of corporeal things Hence when it attributes to God the three dimensions under the comparison of corporeal quantity it implies His virtual quantity thus by depth it signifies His power of knowing hidden things by height the transcendence of His excelling power by length the duration of His existence by breadth His act of love for all Or as says Dionysius Div Nom ix by the depth of God is meant the incomprehensibility of His essence by length the procession of His all pervading power by breadth His overspreading all things inasmuch as all things lie under His protection Reply Obj two Man is said to be after the image of God not as regards his body but as regards that whereby he excels other animals Hence when it is said Let us make man to our image and likeness it is added And let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea general one twenty six Now man excels all animals by his reason and intelligence hence it is according to his intelligence and reason which are incorporeal that man is said to be according to the image of God Reply Obj three Corporeal parts are attributed to God in Scripture on account of His actions and this is owing to a certain parallel For instance the act of the eye is to see hence the eye attributed to God signifies His power of seeing intellectually not sensibly and so on with the other parts Reply Obj four Whatever pertains to posture also is only attributed to God by some sort of parallel He is spoken of as sitting on account of His unchangeableness and dominion and as standing on account of His power of overcoming whatever withstands Him Reply Obj five We draw near to God by no corporeal steps since He is everywhere but by the affections of our soul and by the actions of that same soul do we withdraw from Him thus to draw near to or to withdraw signifies merely spiritual actions based on the metaphor of local motion SECOND ARTICLE I Q three Art two Whether God Is Composed of Matter and Form Objection one It seems that God is composed of matter and form For whatever has a soul is composed of matter and form since the soul is the form of the body But Scripture attributes a soul to God for it is mentioned in Hebrews Heb ten thirty eight where God says But My just man liveth by faith but if he withdraw himself he shall not please My soul Therefore God is composed of matter and form Obj two Further anger joy and the like are passions of the composite But these are attributed to God in Scripture The Lord was exceeding angry with His people Ps one hundred five forty Therefore God is composed of matter and form Obj three Further matter is the principle of individualization But God seems to be individual for He cannot be predicated of many 
3009_10327_000021_000005	train-clean-360	Therefore He is composed of matter and form 
none	none	On the contrary Whatever is composed of matter and form is a body for dimensive quantity is the first property of matter But God is not a body as proved in the preceding Article therefore He is not composed of matter and form I answer that It is impossible that matter should exist in God First because matter is in potentiality But we have shown Q two A three that God is pure act without any potentiality Hence it is impossible that God should be composed of matter and form Secondly because everything composed of matter and form owes its perfection and goodness to its form therefore its goodness is participated inasmuch as matter participates the form Now the first good and the best viz God is not a participated good because the essential good is prior to the participated good Hence it is impossible that God should be composed of matter and form Thirdly because every agent acts by its form hence the manner in which it has its form is the manner in which it is an agent Therefore whatever is primarily and essentially an agent must be primarily and essentially form Now God is the first agent since He is the first efficient cause He is therefore of His essence a form and not composed of matter and form Reply Obj one A soul is attributed to God because His acts resemble the acts of a soul for that we will anything is due to our soul Hence what is pleasing to His will is said to be pleasing to His soul Reply Obj two Anger and the like are attributed to God on account of a similitude of effect Thus because to punish is properly the act of an angry man God s punishment is metaphorically spoken of as His anger Reply Obj three Forms which can be received in matter are individualized by matter which cannot be in another as in a subject since it is the first underlying subject although form of itself unless something else prevents it can be received by many But that form which cannot be received in matter but is self subsisting is individualized precisely because it cannot be received in a subject and such a form is God Hence it does not follow that matter exists in God THIRD ARTICLE I Q three Art three Whether God is the Same as His Essence or Nature Objection one It seems that God is not the same as His essence or nature For nothing can be in itself But the substance or nature of God i e the Godhead is said to be in God Therefore it seems that God is not the same as His essence or nature Obj two Further the effect is assimilated to its cause for every agent produces its like But in created things the suppositum is not identical with its nature for a man is not the same as his humanity Therefore God is not the same as His Godhead On the contrary It is said of God that He is life itself and not only that He is a living thing I am the way the truth and the life John fourteen six Now the relation between Godhead and God is the same as the relation between life and a living thing Therefore God is His very Godhead I answer that God is the same as His essence or nature To understand this it must be noted that in things composed of matter and form the nature or essence must differ from the suppositum because the essence or nature connotes only what is included in the definition of the species as humanity connotes all that is included in the definition of man for it is by this that man is man and it is this that humanity signifies that namely whereby man is man Now individual matter with all the individualizing accidents is not included in the definition of the species For this particular flesh these bones this blackness or whiteness et cetera are not included in the definition of a man Therefore this flesh these bones and the accidental qualities distinguishing this particular matter are not included in humanity and yet they are included in the thing which is man Hence the thing which is a man has something more in it than has humanity Consequently humanity and a man are not wholly identical but humanity is taken to mean the formal part of a man because the principles whereby a thing is defined are regarded as the formal constituent in regard to the individualizing matter On the other hand in things not composed of matter and form in which individualization is not due to individual matter that is to say to this matter the very forms being individualized of themselves it is necessary the forms themselves should be subsisting supposita Therefore suppositum and nature in them are identified Since God then is not composed of matter and form He must be His own Godhead His own Life and whatever else is thus predicated of Him Reply Obj one We can speak of simple things only as though they were like the composite things from which we derive our knowledge Therefore in speaking of God we use concrete nouns to signify His subsistence because with us only those things subsist which are composite and we use abstract nouns to signify His simplicity In saying therefore that Godhead or life or the like are in God we indicate the composite way in which our intellect understands but not that there is any composition in God Reply Obj two The effects of God do not imitate Him perfectly but only as far as they are able and the imitation is here defective precisely because what is simple and one can only be represented by divers things consequently composition is accidental to them and therefore in them suppositum is not the same as nature FOURTH ARTICLE I Q three Art four Whether Essence and Existence Are the Same in God Objection one It seems that essence and existence are not the same in God For if it be so then the divine being has nothing added to it Now being to which no addition is made is universal being which is predicated of all things Therefore it follows that God is being in general which can be predicated of everything But this is false For men gave the incommunicable name to stones and wood Wis fourteen twenty one Therefore God s existence is not His essence Obj two Further we can know whether God exists as said above Q two A two but we cannot know what He is Therefore God s existence is not the same as His essence that is as His quiddity or nature On the contrary Hilary says Trin vii In God existence is not an accidental quality but subsisting truth Therefore what subsists in God is His existence I answer that God is not only His own essence as shown in the preceding article but also His own existence This may be shown in several ways First whatever a thing has besides its essence must be caused either by the constituent principles of that essence like a property that necessarily accompanies the species as the faculty of laughing is proper to a man and is caused by the constituent principles of the species or by some exterior agent as heat is caused in water by fire Therefore if the existence of a thing differs from its essence this existence must be caused either by some exterior agent or by its essential principles Now it is impossible for a thing s existence to be caused by its essential constituent principles for nothing can be the sufficient cause of its own existence if its existence is caused Therefore that thing whose existence differs from its essence must have its existence caused by another But this cannot be true of God because we call God the first efficient cause Therefore it is impossible that in God His existence should differ from His essence Secondly existence is that which makes every form or nature actual for goodness and humanity are spoken of as actual only because they are spoken of as existing Therefore existence must be compared to essence if the latter is a distinct reality as actuality to potentiality Therefore since in God there is no potentiality as shown above A one it follows that in Him essence does not differ from existence Therefore His essence is His existence Thirdly because just as that which has fire but is not itself fire is on fire by participation so that which has existence but is not existence is a being by participation But God is His own essence as shown above A three if therefore He is not His own existence He will be not essential but participated being He will not therefore be the first being which is absurd Therefore God is His own existence and not merely His own essence Reply Obj one A thing that has nothing added to it can be of two kinds Either its essence precludes any addition thus for example it is of the essence of an irrational animal to be without reason Or we may understand a thing to have nothing added to it inasmuch as its essence does not require that anything should be added to it thus the genus animal is without reason because it is not of the essence of animal in general to have reason but neither is it to lack reason And so the divine being has nothing added to it in the first sense whereas universal being has nothing added to it in the second sense Reply Obj two To be can mean either of two things It may mean the act of essence or it may mean the composition of a proposition effected by the mind in joining a predicate to a subject Taking to be in the first sense we cannot understand God s existence nor His essence but only in the second sense We know that this proposition which we form about God when we say God is is true and this we know from His effects Q two A two FIFTH ARTICLE I Q three Art five Whether God Is Contained in a Genus Objection one It seems that God is contained in a genus For a substance is a being that subsists of itself But this is especially true of God Therefore God is in a genus of substance Obj two Further nothing can be measured save by something of its own genus as length is measured by length and numbers by number But God is the measure of all substances as the Commentator shows Metaph x Therefore God is in the genus of substance On the contrary In the mind genus is prior to what it contains But nothing is prior to God either really or mentally Therefore God is not in any genus I answer that A thing can be in a genus in two ways either absolutely and properly as a species contained under a genus or as being reducible to it as principles and privations For example a point and unity are reduced to the genus of quantity as its principles while blindness and all other privations are reduced to the genus of habit But in neither way is God in a genus That He cannot be a species of any genus may be shown in three ways First because a species is constituted of genus and difference Now that from which the difference constituting the species is derived is always related to that from which the genus is derived as actuality is related to potentiality For animal is derived from sensitive nature by concretion as it were for that is animal which has a sensitive nature Rational being on the other hand is derived from intellectual nature because that is rational which has an intellectual nature and intelligence is compared to sense as actuality is to potentiality The same argument holds good in other things Hence since in God actuality is not added to potentiality it is impossible that He should be in any genus as a species Secondly since the existence of God is His essence if God were in any genus He would be the genus being because since genus is predicated as an essential it refers to the essence of a thing But the Philosopher has shown Metaph iii that being cannot be a genus for every genus has differences distinct from its generic essence Now no difference can exist distinct from being for non being cannot be a difference It follows then that God is not in a genus Thirdly because all in one genus agree in the quiddity or essence of the genus which is predicated of them as an essential but they differ in their existence For the existence of man and of horse is not the same as also of this man and that man thus in every member of a genus existence and quiddity i e essence must differ But in God they do not differ as shown in the preceding article Therefore it is plain that God is not in a genus as if He were a species From this it is also plain that He has no genus nor difference nor can there be any definition of Him nor save through His effects a demonstration of Him for a definition is from genus and difference and the mean of a demonstration is a definition That God is not in a genus as reducible to it as its principle is clear from this that a principle reducible to any genus does not extend beyond that genus as a point is the principle of continuous quantity alone and unity of discontinuous quantity But God is the principle of all being Therefore He is not contained in any genus as its principle Reply Obj one The word substance signifies not only what exists of itself for existence cannot of itself be a genus as shown in the body of the article but it also signifies an essence that has the property of existing in this way namely of existing of itself this existence however is not its essence Thus it is clear that God is not in the genus of substance Reply Obj two This objection turns upon proportionate measure which must be homogeneous with what is measured Now God is not a measure proportionate to anything Still He is called the measure of all things in the sense that everything has being only according as it resembles Him SIXTH ARTICLE I Q three Art six Whether in God There Are Any Accidents Objection one It seems that there are accidents in God For substance cannot be an accident as Aristotle says Phys i Therefore that which is an accident in one cannot in another be a substance Thus it is proved that heat cannot be the substantial form of fire because it is an accident in other things But wisdom virtue and the like which are accidents in us are attributes of God Therefore in God there are accidents Obj two Further in every genus there is a first principle But there are many genera of accidents If therefore the primal members of these genera are not in God there will be many primal beings other than God which is absurd On the contrary Every accident is in a subject But God cannot be a subject for no simple form can be a subject as Boethius says De Trin Therefore in God there cannot be any accident I answer that From all we have said it is clear there can be no accident in God First because a subject is compared to its accidents as potentiality to actuality for a subject is in some sense made actual by its accidents But there can be no potentiality in God as was shown Q two A three Secondly because God is His own existence and as Boethius says Hebdom although every essence may have something superadded to it this cannot apply to absolute being thus a heated substance can have something extraneous to heat added to it as whiteness nevertheless absolute heat can have nothing else than heat Thirdly because what is essential is prior to what is accidental Whence as God is absolute primal being there can be in Him nothing accidental Neither can He have any essential accidents as the capability of laughing is an essential accident of man because such accidents are caused by the constituent principles of the subject Now there can be nothing caused in God since He is the first cause Hence it follows that there is no accident in God Reply Obj one Virtue and wisdom are not predicated of God and of us univocally Hence it does not follow that there are accidents in God as there are in us Reply Obj two Since substance is prior to its accidents the principles of accidents are reducible to the principles of the substance as to that which is prior although God is not first as if contained in the genus of substance yet He is first in respect to all being outside of every genus SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q three Art seven Whether God Is Altogether Simple Objection one It seems that God is not altogether simple For whatever is from God must imitate Him Thus from the first being are all beings and from the first good is all good But in the things which God has made nothing is altogether simple Therefore neither is God altogether simple Obj two Further whatever is best must be attributed to God But with us that which is composite is better than that which is simple thus chemical compounds are better than simple elements and animals than the parts that compose them Therefore it cannot be said that God is altogether simple On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iv sixty seven God is truly and absolutely simple I answer that The absolute simplicity of God may be shown in many ways First from the previous articles of this question For there is neither composition of quantitative parts in God since He is not a body nor composition of matter and form nor does His nature differ from His suppositum nor His essence from His existence neither is there in Him composition of genus and difference nor of subject and accident Therefore it is clear that God is nowise composite but is altogether simple Secondly because every composite is posterior to its component parts and is dependent on them but God is the first being as shown above Q two A three Thirdly because every composite has a cause for things in themselves different cannot unite unless something causes them to unite But God is uncaused as shown above Q two A three since He is the first efficient cause Fourthly because in every composite there must be potentiality and actuality but this does not apply to God for either one of the parts actuates another or at least all the parts are potential to the whole Fifthly because nothing composite can be predicated of any single one of its parts And this is evident in a whole made up of dissimilar parts for no part of a man is a man nor any of the parts of the foot a foot But in wholes made up of similar parts although something which is predicated of the whole may be predicated of a part as a part of the air is air and a part of water water nevertheless certain things are predicable of the whole which cannot be predicated of any of the parts for instance if the whole volume of water is two cubits no part of it can be two cubits Thus in every composite there is something which is not it itself But even if this could be said of whatever has a form viz that it has something which is not it itself as in a white object there is something which does not belong to the essence of white nevertheless in the form itself there is nothing besides itself And so since God is absolute form or rather absolute being He can be in no way composite Hilary implies this argument when he says De Trin vii God Who is strength is not made up of things that are weak nor is He Who is light composed of things that are dim Reply Obj one Whatever is from God imitates Him as caused things imitate the first cause But it is of the essence of a thing to be in some sort composite because at least its existence differs from its essence as will be shown hereafter Q four A three Reply Obj two With us composite things are better than simple things because the perfections of created goodness cannot be found in one simple thing but in many things But the perfection of divine goodness is found in one simple thing QQ four A one and six A two EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q three Art eight Whether God Enters into the Composition of Other Things Objection one It seems that God enters into the composition of other things for Dionysius says Coel Hier iv The being of all things is that which is above being the Godhead But the being of all things enters into the composition of everything Therefore God enters into the composition of other things Obj two Further God is a form 
7107-245689-0004	train-other-500	for Augustine says
none	none	 De Verb Dom Serm xxxviii that the word of God which is God is an uncreated form But a form is part of a compound Therefore God is part of some compound Obj three Further whatever things exist in no way differing from each other are the same But God and primary matter exist and in no way differ from each other Therefore they are absolutely the same But primary matter enters into the composition things Therefore also does God Proof of the minor whatever things differ they differ by some differences and therefore must be composite But God and primary matter are altogether simple Therefore they nowise differ from each other On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom ii There can be no touching Him i e God nor any other union with Him by mingling part with part Further the first cause rules all things without commingling with them as the Philosopher says De Causis I answer that On this point there have been three errors Some have affirmed that God is the world soul as is clear from Augustine De Civ Dei vii six This is practically the same as the opinion of those who assert that God is the soul of the highest heaven Again others have said that God is the formal principle of all things and this was the theory of the Almaricians The third error is that of David of Dinant who most absurdly taught that God was primary matter Now all these contain manifest untruth since it is not possible for God to enter into the composition of anything either as a formal or a material principle First because God is the first efficient cause Now the efficient cause is not identical numerically with the form of the thing caused but only specifically for man begets man But primary matter can be neither numerically nor specifically identical with an efficient cause for the former is merely potential while the latter is actual Secondly because since God is the first efficient cause to act belongs to Him primarily and essentially But that which enters into composition with anything does not act primarily and essentially but rather the composite so acts for the hand does not act but the man by his hand and fire warms by its heat Hence God cannot be part of a compound Thirdly because no part of a compound can be absolutely primal among beings not even matter nor form though they are the primal parts of every compound For matter is merely potential and potentiality is absolutely posterior to actuality as is clear from the foregoing Q three A one while a form which is part of a compound is a participated form and as that which participates is posterior to that which is essential so likewise is that which is participated as fire in ignited objects is posterior to fire that is essentially such Now it has been proved that God is absolutely primal being Q two A three Reply Obj one The Godhead is called the being of all things as their efficient and exemplar cause but not as being their essence Reply Obj two The Word is an exemplar form but not a form that is part of a compound Reply Obj three Simple things do not differ by added differences for this is the property of compounds Thus man and horse differ by their differences rational and irrational which differences however do not differ from each other by other differences Hence to be quite accurate it is better to say that they are not different but diverse Hence according to the Philosopher Metaph x things which are diverse are absolutely distinct but things which are different differ by something Therefore strictly speaking primary matter and God do not differ but are by their very being diverse Hence it does not follow they are the same QUESTION four THE PERFECTION OF GOD In Three Articles Having considered the divine simplicity we treat next of God s perfection Now because everything in so far as it is perfect is called good we shall speak first of the divine perfection secondly of the divine goodness Concerning the first there are three points of inquiry one Whether God is perfect two Whether God is perfect universally as having in Himself the perfections of all things three Whether creatures can be said to be like God FIRST ARTICLE I Q four Art one Whether God is Perfect Objection one It seems that perfection does not belong to God For we say a thing is perfect if it is completely made But it does not befit God to be made Therefore He is not perfect Obj two Further God is the first beginning of things But the beginnings of things seem to be imperfect as seed is the beginning of animal and vegetable life Therefore God is imperfect Obj three Further as shown above Q three A four God s essence is existence But existence seems most imperfect since it is most universal and receptive of all modification Therefore God is imperfect On the contrary It is written Be you perfect as also your heavenly Father is perfect Matt five forty eight I answer that As the Philosopher relates Metaph xii some ancient philosophers namely the Pythagoreans and Leucippus did not predicate best and most perfect of the first principle The reason was that the ancient philosophers considered only a material principle and a material principle is most imperfect For since matter as such is merely potential the first material principle must be simply potential and thus most imperfect Now God is the first principle not material but in the order of efficient cause which must be most perfect For just as matter as such is merely potential an agent as such is in the state of actuality Hence the first active principle must needs be most actual and therefore most perfect for a thing is perfect in proportion to its state of actuality because we call that perfect which lacks nothing of the mode of its perfection Reply Obj one As Gregory says Moral v twenty six twenty nine Though our lips can only stammer we yet chant the high things of God For that which is not made is improperly called perfect Nevertheless because created things are then called perfect when from potentiality they are brought into actuality this word perfect signifies whatever is not wanting in actuality whether this be by way of perfection or not Reply Obj two The material principle which with us is found to be imperfect cannot be absolutely primal but must be preceded by something perfect For seed though it be the principle of animal life reproduced through seed has previous to it the animal or plant from which is came Because previous to that which is potential must be that which is actual since a potential being can only be reduced into act by some being already actual Reply Obj three Existence is the most perfect of all things for it is compared to all things as that by which they are made actual for nothing has actuality except so far as it exists Hence existence is that which actuates all things even their forms Therefore it is not compared to other things as the receiver is to the received but rather as the received to the receiver When therefore I speak of the existence of man or horse or anything else existence is considered a formal principle and as something received and not as that which exists SECOND ARTICLE I Q four Art two Whether the Perfections of All Things Are in God Objection one It seems that the perfections of all things are not in God For God is simple as shown above Q three A seven whereas the perfections of things are many and diverse Therefore the perfections of all things are not in God Obj two Further opposites cannot coexist Now the perfections of things are opposed to each other for each thing is perfected by its specific difference But the differences by which genera are divided and species constituted are opposed to each other Therefore because opposites cannot coexist in the same subject it seems that the perfections of all things are not in God Obj three Further a living thing is more perfect than what merely exists and an intelligent thing than what merely lives Therefore life is more perfect than existence and knowledge than life But the essence of God is existence itself Therefore He has not the perfections of life and knowledge and other similar perfections On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom v that God in His one existence prepossesses all things I answer that All created perfections are in God Hence He is spoken of as universally perfect because He lacks not says the Commentator Metaph v any excellence which may be found in any genus This may be seen from two considerations First because whatever perfection exists in an effect must be found in the effective cause either in the same formality if it is a univocal agent as when man reproduces man or in a more eminent degree if it is an equivocal agent thus in the sun is the likeness of whatever is generated by the sun s power Now it is plain that the effect pre exists virtually in the efficient cause and although to pre exist in the potentiality of a material cause is to pre exist in a more imperfect way since matter as such is imperfect and an agent as such is perfect still to pre exist virtually in the efficient cause is to pre exist not in a more imperfect but in a more perfect way Since therefore God is the first effective cause of things the perfections of all things must pre exist in God in a more eminent way Dionysius implies the same line of argument by saying of God Div Nom v It is not that He is this and not that but that He is all as the cause of all Secondly from what has been already proved God is existence itself of itself subsistent Q three A four Consequently He must contain within Himself the whole perfection of being For it is clear that if some hot thing has not the whole perfection of heat this is because heat is not participated in its full perfection but if this heat were self subsisting nothing of the virtue of heat would be wanting to it Since therefore God is subsisting being itself nothing of the perfection of being can be wanting to Him Now all created perfections are included in the perfection of being for things are perfect precisely so far as they have being after some fashion It follows therefore that the perfection of no one thing is wanting to God This line of argument too is implied by Dionysius Div Nom v when he says that God exists not in any single mode but embraces all being within Himself absolutely without limitation uniformly and afterwards he adds that He is the very existence to subsisting things Reply Obj one Even as the sun as Dionysius remarks Div Nom v while remaining one and shining uniformly contains within itself first and uniformly the substances of sensible things and many and diverse qualities a fortiori should all things in a kind of natural unity pre exist in the cause of all things and thus things diverse and in themselves opposed to each other pre exist in God as one without injury to His simplicity This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection Reply Obj three The same Dionysius says Div Nom v that although existence is more perfect than life and life than wisdom if they are considered as distinguished in idea nevertheless a living thing is more perfect than what merely exists because living things also exist and intelligent things both exist and live Although therefore existence does not include life and wisdom because that which participates in existence need not participate in every mode of existence nevertheless God s existence includes in itself life and wisdom because nothing of the perfection of being can be wanting to Him who is subsisting being itself THIRD ARTICLE I Q four Art three Whether Any Creature Can Be Like God Objection one It seems that no creature can be like God For it is written Ps eighty five eight There is none among the gods like unto Thee O Lord But of all creatures the most excellent are those which are called by participation gods Therefore still less can other creatures be said to be like God Obj two Further likeness implies comparison But there can be no comparison between things in a different genus Therefore neither can there be any likeness Thus we do not say that sweetness is like whiteness But no creature is in the same genus as God since God is no genus as shown above Q three A five Therefore no creature is like God Obj three Further we speak of those things as like which agree in form But nothing can agree with God in form for save in God alone essence and existence differ Therefore no creature can be like to God Obj four Further among like things there is mutual likeness for like is like to like If therefore any creature is like God God will be like some creature which is against what is said by Isaias To whom have you likened God Isa forty eighteen On the contrary It is written Let us make man to our image and likeness general one twenty six and When He shall appear we shall be like to Him one John three two I answer that Since likeness is based upon agreement or communication in form it varies according to the many modes of communication in form Some things are said to be like which communicate in the same form according to the same formality and according to the same mode and these are said to be not merely like but equal in their likeness as two things equally white are said to be alike in whiteness and this is the most perfect likeness In another way we speak of things as alike which communicate in form according to the same formality though not according to the same measure but according to more or less as something less white is said to be like another thing more white and this is imperfect likeness In a third way some things are said to be alike which communicate in the same form but not according to the same formality as we see in non univocal agents For since every agent reproduces itself so far as it is an agent and everything acts according to the manner of its form the effect must in some way resemble the form of the agent If therefore the agent is contained in the same species as its effect there will be a likeness in form between that which makes and that which is made according to the same formality of the species as man reproduces man If however the agent and its effect are not contained in the same species there will be a likeness but not according to the formality of the same species as things generated by the sun s heat may be in some sort spoken of as like the sun not as though they received the form of the sun in its specific likeness but in its generic likeness Therefore if there is an agent not contained in any genus its effect will still more distantly reproduce the form of the agent not that is so as to participate in the likeness of the agent s form according to the same specific or generic formality but only according to some sort of analogy as existence is common to all In this way all created things so far as they are beings are like God as the first and universal principle of all being Reply Obj one As Dionysius says Div Nom ix when Holy Writ declares that nothing is like God it does not mean to deny all likeness to Him For the same things can be like and unlike to God like according as they imitate Him as far as He Who is not perfectly imitable can be imitated unlike according as they fall short of their cause not merely in intensity and remission as that which is less white falls short of that which is more white but because they are not in agreement specifically or generically Reply Obj two God is not related to creatures as though belonging to a different genus but as transcending every genus and as the principle of all genera Reply Obj three Likeness of creatures to God is not affirmed on account of agreement in form according to the formality of the same genus or species but solely according to analogy inasmuch as God is essential being whereas other things are beings by participation Reply Obj four Although it may be admitted that creatures are in some sort like God it must nowise be admitted that God is like creatures because as Dionysius says Div Nom ix A mutual likeness may be found between things of the same order but not between a cause and that which is caused For we say that a statue is like a man but not conversely so also a creature can be spoken of as in some sort like God but not that God is like a creature QUESTION five OF GOODNESS IN GENERAL In Six Articles We next consider goodness First goodness in general Secondly the goodness of God Under the first head there are six points of inquiry one Whether goodness and being are the same really two Granted that they differ only in idea which is prior in thought three Granted that being is prior whether every being is good four To what cause should goodness be reduced five Whether goodness consists in mode species and order six Whether goodness is divided into the virtuous the useful and the pleasant FIRST ARTICLE I Q five Art one Whether Goodness Differs Really from Being Objection one It seems that goodness differs really from being For Boethius says De Hebdom I perceive that in nature the fact that things are good is one thing that they are is another Therefore goodness and being really differ Obj two Further nothing can be its own form But that is called good which has the form of being according to the commentary on De Causis Therefore goodness differs really from being Obj three Further goodness can be more or less But being cannot be more or less Therefore goodness differs really from being On the contrary Augustine says De Doctr Christ i forty two that inasmuch as we exist we are good I answer that Goodness and being are really the same and differ only in idea which is clear from the following argument The essence of goodness consists in this that it is in some way desirable Hence the Philosopher says Ethic i Goodness is what all desire 
7107-245689-0112	train-other-500	Now it is clear
none	none	 that a thing is desirable only in so far as it is perfect for all desire their own perfection But everything is perfect so far as it is actual Therefore it is clear that a thing is perfect so far as it exists for it is existence that makes all things actual as is clear from the foregoing Q three A four Q four A one Hence it is clear that goodness and being are the same really But goodness presents the aspect of desirableness which being does not present Reply Obj one Although goodness and being are the same really nevertheless since they differ in thought they are not predicated of a thing absolutely in the same way Since being properly signifies that something actually is and actuality properly correlates to potentiality a thing is in consequence said simply to have being accordingly as it is primarily distinguished from that which is only in potentiality and this is precisely each thing s substantial being Hence by its substantial being everything is said to have being simply but by any further actuality it is said to have being relatively Thus to be white implies relative being for to be white does not take a thing out of simply potential being because only a thing that actually has being can receive this mode of being But goodness signifies perfection which is desirable and consequently of ultimate perfection Hence that which has ultimate perfection is said to be simply good but that which has not the ultimate perfection it ought to have although in so far as it is at all actual it has some perfection is not said to be perfect simply nor good simply but only relatively In this way therefore viewed in its primal i e substantial being a thing is said to be simply and to be good relatively i e in so far as it has being but viewed in its complete actuality a thing is said to be relatively and to be good simply Hence the saying of Boethius De Hebdom I perceive that in nature the fact that things are good is one thing that they are is another is to be referred to a thing s goodness simply and having being simply Because regarded in its primal actuality a thing simply exists and regarded in its complete actuality it is good simply in such sort that even in its primal actuality it is in some sort good and even in its complete actuality it in some sort has being Reply Obj two Goodness is a form so far as absolute goodness signifies complete actuality Reply Obj three Again goodness is spoken of as more or less according to a thing s superadded actuality for example as to knowledge or virtue SECOND ARTICLE I Q five Art two Whether Goodness Is Prior in Idea to Being Objection one It seems that goodness is prior in idea to being For names are arranged according to the arrangement of the things signified by the names But Dionysius Div Nom iii assigned the first place amongst the other names of God to His goodness rather than to His being Therefore in idea goodness is prior to being Obj two Further that which is the more extensive is prior in idea But goodness is more extensive than being because as Dionysius notes Div Nom v goodness extends to things both existing and non existing whereas existence extends to existing things alone Therefore goodness is in idea prior to being Obj three Further what is the more universal is prior in idea But goodness seems to be more universal than being since goodness has the aspect of desirable whereas to some non existence is desirable for it is said of Judas It were better for him if that man had not been born Matt twenty six twenty four Therefore in idea goodness is prior to being Obj four Further not only is existence desirable but life knowledge and many other things besides Thus it seems that existence is a particular appetible and goodness a universal appetible Therefore absolutely goodness is prior in idea to being On the contrary It is said by Aristotle De Causis that the first of created things is being I answer that In idea being is prior to goodness For the meaning signified by the name of a thing is that which the mind conceives of the thing and intends by the word that stands for it Therefore that is prior in idea which is first conceived by the intellect Now the first thing conceived by the intellect is being because everything is knowable only inasmuch as it is in actuality Hence being is the proper object of the intellect and is primarily intelligible as sound is that which is primarily audible Therefore in idea being is prior to goodness Reply Obj one Dionysius discusses the Divine Names Div Nom i iii as implying some causal relation in God for we name God as he says from creatures as a cause from its effects But goodness since it has the aspect of desirable implies the idea of a final cause the causality of which is first among causes since an agent does not act except for some end and by an agent matter is moved to its form Hence the end is called the cause of causes Thus goodness as a cause is prior to being as is the end to the form Therefore among the names signifying the divine causality goodness precedes being Again according to the Platonists who through not distinguishing primary matter from privation said that matter was non being goodness is more extensively participated than being for primary matter participates in goodness as tending to it for all seek their like but it does not participate in being since it is presumed to be non being Therefore Dionysius says that goodness extends to non existence Div Nom v Reply Obj two The same solution is applied to this objection Or it may be said that goodness extends to existing and non existing things not so far as it can be predicated of them but so far as it can cause them if indeed by non existence we understand not simply those things which do not exist but those which are potential and not actual For goodness has the aspect of the end in which not only actual things find their completion but also towards which tend even those things which are not actual but merely potential Now being implies the habitude of a formal cause only either inherent or exemplar and its causality does not extend save to those things which are actual Reply Obj three Non being is desirable not of itself but only relatively i e inasmuch as the removal of an evil which can only be removed by non being is desirable Now the removal of an evil cannot be desirable except so far as this evil deprives a thing of some being Therefore being is desirable of itself and non being only relatively inasmuch as one seeks some mode of being of which one cannot bear to be deprived thus even non being can be spoken of as relatively good Reply Obj four Life wisdom and the like are desirable only so far as they are actual Hence in each one of them some sort of being is desired And thus nothing can be desired except being and consequently nothing is good except being THIRD ARTICLE I Q five Art three Whether Every Being Is Good Objection one It seems that not every being is good For goodness is something superadded to being as is clear from A one But whatever is added to being limits it as substance quantity quality et cetera Therefore goodness limits being Therefore not every being is good Obj two Further no evil is good Woe to you that call evil good and good evil Isa five twenty But some things are called evil Therefore not every being is good Obj three Further goodness implies desirability Now primary matter does not imply desirability but rather that which desires Therefore primary matter does not contain the formality of goodness Therefore not every being is good Obj four Further the Philosopher notes Metaph iii that in mathematics goodness does not exist But mathematics are entities otherwise there would be no science of mathematics Therefore not every being is good On the contrary Every being that is not God is God s creature Now every creature of God is good one Tim four four and God is the greatest good Therefore every being is good I answer that Every being as being is good For all being as being has actuality and is in some way perfect since every act implies some sort of perfection and perfection implies desirability and goodness as is clear from A one Hence it follows that every being as such is good Reply Obj one Substance quantity quality and everything included in them limit being by applying it to some essence or nature Now in this sense goodness does not add anything to being beyond the aspect of desirability and perfection which is also proper to being whatever kind of nature it may be Hence goodness does not limit being Reply Obj two No being can be spoken of as evil formally as being but only so far as it lacks being Thus a man is said to be evil because he lacks some virtue and an eye is said to be evil because it lacks the power to see well Reply Obj three As primary matter has only potential being so it is only potentially good Although according to the Platonists primary matter may be said to be a non being on account of the privation attaching to it nevertheless it does participate to a certain extent in goodness viz by its relation to or aptitude for goodness Consequently to be desirable is not its property but to desire Reply Obj four Mathematical entities do not subsist as realities because they would be in some sort good if they subsisted but they have only logical existence inasmuch as they are abstracted from motion and matter thus they cannot have the aspect of an end which itself has the aspect of moving another Nor is it repugnant that there should be in some logical entity neither goodness nor form of goodness since the idea of being is prior to the idea of goodness as was said in the preceding article FOURTH ARTICLE I Q five Art four Whether Goodness Has the Aspect of a Final Cause Objection one It seems that goodness has not the aspect of a final cause but rather of the other causes For as Dionysius says Div Nom iv Goodness is praised as beauty But beauty has the aspect of a formal cause Therefore goodness has the aspect of a formal cause Obj two Further goodness is self diffusive for Dionysius says Div Nom iv that goodness is that whereby all things subsist and are But to be self giving implies the aspect of an efficient cause Therefore goodness has the aspect of an efficient cause Obj three Further Augustine says De Doctr Christ i thirty one that we exist because God is good But we owe our existence to God as the efficient cause Therefore goodness implies the aspect of an efficient cause 
7326-245693-0037	train-other-500	On the contrary The Philosopher
none	none	 says Phys ii that that is to be considered as the end and the good of other things for the sake of which something is Therefore goodness has the aspect of a final cause I answer that Since goodness is that which all things desire and since this has the aspect of an end it is clear that goodness implies the aspect of an end Nevertheless the idea of goodness presupposes the idea of an efficient cause and also of a formal cause For we see that what is first in causing is last in the thing caused Fire e g heats first of all before it reproduces the form of fire though the heat in the fire follows from its substantial form Now in causing goodness and the end come first both of which move the agent to act secondly the action of the agent moving to the form thirdly comes the form Hence in that which is caused the converse ought to take place so that there should be first the form whereby it is a being secondly we consider in it its effective power whereby it is perfect in being for a thing is perfect when it can reproduce its like as the Philosopher says Meteor iv thirdly there follows the formality of goodness which is the basic principle of its perfection Reply Obj one Beauty and goodness in a thing are identical fundamentally for they are based upon the same thing namely the form and consequently goodness is praised as beauty But they differ logically for goodness properly relates to the appetite goodness being what all things desire and therefore it has the aspect of an end the appetite being a kind of movement towards a thing On the other hand beauty relates to the cognitive faculty for beautiful things are those which please when seen Hence beauty consists in due proportion for the senses delight in things duly proportioned as in what is after their own kind because even sense is a sort of reason just as is every cognitive faculty Now since knowledge is by assimilation and similarity relates to form beauty properly belongs to the nature of a formal cause Reply Obj two Goodness is described as self diffusive in the sense that an end is said to move Reply Obj three He who has a will is said to be good so far as he has a good will because it is by our will that we employ whatever powers we may have Hence a man is said to be good not by his good understanding but by his good will Now the will relates to the end as to its proper object Thus the saying we exist because God is good has reference to the final cause FIFTH ARTICLE I Q five Art five Whether the Essence of Goodness Consists in Mode Species and Order Objection one It seems that the essence of goodness does not consist in mode species and order For goodness and being differ logically But mode species and order seem to belong to the nature of being for it is written Thou hast ordered all things in measure and number and weight Wis eleven twenty one And to these three can be reduced species mode and order as Augustine says general ad lit iv three Measure fixes the mode of everything number gives it its species and weight gives it rest and stability Therefore the essence of goodness does not consist in mode species and order Obj two Further mode species and order are themselves good Therefore if the essence of goodness consists in mode species and order then every mode must have its own mode species and order The same would be the case with species and order in endless succession Obj three Further evil is the privation of mode species and order But evil is not the total absence of goodness Therefore the essence of goodness does not consist in mode species and order Obj four Further that wherein consists the essence of goodness cannot be spoken of as evil Yet we can speak of an evil mode species and order Therefore the essence of goodness does not consist in mode species and order Obj five Further mode species and order are caused by weight number and measure as appears from the quotation from Augustine But not every good thing has weight number and measure for Ambrose says Hexam i nine It is of the nature of light not to have been created in number weight and measure Therefore the essence of goodness does not consist in mode species and order On the contrary Augustine says De Nat Boni iii These three mode species and order as common good things are in everything God has made thus where these three abound the things are very good where they are less the things are less good where they do not exist at all there can be nothing good But this would not be unless the essence of goodness consisted in them Therefore the essence of goodness consists in mode species and order I answer that Everything is said to be good so far as it is perfect for in that way only is it desirable as shown above AA one three Now a thing is said to be perfect if it lacks nothing according to the mode of its perfection But since everything is what it is by its form and since the form presupposes certain things and from the form certain things necessarily follow in order for a thing to be perfect and good it must have a form together with all that precedes and follows upon that form Now the form presupposes determination or commensuration of its principles whether material or efficient and this is signified by the mode hence it is said that the measure marks the mode But the form itself is signified by the species for everything is placed in its species by its form Hence the number is said to give the species for definitions signifying species are like numbers according to the Philosopher Metaph x for as a unit added to or taken from a number changes its species so a difference added to or taken from a definition changes its species Further upon the form follows an inclination to the end or to an action or something of the sort for everything in so far as it is in act acts and tends towards that which is in accordance with its form and this belongs to weight and order Hence the essence of goodness so far as it consists in perfection consists also in mode species and order Reply Obj one These three only follow upon being so far as it is perfect and according to this perfection is it good Reply Obj two Mode species and order are said to be good and to be beings not as though they themselves were subsistences but because it is through them that other things are both beings and good Hence they have no need of other things whereby they are good for they are spoken of as good not as though formally constituted so by something else but as formally constituting others good thus whiteness is not said to be a being as though it were by anything else but because by it something else has accidental being as an object that is white Reply Obj three Every being is due to some form Hence according to every being of a thing is its mode species order Thus a man has a mode species and order as he is white virtuous learned and so on according to everything predicated of him But evil deprives a thing of some sort of being as blindness deprives us of that being which is sight yet it does not destroy every mode species and order but only such as follow upon the being of sight Reply Obj four Augustine says De Nat Boni xxiii Every mode as mode is good and the same can be said of species and order But an evil mode species and order are so called as being less than they ought to be or as not belonging to that which they ought to belong Therefore they are called evil because they are out of place and incongruous Reply Obj five The nature of light is spoken of as being without number weight and measure not absolutely but in comparison with corporeal things because the power of light extends to all corporeal things inasmuch as it is an active quality of the first body that causes change i e the heavens SIXTH ARTICLE I Q five Art six Whether Goodness Is Rightly Divided into the Virtuous the Useful and the Pleasant Bonum honestum is the virtuous good considered as fitting Cf II II Q one hundred forty one A three Q one hundred forty five Objection one It seems that goodness is not rightly divided into the virtuous the useful and the pleasant For goodness is divided by the ten predicaments as the Philosopher says Ethic i But the virtuous the useful and the pleasant can be found under one predicament Therefore goodness is not rightly divided by them Obj two Further every division is made by opposites But these three do not seem to be opposites for the virtuous is pleasing and no wickedness is useful whereas this ought to be the case if the division were made by opposites for then the virtuous and the useful would be opposed and Tully speaks of this De Offic ii Therefore this division is incorrect Obj three Further where one thing is on account of another there is only one thing But the useful is not goodness except so far as it is pleasing and virtuous Therefore the useful ought not to divided against the pleasant and the virtuous On the contrary Ambrose makes use of this division of goodness De Offic i nine I answer that This division properly concerns human goodness But if we consider the nature of goodness from a higher and more universal point of view we shall find that this division properly concerns goodness as such For everything is good so far as it is desirable and is a term of the movement of the appetite the term of whose movement can be seen from a consideration of the movement of a natural body Now the movement of a natural body is terminated by the end absolutely and relatively by the means through which it comes to the end where the movement ceases so a thing is called a term of movement so far as it terminates any part of that movement Now the ultimate term of movement can be taken in two ways either as the thing itself towards which it tends e g a place or form or a state of rest in that thing Thus in the movement of the appetite the thing desired that terminates the movement of the appetite relatively as a means by which something tends towards another is called the useful but that sought after as the last thing absolutely terminating the movement of the appetite as a thing towards which for its own sake the appetite tends is called the virtuous for the virtuous is that which is desired for its own sake but that which terminates the movement of the appetite in the form of rest in the thing desired is called the pleasant Reply Obj one Goodness so far as it is identical with being is divided by the ten predicaments But this division belongs to it according to its proper formality Reply Obj two This division is not by opposite things but by opposite aspects Now those things are called pleasing which have no other formality under which they are desirable except the pleasant being sometimes hurtful and contrary to virtue Whereas the useful applies to such as have nothing desirable in themselves but are desired only as helpful to something further as the taking of bitter medicine while the virtuous is predicated of such as are desirable in themselves Reply Obj three Goodness is not divided into these three as something univocal to be predicated equally of them all but as something analogical to be predicated of them according to priority and posteriority Hence it is predicated chiefly of the virtuous then of the pleasant and lastly of the useful QUESTION six THE GOODNESS OF GOD In Four Articles We next consider the goodness of God under which head there are four points of inquiry one Whether goodness belongs to God two Whether God is the supreme good three Whether He alone is essentially good four Whether all things are good by the divine goodness FIRST ARTICLE I Q six Art one Whether God is good Objection one It seems that to be good does not belong to God For goodness consists in mode species and order But these do not seem to belong to God since God is immense and is not ordered to anything else Therefore to be good does not belong to God Obj two Further the good is what all things desire But all things do not desire God because all things do not know Him and nothing is desired unless it is known Therefore to be good does not belong to God On the contrary It is written Lam three twenty five The Lord is good to them that hope in Him to the soul that seeketh Him I answer that To be good belongs pre eminently to God For a thing is good according to its desirableness Now everything seeks after its own perfection and the perfection and form of an effect consist in a certain likeness to the agent since every agent makes its like and hence the agent itself is desirable and has the nature of good For the very thing which is desirable in it is the participation of its likeness Therefore since God is the first effective cause of all things it is manifest that the aspect of good and of desirableness belong to Him and hence Dionysius Div Nom iv attributes good to God as to the first efficient cause saying that God is called good as by Whom all things subsist Reply Obj one To have mode species and order belongs to the essence of caused good but good is in God as in its cause and hence it belongs to Him to impose mode species and order on others wherefore these three things are in God as in their cause Reply Obj two All things by desiring their own perfection desire God Himself inasmuch as the perfections of all things are so many similitudes of the divine being as appears from what is said above Q four A three And so of those things which desire God some know Him as He is Himself and this is proper to the rational creature others know some participation of His goodness and this belongs also to sensible knowledge others have a natural desire without knowledge as being directed to their ends by a higher intelligence SECOND ARTICLE I Q six Art two Whether God Is the Supreme Good Objection one It seems that God is not the supreme good For the supreme good adds something to good otherwise it would belong to every good But everything which is an addition to anything else is a compound thing therefore the supreme good is a compound But God is supremely simple as was shown above Q three A seven Therefore God is not the supreme good Obj two Further Good is what all desire as the Philosopher says Ethic i one Now what all desire is nothing but God Who is the end of all things therefore there is no other good but God This appears also from what is said Luke eighteen nineteen None is good but God alone But we use the word supreme in comparison with others as e g supreme heat is used in comparison with all other heats Therefore God cannot be called the supreme good Obj three Further supreme implies comparison But things not in the same genus are not comparable as sweetness is not properly greater or less than a line Therefore since God is not in the same genus as other good things as appears above QQ three A five four A three it seems that God cannot be called the supreme good in relation to others On the contrary Augustine says De Trin ii that the Trinity of the divine persons is the supreme good discerned by purified minds I answer that God is the supreme good simply and not only as existing in any genus or order of things For good is attributed to God as was said in the preceding article inasmuch as all desired perfections flow from Him as from the first cause They do not however flow from Him as from a univocal agent as shown above Q four A two but as from an agent which does not agree with its effects either in species or genus Now the likeness of an effect in the univocal cause is found uniformly but in the equivocal cause it is found more excellently as heat is in the sun more excellently than it is in fire Therefore as good is in God as in the first but not the univocal cause of all things it must be in Him in a most excellent way and therefore He is called the supreme good Reply Obj one The supreme good does not add to good any absolute thing but only a relation Now a relation of God to creatures is not a reality in God but in the creature for it is in God in our idea only as what is knowable is so called with relation to knowledge not that it depends on knowledge but because knowledge depends on it Thus it is not necessary that there should be composition in the supreme good but only that other things are deficient in comparison with it Reply Obj two When we say that good is what all desire it is not to be understood that every kind of good thing is desired by all but that whatever is desired has the nature of good And when it is said None is good but God alone this is to be understood of essential goodness as will be explained in the next article Reply Obj three Things not of the same genus are in no way comparable to each other if indeed they are in different genera Now we say that God is not in the same genus with other good things not that He is any other genus but that He is outside genus and is the principle of every genus and thus He is compared to others by excess and it is this kind of comparison the supreme good implies THIRD ARTICLE I Q six Art three Whether to Be Essentially Good Belongs to God Alone Objection one It seems that to be essentially good does not belong to God alone For as one is convertible with being so is good as we said above Q five A one But every being is one essentially as appears from the Philosopher Metaph iv therefore every being is good essentially Obj two Further if good is what all things desire since being itself is desired by all then the being of each thing is its good But everything is a being essentially therefore every being is good essentially Obj three Further everything is good by its own goodness Therefore if there is anything which is not good essentially it is necessary to say that its goodness is not its own essence Therefore its goodness since it is a being must be good and if it is good by some other goodness the same question applies to that goodness also therefore we must either proceed to infinity or come to some goodness which is not good by any other goodness Therefore the first supposition holds good Therefore everything is good essentially On the contrary Boethius says De Hebdom that all things but God are good by participation Therefore they are not good essentially I answer that God alone is good essentially For everything is called good according to its perfection Now perfection of a thing is threefold first according to the constitution of its own being secondly in respect of any accidents being added as necessary for its perfect operation thirdly perfection consists in the attaining to something else as the end Thus for instance the first perfection of fire consists in its existence which it has through its own substantial form its secondary perfection consists in heat lightness and dryness and the like its third perfection is to rest in its own place This triple perfection belongs to no creature by its own essence it belongs to God only in Whom alone essence is existence in Whom there are no accidents since whatever belongs to others accidentally belongs to Him essentially as to be powerful wise and the like as appears from what is stated above Q three A six and He is not directed to anything else as to an end but is Himself the last end of all things Hence it is manifest that God alone has every kind of perfection by His own essence therefore He Himself alone is good essentially Reply Obj one One does not include the idea of perfection but only of indivision which belongs to everything according to its own essence Now the essences of simple things are undivided both actually and potentially but the essences of compounds are undivided only actually and therefore everything must be one essentially but not good essentially as was shown above Reply Obj two Although everything is good in that it has being yet the essence of a creature is not very being and therefore it does not follow that a creature is good essentially Reply Obj three The goodness of a creature is not its very essence but something superadded it is either its existence or some added perfection or the order to its end Still the goodness itself thus added is good just as it is being But for this reason is it called being because by it something has being not because it itself has being through something else hence for this reason is it called good because by it something is good and not because it itself has some other goodness whereby it is good FOURTH ARTICLE I Q six Art four Whether All Things Are Good by the Divine Goodness Objection one It seems that all things are good by the divine goodness For Augustine says De Trin viii This and that are good take away this and that and see good itself if thou canst and so thou shalt see God good not by any other good but the good of every good But everything is good by its own good therefore everything is good by that very good which is God Obj two Further as Boethius says De Hebdom all things are called good accordingly as they are directed to God and this is by reason of the divine goodness therefore all things are good by the divine goodness On the contrary All things are good inasmuch as they have being But they are not called beings through the divine being but through their own being therefore all things are not good by the divine goodness but by their own goodness I answer that As regards relative things we must admit extrinsic denomination as a thing is denominated placed from place and measured from measure But as regards absolute things opinions differ Plato held the existence of separate ideas Q eighty four A four of all things and that individuals were denominated by them as participating in the separate ideas for instance that Socrates is called man according to the separate idea of man Now just as he laid down separate ideas of man and horse which he called absolute man and absolute horse so likewise he laid down separate ideas of being and of one and these he called absolute being and absolute oneness and by participation of these everything was called being or one and what was thus absolute being and absolute one he said was the supreme good And because good is convertible with being as one is also he called God the absolute good from whom all things are called good by way of participation Although this opinion appears to be unreasonable in affirming separate ideas of natural things as subsisting of themselves as Aristotle argues in many ways still it is absolutely true that there is first something which is essentially being and essentially good which we call God as appears from what is shown above Q two A three and Aristotle agrees with this Hence from the first being essentially such and good everything can be called good and a being inasmuch as it participates in it by way of a certain assimilation which is far removed and defective as appears from the above Q four A three Everything is therefore called good from the divine goodness as from the first exemplary effective and final principle of all goodness Nevertheless everything is called good by reason of the similitude of the divine goodness belonging to it which is formally its own goodness whereby it is denominated good And so of all things there is one goodness and yet many goodnesses This is a sufficient Reply to the Objections QUESTION seven THE INFINITY OF GOD In Four Articles After considering the divine perfection we must consider the divine infinity and God s existence in things for God is everywhere and in all things inasmuch as He is boundless and infinite Concerning the first there are four points of inquiry one Whether God is infinite two Whether anything besides Him is infinite in essence three Whether anything can be infinitude in magnitude four Whether an infinite multitude can exist FIRST ARTICLE I Q seven Art one Whether God Is Infinite Objection one It seems that God is not infinite For everything infinite is imperfect as the Philosopher says because it has parts and matter as is said in Phys iii But God is most perfect therefore He is not infinite Obj two Further according to the Philosopher Phys i finite and infinite belong to quantity But there is no quantity in God for He is not a body as was shown above Q three A one Therefore it does not belong to Him to be infinite Obj three Further what is here in such a way as not to be elsewhere is finite according to place Therefore that which is a thing in such a way as not to be another thing is finite according to substance But God is this and not another for He is not a stone or wood Therefore God is not infinite in substance On the contrary Damascene says De Fide Orth i four that God is infinite and eternal and boundless I answer that All the ancient philosophers attribute infinitude to the first principle as is said Phys iii and with reason for they considered that things flow forth infinitely from the first principle But because some erred concerning the nature of the first principle as a consequence they erred also concerning its infinity forasmuch as they asserted that matter was the first principle consequently they attributed to the first principle a material infinity to the effect that some infinite body was the first principle of things We must consider therefore that a thing is called infinite because it is not finite Now matter is in a way made finite by form and the form by matter Matter indeed is made finite by form inasmuch as matter before it receives its form is in potentiality to many forms but on receiving a form it is terminated by that one Again form is made finite by matter inasmuch as form considered in itself is common to many but when received in matter the form is determined to this one particular thing Now matter is perfected by the form by which it is made finite therefore infinite as attributed to matter has the nature of something imperfect for it is as it were formless matter On the other hand form is not made perfect by matter but rather is contracted by matter and hence the infinite regarded on the part of the form not determined by matter has the nature of something perfect Now being is the most formal of all things as appears from what is shown above Q four A one Obj three Since therefore the divine being is not a being received in anything but He is His own subsistent being as was shown above Q three A four it is clear that God Himself is infinite and perfect From this appears the Reply to the First Objection Reply Obj two Quantity is terminated by its form which can be seen in the fact that a figure which consists in quantity terminated is a kind of quantitative form Hence the infinite of quantity is the infinite of matter such a kind of infinite cannot be attributed to God as was said above in this article Reply Obj three The fact that the being of God is self subsisting not received in any other and is thus called infinite shows Him to be distinguished from all other beings and all others to be apart from Him Even so were there such a thing as a self subsisting whiteness the very fact that it did not exist in anything else would make it distinct from every other whiteness existing in a subject SECOND ARTICLE I Q seven Art two Whether Anything but God Can Be Essentially Infinite Objection one It seems that something else besides God can be essentially infinite For the power of anything is proportioned to its essence Now if the essence of God is infinite His power must also be infinite Therefore He can produce an infinite effect since the extent of a power is known by its effect Obj two Further whatever has infinite power has an infinite essence Now the created intellect has an infinite power for it apprehends the universal which can extend itself to an infinitude of singular things Therefore every created intellectual substance is infinite Obj three Further primary matter is something other than God as was shown above Q three A eight But primary matter is infinite Therefore something besides God can be infinite On the contrary The infinite cannot have a beginning as said in Phys iii But everything outside God is from God as from its first principle Therefore besides God nothing can be infinite I answer that Things other than God can be relatively infinite but not absolutely infinite For with regard to infinite as applied to matter it is manifest that everything actually existing possesses a form and thus its matter is determined by form But because matter considered as existing under some substantial form remains in potentiality to many accidental forms which is absolutely finite can be relatively infinite as for example wood is finite according to its own form but still it is relatively infinite inasmuch as it is in potentiality to an infinite number of shapes But if we speak of the infinite in reference to form it is manifest that those things the forms of which are in matter are absolutely finite and in no way infinite If however any created forms are not received into matter but are self subsisting as some think is the case with angels these will be relatively infinite inasmuch as such kinds of forms are not terminated nor contracted by any matter But because a created form thus subsisting has being and yet is not its own being it follows that its being is received and contracted to a determinate nature Hence it cannot be absolutely infinite Reply Obj one It is against the nature of a made thing for its essence to be its existence because subsisting being is not a created being hence it is against the nature of a made thing to be absolutely infinite Therefore as God although He has infinite power cannot make a thing to be not made for this would imply that two contradictories are true at the same time so likewise He cannot make anything to be absolutely infinite Reply Obj two The fact that the power of the intellect extends itself in a way to infinite things is because the intellect is a form not in matter but either wholly separated from matter as is the angelic substance or at least an intellectual power which is not the act of any organ in the intellectual soul joined to a body Reply Obj three Primary matter does not exist by itself in nature since it is not actually being but potentially only hence it is something concreated rather than created Nevertheless primary matter even as a potentiality is not absolutely infinite but relatively because its potentiality extends only to natural forms THIRD ARTICLE I Q seven Art three Whether an Actually Infinite Magnitude Can Exist Objection one It seems that there can be something actually infinite in magnitude For in mathematics there is no error since there is no lie in things abstract as the Philosopher says Phys ii But mathematics uses the infinite in magnitude thus the geometrician in his demonstrations says Let this line be infinite Therefore it is not impossible for a thing to be infinite in magnitude Obj two Further what is not against the nature of anything can agree with it Now to be infinite is not against the nature of magnitude but rather both the finite and the infinite seem to be properties of quantity Therefore it is not impossible for some magnitude to be infinite Obj three Further magnitude is infinitely divisible for the continuous is defined that which is infinitely divisible as is clear from Phys iii But contraries are concerned about one and the same thing Since therefore addition is opposed to division and increase opposed to diminution it appears that magnitude can be increased to infinity Therefore it is possible for magnitude to be infinite Obj four Further movement and time have quantity and continuity derived from the magnitude over which movement passes as is said in Phys iv But it is not against the nature of time and movement to be infinite since every determinate indivisible in time and circular movement is both a beginning and an end Therefore neither is it against the nature of magnitude to be infinite On the contrary Every body has a surface But every body which has a surface is finite because surface is the term of a finite body Therefore all bodies are finite The same applies both to surface and to a line Therefore nothing is infinite in magnitude I answer that It is one thing to be infinite in essence and another to be infinite in magnitude For granted that a body exists infinite in magnitude as fire or air yet this could not be infinite in essence because its essence would be terminated in a species by its form and confined to individuality by matter And so assuming from these premises that no creature is infinite in essence it still remains to inquire whether any creature can be infinite in magnitude We must therefore observe that a body which is a complete magnitude can be considered in two ways mathematically in respect to its quantity only and naturally as regards its matter and form Now it is manifest that a natural body cannot be actually infinite For every natural body has some determined substantial form Since therefore the accidents follow upon the substantial form it is necessary that determinate accidents should follow upon a determinate form and among these accidents is quantity So every natural body has a greater or smaller determinate quantity Hence it is impossible for a natural body to be infinite The same appears from movement because every natural body has some natural movement whereas an infinite body could not have any natural movement neither direct because nothing moves naturally by a direct movement unless it is out of its place and this could not happen to an infinite body for it would occupy every place and thus every place would be indifferently its own place Neither could it move circularly forasmuch as circular motion requires that one part of the body is necessarily transferred to a place occupied by another part and this could not happen as regards an infinite circular body for if two lines be drawn from the centre the farther they extend from the centre the farther they are from each other therefore if a body were infinite the lines would be infinitely distant from each other and thus one could never occupy the place belonging to any other The same applies to a mathematical body For if we imagine a mathematical body actually existing we must imagine it under some form because nothing is actual except by its form hence since the form of quantity as such is figure such a body must have some figure and so would be finite for figure is confined by a term or boundary Reply Obj one A geometrician does not need to assume a line actually infinite but takes some actually finite line from which he subtracts whatever he finds necessary which line he calls infinite Reply Obj two Although the infinite is not against the nature of magnitude in general still it is against the nature of any species of it thus for instance it is against the nature of a bicubical or tricubical magnitude whether circular or triangular and so on Now what is not possible in any species cannot exist in the genus hence there cannot be any infinite magnitude since no species of magnitude is infinite Reply Obj three The infinite in quantity as was shown above belongs to matter Now by division of the whole we approach to matter forasmuch as parts have the aspect of matter but by addition we approach to the whole which has the aspect of a form Therefore the infinite is not in the addition of magnitude but only in division Reply Obj four Movement and time are whole not actually but successively hence they have potentiality mixed with actuality But magnitude is an actual whole therefore the infinite in quantity refers to matter and does not agree with the totality of magnitude yet it agrees with the totality of time and movement for it is proper to matter to be in potentiality FOURTH ARTICLE I Q seven Art four Whether an Infinite Multitude Can Exist Objection one It seems that an actually infinite multitude is possible For it is not impossible for a potentiality to be made actual But number can be multiplied to infinity Therefore it is possible for an infinite multitude actually to exist Obj two Further it is possible for any individual of any species to be made actual But the species of figures are infinite Therefore an infinite number of actual figures is possible Obj three Further things not opposed to each other do not obstruct each other But supposing a multitude of things to exist there can still be many others not opposed to them Therefore it is not impossible for others also to coexist with them and so on to infinitude therefore an actual infinite number of things is possible On the contrary It is written Thou hast ordered all things in measure and number and weight Wis eleven twenty one I answer that A twofold opinion exists on this subject Some as Avicenna and Algazel said that it was impossible for an actually infinite multitude to exist absolutely but that an accidentally infinite multitude was not impossible A multitude is said to be infinite absolutely when an infinite multitude is necessary that something may exist Now this is impossible because it would entail something dependent on an infinity for its existence and hence its generation could never come to be because it is impossible to pass through an infinite medium A multitude is said to be accidentally infinite when its existence as such is not necessary but accidental This can be shown for example in the work of a carpenter requiring a certain absolute multitude namely art in the soul the movement of the hand and a hammer and supposing that such things were infinitely multiplied the carpentering work would never be finished forasmuch as it would depend on an infinite number of causes But the multitude of hammers inasmuch as one may be broken and another used is an accidental multitude for it happens by accident that many hammers are used and it matters little whether one or two or many are used or an infinite number if the work is carried on for an infinite time In this way they said that there can be an accidentally infinite multitude This however is impossible since every kind of multitude must belong to a species of multitude Now the species of multitude are to be reckoned by the species of numbers But no species of number is infinite for every number is multitude measured by one Hence it is impossible for there to be an actually infinite multitude either absolute or accidental Likewise multitude in nature is created and everything created is comprehended under some clear intention of the Creator for no agent acts aimlessly Hence everything created must be comprehended in a certain number Therefore it is impossible for an actually infinite multitude to exist even accidentally But a potentially infinite multitude is possible because the increase of multitude follows upon the division of magnitude since the more a thing is divided the greater number of things result Hence as the infinite is to be found potentially in the division of the continuous because we thus approach matter as was shown in the preceding article by the same rule the infinite can be also found potentially in the addition of multitude Reply Obj one Every potentiality is made actual according to its mode of being for instance a day is reduced to act successively and not all at once Likewise the infinite in multitude is reduced to act successively and not all at once because every multitude can be succeeded by another multitude to infinity Reply Obj two Species of figures are infinite by infinitude of number Now there are various species of figures such as trilateral quadrilateral and so on and as an infinitely numerable multitude is not all at once reduced to act so neither is the multitude of figures Reply Obj three Although the supposition of some things does not preclude the supposition of others still the supposition of an infinite number is opposed to any single species of multitude Hence it is not possible for an actually infinite multitude to exist QUESTION eight THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IN THINGS In Four Articles Since it evidently belongs to the infinite to be present everywhere and in all things we now consider whether this belongs to God and concerning this there arise four points of inquiry one Whether God is in all things two Whether God is everywhere three Whether God is everywhere by essence power and presence four Whether to be everywhere belongs to God alone FIRST ARTICLE I Q eight Art one Whether God Is in All Things Objection one It seems that God is not in all things For what is above all things is not in all things But God is above all according to the Psalm Ps one hundred twelve four The Lord is high above all nations et cetera Therefore God is not in all things Obj two Further what is in anything is thereby contained Now God is not contained by things but rather does He contain them Therefore God is not in things but things are rather in Him Hence Augustine says Octog Tri Quaest qu twenty that in Him things are rather than He is in any place Obj three Further the more powerful an agent is the more extended is its action But God is the most powerful of all agents Therefore His action can extend to things which are far removed from Him nor is it necessary that He should be in all things Obj four Further the demons are beings But God is not in the demons for there is no fellowship between light and darkness two Cor six fourteen Therefore God is not in all things On the contrary A thing is wherever it operates But God operates in all things according to Isa twenty six twelve Lord Thou hast wrought all our works in Vulg for us Therefore God is in all things I answer that God is in all things not indeed as part of their essence nor as an accident but as an agent is present to that upon which it works For an agent must be joined to that wherein it acts immediately and touch it by its power hence it is proved in Phys vii that the thing moved and the mover must be joined together Now since God is very being by His own essence created being must be His proper effect as to ignite is the proper effect of fire Now God causes this effect in things not only when they first begin to be but as long as they are preserved in being as light is caused in the air by the sun as long as the air remains illuminated Therefore as long as a thing has being God must be present to it according to its mode of being But being is innermost in each thing and most fundamentally inherent in all things since it is formal in respect of everything found in a thing as was shown above Q seven A one Hence it must be that God is in all things and innermostly Reply Obj one God is above all things by the excellence of His nature nevertheless He is in all things as the cause of the being of all things as was shown above in this article Reply Obj two Although corporeal things are said to be in another as in that which contains them nevertheless spiritual things contain those things in which they are as the soul contains the body Hence also God is in things containing them nevertheless by a certain similitude to corporeal things it is said that all things are in God inasmuch as they are contained by Him Reply Obj three No action of an agent however powerful it may be acts at a distance except through a medium But it belongs to the great power of God that He acts immediately in all things Hence nothing is distant from Him as if it could be without God in itself But things are said to be distant from God by the unlikeness to Him in nature or grace as also He is above all by the excellence of His own nature Reply Obj four In the demons there is their nature which is from God and also the deformity of sin which is not from Him therefore it is not to be absolutely conceded that God is in the demons except with the addition inasmuch as they are beings But in things not deformed in their nature we must say absolutely that God is SECOND ARTICLE I Q eight Art two Whether God Is Everywhere Objection one It seems that God is not everywhere For to be everywhere means to be in every place But to be in every place does not belong to God to Whom it does not belong to be in place at all for incorporeal things as Boethius says De Hebdom are not in a place Therefore God is not everywhere Obj two Further the relation of time to succession is the same as the relation of place to permanence But one indivisible part of action or movement cannot exist in different times therefore neither can one indivisible part in the genus of permanent things be in every place Now the divine being is not successive but permanent Therefore God is not in many places and thus He is not everywhere Obj three Further what is wholly in any one place is not in part elsewhere But if God is in any one place He is all there for He has no parts No part of Him then is elsewhere and therefore God is not everywhere On the contrary It is written I fill heaven and earth Jer twenty three twenty four I answer that Since place is a thing to be in place can be understood in a twofold sense either by way of other things i e as one thing is said to be in another no matter how and thus the accidents of a place are in place or by a way proper to place and thus things placed are in a place Now in both these senses in some way God is in every place and this is to be everywhere First as He is in all things giving them being power and operation so He is in every place as giving it existence and locative power Again things placed are in place inasmuch as they fill place and God fills every place not indeed like a body for a body is said to fill place inasmuch as it excludes the company presence of another body whereas by God being in a place others are not thereby excluded from it indeed by the very fact that He gives being to the things that fill every place He Himself fills every place Reply Obj one Incorporeal things are in place not by contact of dimensive quantity as bodies are but by contact of power Reply Obj two The indivisible is twofold One is the term of the continuous as a point in permanent things and as a moment in succession and this kind of the indivisible in permanent things forasmuch as it has a determinate site cannot be in many parts of place or in many places likewise the indivisible of action or movement forasmuch as it has a determinate order in movement or action cannot be in many parts of time Another kind of the indivisible is outside of the whole genus of the continuous and in this way incorporeal substances like God angel and soul are called indivisible Such a kind of indivisible does not belong to the continuous as a part of it but as touching it by its power hence according as its power can extend itself to one or to many to a small thing or to a great one in this way it is in one or in many places and in a small or large place Reply Obj three A whole is so called with reference to its parts Now part is twofold viz a part of the essence as the form and the matter are called parts of the composite while genus and difference are called parts of species There is also part of quantity into which any quantity is divided What therefore is whole in any place by totality of quantity cannot be outside of that place because the quantity of anything placed is commensurate to the quantity of the place and hence there is no totality of quantity without totality of place But totality of essence is not commensurate to the totality of place Hence it is not necessary for that which is whole by totality of essence in a thing not to be at all outside of it This appears also in accidental forms which have accidental quantity as an example whiteness is whole in each part of the surface if we speak of its totality of essence because according to the perfect idea of its species it is found to exist in every part of the surface But if its totality be considered according to quantity which it has accidentally then it is not whole in every part of the surface On the other hand incorporeal substances have no totality either of themselves or accidentally except in reference to the perfect idea of their essence Hence as the soul is whole in every part of the body so is God whole in all things and in each one THIRD ARTICLE I Q eight Art three Whether God Is Everywhere by Essence Presence and Power Objection one It seems that the mode of God s existence in all things is not properly described by way of essence presence and power For what is by essence in anything is in it essentially But God is not essentially in things for He does not belong to the essence of anything Therefore it ought not to be said that God is in things by essence presence and power Obj two Further to be present in anything means not to be absent from it Now this is the meaning of God being in things by His essence that He is not absent from anything Therefore the presence of God in all things by essence and presence means the same thing Therefore it is superfluous to say that God is present in things by His essence presence and power Obj three Further as God by His power is the principle of all things so He is the same likewise by His knowledge and will But it is not said that He is in things by knowledge and will Therefore neither is He present by His power Obj four Further as grace is a perfection added to the substance of a thing so many other perfections are likewise added Therefore if God is said to be in certain persons in a special way by grace it seems that according to every perfection there ought to be a special mode of God s existence in things On the contrary A gloss on the Canticle of Canticles five says that God by a common mode is in all things by His presence power and substance still He is said to be present more familiarly in some by grace The quotation is from saint Gregory Hom viii in Ezech I answer that God is said to be in a thing in two ways in one way after the manner of an efficient cause and thus He is in all things created by Him in another way he is in things as the object of operation is in the operator and this is proper to the operations of the soul according as the thing known is in the one who knows and the thing desired in the one desiring In this second way God is especially in the rational creature which knows and loves Him actually or habitually And because the rational creature possesses this prerogative by grace as will be shown later Q twelve He is said to be thus in the saints by grace But how He is in other things created by Him may be considered from human affairs A king for example is said to be in the whole kingdom by his power although he is not everywhere present Again a thing is said to be by its presence in other things which are subject to its inspection as things in a house are said to be present to anyone who nevertheless may not be in substance in every part of the house Lastly a thing is said to be by way of substance or essence in that place in which its substance may be Now there were some the Manichees who said that spiritual and incorporeal things were subject to the divine power but that visible and corporeal things were subject to the power of a contrary principle Therefore against these it is necessary to say that God is in all things by His power But others though they believed that all things were subject to the divine power still did not allow that divine providence extended to these inferior bodies and in the person of these it is said He walketh about the poles of the heavens and He doth not consider our things Vulg He doth not consider and He walketh et cetera Job twenty two fourteen Against these it is necessary to say that God is in all things by His presence Further others said that although all things are subject to God s providence still all things are not immediately created by God but that He immediately created the first creatures and these created the others Against these it is necessary to say that He is in all things by His essence Therefore God is in all things by His power inasmuch as all things are subject to His power He is by His presence in all things as all things are bare and open to His eyes He is in all things by His essence inasmuch as He is present to all as the cause of their being Reply Obj one God is said to be in all things by essence not indeed by the essence of the things themselves as if He were of their essence but by His own essence because His substance is present to all things as the cause of their being Reply Obj two A thing can be said to be present to another when in its sight though the thing may be distant in substance as was shown in this article and therefore two modes of presence are necessary viz by essence and by presence Reply Obj three Knowledge and will require that the thing known should be in the one who knows and the thing willed in the one who wills Hence by knowledge and will things are more truly in God than God in things But power is the principle of acting on another hence by power the agent is related and applied to an external thing thus by power an agent may be said to be present to another Reply Obj four No other perfection except grace added to substance renders God present in anything as the object known and loved therefore only grace constitutes a special mode of God s existence in things There is however another special mode of God s existence in man by union which will be treated of in its own place Part III FOURTH ARTICLE I Q eight Art four Whether to Be Everywhere Belongs to God Alone Objection one It seems that to be everywhere does not belong to God alone For the universal according to the Philosopher Poster i is everywhere and always primary matter also since it is in all bodies is everywhere But neither of these is God as appears from what is said above Q three Therefore to be everywhere does not belong to God alone Obj two Further number is in things numbered But the whole universe is constituted in number as appears from the Book of Wisdom Wis eleven twenty one Therefore there is some number which is in the whole universe and is thus everywhere Obj three Further the universe is a kind of whole perfect body Coel et Mund i But the whole universe is everywhere because there is no place outside it Therefore to be everywhere does not belong to God alone Obj four Further if any body were infinite no place would exist outside of it and so it would be everywhere Therefore to be everywhere does not appear to belong to God alone Obj five Further the soul as Augustine says De Trin vi six is whole in the whole body and whole in every one of its parts Therefore if there was only one animal in the world its soul would be everywhere and thus to be everywhere does not belong to God alone Obj six Further as Augustine says Ep one hundred thirty seven The soul feels where it sees and lives where it feels and is where it lives But the soul sees as it were everywhere for in a succession of glances it comprehends the entire space of the heavens in its sight Therefore the soul is everywhere On the contrary Ambrose says De Spir Sanct i seven Who dares to call the Holy Ghost a creature Who in all things and everywhere and always is which assuredly belongs to the divinity alone I answer that To be everywhere primarily and absolutely is proper to God Now to be everywhere primarily is said of that which in its whole self is everywhere for if a thing were everywhere according to its parts in different places it would not be primarily everywhere forasmuch as what belongs to anything according to part does not belong to it primarily thus if a man has white teeth whiteness belongs primarily not to the man but to his teeth But a thing is everywhere absolutely when it does not belong to it to be everywhere accidentally that is merely on some supposition as a grain of millet would be everywhere supposing that no other body existed It belongs therefore to a thing to be everywhere absolutely when on any supposition it must be everywhere and this properly belongs to God alone For whatever number of places be supposed even if an infinite number be supposed besides what already exist it would be necessary that God should be in all of them for nothing can exist except by Him Therefore to be everywhere primarily and absolutely belongs to God and is proper to Him because whatever number of places be supposed to exist God must be in all of them not as to a part of Him but as to His very self Reply Obj one The universal and also primary matter are indeed everywhere but not according to the same mode of existence Reply Obj two Number since it is an accident does not of itself exist in place but accidentally neither is the whole but only part of it in each of the things numbered hence it does not follow that it is primarily and absolutely everywhere Reply Obj three The whole body of the universe is everywhere but not primarily forasmuch as it is not wholly in each place but according to its parts nor again is it everywhere absolutely because supposing that other places existed besides itself it would not be in them Reply Obj four If an infinite body existed it would be everywhere but according to its parts Reply Obj five Were there one animal only its soul would be everywhere primarily indeed but only accidentally Reply Obj six When it is said that the soul sees anywhere this can be taken in two senses In one sense the adverb anywhere determines the act of seeing on the part of the object and in this sense it is true that while it sees the heavens it sees in the heavens and in the same way it feels in the heavens but it does not follow that it lives or exists in the heavens because to live and to exist do not import an act passing to an exterior object In another sense it can be understood according as the adverb determines the act of the seer as proceeding from the seer and thus it is true that where the soul feels and sees there it is and there it lives according to this mode of speaking and thus it does not follow that it is everywhere QUESTION nine THE IMMUTABILITY OF GOD In Two Articles We next consider God s immutability and His eternity following on His immutability On the immutability of God there are two points of inquiry one Whether God is altogether immutable two Whether to be immutable belongs to God alone FIRST ARTICLE I Q nine Art one Whether God is altogether immutable Objection one It seems that God is not altogether immutable For whatever moves itself is in some way mutable But as Augustine says general ad lit viii twenty The Creator Spirit moves Himself neither by time nor by place Therefore God is in some way mutable Obj two Further it is said of Wisdom that it is more mobile than all things active Vulg mobilior Wis seven twenty four But God is wisdom itself therefore God is movable Obj three Further to approach and to recede signify movement But these are said of God in Scripture Draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you James four eight Therefore God is mutable On the contrary It is written I am the Lord and I change not Malachi three six I answer that From what precedes it is shown that God is altogether immutable First because it was shown above that there is some first being whom we call God and that this first being must be pure act without the admixture of any potentiality for the reason that absolutely potentiality is posterior to act Now everything which is in any way changed is in some way in potentiality Hence it is evident that it is impossible for God to be in any way changeable Secondly because everything which is moved remains as it was in part and passes away in part as what is moved from whiteness to blackness remains the same as to substance thus in everything which is moved there is some kind of composition to be found But it has been shown above Q three A seven that in God there is no composition for He is altogether simple Hence it is manifest that God cannot be moved Thirdly because everything which is moved acquires something by its movement and attains to what it had not attained previously But since God is infinite comprehending in Himself all the plenitude of perfection of all being He cannot acquire anything new nor extend Himself to anything whereto He was not extended previously Hence movement in no way belongs to Him So some of the ancients constrained as it were by the truth decided that the first principle was immovable Reply Obj one Augustine there speaks in a similar way to Plato who said that the first mover moves Himself calling every operation a movement even as the acts of understanding and willing and loving are called movements Therefore because God understands and loves Himself in that respect they said that God moves Himself not however as movement and change belong to a thing existing in potentiality as we now speak of change and movement Reply Obj two Wisdom is called mobile by way of similitude according as it diffuses its likeness even to the outermost of things for nothing can exist which does not proceed from the divine wisdom by way of some kind of imitation as from the first effective and formal principle as also works of art proceed from the wisdom of the artist And so in the same way inasmuch as the similitude of the divine wisdom proceeds in degrees from the highest things which participate more fully of its likeness to the lowest things which participate of it in a lesser degree there is said to be a kind of procession and movement of the divine wisdom to things as when we say that the sun proceeds to the earth inasmuch as the ray of light touches the earth In this way Dionysius Coel Hier i expounds the matter that every procession of the divine manifestation comes to us from the movement of the Father of light Reply Obj three These things are said of God in Scripture metaphorically For as the sun is said to enter a house or to go out according as its rays reach the house so God is said to approach to us or to recede from us when we receive the influx of His goodness or decline from Him SECOND ARTICLE I Q nine Art two Whether to Be Immutable Belongs to God Alone Objection one It seems that to be immutable does not belong to God alone For the Philosopher says Metaph ii that matter is in everything which is moved But according to some certain created substances as angels and souls have not matter Therefore to be immutable does not belong to God alone Obj two Further everything in motion moves to some end What therefore has already attained its ultimate end is not in motion But some creatures have already attained to their ultimate end as all the blessed in heaven Therefore some creatures are immovable Obj three Further everything which is mutable is variable But forms are invariable for it is said Sex Princip i that form is essence consisting of the simple and invariable Therefore it does not belong to God alone to be immutable On the contrary Augustine says De Nat Boni i God alone is immutable and whatever things He has made being from nothing are mutable I answer that God alone is altogether immutable whereas every creature is in some way mutable Be it known therefore that a mutable thing can be called so in two ways by a power in itself and by a power possessed by another For all creatures before they existed were possible not by any created power since no creature is eternal but by the divine power alone inasmuch as God could produce them into existence Thus as the production of a thing into existence depends on the will of God so likewise it depends on His will that things should be preserved for He does not preserve them otherwise than by ever giving them existence hence if He took away His action from them all things would be reduced to nothing as appears from Augustine general ad lit iv twelve Therefore as it was in the Creator s power to produce them before they existed in themselves so likewise it is in the Creator s power when they exist in themselves to bring them to nothing In this way therefore by the power of another namely of God they are mutable inasmuch as they are producible from nothing by Him and are by Him reducible from existence to non existence If however a thing is called mutable by a power in itself thus also in some manner every creature is mutable For every creature has a twofold power active and passive and I call that power passive which enables anything to attain its perfection either in being or in attaining to its end Now if the mutability of a thing be considered according to its power for being in that way all creatures are not mutable but those only in which what is potential in them is consistent with non being Hence in the inferior bodies there is mutability both as regards substantial being inasmuch as their matter can exist with privation of their substantial form and also as regards their accidental being supposing the subject to coexist with privation of accident as for example this subject man can exist with not whiteness and can therefore be changed from white to not white But supposing the accident to be such as to follow on the essential principles of the subject then the privation of such an accident cannot coexist with the subject Hence the subject cannot be changed as regards that kind of accident as for example snow cannot be made black Now in the celestial bodies matter is not consistent with privation of form because the form perfects the whole potentiality of the matter therefore these bodies are not mutable as to substantial being but only as to locality because the subject is consistent with privation of this or that place On the other hand incorporeal substances being subsistent forms which although with respect to their own existence are as potentiality to act are not consistent with the privation of this act forasmuch as existence is consequent upon form and nothing corrupts except it lose its form Hence in the form itself there is no power to non existence and so these kinds of substances are immutable and invariable as regards their existence Wherefore Dionysius says Div Nom iv that intellectual created substances are pure from generation and from every variation as also are incorporeal and immaterial substances Still there remains in them a twofold mutability one as regards their potentiality to their end and in that way there is in them a mutability according to choice from good to evil as Damascene says De Fide ii thirty four the other as regards place inasmuch as by their finite power they attain to certain fresh places which cannot be said of God who by His infinity fills all places as was shown above Q eight A two Thus in every creature there is a potentiality to change either as regards substantial being as in the case of things corruptible or as regards locality only as in the case of the celestial bodies or as regards the order to their end and the application of their powers to divers objects as in the case with the angels and universally all creatures generally are mutable by the power of the Creator in Whose power is their existence and non existence Hence since God is in none of these ways mutable it belongs to Him alone to be altogether immutable Reply Obj one This objection proceeds from mutability as regards substantial or accidental being for philosophers treated of such movement Reply Obj two The good angels besides their natural endowment of immutability of being have also immutability of election by divine power nevertheless there remains in them mutability as regards place Reply Obj three Forms are called invariable forasmuch as they cannot be subjects of variation but they are subject to variation because by them their subject is variable Hence it is clear that they vary in so far as they are for they are not called beings as though they were the subject of being but because through them something has being QUESTION ten THE ETERNITY OF GOD In Six Articles We must now consider the eternity of God concerning which arise six points of inquiry one What is eternity two Whether God is eternal three Whether to be eternal belongs to God alone four Whether eternity differs from time five The difference of aeviternity and of time six Whether there is only one aeviternity as there is one time and one eternity FIRST ARTICLE I Q ten Art one Whether This Is a Good Definition of Eternity The Simultaneously Whole and Perfect Possession of Interminable Life Objection one It seems that the definition of eternity given by Boethius De Consol v is not a good one Eternity is the simultaneously whole and perfect possession of interminable life For the word interminable is a negative one But negation only belongs to what is defective and this does not belong to eternity Therefore in the definition of eternity the word interminable ought not to be found Obj two Further eternity signifies a certain kind of duration But duration regards existence rather than life Therefore the word life ought not to come into the definition of eternity but rather the word existence Obj three Further a whole is what has parts But this is alien to eternity which is simple Therefore it is improperly said to be whole Obj four Many days cannot occur together nor can many times exist all at once But in eternity days and times are in the plural for it is said His going forth is from the beginning from the days of eternity Micah five two and also it is said According to the revelation of the mystery hidden from eternity Rom sixteen twenty five Therefore eternity is not omni simultaneous Obj five Further the whole and the perfect are the same thing Supposing therefore that it is whole it is superfluously described as perfect Obj six Further duration does not imply possession But eternity is a kind of duration Therefore eternity is not possession I answer that As we attain to the knowledge of simple things by way of compound things so must we reach to the knowledge of eternity by means of time which is nothing but the numbering of movement by before and after For since succession occurs in every movement and one part comes after another the fact that we reckon before and after in movement makes us apprehend time which is nothing else but the measure of before and after in movement Now in a thing bereft of movement which is always the same there is no before or after As therefore the idea of time consists in the numbering of before and after in movement so likewise in the apprehension of the uniformity of what is outside of movement consists the idea of eternity Further those things are said to be measured by time which have a beginning and an end in time because in everything which is moved there is a beginning and there is an end But as whatever is wholly immutable can have no succession so it has no beginning and no end Thus eternity is known from two sources first because what is eternal is interminable that is has no beginning nor end that is no term either way secondly because eternity has no succession being simultaneously whole Reply Obj one Simple things are usually defined by way of negation as a point is that which has no parts Yet this is not to be taken as if the negation belonged to their essence but because our intellect which first apprehends compound things cannot attain to the knowledge of simple things except by removing the opposite Reply Obj two What is truly eternal is not only being but also living and life extends to operation which is not true of being Now the protraction of duration seems to belong to operation rather than to being hence time is the numbering of movement Reply Obj three Eternity is called whole not because it has parts but because it is wanting in nothing Reply Obj four As God although incorporeal is named in Scripture metaphorically by corporeal names so eternity though simultaneously whole is called by names implying time and succession Reply Obj five Two things are to be considered in time time itself which is successive and the now of time which is imperfect Hence the expression simultaneously whole is used to remove the idea of time and the word perfect is used to exclude the now of time Reply Obj six Whatever is possessed is held firmly and quietly therefore to designate the immutability and permanence of eternity we use the word possession SECOND ARTICLE I Q ten Art two Whether God is Eternal Objection one It seems that God is not eternal For nothing made can be predicated of God for Boethius says De Trin iv that The now that flows away makes time the now that stands still makes eternity and Augustine says Octog Tri Quaest qu twenty eight that God is the author of eternity Therefore God is not eternal Obj two Further what is before eternity and after eternity is not measured by eternity But as Aristotle says De Causis God is before eternity and He is after eternity for it is written that the Lord shall reign for eternity and beyond Douay for ever and ever Ex fifteen eighteen Therefore to be eternal does not belong to God Obj three Further eternity is a kind of measure But to be measured belongs not to God Therefore it does not belong to Him to be eternal Obj four Further in eternity there is no present past or future since it is simultaneously whole as was said in the preceding article But words denoting present past and future time are applied to God in Scripture Therefore God is not eternal On the contrary Athanasius says in his Creed The Father is eternal the Son is eternal the Holy Ghost is eternal I answer that The idea of eternity follows immutability as the idea of time follows movement as appears from the preceding article Hence as God is supremely immutable it supremely belongs to Him to be eternal Nor is He eternal only but He is His own eternity whereas no other being is its own duration as no other is its own being Now God is His own uniform being and hence as He is His own essence so He is His own eternity Reply Obj one The now that stands still is said to make eternity according to our apprehension As the apprehension of time is caused in us by the fact that we apprehend the flow of the now so the apprehension of eternity is caused in us by our apprehending the now standing still When Augustine says that God is the author of eternity this is to be understood of participated eternity For God communicates His eternity to some in the same way as He communicates His immutability Reply Obj two From this appears the answer to the Second Objection For God is said to be before eternity according as it is shared by immaterial substances Hence also in the same book it is said that intelligence is equal to eternity In the words of Exodus The Lord shall reign for eternity and beyond eternity stands for age as another rendering has it Thus it is said that the Lord will reign beyond eternity inasmuch as He endures beyond every age i e beyond every kind of duration For age is nothing more than the period of each thing as is said in the book De Coelo i Or to reign beyond eternity can be taken to mean that if any other thing were conceived to exist for ever as the movement of the heavens according to some philosophers then God would still reign beyond inasmuch as His reign is simultaneously whole Reply Obj three Eternity is nothing else but God Himself Hence God is not called eternal as if He were in any way measured but the idea of measurement is there taken according to the apprehension of our mind alone Reply Obj four Words denoting different times are applied to God because His eternity includes all times not as if He Himself were altered through present past and future THIRD ARTICLE I Q ten Art three Whether to Be Eternal Belongs to God Alone Objection one It seems that it does not belong to God alone to be eternal For it is written that those who instruct many to justice shall be as stars unto perpetual eternities Douay for all eternity Dan twelve three Now if God alone were eternal there could not be many eternities Therefore God alone is not the only eternal Obj two Further it is written Depart ye cursed into eternal Douay everlasting fire Matt twenty five forty one Therefore God is not the only eternal Obj three Further every necessary thing is eternal But there are many necessary things as for instance all principles of demonstration and all demonstrative propositions Therefore God is not the only eternal On the contrary Jerome says Ep ad Damasum xv that God is the only one who has no beginning Now whatever has a beginning is not eternal Therefore God is the only one eternal I answer that Eternity truly and properly so called is in God alone because eternity follows on immutability as appears from the first article But God alone is altogether immutable as was shown above Q nine A one Accordingly however as some receive immutability from Him they share in His eternity Thus some receive immutability from God in the way of never ceasing to exist in that sense it is said of the earth it standeth for ever Eccl one four Again some things are called eternal in Scripture because of the length of their duration although they are in nature corruptible thus Ps seventy five five the hills are called eternal and we read of the fruits of the eternal hills Deut thirty three fifteen Some again share more fully than others in the nature of eternity inasmuch as they possess unchangeableness either in being or further still in operation like the angels and the blessed who enjoy the Word because as regards that vision of the Word no changing thoughts exist in the Saints as Augustine says De Trin xv Hence those who see God are said to have eternal life according to that text This is eternal life that they may know Thee the only true God et cetera John seventeen three Reply Obj one There are said to be many eternities accordingly as many share in eternity by the contemplation of God Reply Obj two The fire of hell is called eternal only because it never ends Still there is change in the pains of the lost according to the words To extreme heat they will pass from snowy waters Job twenty four nineteen Hence in hell true eternity does not exist but rather time according to the text of the Psalm Their time will be for ever Ps eighty sixteen Reply Obj three Necessary means a certain mode of truth and truth according to the Philosopher Metaph vi is in the mind Therefore in this sense the true and necessary are eternal because they are in the eternal mind which is the divine intellect alone hence it does not follow that anything beside God is eternal FOURTH ARTICLE I Q ten Art four Whether Eternity Differs from Time Objection one It seems that eternity does not differ from time For two measures of duration cannot exist together unless one is part of the other for instance two days or two hours cannot be together nevertheless we may say that a day or an hour are together considering hour as part of a day But eternity and time occur together each of which imports a certain measure of duration Since therefore eternity is not a part of time forasmuch as eternity exceeds time and includes it it seems that time is a part of eternity and is not a different thing from eternity Obj two Further according to the Philosopher Phys iv the now of time remains the same in the whole of time But the nature of eternity seems to be that it is the same indivisible thing in the whole space of time Therefore eternity is the now of time But the now of time is not substantially different from time Therefore eternity is not substantially different from time Obj three Further as the measure of the first movement is the measure of every movement as said in Phys iv it thus appears that the measure of the first being is that of every being But eternity is the measure of the first being that is of the divine being Therefore eternity is the measure of every being But the being of things corruptible is measured by time Time therefore is either eternity or is a part of eternity On the contrary Eternity is simultaneously whole But time has a before and an after Therefore time and eternity are not the same thing I answer that It is manifest that time and eternity are not the same Some have founded this difference on the fact that eternity has neither beginning nor an end whereas time has a beginning and an end This however makes a merely accidental and not an absolute difference because granted that time always was and always will be according to the idea of those who think the movement of the heavens goes on for ever there would yet remain a difference between eternity and time as Boethius says De Consol v arising from the fact that eternity is simultaneously whole which cannot be applied to time for eternity is the measure of a permanent being while time is a measure of movement Supposing however that the aforesaid difference be considered on the part of the things measured and not as regards the measures then there is some reason for it inasmuch as that alone is measured by time which has beginning and end in time Hence if the movement of the heavens lasted always time would not be of its measure as regards the whole of its duration since the infinite is not measurable but it would be the measure of that part of its revolution which has beginning and end in time Another reason for the same can be taken from these measures in themselves if we consider the end and the beginning as potentialities because granted also that time always goes on yet it is possible to note in time both the beginning and the end by considering its parts thus we speak of the beginning and the end of a day or of a year which cannot be applied to eternity Still these differences follow upon the essential and primary differences that eternity is simultaneously whole but that time is not so Reply Obj one Such a reason would be a valid one if time and eternity were the same kind of measure but this is seen not to be the case when we consider those things of which the respective measures are time and eternity Reply Obj two The now of time is the same as regards its subject in the whole course of time but it differs in aspect for inasmuch as time corresponds to movement its now corresponds to what is movable and the thing movable has the same one subject in all time but differs in aspect a being here and there and such alteration is movement Likewise the flow of the now as alternating in aspect is time But eternity remains the same according to both subject and aspect and hence eternity is not the same as the now of time Reply Obj three As eternity is the proper measure of permanent being so time is the proper measure of movement and hence according as any being recedes from permanence of being and is subject to change it recedes from eternity and is subject to time Therefore the being of things corruptible because it is changeable is not measured by eternity but by time for time measures not only things actually changed but also things changeable hence it not only measures movement but it also measures repose which belongs to whatever is naturally movable but is not actually in motion FIFTH ARTICLE I Q ten Art five The Difference of Aeviternity and Time Objection one It seems that aeviternity is the same as time For Augustine says general ad lit viii twenty twenty two twenty three that God moves the spiritual through time But aeviternity is said to be the measure of spiritual substances Therefore time is the same as aeviternity Obj two Further it is essential to time to have before and after but it is essential to eternity to be simultaneously whole as was shown above in the first article Now aeviternity is not eternity for it is written Ecclus one one that eternal Wisdom is before age Therefore it is not simultaneously whole but has before and after and thus it is the same as time Obj three Further if there is no before and after in aeviternity it follows that in aeviternal things there is no difference between being having been or going to be Since then it is impossible for aeviternal things not to have been it follows that it is impossible for them not to be in the future which is false since God can reduce them to nothing Obj four Further since the duration of aeviternal things is infinite as to subsequent duration if aeviternity is simultaneously whole it follows that some creature is actually infinite which is impossible Therefore aeviternity does not differ from time On the contrary Boethius says De Consol iii Who commandest time to be separate from aeviternity I answer that Aeviternity differs from time and from eternity as the mean between them both This difference is explained by some to consist in the fact that eternity has neither beginning nor end aeviternity a beginning but no end and time both beginning and end This difference however is but an accidental one as was shown above in the preceding article because even if aeviternal things had always been and would always be as some think and even if they might sometimes fail to be which is possible to God to allow even granted this aeviternity would still be distinguished from eternity and from time Others assign the difference between these three to consist in the fact that eternity has no before and after but that time has both together with innovation and veteration and that aeviternity has before and after without innovation and veteration This theory however involves a contradiction which manifestly appears if innovation and veteration be referred to the measure itself For since before and after of duration cannot exist together if aeviternity has before and after it must follow that with the receding of the first part of aeviternity the after part of aeviternity must newly appear and thus innovation would occur in aeviternity itself as it does in time And if they be referred to the things measured even then an incongruity would follow For a thing which exists in time grows old with time because it has a changeable existence and from the changeableness of a thing measured there follows before and after in the measure as is clear from Physic iv Therefore the fact that an aeviternal thing is neither inveterate nor subject to innovation comes from its changelessness and consequently its measure does not contain before and after We say then that since eternity is the measure of a permanent being in so far as anything recedes from permanence of being it recedes from eternity Now some things recede from permanence of being so that their being is subject to change or consists in change and these things are measured by time as are all movements and also the being of all things corruptible But others recede less from permanence of being forasmuch as their being neither consists in change nor is the subject of change nevertheless they have change annexed to them either actually or potentially This appears in the heavenly bodies the substantial being of which is unchangeable and yet with unchangeable being they have changeableness of place The same applies to the angels who have an unchangeable being as regards their nature with changeableness as regards choice moreover they have changeableness of intelligence of affections and of places in their own degree Therefore these are measured by aeviternity which is a mean between eternity and time But the being that is measured by eternity is not changeable nor is it annexed to change In this way time has before and after aeviternity in itself has no before and after which can however be annexed to it while eternity has neither before nor after nor is it compatible with such at all Reply Obj one Spiritual creatures as regards successive affections and intelligences are measured by time Hence also Augustine says general ad lit viii twenty twenty two twenty three that to be moved through time is to be moved by affections But as regards their nature they are measured by aeviternity whereas as regards the vision of glory they have a share of eternity Reply Obj two Aeviternity is simultaneously whole yet it is not eternity because before and after are compatible with it Reply Obj three In the very being of an angel considered absolutely there is no difference of past and future but only as regards accidental change Now to say that an angel was or is or will be is to be taken in a different sense according to the acceptation of our intellect which apprehends the angelic existence by comparison with different parts of time But when we say that an angel is or was we suppose something which being supposed its opposite is not subject to the divine power Whereas when we say he will be we do not as yet suppose anything Hence since the existence and non existence of an angel considered absolutely is subject to the divine power God can make the existence of an angel not future but He cannot cause him not to be while he is or not to have been after he has been Reply Obj four The duration of aeviternity is infinite forasmuch as it is not finished by time Hence there is no incongruity in saying that a creature is infinite inasmuch as it is not ended by any other creature SIXTH ARTICLE I Q ten Art six Whether There Is Only One Aeviternity Objection one It seems that there is not only one aeviternity for it is written in the apocryphal books of Esdras Majesty and power of ages are with Thee O Lord Obj two Further different genera have different measures But some aeviternal things belong to the corporeal genus as the heavenly bodies and others are spiritual substances as are the angels Therefore there is not only one aeviternity Obj three Further since aeviternity is a term of duration where there is one aeviternity there is also one duration But not all aeviternal things have one duration for some begin to exist after others as appears in the case especially of human souls Therefore there is not only one aeviternity Obj four Further things not dependent on each other do not seem to have one measure of duration for there appears to be one time for all temporal things since the first movement measured by time is in some way the cause of all movement But aeviternal things do not depend on each other for one angel is not the cause of another angel Therefore there is not only one aeviternity On the contrary Aeviternity is a more simple thing than time and is nearer to eternity But time is one only Therefore much more is aeviternity one only I answer that A twofold opinion exists on this subject Some say there is only one aeviternity others that there are many aeviternities Which of these is true may be considered from the cause why time is one for we can rise from corporeal things to the knowledge of spiritual things Now some say that there is only one time for temporal things forasmuch as one number exists for all things numbered as time is a number according to the Philosopher Physic iv This however is not a sufficient reason because time is not a number abstracted from the thing numbered but existing in the thing numbered otherwise it would not be continuous for ten ells of cloth are continuous not by reason of the number but by reason of the thing numbered Now number as it exists in the thing numbered is not the same for all but it is different for different things Hence others assert that the unity of eternity as the principle of all duration is the cause of the unity of time Thus all durations are one in that view in the light of their principle but are many in the light of the diversity of things receiving duration from the influx of the first principle On the other hand others assign primary matter as the cause why time is one as it is the first subject of movement the measure of which is time Neither of these reasons however is sufficient forasmuch as things which are one in principle or in subject especially if distant are not one absolutely but accidentally Therefore the true reason why time is one is to be found in the oneness of the first movement by which since it is most simple all other movements are measured Therefore time is referred to that movement not only as a measure is to the thing measured but also as accident is to subject and thus receives unity from it Whereas to other movements it is compared only as the measure is to the thing measured Hence it is not multiplied by their multitude because by one separate measure many things can be measured This being established we must observe that a twofold opinion existed concerning spiritual substances Some said that all proceeded from God in a certain equality as Origen said Peri Archon i or at least many of them as some others thought Others said that all spiritual substances proceeded from God in a certain degree and order and Dionysius Coel Hier x seems to have thought so when he said that among spiritual substances there are the first the middle and the last even in one order of angels Now according to the first opinion it must be said that there are many aeviternities as there are many aeviternal things of first degree But according to the second opinion it would be necessary to say that there is one aeviternity only because since each thing is measured by the most simple element of its genus it must be that the existence of all aeviternal things should be measured by the existence of the first aeviternal thing which is all the more simple the nearer it is to the first Wherefore because the second opinion is truer as will be shown later Q forty seven A two we concede at present that there is only one aeviternity Reply Obj one Aeviternity is sometimes taken for age that is a space of a thing s duration and thus we say many aeviternities when we mean ages Reply Obj two Although the heavenly bodies and spiritual things differ in the genus of their nature still they agree in having a changeless being and are thus measured by aeviternity Reply Obj three All temporal things did not begin together nevertheless there is one time for all of them by reason of the first measured by time and thus all aeviternal things have one aeviternity by reason of the first though all did not begin together Reply Obj four For things to be measured by one it is not necessary that the one should be the cause of all but that it be more simple than the rest QUESTION eleven THE UNITY OF GOD In Four Articles After the foregoing we consider the divine unity concerning which there are four points of inquiry one Whether one adds anything to being two Whether one and many are opposed to each other three Whether God is one four Whether He is in the highest degree one FIRST ARTICLE I Q eleven Art one Whether One Adds Anything to Being Objection one It seems that one adds something to being For everything is in a determinate genus by addition to being which penetrates all genera But one is a determinate genus for it is the principle of number which is a species of quantity Therefore one adds something to being Obj two Further what divides a thing common to all is an addition to it But being is divided by one and by many Therefore one is an addition to being Obj three Further if one is not an addition to being one and being must have the same meaning But it would be nugatory to call being by the name of being therefore it would be equally so to call being one Now this is false Therefore one is an addition to being On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom five ult Nothing which exists is not in some way one which would be false if one were an addition to being in the sense of limiting it Therefore one is not an addition to being I answer that One does not add any reality to being but is only a negation of division for one means undivided being This is the very reason why one is the same as being Now every being is either simple or compound But what is simple is undivided both actually and potentially Whereas what is compound has not being whilst its parts are divided but after they make up and compose it Hence it is manifest that the being of anything consists in undivision and hence it is that everything guards its unity as it guards its being Reply Obj one Some thinking that the one convertible with being is the same as the one which is the principle of number were divided into contrary opinions Pythagoras and Plato seeing that the one convertible with being did not add any reality to being but signified the substance of being as undivided thought that the same applied to the one which is the principle of number And because number is composed of unities they thought that numbers were the substances of all things Avicenna however on the contrary considering that one which is the principle of number added a reality to the substance of being otherwise number made of unities would not be a species of quantity thought that the one convertible with being added a reality to the substance of beings as white to man This however is manifestly false inasmuch as each thing is one by its substance For if a thing were one by anything else but by its substance since this again would be one supposing it were again one by another thing we should be driven on to infinity Hence we must adhere to the former statement therefore we must say that the one which is convertible with being does not add a reality to being but that the one which is the principle of number does add a reality to being belonging to the genus of quantity Reply Obj two There is nothing to prevent a thing which in one way is divided from being another way undivided as what is divided in number may be undivided in species thus it may be that a thing is in one way one and in another way many Still if it is absolutely undivided either because it is so according to what belongs to its essence though it may be divided as regards what is outside its essence as what is one in subject may have many accidents or because it is undivided actually and divided potentially as what is one in the whole and is many in parts in such a case a thing will be one absolutely and many accidentally On the other hand if it be undivided accidentally and divided absolutely as if it were divided in essence and undivided in idea or in principle or cause it will be many absolutely and one accidentally as what are many in number and one in species or one in principle Hence in that way being is divided by one and by many as it were by one absolutely and by many accidentally For multitude itself would not be contained under being unless it were in some way contained under one Thus Dionysius says Div Nom cap ult that there is no kind of multitude that is not in a way one But what are many in their parts are one in their whole and what are many in accidents are one in subject and what are many in number are one in species and what are many in species are one in genus and what are many in processions are one in principle Reply Obj three It does not follow that it is nugatory to say being is one forasmuch as one adds an idea to being SECOND ARTICLE I Q eleven Art two Whether One and Many Are Opposed to Each Other Objection one It seems that one and many are not mutually opposed For no opposite thing is predicated of its opposite But every multitude is in a certain way one as appears from the preceding article Therefore one is not opposed to multitude Obj two Further no opposite thing is constituted by its opposite But multitude is constituted by one Therefore it is not opposed to multitude Obj three Further one is opposed to one But the idea of few is opposed to many Therefore one is not opposed to many Obj four Further if one is opposed to multitude it is opposed as the undivided is to the divided and is thus opposed to it as privation is to habit But this appears to be incongruous because it would follow that one comes after multitude and is defined by it whereas on the contrary multitude is defined by one Hence there would be a vicious circle in the definition which is inadmissible Therefore one and many are not opposed On the contrary Things which are opposed in idea are themselves opposed to each other But the idea of one consists in indivisibility and the idea of multitude contains division Therefore one and many are opposed to each other I answer that One is opposed to many but in various ways The one which is the principle of number is opposed to multitude which is number as the measure is to the thing measured For one implies the idea of a primary measure and number is multitude measured by one as is clear from Metaph x But the one which is convertible with being is opposed to multitude by way of privation as the undivided is to the thing divided Reply Obj one No privation entirely takes away the being of a thing inasmuch as privation means negation in the subject according to the Philosopher Categor viii Nevertheless every privation takes away some being and so in being by reason of its universality the privation of being has its foundation in being which is not the case in privations of special forms as of sight or of whiteness and the like And what applies to being applies also to one and to good which are convertible with being for the privation of good is founded in some good likewise the removal of unity is founded in some one thing Hence it happens that multitude is some one thing and evil is some good thing and non being is some kind of being Nevertheless opposite is not predicated of opposite forasmuch as one is absolute and the other is relative for what is relative being as a potentiality is non being absolutely i e actually or what is absolute being in the genus of substance is non being relatively as regards some accidental being In the same way what is relatively good is absolutely bad or vice versa likewise what is absolutely one is relatively many and vice versa Reply Obj two A whole is twofold In one sense it is homogeneous composed of like parts in another sense it is heterogeneous composed of dissimilar parts Now in every homogeneous whole the whole is made up of parts having the form of the whole as for instance every part of water is water and such is the constitution of a continuous thing made up of its parts In every heterogeneous whole however every part is wanting in the form belonging to the whole as for instance no part of a house is a house nor is any part of a man a man Now multitude is such a kind of a whole Therefore inasmuch as its part has not the form of the multitude the latter is composed of unities as a house is composed of not houses not indeed as if unities constituted multitude so far as they are undivided in which way they are opposed to multitude but so far as they have being as also the parts of a house make up the house by the fact that they are beings not by the fact that they are not houses Reply Obj three Many is taken in two ways absolutely and in that sense it is opposed to one in another way as importing some kind of excess in which sense it is opposed to few hence in the first sense two are many but not in the second sense Reply Obj four One is opposed to many privatively inasmuch as the idea of many involves division Hence division must be prior to unity not absolutely in itself but according to our way of apprehension For we apprehend simple things by compound things and hence we define a point to be what has no part or the beginning of a line Multitude also in idea follows on one because we do not understand divided things to convey the idea of multitude except by the fact that we attribute unity to every part Hence one is placed in the definition of multitude but multitude is not placed in the definition of one But division comes to be understood from the very negation of being so what first comes to mind is being secondly that this being is not that being and thus we apprehend division as a consequence thirdly comes the notion of one fourthly the notion of multitude THIRD ARTICLE I Q eleven Art three Whether God Is One Objection one It seems that God is not one For it is written For there be many gods and many lords one Cor eight five Obj two Further One as the principle of number cannot be predicated of God since quantity is not predicated of God likewise neither can one which is convertible with being be predicated of God because it imports privation and every privation is an imperfection which cannot apply to God Therefore God is not one On the contrary It is written Hear O Israel the Lord our God is one Lord Deut six four I answer that It can be shown from these three sources that God is one First from His simplicity For it is manifest that the reason why any singular thing is this particular thing is because it cannot be communicated to many since that whereby Socrates is a man can be communicated to many whereas what makes him this particular man is only communicable to one Therefore if Socrates were a man by what makes him to be this particular man as there cannot be many Socrates so there could not in that way be many men Now this belongs to God alone for God Himself is His own nature as was shown above Q three A three Therefore in the very same way God is God and He is this God Impossible is it therefore that many Gods should exist Secondly this is proved from the infinity of His perfection For it was shown above Q four A two that God comprehends in Himself the whole perfection of being If then many gods existed they would necessarily differ from each other Something therefore would belong to one which did not belong to another And if this were a privation one of them would not be absolutely perfect but if a perfection one of them would be without it So it is impossible for many gods to exist Hence also the ancient philosophers constrained as it were by truth when they asserted an infinite principle asserted likewise that there was only one such principle Thirdly this is shown from the unity of the world For all things that exist are seen to be ordered to each other since some serve others But things that are diverse do not harmonize in the same order unless they are ordered thereto by one For many are reduced into one order by one better than by many because one is the per se cause of one and many are only the accidental cause of one inasmuch as they are in some way one Since therefore what is first is most perfect and is so per se and not accidentally it must be that the first which reduces all into one order should be only one And this one is God Reply Obj one Gods are called many by the error of some who worshipped many deities thinking as they did that the planets and other stars were gods and also the separate parts of the world Hence the Apostle adds Our God is one et cetera Reply Obj two One which is the principle of number is not predicated of God but only of material things For one the principle of number belongs to the genus of mathematics which are material in being and abstracted from matter only in idea But one which is convertible with being is a metaphysical entity and does not depend on matter in its being And although in God there is no privation still according to the mode of our apprehension He is known to us by way only of privation and remotion Thus there is no reason why a certain kind of privation should not be predicated of God for instance that He is incorporeal and infinite and in the same way it is said of God that He is one FOURTH ARTICLE I Q eleven Art four Whether God Is Supremely One Objection one It seems that God is not supremely one For one is so called from the privation of division But privation cannot be greater or less Therefore God is not more one than other things which are called one Obj two Further nothing seems to be more indivisible than what is actually and potentially indivisible such as a point and unity But a thing is said to be more one according as it is indivisible Therefore God is not more one than unity is one and a point is one Obj three Further what is essentially good is supremely good Therefore what is essentially one is supremely one But every being is essentially one as the Philosopher says Metaph iv Therefore every being is supremely one and therefore God is not one more than any other being is one On the contrary Bernard says De Consid v Among all things called one the unity of the Divine Trinity holds the first place I answer that Since one is an undivided being if anything is supremely one it must be supremely being and supremely undivided Now both of these belong to God For He is supremely being inasmuch as His being is not determined by any nature to which it is adjoined since He is being itself subsistent absolutely undetermined But He is supremely undivided inasmuch as He is divided neither actually nor potentially by any mode of division since He is altogether simple as was shown above Q three A seven Hence it is manifest that God is one in the supreme degree Reply Obj one Although privation considered in itself is not susceptive of more or less still according as its opposite is subject to more or less privation also can be considered itself in the light of more and less Therefore according as a thing is more divided or is divisible either less or not at all in the degree it is called more or less or supremely one Reply Obj two A point and unity which is the principle of number are not supremely being inasmuch as they have being only in some subject Hence neither of them can be supremely one For as a subject cannot be supremely one because of the difference within it of accident and subject so neither can an accident Reply Obj three Although every being is one by its substance still every such substance is not equally the cause of unity for the substance of some things is compound and of others simple QUESTION twelve HOW GOD IS KNOWN BY US In Thirteen Articles As hitherto we have considered God as He is in Himself we now go on to consider in what manner He is in the knowledge of creatures concerning which there are thirteen points of inquiry one Whether any created intellect can see the essence of God two Whether the essence of God is seen by the intellect through any created image three Whether the essence of God can be seen by the corporeal eye four Whether any created intellectual substance is sufficient by its own natural powers to see the essence of God five Whether the created intellect needs any created light in order to see the essence of God six Whether of those who see God one sees Him more perfectly than another seven Whether any created intellect can comprehend the essence of God eight Whether the created intellect seeing the essence of God knows all things in it nine Whether what is there known is known by any similitudes ten Whether the created intellect knows at once what it sees in God eleven Whether in the state of this life any man can see the essence of God twelve Whether by natural reason we can know God in this life thirteen Whether there is in this life any knowledge of God through grace above the knowledge of natural reason FIRST ARTICLE I Q twelve Art one Whether Any Created Intellect Can See the Essence of God Objection one It seems that no created intellect can see the essence of God For Chrysostom Hom xiv in Joan commenting on John one eighteen No man hath seen God at any time says Not prophets only but neither angels nor archangels have seen God For how can a creature see what is increatable Dionysius also says Div Nom i speaking of God Neither is there sense nor image nor opinion nor reason nor knowledge of Him Obj two Further everything infinite as such is unknown But God is infinite as was shown above Q seven A one Therefore in Himself He is unknown Obj three Further the created intellect knows only existing things For what falls first under the apprehension of the intellect is being Now God is not something existing but He is rather super existence as Dionysius says Div Nom iv Therefore God is not intelligible but above all intellect Obj four Further there must be some proportion between the knower and the known since the known is the perfection of the knower But no proportion exists between the created intellect and God for there is an infinite distance between them Therefore the created intellect cannot see the essence of God On the contrary It is written We shall see Him as He is one John two two I answer that Since everything is knowable according as it is actual God Who is pure act without any admixture of potentiality is in Himself supremely knowable But what is supremely knowable in itself may not be knowable to a particular intellect on account of the excess of the intelligible object above the intellect as for example the sun which is supremely visible cannot be seen by the bat by reason of its excess of light Therefore some who considered this held that no created intellect can see the essence of God This opinion however is not tenable For as the ultimate beatitude of man consists in the use of his highest function which is the operation of his intellect if we suppose that the created intellect could never see God it would either never attain to beatitude or its beatitude would consist in something else beside God which is opposed to faith For the ultimate perfection of the rational creature is to be found in that which is the principle of its being since a thing is perfect so far as it attains to its principle Further the same opinion is also against reason For there resides in every man a natural desire to know the cause of any effect which he sees and thence arises wonder in men But if the intellect of the rational creature could not reach so far as to the first cause of things the natural desire would remain void Hence it must be absolutely granted that the blessed see the essence of God Reply Obj one Both of these authorities speak of the vision of comprehension Hence Dionysius premises immediately before the words cited He is universally to all incomprehensible et cetera Chrysostom likewise after the words quoted says He says this of the most certain vision of the Father which is such a perfect consideration and comprehension as the Father has of the Son Reply Obj two The infinity of matter not made perfect by form is unknown in itself because all knowledge comes by the form whereas the infinity of the form not limited by matter is in itself supremely known God is Infinite in this way and not in the first way as appears from what was said above Q seven A one Reply Obj three God is not said to be not existing as if He did not exist at all but because He exists above all that exists inasmuch as He is His own existence Hence it does not follow that He cannot be known at all but that He exceeds every kind of knowledge which means that He is not comprehended Reply Obj four Proportion is twofold In one sense it means a certain relation of one quantity to another according as double treble and equal are species of proportion In another sense every relation of one thing to another is called proportion And in this sense there can be a proportion of the creature to God inasmuch as it is related to Him as the effect of its cause and as potentiality to its act and in this way the created intellect can be proportioned to know God SECOND ARTICLE I Q twelve Art two Whether the Essence of God Is Seen by the Created Intellect Through an Image Objection one It seems that the essence of God is seen through an image by the created intellect For it is written We know that when He shall appear we shall be like to Him and Vulg because we shall see Him as He is one John three two Obj two Further Augustine says De Trin v When we know God some likeness of God is made in us Obj three Further the intellect in act is the actual intelligible as sense in act is the actual sensible But this comes about inasmuch as sense is informed with the likeness of the sensible object and the intellect with the likeness of the thing understood Therefore if God is seen by the created intellect in act it must be that He is seen by some similitude On the contrary Augustine says De Trin xv that when the Apostle says We see through a glass and in an enigma Douay in a dark manner by the terms glass and enigma certain similitudes are signified by him which are accommodated to the vision of God But to see the essence of God is not an enigmatic nor a speculative vision but is on the contrary of an opposite kind Therefore the divine essence is not seen through a similitude I answer that Two things are required both for sensible and for intellectual vision viz power of sight and union of the thing seen with the sight For vision is made actual only when the thing seen is in a certain way in the seer Now in corporeal things it is clear that the thing seen cannot be by its essence in the seer but only by its likeness as the similitude of a stone is in the eye whereby the vision is made actual whereas the substance of the stone is not there But if the principle of the visual power and the thing seen were one and the same thing it would necessarily follow that the seer would receive both the visual power and the form whereby it sees from that one same thing Now it is manifest both that God is the author of the intellectual power and that He can be seen by the intellect And since the intellective power of the creature is not the essence of God it follows that it is some kind of participated likeness of Him who is the first intellect Hence also the intellectual power of the creature is called an intelligible light as it were derived from the first light whether this be understood of the natural power or of some perfection superadded of grace or of glory Therefore in order to see God there must be some similitude of God on the part of the visual faculty whereby the intellect is made capable of seeing God But on the part of the object seen which must necessarily be united to the seer the essence of God cannot be seen by any created similitude First because as Dionysius says Div Nom i by the similitudes of the inferior order of things the superior can in no way be known as by the likeness of a body the essence of an incorporeal thing cannot be known Much less therefore can the essence of God be seen by any created likeness whatever Secondly because the essence of God is His own very existence as was shown above Q three A four which cannot be said of any created form and so no created form can be the similitude representing the essence of God to the seer Thirdly because the divine essence is uncircumscribed and contains in itself super eminently whatever can be signified or understood by the created intellect Now this cannot in any way be represented by any created likeness for every created form is determined according to some aspect of wisdom or of power or of being itself or of some like thing Hence to say that God is seen by some similitude is to say that the divine essence is not seen at all which is false Therefore it must be said that to see the essence of God there is required some similitude in the visual faculty namely the light of glory strengthening the intellect to see God which is spoken of in the Psalm thirty five ten In Thy light we shall see light The essence of God however cannot be seen by any created similitude representing the divine essence itself as it really is Reply Obj one That authority speaks of the similitude which is caused by participation of the light of glory Reply Obj two Augustine speaks of the knowledge of God here on earth Reply Obj three The divine essence is existence itself Hence as other intelligible forms which are not their own existence are united to the intellect by means of some entity whereby the intellect itself is informed and made in act so the divine essence is united to the created intellect as the object actually understood making the intellect in act by and of itself THIRD ARTICLE I Q twelve Art three Whether the Essence of God Can Be Seen with the Bodily Eye Objection one It seems that the essence of God can be seen by the corporeal eye For it is written Job nineteen twenty six In my flesh I shall see God and Job forty two five With the hearing of the ear I have heard Thee but now my eye seeth Thee Obj two Further Augustine says De Civ Dei xxix twenty nine Those eyes namely the glorified will therefore have a greater power of sight not so much to see more keenly as some report of the sight of serpents or of eagles for whatever acuteness of vision is possessed by these creatures they can see only corporeal things but to see even incorporeal things Now whoever can see incorporeal things can be raised up to see God Therefore the glorified eye can see God Obj three Further God can be seen by man through a vision of the imagination For it is written I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne et cetera Isa six one But an imaginary vision originates from sense for the imagination is moved by sense to act Therefore God can be seen by a vision of sense On the contrary Augustine says De Vid Deum Ep cxlvii No one has ever seen God either in this life as He is nor in the angelic life as visible things are seen by corporeal vision I answer that It is impossible for God to be seen by the sense of sight or by any other sense or faculty of the sensitive power For every such kind of power is the act of a corporeal organ as will be shown later Q seventy eight Now act is proportional to the nature which possesses it Hence no power of that kind can go beyond corporeal things For God is incorporeal as was shown above Q three A one Hence He cannot be seen by the sense or the imagination but only by the intellect Reply Obj one The words In my flesh I shall see God my Saviour do not mean that God will be seen with the eye of the flesh but that man existing in the flesh after the resurrection will see God Likewise the words Now my eye seeth Thee are to be understood of the mind s eye as the Apostle says May He give unto you the spirit of wisdom in the knowledge of Him that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened Eph one seventeen eighteen Reply Obj two Augustine speaks as one inquiring and conditionally This appears from what he says previously Therefore they will have an altogether different power viz the glorified eyes if they shall see that incorporeal nature and afterwards he explains this saying It is very credible that we shall so see the mundane bodies of the new heaven and the new earth as to see most clearly God everywhere present governing all corporeal things not as we now see the invisible things of God as understood by what is made but as when we see men among whom we live living and exercising the functions of human life we do not believe they live but see it Hence it is evident how the glorified eyes will see God as now our eyes see the life of another But life is not seen with the corporeal eye as a thing in itself visible but as the indirect object of the sense which indeed is not known by sense but at once together with sense by some other cognitive power But that the divine presence is known by the intellect immediately on the sight of and through corporeal things happens from two causes viz from the perspicuity of the intellect and from the refulgence of the divine glory infused into the body after its renovation Reply Obj three The essence of God is not seen in a vision of the imagination but the imagination receives some form representing God according to some mode of similitude as in the divine Scripture divine things are metaphorically described by means of sensible things FOURTH ARTICLE I Q twelve Art four Whether Any Created Intellect by Its Natural Powers Can See the Divine Essence Objection one It seems that a created intellect can see the Divine essence by its own natural power For Dionysius says Div Nom iv An angel is a pure mirror most clear receiving if it is right to say so the whole beauty of God But if a reflection is seen the original thing is seen Therefore since an angel by his natural power understands himself it seems that by his own natural power he understands the Divine essence Obj two Further what is supremely visible is made less visible to us by reason of our defective corporeal or intellectual sight But the angelic intellect has no such defect Therefore since God is supremely intelligible in Himself it seems that in like manner He is supremely so to an angel Therefore if he can understand other intelligible things by his own natural power much more can he understand God Obj three Further corporeal sense cannot be raised up to understand incorporeal substance which is above its nature Therefore if to see the essence of God is above the nature of every created intellect it follows that no created intellect can reach up to see the essence of God at all But this is false as appears from what is said above A one Therefore it seems that it is natural for a created intellect to see the Divine essence On the contrary It is written The grace of God is life everlasting Rom six twenty three But life everlasting consists in the vision of the Divine essence according to the words This is eternal life that they may know Thee the only true God et cetera John seventeen three Therefore to see the essence of God is possible to the created intellect by grace and not by nature I answer that It is impossible for any created intellect to see the essence of God by its own natural power For knowledge is regulated according as the thing known is in the knower But the thing known is in the knower according to the mode of the knower Hence the knowledge of every knower is ruled according to its own nature If therefore the mode of anything s being exceeds the mode of the knower it must result that the knowledge of the object is above the nature of the knower Now the mode of being of things is manifold For some things have being only in this one individual matter as all bodies But others are subsisting natures not residing in matter at all which however are not their own existence but receive it and these are the incorporeal beings called angels But to God alone does it belong to be His own subsistent being Therefore what exists only in individual matter we know naturally forasmuch as our soul whereby we know is the form of certain matter Now our soul possesses two cognitive powers one is the act of a corporeal organ which naturally knows things existing in individual matter hence sense knows only the singular But there is another kind of cognitive power in the soul called the intellect and this is not the act of any corporeal organ Wherefore the intellect naturally knows natures which exist only in individual matter not as they are in such individual matter but according as they are abstracted therefrom by the considering act of the intellect hence it follows that through the intellect we can understand these objects as universal and this is beyond the power of the sense Now the angelic intellect naturally knows natures that are not in matter but this is beyond the power of the intellect of our soul in the state of its present life united as it is to the body It follows therefore that to know self subsistent being is natural to the divine intellect alone and this is beyond the natural power of any created intellect for no creature is its own existence forasmuch as its existence is participated Therefore the created intellect cannot see the essence of God unless God by His grace unites Himself to the created intellect as an object made intelligible to it Reply Obj one This mode of knowing God is natural to an angel namely to know Him by His own likeness refulgent in the angel himself But to know God by any created similitude is not to know the essence of God as was shown above A two Hence it does not follow that an angel can know the essence of God by his own power Reply Obj two The angelic intellect is not defective if defect be taken to mean privation as if it were without anything which it ought to have But if the defect be taken negatively in that sense every creature is defective when compared with God forasmuch as it does not possess the excellence which is in God Reply Obj three The sense of sight as being altogether material cannot be raised up to immateriality But our intellect or the angelic intellect inasmuch as it is elevated above matter in its own nature can be raised up above its own nature to a higher level by grace The proof is that sight cannot in any way know abstractedly what it knows concretely for in no way can it perceive a nature except as this one particular nature whereas our intellect is able to consider abstractedly what it knows concretely Now although it knows things which have a form residing in matter still it resolves the composite into both of these elements and it considers the form separately by itself Likewise also the intellect of an angel although it naturally knows the concrete in any nature still it is able to separate that existence by its intellect since it knows that the thing itself is one thing and its existence is another Since therefore the created intellect is naturally capable of apprehending the concrete form and the concrete being abstractedly by way of a kind of resolution of parts it can by grace be raised up to know separate subsisting substance and separate subsisting existence FIFTH ARTICLE I Q twelve Art five Whether the Created Intellect Needs Any Created Light in Order to See the Essence of God Objection one It seems that the created intellect does not need any created light in order to see the essence of God For what is of itself lucid in sensible things does not require any other light in order to be seen Therefore the same applies to intelligible things Now God is intelligible light Therefore He is not seen by means of any created light Obj two Further if God is seen through a medium He is not seen in His essence But if seen by any created light He is seen through a medium Therefore He is not seen in His essence Obj three Further what is created can be natural to some creature Therefore if the essence of God is seen through any created light such a light can be made natural to some other creature and thus that creature would not need any other light to see God which is impossible Therefore it is not necessary that every creature should require a superadded light in order to see the essence of God On the contrary It is written In Thy light we shall see light Ps thirty five ten I answer that Everything which is raised up to what exceeds its nature must be prepared by some disposition above its nature as for example if air is to receive the form of fire it must be prepared by some disposition for such a form But when any created intellect sees the essence of God the essence of God itself becomes the intelligible form of the intellect Hence it is necessary that some supernatural disposition should be added to the intellect in order that it may be raised up to such a great and sublime height Now since the natural power of the created intellect does not avail to enable it to see the essence of God as was shown in the preceding article it is necessary that the power of understanding should be added by divine grace Now this increase of the intellectual powers is called the illumination of the intellect as we also call the intelligible object itself by the name of light of illumination And this is the light spoken of in the Apocalypse Apoc twenty one twenty three The glory of God hath enlightened it viz the society of the blessed who see God By this light the blessed are made deiform i e like to God according to the saying When He shall appear we shall be like to Him and Vulg because we shall see Him as He is one John two two Reply Obj one The created light is necessary to see the essence of God not in order to make the essence of God intelligible which is of itself intelligible but in order to enable the intellect to understand in the same way as a habit makes a power abler to act Even so corporeal light is necessary as regards external sight inasmuch as it makes the medium actually transparent and susceptible of color Reply Obj two This light is required to see the divine essence not as a similitude in which God is seen but as a perfection of the intellect strengthening it to see God Therefore it may be said that this light is to be described not as a medium in which God is seen but as one by which He is seen and such a medium does not take away the immediate vision of God Reply Obj three The disposition to the form of fire can be natural only to the subject of that form Hence the light of glory cannot be natural to a creature unless the creature has a divine nature which is impossible But by this light the rational creature is made deiform as is said in this article SIXTH ARTICLE I Q twelve Art six Whether of Those Who See the Essence of God One Sees More Perfectly Than Another Objection one It seems that of those who see the essence of God one does not see more perfectly than another For it is written one John three two We shall see Him as He is But He is only in one way Therefore He will be seen by all in one way only and therefore He will not be seen more perfectly by one and less perfectly by another Obj two Further Augustine says Octog Tri Quaest qu xxxii One person cannot see one and the same thing more perfectly than another But all who see the essence of God understand the Divine essence for God is seen by the intellect and not by sense as was shown above A three Therefore of those who see the divine essence one does not see more clearly than another Obj three Further That anything be seen more perfectly than another can happen in two ways either on the part of the visible object or on the part of the visual power of the seer On the part of the object it may so happen because the object is received more perfectly in the seer that is according to the greater perfection of the similitude but this does not apply to the present question for God is present to the intellect seeing Him not by way of similitude but by His essence It follows then that if one sees Him more perfectly than another this happens according to the difference of the intellectual power thus it follows too that the one whose intellectual power is higher will see Him the more clearly and this is incongruous since equality with angels is promised to men as their beatitude On the contrary Eternal life consists in the vision of God according to John seventeen three This is eternal life that they may know Thee the only true God et cetera Therefore if all saw the essence of God equally in eternal life all would be equal the contrary to which is declared by the Apostle Star differs from star in glory one Cor fifteen forty one I answer that Of those who see the essence of God one sees Him more perfectly than another This indeed does not take place as if one had a more perfect similitude of God than another since that vision will not spring from any similitude but it will take place because one intellect will have a greater power or faculty to see God than another The faculty of seeing God however does not belong to the created intellect naturally but is given to it by the light of glory which establishes the intellect in a kind of deiformity as appears from what is said above in the preceding article Hence the intellect which has more of the light of glory will see God the more perfectly and he will have a fuller participation of the light of glory who has more charity because where there is the greater charity there is the more desire and desire in a certain degree makes the one desiring apt and prepared to receive the object desired Hence he who possesses the more charity will see God the more perfectly and will be the more beatified Reply Obj one In the words We shall see Him as He is the conjunction as determines the mode of vision on the part of the object seen so that the meaning is we shall see Him to be as He is because we shall see His existence which is His essence But it does not determine the mode of vision on the part of the one seeing as if the meaning was that the mode of seeing God will be as perfect as is the perfect mode of God s existence Thus appears the answer to the Second Objection For when it is said that one intellect does not understand one and the same thing better than another this would be true if referred to the mode of the thing understood for whoever understands it otherwise than it really is does not truly understand it but not if referred to the mode of understanding for the understanding of one is more perfect than the understanding of another Reply Obj three The diversity of seeing will not arise on the part of the object seen for the same object will be presented to all viz the essence of God nor will it arise from the diverse participation of the object seen by different similitudes but it will arise on the part of the diverse faculty of the intellect not indeed the natural faculty but the glorified faculty SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q twelve Art seven Whether Those Who See the Essence of God Comprehend Him Objection one It seems that those who see the divine essence comprehend God For the Apostle says Phil three twelve But I follow after if I may by any means comprehend Douay apprehend But the Apostle did not follow in vain for he said one Cor nine twenty six I so run not as at an uncertainty Therefore he comprehended and in the same way others also whom he invites to do the same saying So run that you may comprehend Obj two Further Augustine says De Vid Deum Ep cxlvii That is comprehended which is so seen as a whole that nothing of it is hidden from the seer But if God is seen in His essence He is seen whole and nothing of Him is hidden from the seer since God is simple Therefore whoever sees His essence comprehends Him Obj three Further if we say that He is seen as a whole but not wholly it may be contrarily urged that wholly refers either to the mode of the seer or to the mode of the thing seen But he who sees the essence of God sees Him wholly if the mode of the thing seen is considered forasmuch as he sees Him as He is also likewise he sees Him wholly if the mode of the seer is meant forasmuch as the intellect will with its full power see the Divine essence Therefore all who see the essence of God see Him wholly therefore they comprehend Him On the contrary It is written O most mighty great and powerful the Lord of hosts is Thy Name Great in counsel and incomprehensible in thought Jer thirty two eighteen nineteen Therefore He cannot be comprehended I answer that It is impossible for any created intellect to comprehend God yet for the mind to attain to God in some degree is great beatitude as Augustine says De Verb Dom Serm xxxviii In proof of this we must consider that what is comprehended is perfectly known and that is perfectly known which is known so far as it can be known Thus if anything which is capable of scientific demonstration is held only by an opinion resting on a probably proof it is not comprehended as for instance if anyone knows by scientific demonstration that a triangle has three angles equal to two right angles he comprehends that truth whereas if anyone accepts it as a probable opinion because wise men or most men teach it he cannot be said to comprehend the thing itself because he does not attain to that perfect mode of knowledge of which it is intrinsically capable But no created intellect can attain to that perfect mode of the knowledge of the Divine intellect whereof it is intrinsically capable Which thus appears Everything is knowable according to its actuality But God whose being is infinite as was shown above Q seven is infinitely knowable Now no created intellect can know God infinitely For the created intellect knows the Divine essence more or less perfectly in proportion as it receives a greater or lesser light of glory Since therefore the created light of glory received into any created intellect cannot be infinite it is clearly impossible for any created intellect to know God in an infinite degree Hence it is impossible that it should comprehend God Reply Obj one Comprehension is twofold in one sense it is taken strictly and properly according as something is included in the one comprehending and thus in no way is God comprehended either by intellect or in any other way forasmuch as He is infinite and cannot be included in any finite being so that no finite being can contain Him infinitely in the degree of His own infinity In this sense we now take comprehension But in another sense comprehension is taken more largely as opposed to non attainment for he who attains to anyone is said to comprehend him when he attains to him And in this sense God is comprehended by the blessed according to the words I held him and I will not let him go Cant three four in this sense also are to be understood the words quoted from the Apostle concerning comprehension And in this way comprehension is one of the three prerogatives of the soul responding to hope as vision responds to faith and fruition responds to charity For even among ourselves not everything seen is held or possessed forasmuch as things either appear sometimes afar off or they are not in our power of attainment Neither again do we always enjoy what we possess either because we find no pleasure in them or because such things are not the ultimate end of our desire so as to satisfy and quell it But the blessed possess these three things in God because they see Him and in seeing Him possess Him as present having the power to see Him always and possessing Him they enjoy Him as the ultimate fulfilment of desire Reply Obj two God is called incomprehensible not because anything of Him is not seen but because He is not seen as perfectly as He is capable of being seen thus when any demonstrable proposition is known by probable reason only it does not follow that any part of it is unknown either the subject or the predicate or the composition but that it is not as perfectly known as it is capable of being known Hence Augustine in his definition of comprehension says the whole is comprehended when it is seen in such a way that nothing of it is hidden from the seer or when its boundaries can be completely viewed or traced for the boundaries of a thing are said to be completely surveyed when the end of the knowledge of it is attained Reply Obj three The word wholly denotes a mode of the object not that the whole object does not come under knowledge but that the mode of the object is not the mode of the one who knows Therefore he who sees God s essence sees in Him that He exists infinitely and is infinitely knowable nevertheless this infinite mode does not extend to enable the knower to know infinitely thus for instance a person can have a probable opinion that a proposition is demonstrable although he himself does not know it as demonstrated EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q twelve Art eight Whether Those Who See the Essence of God See All in God Objection one It seems that those who see the essence of God see all things in God For Gregory says Dialog iv What do they not see who see Him Who sees all things But God sees all things Therefore those who see God see all things Obj two Further whoever sees a mirror sees what is reflected in the mirror But all actual or possible things shine forth in God as in a mirror for He knows all things in Himself Therefore whoever sees God sees all actual things in Him and also all possible things Obj three Further whoever understands the greater can understand the least as is said in De Anima iii But all that God does or can do are less than His essence Therefore whoever understands God can understand all that God does or can do Obj four Further the rational creature naturally desires to know all things Therefore if in seeing God it does not know all things its natural desire will not rest satisfied thus in seeing God it will not be fully happy which is incongruous Therefore he who sees God knows all things On the contrary The angels see the essence of God and yet do not know all things For as Dionysius says Coel Hier vii the inferior angels are cleansed from ignorance by the superior angels Also they are ignorant of future contingent things and of secret thoughts for this knowledge belongs to God alone Therefore whosoever sees the essence of God does not know all things I answer that The created intellect in seeing the divine essence does not see in it all that God does or can do For it is manifest that things are seen in God as they are in Him But all other things are in God as effects are in the power of their cause Therefore all things are seen in God as an effect is seen in its cause Now it is clear that the more perfectly a cause is seen the more of its effects can be seen in it For whoever has a lofty understanding as soon as one demonstrative principle is put before him can gather the knowledge of many conclusions but this is beyond one of a weaker intellect for he needs things to be explained to him separately And so an intellect can know all the effects of a cause and the reasons for those effects in the cause itself if it comprehends the cause wholly Now no created intellect can comprehend God wholly as shown above A seven Therefore no created intellect in seeing God can know all that God does or can do for this would be to comprehend His power but of what God does or can do any intellect can know the more the more perfectly it sees God Reply Obj one Gregory speaks as regards the object being sufficient namely God who in Himself sufficiently contains and shows forth all things but it does not follow that whoever sees God knows all things for he does not perfectly comprehend Him Reply Obj two It is not necessary that whoever sees a mirror should see all that is in the mirror unless his glance comprehends the mirror itself Reply Obj three Although it is more to see God than to see all things else still it is a greater thing to see Him so that all things are known in Him than to see Him in such a way that not all things but the fewer or the more are known in Him For it has been shown in this article that the more things are known in God according as He is seen more or less perfectly Reply Obj four The natural desire of the rational creature is to know everything that belongs to the perfection of the intellect namely the species and the genera of things and their types and these everyone who sees the Divine essence will see in God But to know other singulars their thoughts and their deeds does not belong to the perfection of the created intellect nor does its natural desire go out to these things neither again does it desire to know things that exist not as yet but which God can call into being Yet if God alone were seen Who is the fount and principle of all being and of all truth He would so fill the natural desire of knowledge that nothing else would be desired and the seer would be completely beatified Hence Augustine says Confess v Unhappy the man who knoweth all these i e all creatures and knoweth not Thee but happy whoso knoweth Thee although he know not these And whoso knoweth both Thee and them is not the happier for them but for Thee alone NINTH ARTICLE I Q twelve Art nine Whether What Is Seen in God by Those Who See the Divine Essence Is Seen Through Any Similitude Objection one It seems that what is seen in God by those who see the Divine essence is seen by means of some similitude For every kind of knowledge comes about by the knower being assimilated to the object known For thus the intellect in act becomes the actual intelligible and the sense in act becomes the actual sensible inasmuch as it is informed by a similitude of the object as the eye by the similitude of color Therefore if the intellect of one who sees the Divine essence understands any creatures in God it must be informed by their similitudes Obj two Further what we have seen we keep in memory But Paul seeing the essence of God whilst in ecstasy when he had ceased to see the Divine essence as Augustine says general ad lit ii twenty eight thirty four remembered many of the things he had seen in the rapture hence he said I have heard secret words which it is not granted to man to utter two Cor twelve four Therefore it must be said that certain similitudes of what he remembered remained in his mind and in the same way when he actually saw the essence of God he had certain similitudes or ideas of what he actually saw in it On the contrary A mirror and what is in it are seen by means of one likeness But all things are seen in God as in an intelligible mirror Therefore if God Himself is not seen by any similitude but by His own essence neither are the things seen in Him seen by any similitudes or ideas I answer that Those who see the divine essence see what they see in God not by any likeness but by the divine essence itself united to their intellect For each thing is known in so far as its likeness is in the one who knows Now this takes place in two ways For as things which are like one and the same thing are like to each other the cognitive faculty can be assimilated to any knowable object in two ways In one way it is assimilated by the object itself when it is directly informed by a similitude and then the object is known in itself In another way when informed by a similitude which resembles the object and in this way the knowledge is not of the thing in itself but of the thing in its likeness For the knowledge of a man in himself differs from the knowledge of him in his image Hence to know things thus by their likeness in the one who knows is to know them in themselves or in their own nature whereas to know them by their similitudes pre existing in God is to see them in God Now there is a difference between these two kinds of knowledge Hence according to the knowledge whereby things are known by those who see the essence of God they are seen in God Himself not by any other similitudes but by the Divine essence alone present to the intellect by which also God Himself is seen Reply Obj one The created intellect of one who sees God is assimilated to what is seen in God inasmuch as it is united to the Divine essence in which the similitudes of all things pre exist Reply Obj two Some of the cognitive faculties form other images from those first conceived thus the imagination from the preconceived images of a mountain and of gold can form the likeness of a golden mountain and the intellect from the preconceived ideas of genus and difference forms the idea of species in like manner from the similitude of an image we can form in our minds the similitude of the original of the image Thus Paul or any other person who sees God by the very vision of the divine essence can form in himself the similitudes of what is seen in the divine essence which remained in Paul even when he had ceased to see the essence of God Still this kind of vision whereby things are seen by this likeness thus conceived is not the same as that whereby things are seen in God TENTH ARTICLE I Q twelve Art ten Whether Those Who See the Essence of God See All They See in It at the Same Time Objection one It seems that those who see the essence of God do not see all they see in Him at one and the same time For according to the Philosopher Topic ii It may happen that many things are known but only one is understood But what is seen in God is understood for God is seen by the intellect Therefore those who see God do not see all in Him at the same time Obj two Further Augustine says general ad lit viii twenty two twenty three God moves the spiritual creature according to time i e by intelligence and affection But the spiritual creature is the angel who sees God Therefore those who see God understand and are affected successively for time means succession On the contrary Augustine says De Trin xvi Our thoughts will not be unstable going to and fro from one thing to another but we shall see all we know at one glance I answer that What is seen in the Word is seen not successively but at the same time In proof whereof we ourselves cannot know many things all at once forasmuch as understand many things by means of many ideas But our intellect cannot be actually informed by many diverse ideas at the same time so as to understand by them as one body cannot bear different shapes simultaneously Hence when many things can be understood by one idea they are understood at the same time as the parts of a whole are understood successively and not all at the same time if each one is understood by its own idea whereas if all are understood under the one idea of the whole they are understood simultaneously Now it was shown above that things seen in God are not seen singly by their own similitude but all are seen by the one essence of God Hence they are seen simultaneously and not successively Reply Obj one We understand one thing only when we understand by one idea but many things understood by one idea are understood simultaneously as in the idea of a man we understand animal and rational and in the idea of a house we understand the wall and the roof Reply Obj two As regards their natural knowledge whereby they know things by diverse ideas given them the angels do not know all things simultaneously and thus they are moved in the act of understanding according to time but as regards what they see in God they see all at the same time ELEVENTH ARTICLE I Q twelve Art eleven Whether Anyone in This Life Can See the Essence of God Objection one It seems that one can in this life see the Divine essence For Jacob said I have seen God face to face general thirty two thirty But to see Him face to face is to see His essence as appears from the words We see now in a glass and in a dark manner but then face to face one Cor thirteen twelve Obj two Further the Lord said to Moses I speak to him mouth to mouth and plainly and not by riddles and figures doth he see the Lord Num twelve eight but this is to see God in His essence Therefore it is possible to see the essence of God in this life Obj three Further that wherein we know all other things and whereby we judge of other things is known in itself to us But even now we know all things in God for Augustine says Confess viii If we both see that what you say is true and we both see that what I say is true where I ask do we see this neither I in thee nor thou in me but both of us in the very incommutable truth itself above our minds He also says De Vera Relig xxx that We judge of all things according to the divine truth and De Trin xii that it is the duty of reason to judge of these corporeal things according to the incorporeal and eternal ideas which unless they were above the mind could not be incommutable Therefore even in this life we see God Himself Obj four Further according to Augustine general ad lit xii twenty four twenty five those things that are in the soul by their essence are seen by intellectual vision But intellectual vision is of intelligible things not by similitudes but by their very essences as he also says general ad lit xiii twenty four twenty five Therefore since God is in our soul by His essence it follows that He is seen by us in His essence On the contrary It is written Man shall not see Me and live Ex thirty two twenty and a gloss upon this says In this mortal life God can be seen by certain images but not by the likeness itself of His own nature I answer that God cannot be seen in His essence by a mere human being except he be separated from this mortal life The reason is because as was said above A four the mode of knowledge follows the mode of the nature of the knower But our soul as long as we live in this life has its being in corporeal matter hence naturally it knows only what has a form in matter or what can be known by such a form Now it is evident that the Divine essence cannot be known through the nature of material things For it was shown above AA two nine that the knowledge of God by means of any created similitude is not the vision of His essence Hence it is impossible for the soul of man in this life to see the essence of God This can be seen in the fact that the more our soul is abstracted from corporeal things the more it is capable of receiving abstract intelligible things Hence in dreams and alienations of the bodily senses divine revelations and foresight of future events are perceived the more clearly It is not possible therefore that the soul in this mortal life should be raised up to the supreme of intelligible objects i e to the divine essence Reply Obj one According to Dionysius Coel Hier iv a man is said in the Scriptures to see God in the sense that certain figures are formed in the senses or imagination according to some similitude representing in part the divinity So when Jacob says I have seen God face to face this does not mean the Divine essence but some figure representing God And this is to be referred to some high mode of prophecy so that God seems to speak though in an imaginary vision as will later be explained II II Q one hundred seventy four in treating of the degrees of prophecy We may also say that Jacob spoke thus to designate some exalted intellectual contemplation above the ordinary state Reply Obj two As God works miracles in corporeal things so also He does supernatural wonders above the common order raising the minds of some living in the flesh beyond the use of sense even up to the vision of His own essence as Augustine says general ad lit xii twenty six twenty seven twenty eight of Moses the teacher of the Jews and of Paul the teacher of the Gentiles This will be treated more fully in the question of rapture II II Q one hundred seventy five Reply Obj three All things are said to be seen in God and all things are judged in Him because by the participation of His light we know and judge all things for the light of natural reason itself is a participation of the divine light as likewise we are said to see and judge of sensible things in the sun i e by the sun s light Hence Augustine says Soliloq i eight The lessons of instruction can only be seen as it were by their own sun namely God As therefore in order to see a sensible object it is not necessary to see the substance of the sun so in like manner to see any intelligible object it is not necessary to see the essence of God Reply Obj four Intellectual vision is of the things which are in the soul by their essence as intelligible things are in the intellect And thus God is in the souls of the blessed not thus is He in our soul but by presence essence and power TWELFTH ARTICLE I Q twelve Art twelve Whether God Can Be Known in This Life by Natural Reason Objection one It seems that by natural reason we cannot know God in this life For Boethius says De Consol v that reason does not grasp simple form But God is a supremely simple form as was shown above Q three A seven Therefore natural reason cannot attain to know Him Obj two Further the soul understands nothing by natural reason without the use of the imagination But we cannot have an imagination of God Who is incorporeal Therefore we cannot know God by natural knowledge Obj three Further the knowledge of natural reason belongs to both good and evil inasmuch as they have a common nature But the knowledge of God belongs only to the good for Augustine says De Trin i The weak eye of the human mind is not fixed on that excellent light unless purified by the justice of faith Therefore God cannot be known by natural reason On the contrary It is written Rom one nineteen That which is known of God namely what can be known of God by natural reason is manifest in them I answer that Our natural knowledge begins from sense Hence our natural knowledge can go as far as it can be led by sensible things But our mind cannot be led by sense so far as to see the essence of God because the sensible effects of God do not equal the power of God as their cause Hence from the knowledge of sensible things the whole power of God cannot be known nor therefore can His essence be seen But because they are His effects and depend on their cause we can be led from them so far as to know of God whether He exists and to know of Him what must necessarily belong to Him as the first cause of all things exceeding all things caused by Him Hence we know that His relationship with creatures so far as to be the cause of them all also that creatures differ from Him inasmuch as He is not in any way part of what is caused by Him and that creatures are not removed from Him by reason of any defect on His part but because He superexceeds them all Reply Obj one Reason cannot reach up to simple form so as to know what it is but it can know whether it is Reply Obj two God is known by natural knowledge through the images of His effects Reply Obj three As the knowledge of God s essence is by grace it belongs only to the good but the knowledge of Him by natural reason can belong to both good and bad and hence Augustine says Retract i retracting what he had said before I do not approve what I said in prayer God who willest that only the pure should know truth For it can be answered that many who are not pure can know many truths i e by natural reason THIRTEENTH ARTICLE I Q twelve Art thirteen Whether by Grace a Higher Knowledge of God Can Be Obtained Than by Natural Reason Objection one It seems that by grace a higher knowledge of God is not obtained than by natural reason For Dionysius says De Mystica Theol i that whoever is the more united to God in this life is united to Him as to one entirely unknown He says the same of Moses who nevertheless obtained a certain excellence by the knowledge conferred by grace But to be united to God while ignoring of Him what He is comes about also by natural reason Therefore God is not more known to us by grace than by natural reason Obj two Further we can acquire the knowledge of divine things by natural reason only through the imagination and the same applies to the knowledge given by grace For Dionysius says Coel Hier i that it is impossible for the divine ray to shine upon us except as screened round about by the many colored sacred veils Therefore we cannot know God more fully by grace than by natural reason Obj three Further our intellect adheres to God by grace of faith But faith does not seem to be knowledge for Gregory says Hom xxvi in Ev that things not seen are the objects of faith and not of knowledge Therefore there is not given to us a more excellent knowledge of God by grace On the contrary The Apostle says that God hath revealed to us His spirit what none of the princes of this world knew one Cor two ten namely the philosophers as the gloss expounds I answer that We have a more perfect knowledge of God by grace than by natural reason Which is proved thus The knowledge which we have by natural reason contains two things images derived from the sensible objects and the natural intelligible light enabling us to abstract from them intelligible conceptions Now in both of these human knowledge is assisted by the revelation of grace For the intellect s natural light is strengthened by the infusion of gratuitous light and sometimes also the images in the human imagination are divinely formed so as to express divine things better than those do which we receive from sensible objects as appears in prophetic visions while sometimes sensible things or even voices are divinely formed to express some divine meaning as in the Baptism the Holy Ghost was seen in the shape of a dove and the voice of the Father was heard This is My beloved Son Matt three seventeen Reply Obj one Although by the revelation of grace in this life we cannot know of God what He is and thus are united to Him as to one unknown still we know Him more fully according as many and more excellent of His effects are demonstrated to us and according as we attribute to Him some things known by divine revelation to which natural reason cannot reach as for instance that God is Three and One Reply Obj two From the images either received from sense in the natural order or divinely formed in the imagination we have so much the more excellent intellectual knowledge the stronger the intelligible light is in man and thus through the revelation given by the images a fuller knowledge is received by the infusion of the divine light Reply Obj three Faith is a kind of knowledge inasmuch as the intellect is determined by faith to some knowable object But this determination to one object does not proceed from the vision of the believer but from the vision of Him who is believed Thus as far as faith falls short of vision it falls short of the knowledge which belongs to science for science determines the intellect to one object by the vision and understanding of first principles QUESTION thirteen THE NAMES OF GOD In Twelve Articles After the consideration of those things which belong to the divine knowledge we now proceed to the consideration of the divine names For everything is named by us according to our knowledge of it Under this head there are twelve points for inquiry one Whether God can be named by us two Whether any names applied to God are predicated of Him substantially three Whether any names applied to God are said of Him literally or are all to be taken metaphorically four Whether any names applied to God are synonymous five Whether some names are applied to God and to creatures univocally or equivocally six Whether supposing they are applied analogically they are applied first to God or to creatures seven Whether any names are applicable to God from time eight Whether this name God is a name of nature or of the operation nine Whether this name God is a communicable name ten Whether it is taken univocally or equivocally as signifying God by nature by participation and by opinion eleven Whether this name Who is is the supremely appropriate name of God twelve Whether affirmative propositions can be formed about God FIRST ARTICLE I Q thirteen Art one Whether a Name Can Be Given to God Objection one It seems that no name can be given to God For Dionysius says Div Nom i that Of Him there is neither name nor can one be found of Him and it is written What is His name and what is the name of His Son if thou knowest Prov thirty four Obj two Further every name is either abstract or concrete But concrete names do not belong to God since He is simple nor do abstract names belong to Him forasmuch as they do not signify any perfect subsisting thing Therefore no name can be said of God Obj three Further nouns are taken to signify substance with quality verbs and participles signify substance with time pronouns the same with demonstration or relation But none of these can be applied to God for He has no quality nor accident nor time moreover He cannot be felt so as to be pointed out nor can He be described by relation inasmuch as relations serve to recall a thing mentioned before by nouns participles or demonstrative pronouns Therefore God cannot in any way be named by us On the contrary It is written Ex fifteen three The Lord is a man of war Almighty is His name I answer that Since according to the Philosopher Peri Herm i words are signs of ideas and ideas the similitude of things it is evident that words relate to the meaning of things signified through the medium of the intellectual conception It follows therefore that we can give a name to anything in as far as we can understand it Now it was shown above Q twelve AA eleven twelve that in this life we cannot see the essence of God but we know God from creatures as their principle and also by way of excellence and remotion In this way therefore He can be named by us from creatures yet not so that the name which signifies Him expresses the divine essence in itself Thus the name man expresses the essence of man in himself since it signifies the definition of man by manifesting his essence for the idea expressed by the name is the definition Reply Obj one The reason why God has no name or is said to be above being named is because His essence is above all that we understand about God and signify in word Reply Obj two Because we know and name God from creatures the names we attribute to God signify what belongs to material creatures of which the knowledge is natural to us And because in creatures of this kind what is perfect and subsistent is compound whereas their form is not a complete subsisting thing but rather is that whereby a thing is hence it follows that all names used by us to signify a complete subsisting thing must have a concrete meaning as applicable to compound things whereas names given to signify simple forms signify a thing not as subsisting but as that whereby a thing is as for instance whiteness signifies that whereby a thing is white And as God is simple and subsisting we attribute to Him abstract names to signify His simplicity and concrete names to signify His substance and perfection although both these kinds of names fail to express His mode of being forasmuch as our intellect does not know Him in this life as He is Reply Obj three To signify substance with quality is to signify the suppositum with a nature or determined form in which it subsists Hence as some things are said of God in a concrete sense to signify His subsistence and perfection so likewise nouns are applied to God signifying substance with quality Further verbs and participles which signify time are applied to Him because His eternity includes all time For as we can apprehend and signify simple subsistences only by way of compound things so we can understand and express simple eternity only by way of temporal things because our intellect has a natural affinity to compound and temporal things But demonstrative pronouns are applied to God as describing what is understood not what is sensed For we can only describe Him as far as we understand Him Thus according as nouns participles and demonstrative pronouns are applicable to God so far can He be signified by relative pronouns SECOND ARTICLE I Q thirteen Art two Whether Any Name Can Be Applied to God Substantially Objection one It seems that no name can be applied to God substantially For Damascene says De Fide Orth i nine Everything said of God signifies not His substance but rather shows forth what He is not or expresses some relation or something following from His nature or operation Obj two Further Dionysius says Div Nom i You will find a chorus of holy doctors addressed to the end of distinguishing clearly and praiseworthily the divine processions in the denomination of God Thus the names applied by the holy doctors in praising God are distinguished according to the divine processions themselves But what expresses the procession of anything does not signify its essence Therefore the names applied to God are not said of Him substantially Obj three Further a thing is named by us according as we understand it But God is not understood by us in this life in His substance Therefore neither is any name we can use applied substantially to God On the contrary Augustine says De Trin vi The being of God is the being strong or the being wise or whatever else we may say of that simplicity whereby His substance is signified Therefore all names of this kind signify the divine substance I answer that Negative names applied to God or signifying His relation to creatures manifestly do not at all signify His substance but rather express the distance of the creature from Him or His relation to something else or rather the relation of creatures to Himself But as regards absolute and affirmative names of God as good wise and the like various and many opinions have been given For some have said that all such names although they are applied to God affirmatively nevertheless have been brought into use more to express some remotion from God rather than to express anything that exists positively in Him Hence they assert that when we say that God lives we mean that God is not like an inanimate thing and the same in like manner applies to other names and this was taught by Rabbi Moses Others say that these names applied to God signify His relationship towards creatures thus in the words God is good we mean God is the cause of goodness in things and the same rule applies to other names Both of these opinions however seem to be untrue for three reasons First because in neither of them can a reason be assigned why some names more than others are applied to God For He is assuredly the cause of bodies in the same way as He is the cause of good things therefore if the words God is good signified no more than God is the cause of good things it might in like manner be said that God is a body inasmuch as He is the cause of bodies So also to say that He is a body implies that He is not a mere potentiality as is primary matter Secondly because it would follow that all names applied to God would be said of Him by way of being taken in a secondary sense as healthy is secondarily said of medicine forasmuch as it signifies only the cause of the health in the animal which primarily is called healthy Thirdly because this is against the intention of those who speak of God For in saying that God lives they assuredly mean more than to say the He is the cause of our life or that He differs from inanimate bodies Therefore we must hold a different doctrine viz that these names signify the divine substance and are predicated substantially of God although they fall short of a full representation of Him Which is proved thus For these names express God so far as our intellects know Him Now since our intellect knows God from creatures it knows Him as far as creatures represent Him Now it is shown above Q four A two that God prepossesses in Himself all the perfections of creatures being Himself simply and universally perfect Hence every creature represents Him and is like Him so far as it possesses some perfection yet it represents Him not as something of the same species or genus but as the excelling principle of whose form the effects fall short although they derive some kind of likeness thereto even as the forms of inferior bodies represent the power of the sun This was explained above Q four A three in treating of the divine perfection Therefore the aforesaid names signify the divine substance but in an imperfect manner even as creatures represent it imperfectly So when we say God is good the meaning is not God is the cause of goodness or God is not evil but the meaning is Whatever good we attribute to creatures pre exists in God and in a more excellent and higher way Hence it does not follow that God is good because He causes goodness but rather on the contrary He causes goodness in things because He is good according to what Augustine says De Doctr Christ i thirty two Because He is good we are Reply Obj one Damascene says that these names do not signify what God is forasmuch as by none of these names is perfectly expressed what He is but each one signifies Him in an imperfect manner even as creatures represent Him imperfectly Reply Obj two In the significance of names that from which the name is derived is different sometimes from what it is intended to signify as for instance this name stone lapis is imposed from the fact that it hurts the foot loedit pedem but it is not imposed to signify that which hurts the foot but rather to signify a certain kind of body otherwise everything that hurts the foot would be a stone This refers to the Latin etymology of the word lapis which has no place in English So we must say that these kinds of divine names are imposed from the divine processions for as according to the diverse processions of their perfections creatures are the representations of God although in an imperfect manner so likewise our intellect knows and names God according to each kind of procession but nevertheless these names are not imposed to signify the procession themselves as if when we say God lives the sense were life proceeds from Him but to signify the principle itself of things in so far as life pre exists in Him although it pre exists in Him in a more eminent way than can be understood or signified Reply Obj three We cannot know the essence of God in this life as He really is in Himself but we know Him accordingly as He is represented in the perfections of creatures and thus the names imposed by us signify Him in that manner only THIRD ARTICLE I Q thirteen Art three Whether Any Name Can Be Applied to God in Its Literal Sense Objection one It seems that no name is applied literally to God For all names which we apply to God are taken from creatures as was explained above A one But the names of creatures are applied to God metaphorically as when we say God is a stone or a lion or the like Therefore names are applied to God in a metaphorical sense Obj two Further no name can be applied literally to anything if it should be withheld from it rather than given to it But all such names as good wise and the like are more truly withheld from God than given to Him as appears from Dionysius says Coel Hier ii Therefore none of these names belong to God in their literal sense Obj three Further corporeal names are applied to God in a metaphorical sense only since He is incorporeal But all such names imply some kind of corporeal condition for their meaning is bound up with time and composition and like corporeal conditions Therefore all these names are applied to God in a metaphorical sense On the contrary Ambrose says De Fide ii Some names there are which express evidently the property of the divinity and some which express the clear truth of the divine majesty but others there are which are applied to God metaphorically by way of similitude Therefore not all names are applied to God in a metaphorical sense but there are some which are said of Him in their literal sense I answer that According to the preceding article our knowledge of God is derived from the perfections which flow from Him to creatures which perfections are in God in a more eminent way than in creatures Now our intellect apprehends them as they are in creatures and as it apprehends them it signifies them by names Therefore as to the names applied to God viz the perfections which they signify such as goodness life and the like and their mode of signification As regards what is signified by these names they belong properly to God and more properly than they belong to creatures and are applied primarily to Him But as regards their mode of signification they do not properly and strictly apply to God for their mode of signification applies to creatures Reply Obj one There are some names which signify these perfections flowing from God to creatures in such a way that the imperfect way in which creatures receive the divine perfection is part of the very signification of the name itself as stone signifies a material being and names of this kind can be applied to God only in a metaphorical sense Other names however express these perfections absolutely without any such mode of participation being part of their signification as the words being good living and the like and such names can be literally applied to God Reply Obj two Such names as these as Dionysius shows are denied of God for the reason that what the name signifies does not belong to Him in the ordinary sense of its signification but in a more eminent way Hence Dionysius says also that God is above all substance and all life Reply Obj three These names which are applied to God literally imply corporeal conditions not in the thing signified but as regards their mode of signification whereas those which are applied to God metaphorically imply and mean a corporeal condition in the thing signified FOURTH ARTICLE I Q thirteen Art four Whether Names Applied to God Are Synonymous Objection one It seems that these names applied to God are synonymous names For synonymous names are those which mean exactly the same But these names applied to God mean entirely the same thing in God for the goodness of God is His essence and likewise it is His wisdom Therefore these names are entirely synonymous Obj two Further if it be said these names signify one and the same thing in reality but differ in idea it can be objected that an idea to which no reality corresponds is a vain notion Therefore if these ideas are many and the thing is one it seems also that all these ideas are vain notions Obj three Further a thing which is one in reality and in idea is more one than what is one in reality and many in idea But God is supremely one Therefore it seems that He is not one in reality and many in idea and thus the names applied to God do not signify different ideas and thus they are synonymous On the contrary All synonyms united with each other are redundant as when we say vesture clothing Therefore if all names applied to God are synonymous we cannot properly say good God or the like and yet it is written O most mighty great and powerful the Lord of hosts is Thy name Jer thirty two eighteen I answer that These names spoken of God are not synonymous This would be easy to understand if we said that these names are used to remove or to express the relation of cause to creatures for thus it would follow that there are different ideas as regards the diverse things denied of God or as regards diverse effects connoted But even according to what was said above A two that these names signify the divine substance although in an imperfect manner it is also clear from what has been said AA one two that they have diverse meanings For the idea signified by the name is the conception in the intellect of the thing signified by the name But our intellect since it knows God from creatures in order to understand God forms conceptions proportional to the perfections flowing from God to creatures which perfections pre exist in God unitedly and simply whereas in creatures they are received and divided and multiplied As therefore to the different perfections of creatures there corresponds one simple principle represented by different perfections of creatures in a various and manifold manner so also to the various and multiplied conceptions of our intellect there corresponds one altogether simple principle according to these conceptions imperfectly understood Therefore although the names applied to God signify one thing still because they signify that under many and different aspects they are not synonymous Thus appears the solution of the First Objection since synonymous terms signify one thing under one aspect for words which signify different aspects of one thing do not signify primarily and absolutely one thing because the term only signifies the thing through the medium of the intellectual conception as was said above Reply Obj two The many aspects of these names are not empty and vain for there corresponds to all of them one simple reality represented by them in a manifold and imperfect manner Reply Obj three The perfect unity of God requires that what are manifold and divided in others should exist in Him simply and unitedly Thus it comes about that He is one in reality and yet multiple in idea because our intellect apprehends Him in a manifold manner as things represent Him FIFTH ARTICLE I Q thirteen Art five Whether What Is Said of God and of Creatures Is Univocally Predicated of Them Objection one It seems that the things attributed to God and creatures are univocal For every equivocal term is reduced to the univocal as many are reduced to one for if the name dog be said equivocally of the barking dog and of the dogfish it must be said of some univocally viz of all barking dogs otherwise we proceed to infinitude Now there are some univocal agents which agree with their effects in name and definition as man generates man and there are some agents which are equivocal as the sun which causes heat although the sun is hot only in an equivocal sense Therefore it seems that the first agent to which all other agents are reduced is an univocal agent and thus what is said of God and creatures is predicated univocally Obj two Further there is no similitude among equivocal things Therefore as creatures have a certain likeness to God according to the word of Genesis general one twenty six Let us make man to our image and likeness it seems that something can be said of God and creatures univocally Obj three Further measure is homogeneous with the thing measured But God is the first measure of all beings Therefore God is homogeneous with creatures and thus a word may be applied univocally to God and to creatures On the contrary whatever is predicated of various things under the same name but not in the same sense is predicated equivocally But no name belongs to God in the same sense that it belongs to creatures for instance wisdom in creatures is a quality but not in God Now a different genus changes an essence since the genus is part of the definition and the same applies to other things Therefore whatever is said of God and of creatures is predicated equivocally Further God is more distant from creatures than any creatures are from each other But the distance of some creatures makes any univocal predication of them impossible as in the case of those things which are not in the same genus Therefore much less can anything be predicated univocally of God and creatures and so only equivocal predication can be applied to them I answer that Univocal predication is impossible between God and creatures The reason of this is that every effect which is not an adequate result of the power of the efficient cause receives the similitude of the agent not in its full degree but in a measure that falls short so that what is divided and multiplied in the effects resides in the agent simply and in the same manner as for example the sun by exercise of its one power produces manifold and various forms in all inferior things In the same way as said in the preceding article all perfections existing in creatures divided and multiplied pre exist in God unitedly Thus when any term expressing perfection is applied to a creature it signifies that perfection distinct in idea from other perfections as for instance by the term wise applied to man we signify some perfection distinct from a man s essence and distinct from his power and existence and from all similar things whereas when we apply to it God we do not mean to signify anything distinct from His essence or power or existence Thus also this term wise applied to man in some degree circumscribes and comprehends the thing signified whereas this is not the case when it is applied to God but it leaves the thing signified as incomprehended and as exceeding the signification of the name Hence it is evident that this term wise is not applied in the same way to God and to man The same rule applies to other terms Hence no name is predicated univocally of God and of creatures Neither on the other hand are names applied to God and creatures in a purely equivocal sense as some have said Because if that were so it follows that from creatures nothing could be known or demonstrated about God at all for the reasoning would always be exposed to the fallacy of equivocation Such a view is against the philosophers who proved many things about God and also against what the Apostle says The invisible things of God are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made Rom one twenty Therefore it must be said that these names are said of God and creatures in an analogous sense i e according to proportion Now names are thus used in two ways either according as many things are proportionate to one thus for example healthy predicated of medicine and urine in relation and in proportion to health of a body of which the former is the sign and the latter the cause or according as one thing is proportionate to another thus healthy is said of medicine and animal since medicine is the cause of health in the animal body And in this way some things are said of God and creatures analogically and not in a purely equivocal nor in a purely univocal sense For we can name God only from creatures A one Thus whatever is said of God and creatures is said according to the relation of a creature to God as its principle and cause wherein all perfections of things pre exist excellently Now this mode of community of idea is a mean between pure equivocation and simple univocation For in analogies the idea is not as it is in univocals one and the same yet it is not totally diverse as in equivocals but a term which is thus used in a multiple sense signifies various proportions to some one thing thus healthy applied to urine signifies the sign of animal health and applied to medicine signifies the cause of the same health Reply Obj one Although equivocal predications must be reduced to univocal still in actions the non univocal agent must precede the univocal agent For the non univocal agent is the universal cause of the whole species as for instance the sun is the cause of the generation of all men whereas the univocal agent is not the universal efficient cause of the whole species otherwise it would be the cause of itself since it is contained in the species but is a particular cause of this individual which it places under the species by way of participation Therefore the universal cause of the whole species is not an univocal agent and the universal cause comes before the particular cause But this universal agent whilst it is not univocal nevertheless is not altogether equivocal otherwise it could not produce its own likeness but rather it is to be called an analogical agent as all univocal predications are reduced to one first non univocal analogical predication which is being Reply Obj two The likeness of the creature to God is imperfect for it does not represent one and the same generic thing Q four A three Reply Obj three God is not the measure proportioned to things measured hence it is not necessary that God and creatures should be in the same genus The arguments adduced in the contrary sense prove indeed that these names are not predicated univocally of God and creatures yet they do not prove that they are predicated equivocally SIXTH ARTICLE I Q thirteen Art six Whether Names Predicated of God Are Predicated Primarily of Creatures Objection one It seems that names are predicated primarily of creatures rather than of God For we name anything accordingly as we know it since names as the Philosopher says are signs of ideas But we know creatures before we know God Therefore the names imposed by us are predicated primarily of creatures rather than of God Obj two Further Dionysius says Div Nom i We name God from creatures But names transferred from creatures to God are said primarily of creatures rather than of God as lion stone and the like Therefore all names applied to God and creatures are applied primarily to creatures rather than to God Obj three Further all names equally applied to God and creatures are applied to God as the cause of all creatures as Dionysius says De Mystica Theol But what is applied to anything through its cause is applied to it secondarily for healthy is primarily predicated of animal rather than of medicine which is the cause of health Therefore these names are said primarily of creatures rather than of God On the contrary It is written I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ of Whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named Eph three fourteen fifteen and the same applies to the other names applied to God and creatures Therefore these names are applied primarily to God rather than to creatures I answer that In names predicated of many in an analogical sense all are predicated because they have reference to some one thing and this one thing must be placed in the definition of them all And since that expressed by the name is the definition as the Philosopher says Metaph iv such a name must be applied primarily to that which is put in the definition of such other things and secondarily to these others according as they approach more or less to that first Thus for instance healthy applied to animals comes into the definition of healthy applied to medicine which is called healthy as being the cause of health in the animal and also into the definition of healthy which is applied to urine which is called healthy in so far as it is the sign of the animal s health Thus all names applied metaphorically to God are applied to creatures primarily rather than to God because when said of God they mean only similitudes to such creatures For as smiling applied to a field means only that the field in the beauty of its flowering is like the beauty of the human smile by proportionate likeness so the name of lion applied to God means only that God manifests strength in His works as a lion in his Thus it is clear that applied to God the signification of names can be defined only from what is said of creatures But to other names not applied to God in a metaphorical sense the same rule would apply if they were spoken of God as the cause only as some have supposed For when it is said God is good it would then only mean God is the cause of the creature s goodness thus the term good applied to God would included in its meaning the creature s goodness Hence good would apply primarily to creatures rather than to God But as was shown above A two these names are applied to God not as the cause only but also essentially For the words God is good or wise signify not only that He is the cause of wisdom or goodness but that these exist in Him in a more excellent way Hence as regards what the name signifies these names are applied primarily to God rather than to creatures because these perfections flow from God to creatures but as regards the imposition of the names they are primarily applied by us to creatures which we know first Hence they have a mode of signification which belongs to creatures as said above A three Reply Obj one This objection refers to the imposition of the name Reply Obj two The same rule does not apply to metaphorical and to other names as said above Reply Obj three This objection would be valid if these names were applied to God only as cause and not also essentially for instance as healthy is applied to medicine SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q thirteen Art seven Whether Names Which Imply Relation to Creatures Are Predicated of God Temporally Objection one It seems that names which imply relation to creatures are not predicated of God temporally For all such names signify the divine substance as is universally held Hence also Ambrose says De Fide i that this name Lord is the name of power which is the divine substance and Creator signifies the action of God which is His essence Now the divine substance is not temporal but eternal Therefore these names are not applied to God temporally but eternally Obj two Further that to which something applies temporally can be described as made for what is white temporally is made white But to make does not apply to God Therefore nothing can be predicated of God temporally Obj three Further if any names are applied to God temporally as implying relation to creatures the same rule holds good of all things that imply relation to creatures But some names are spoken of God implying relation of God to creatures from eternity for from eternity He knew and loved the creature according to the word I have loved thee with an everlasting love Jer thirty one three Therefore also other names implying relation to creatures as Lord and Creator are applied to God from eternity Obj four Further names of this kind signify relation Therefore that relation must be something in God or in the creature only But it cannot be that it is something in the creature only for in that case God would be called Lord from the opposite relation which is in creatures and nothing is named from its opposite Therefore the relation must be something in God also But nothing temporal can be in God for He is above time Therefore these names are not applied to God temporally Obj five Further a thing is called relative from relation for instance lord from lordship as white from whiteness Therefore if the relation of lordship is not really in God but only in idea it follows that God is not really Lord which is plainly false Obj six Further in relative things which are not simultaneous in nature one can exist without the other as a thing knowable can exist without the knowledge of it as the Philosopher says Praedic v But relative things which are said of God and creatures are not simultaneous in nature Therefore a relation can be predicated of God to the creature even without the existence of the creature and thus these names Lord and Creator are predicated of God from eternity and not temporally On the contrary Augustine says De Trin v that this relative appellation Lord is applied to God temporally I answer that The names which import relation to creatures are applied to God temporally and not from eternity To see this we must learn that some have said that relation is not a reality but only an idea But this is plainly seen to be false from the very fact that things themselves have a mutual natural order and habitude Nevertheless it is necessary to know that since relation has two extremes it happens in three ways that a relation is real or logical Sometimes from both extremes it is an idea only as when mutual order or habitude can only go between things in the apprehension of reason as when we say a thing the same as itself For reason apprehending one thing twice regards it as two thus it apprehends a certain habitude of a thing to itself And the same applies to relations between being and non being formed by reason apprehending non being as an extreme The same is true of relations that follow upon an act of reason as genus and species and the like Now there are other relations which are realities as regards both extremes as when for instance a habitude exists between two things according to some reality that belongs to both as is clear of all relations consequent upon quantity as great and small double and half and the like for quantity exists in both extremes and the same applies to relations consequent upon action and passion as motive power and the movable thing father and son and the like Again sometimes a relation in one extreme may be a reality while in the other extreme it is an idea only and this happens whenever two extremes are not of one order as sense and science refer respectively to sensible things and to intellectual things which inasmuch as they are realities existing in nature are outside the order of sensible and intellectual existence Therefore in science and in sense a real relation exists because they are ordered either to the knowledge or to the sensible perception of things whereas the things looked at in themselves are outside this order and hence in them there is no real relation to science and sense but only in idea inasmuch as the intellect apprehends them as terms of the relations of science and sense Hence the Philosopher says Metaph v that they are called relative not forasmuch as they are related to other things but as others are related to them Likewise for instance on the right is not applied to a column unless it stands as regards an animal on the right side which relation is not really in the column but in the animal Since therefore God is outside the whole order of creation and all creatures are ordered to Him and not conversely it is manifest that creatures are really related to God Himself whereas in God there is no real relation to creatures but a relation only in idea inasmuch as creatures are referred to Him Thus there is nothing to prevent these names which import relation to the creature from being predicated of God temporally not by reason of any change in Him but by reason of the change of the creature as a column is on the right of an animal without change in itself but by change in the animal Reply Obj one Some relative names are imposed to signify the relative habitudes themselves as master and servant father and son and the like and these relatives are called predicamental secundum esse But others are imposed to signify the things from which ensue certain habitudes as the mover and the thing moved the head and the thing that has a head and the like and these relatives are called transcendental secundum dici Thus there is the same two fold difference in divine names For some signify the habitude itself to the creature as Lord and these do not signify the divine substance directly but indirectly in so far as they presuppose the divine substance as dominion presupposes power which is the divine substance Others signify the divine essence directly and consequently the corresponding habitudes as Saviour Creator and suchlike and these signify the action of God which is His essence Yet both names are said of God temporarily so far as they imply a habitude either principally or consequently but not as signifying the essence either directly or indirectly Reply Obj two As relations applied to God temporally are only in God in our idea so to become or to be made are applied to God only in idea with no change in Him as for instance when we say Lord Thou art become Douay hast been our refuge Ps eighty nine one Reply Obj three The operation of the intellect and the will is in the operator therefore names signifying relations following upon the action of the intellect or will are applied to God from eternity whereas those following upon the actions proceeding according to our mode of thinking to external effects are applied to God temporally as Saviour Creator and the like Reply Obj four Relations signified by these names which are applied to God temporally are in God only in idea but the opposite relations in creatures are real Nor is it incongruous that God should be denominated from relations really existing in the thing yet so that the opposite relations in God should also be understood by us at the same time in the sense that God is spoken of relatively to the creature inasmuch as the creature is related to Him thus the Philosopher says Metaph v that the object is said to be knowable relatively because knowledge relates to it Reply Obj five Since God is related to the creature for the reason that the creature is related to Him and since the relation of subjection is real in the creature it follows that God is Lord not in idea only but in reality for He is called Lord according to the manner in which the creature is subject to Him Reply Obj six To know whether relations are simultaneous by nature or otherwise it is not necessary to consider the order of things to which they belong but the meaning of the relations themselves For if one in its idea includes another and vice versa then they are simultaneous by nature as double and half father and son and the like But if one in its idea includes another and not vice versa they are not simultaneous by nature This applies to science and its object for the object knowable is considered as a potentiality and the science as a habit or as an act Hence the knowable object in its mode of signification exists before science but if the same object is considered in act then it is simultaneous with science in act for the object known is nothing as such unless it is known Thus though God is prior to the creature still because the signification of Lord includes the idea of a servant and vice versa these two relative terms Lord and servant are simultaneous by nature Hence God was not Lord until He had a creature subject to Himself EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q thirteen Art eight Whether This Name God Is a Name of the Nature Objection one It seems that this name God is not a name of the nature For Damascene says De Fide Orth one that God Theos is so called from theein which means to take care of and to cherish all things or from aithein that is to burn for our God is a fire consuming all malice or from theasthai which means to consider all things But all these names belong to operation Therefore this name God signifies His operation and not His nature Obj two Further a thing is named by us as we know it But the divine nature is unknown to us Therefore this name God does not signify the divine nature On the contrary Ambrose says De Fide i that God is a name of the nature I answer that Whence a name is imposed and what the name signifies are not always the same thing For as we know substance from its properties and operations so we name substance sometimes for its operation or its property e g we name the substance of a stone from its act as for instance that it hurts the foot loedit pedem but still this name is not meant to signify the particular action but the stone s substance The things on the other hand known to us in themselves such as heat cold whiteness and the like are not named from other things Hence as regards such things the meaning of the name and its source are the same Because therefore God is not known to us in His nature but is made known to us from His operations or effects we name Him from these as said in A one hence this name God is a name of operation so far as relates to the source of its meaning For this name is imposed from His universal providence over all things since all who speak of God intend to name God as exercising providence over all hence Dionysius says Div Nom ii The Deity watches over all with perfect providence and goodness But taken from this operation this name God is imposed to signify the divine nature Reply Obj one All that Damascene says refers to providence which is the source of the signification of the name God Reply Obj two We can name a thing according to the knowledge we have of its nature from its properties and effects Hence because we can know what stone is in itself from its property this name stone signifies the nature of the stone itself for it signifies the definition of stone by which we know what it is for the idea which the name signifies is the definition as is said in Metaph iv Now from the divine effects we cannot know the divine nature in itself so as to know what it is but only by way of eminence and by way of causality and of negation as stated above Q twelve A twelve Thus the name God signifies the divine nature for this name was imposed to signify something existing above all things the principle of all things and removed from all things for those who name God intend to signify all this NINTH ARTICLE I Q thirteen Art nine Whether This Name God Is Communicable Objection one It seems that this name God is communicable For whosoever shares in the thing signified by a name shares in the name itself But this name God signifies the divine nature which is communicable to others according to the words He hath given us great Vulg most great and precious promises that by these we Vulg ye may be made partakers of the divine nature two Pet one four Therefore this name God can be communicated to others Obj two Further only proper names are not communicable Now this name God is not a proper but an appellative noun which appears from the fact that it has a plural according to the text I have said You are gods Ps eighty one six Therefore this name God is communicable Obj three Further this name God comes from operation as explained But other names given to God from His operations or effects are communicable as good wise and the like Therefore this name God is communicable On the contrary It is written They gave the incommunicable name to wood and stones Wis fourteen twenty one in reference to the divine name Therefore this name God is incommunicable I answer that A name is communicable in two ways properly and by similitude It is properly communicable in the sense that its whole signification can be given to many by similitude it is communicable according to some part of the signification of the name For instance this name lion is properly communicable to all things of the same nature as lion by similitude it is communicable to those who participate in the nature of a lion as for instance by courage or strength and those who thus participate are called lions metaphorically To know however what names are properly communicable we must consider that every form existing in the singular subject by which it is individualized is common to many either in reality or in idea as human nature is common to many in reality and in idea whereas the nature of the sun is not common to many in reality but only in idea for the nature of the sun can be understood as existing in many subjects and the reason is because the mind understands the nature of every species by abstraction from the singular Hence to be in one singular subject or in many is outside the idea of the nature of the species So given the idea of a species it can be understood as existing in many But the singular from the fact that it is singular is divided off from all others Hence every name imposed to signify any singular thing is incommunicable both in reality and idea for the plurality of this individual thing cannot be nor can it be conceived in idea Hence no name signifying any individual thing is properly communicable to many but only by way of similitude as for instance a person can be called Achilles metaphorically forasmuch as he may possess something of the properties of Achilles such as strength On the other hand forms which are individualized not by any suppositum but by and of themselves as being subsisting forms if understood as they are in themselves could not be communicable either in reality or in idea but only perhaps by way of similitude as was said of individuals Forasmuch as we are unable to understand simple self subsisting forms as they really are we understand them as compound things having forms in matter therefore as was said in the first article we give them concrete names signifying a nature existing in some suppositum Hence so far as concerns images the same rules apply to names we impose to signify the nature of compound things as to names given to us to signify simple subsisting natures Since then this name God is given to signify the divine nature as stated above A eight and since the divine nature cannot be multiplied as shown above Q eleven A three it follows that this name God is incommunicable in reality but communicable in opinion just in the same way as this name sun would be communicable according to the opinion of those who say there are many suns Therefore it is written You served them who by nature are not gods Gal four eight and a gloss adds Gods not in nature but in human opinion Nevertheless this name God is communicable not in its whole signification but in some part of it by way of similitude so that those are called gods who share in divinity by likeness according to the text I have said You are gods Ps eighty one six But if any name were given to signify God not as to His nature but as to His suppositum accordingly as He is considered as this something that name would be absolutely incommunicable as for instance perhaps the Tetragrammaton among the Hebrew and this is like giving a name to the sun as signifying this individual thing Reply Obj one The divine nature is only communicable according to the participation of some similitude Reply Obj two This name God is an appellative name and not a proper name for it signifies the divine nature in the possessor although God Himself in reality is neither universal nor particular For names do not follow upon the mode of being in things but upon the mode of being as it is in our mind And yet it is incommunicable according to the truth of the thing as was said above concerning the name sun Reply Obj three These names good wise and the like are imposed from the perfections proceeding from God to creatures but they do not signify the divine nature but rather signify the perfections themselves absolutely and therefore they are in truth communicable to many But this name God is given to God from His own proper operation which we experience continually to signify the divine nature TENTH ARTICLE I Q thirteen Art ten Whether This Name God Is Applied to God Univocally by Nature by Participation and According to Opinion Objection one It seems that this name God is applied to God univocally by nature by participation and according to opinion For where a diverse signification exists there is no contradiction of affirmation and negation for equivocation prevents contradiction But a Catholic who says An idol is not God contradicts a pagan who says An idol is God Therefore God in both senses is spoken of univocally Obj two Further as an idol is God in opinion and not in truth so the enjoyment of carnal pleasures is called happiness in opinion and not in truth But this name beatitude is applied univocally to this supposed happiness and also to true happiness Therefore also this name God is applied univocally to the true God and to God also in opinion Obj three Further names are called univocal because they contain one idea Now when a Catholic says There is one God he understands by the name God an omnipotent being and one venerated above all while the heathen understands the same when he says An idol is God Therefore this name God is applied univocally to both On the contrary The idea in the intellect is the likeness of what is in the thing as is said in Peri Herm i But the word animal applied to a true animal and to a picture of one is equivocal Therefore this name God applied to the true God and to God in opinion is applied equivocally Further No one can signify what he does not know But the heathen does not know the divine nature So when he says an idol is God he does not signify the true Deity On the other hand a Catholic signifies the true Deity when he says that there is one God Therefore this name God is not applied univocally but equivocally to the true God and to God according to opinion I answer that This name God in the three aforesaid significations is taken neither univocally nor equivocally but analogically This is apparent from this reason Univocal terms mean absolutely the same thing but equivocal terms absolutely different whereas in analogical terms a word taken in one signification must be placed in the definition of the same word taken in other senses as for instance being which is applied to substance is placed in the definition of being as applied to accident and healthy applied to animal is placed in the definition of healthy as applied to urine and medicine For urine is the sign of health in the animal and medicine is the cause of health The same applies to the question at issue For this name God as signifying the true God includes the idea of God when it is used to denote God in opinion or participation For when we name anyone god by participation we understand by the name of god some likeness of the true God Likewise when we call an idol god by this name god we understand and signify something which men think is God thus it is manifest that the name has different meanings but that one of them is comprised in the other significations Hence it is manifestly said analogically Reply Obj one The multiplication of names does not depend on the predication of the name but on the signification for this name man of whomsoever it is predicated whether truly or falsely is predicated in one sense But it would be multiplied if by the name man we meant to signify different things for instance if one meant to signify by this name man what man really is and another meant to signify by the same name a stone or something else Hence it is evident that a Catholic saying that an idol is not God contradicts the pagan asserting that it is God because each of them uses this name God to signify the true God For when the pagan says an idol is God he does not use this name as meaning God in opinion for he would then speak the truth as also Catholics sometimes use the name in that sense as in the Psalm All the gods of the Gentiles are demons Ps ninety five five The same remark applies to the Second and Third Objections For these reasons proceed from the different predication of the name and not from its various significations Reply Obj four On the contrary par one The term animal applied to a true and a pictured animal is not purely equivocal for the Philosopher takes equivocal names in a large sense including analogous names because also being which is predicated analogically is sometimes said to be predicated equivocally of different predicaments Reply Obj five On the contrary par two Neither a Catholic nor a pagan knows the very nature of God as it is in itself but each one knows it according to some idea of causality or excellence or remotion Q twelve A twelve So a pagan can take this name God in the same way when he says an idol is God as the Catholic does in saying an idol is not God But if anyone should be quite ignorant of God altogether he could not even name Him unless perhaps as we use names the meaning of which we know not ELEVENTH ARTICLE I Q thirteen Art eleven Whether This Name HE WHO IS Is the Most Proper Name of God Objection one It seems that this name HE WHO IS is not the most proper name of God For this name God is an incommunicable name But this name HE WHO IS is not an incommunicable name Therefore this name HE WHO IS is not the most proper name of God Obj two Further Dionysius says Div Nom iii that the name of good excellently manifests all the processions of God But it especially belongs to God to be the universal principle of all things Therefore this name good is supremely proper to God and not this name HE WHO IS Obj three Further every divine name seems to imply relation to creatures for God is known to us only through creatures But this name HE WHO IS imports no relation to creatures Therefore this name HE WHO IS is not the most applicable to God On the contrary It is written that when Moses asked If they should say to me What is His name what shall I say to them The Lord answered him Thus shalt thou say to them HE WHO IS hath sent me to you Ex three thirteen fourteen Therefore this name HE WHO IS most properly belongs to God I answer that This name HE WHO IS is most properly applied to God for three reasons First because of its signification For it does not signify form but simply existence itself Hence since the existence of God is His essence itself which can be said of no other Q three A four it is clear that among other names this one specially denominates God for everything is denominated by its form Secondly on account of its universality For all other names are either less universal or if convertible with it add something above it at least in idea hence in a certain way they inform and determine it Now our intellect cannot know the essence of God itself in this life as it is in itself but whatever mode it applies in determining what it understands about God it falls short of the mode of what God is in Himself Therefore the less determinate the names are and the more universal and absolute they are the more properly they are applied to God Hence Damascene says De Fide Orth i that HE WHO IS is the principal of all names applied to God for comprehending all in itself it contains existence itself as an infinite and indeterminate sea of substance Now by any other name some mode of substance is determined whereas this name HE WHO IS determines no mode of being but is indeterminate to all and therefore it denominates the infinite ocean of substance Thirdly from its consignification for it signifies present existence and this above all properly applies to God whose existence knows not past or future as Augustine says De Trin v Reply Obj one This name HE WHO IS is the name of God more properly than this name God as regards its source namely existence and as regards the mode of signification and consignification as said above But as regards the object intended by the name this name God is more proper as it is imposed to signify the divine nature and still more proper is the Tetragrammaton imposed to signify the substance of God itself incommunicable and if one may so speak singular Reply Obj two This name good is the principal name of God in so far as He is a cause but not absolutely for existence considered absolutely comes before the idea of cause Reply Obj three It is not necessary that all the divine names should import relation to creatures but it suffices that they be imposed from some perfections flowing from God to creatures Among these the first is existence from which comes this name HE WHO IS TWELFTH ARTICLE I Q thirteen Art twelve Whether Affirmative Propositions Can Be Formed About God Objection one It seems that affirmative propositions cannot be formed about God For Dionysius says Coel Hier ii that negations about God are true but affirmations are vague Obj two Further Boethius says De Trin ii that a simple form cannot be a subject But God is the most absolutely simple form as shown Q three therefore He cannot be a subject But everything about which an affirmative proposition is made is taken as a subject Therefore an affirmative proposition cannot be formed about God Obj three Further every intellect is false which understands a thing otherwise than as it is But God has existence without any composition as shown above Q three A seven Therefore since every affirmative intellect understands something as compound it follows that a true affirmative proposition about God cannot be made On the contrary What is of faith cannot be false But some affirmative propositions are of faith as that God is Three and One and that He is omnipotent Therefore true affirmative propositions can be formed about God I answer that True affirmative propositions can be formed about God To prove this we must know that in every true affirmative proposition the predicate and the subject signify in some way the same thing in reality and different things in idea And this appears to be the case both in propositions which have an accidental predicate and in those which have an essential predicate For it is manifest that man and white are the same in subject and different in idea for the idea of man is one thing and that of whiteness is another The same applies when I say man is an animal since the same thing which is man is truly animal for in the same suppositum there is sensible nature by reason of which he is called animal and the rational nature by reason of which he is called man hence here again predicate and subject are the same as to suppositum but different as to idea But in propositions where one same thing is predicated of itself the same rule in some way applies inasmuch as the intellect draws to the suppositum what it places in the subject and what it places in the predicate it draws to the nature of the form existing in the suppositum according to the saying that predicates are to be taken formally and subjects materially To this diversity in idea corresponds the plurality of predicate and subject while the intellect signifies the identity of the thing by the composition itself God however as considered in Himself is altogether one and simple yet our intellect knows Him by different conceptions because it cannot see Him as He is in Himself Nevertheless although it understands Him under different conceptions it knows that one and the same simple object corresponds to its conceptions Therefore the plurality of predicate and subject represents the plurality of idea and the intellect represents the unity by composition Reply Obj one Dionysius says that the affirmations about God are vague or according to another translation incongruous inasmuch as no name can be applied to God according to its mode of signification Reply Obj two Our intellect cannot comprehend simple subsisting forms as they really are in themselves but it apprehends them as compound things in which there is something taken as subject and something that is inherent Therefore it apprehends the simple form as a subject and attributes something else to it Reply Obj three This proposition The intellect understanding anything otherwise than it is is false can be taken in two senses accordingly as this adverb otherwise determines the word understanding on the part of the thing understood or on the part of the one who understands Taken as referring to the thing understood the proposition is true and the meaning is Any intellect which understands that the thing is otherwise than it is is false But this does not hold in the present case because our intellect when forming a proposition about God does not affirm that He is composite but that He is simple But taken as referring to the one who understands the proposition is false For the mode of the intellect in understanding is different from the mode of the thing in its essence Since it is clear that our intellect understands material things below itself in an immaterial manner not that it understands them to be immaterial things but its manner of understanding is immaterial Likewise when it understands simple things above itself it understands them according to its own mode which is in a composite manner yet not so as to understand them to be composite things And thus our intellect is not false in forming composition in its ideas concerning God QUESTION fourteen OF GOD S KNOWLEDGE In Sixteen Articles Having considered what belongs to the divine substance we have now to treat of God s operation And since one kind of operation is immanent and another kind of operation proceeds to the exterior effect we treat first of knowledge and of will for understanding abides in the intelligent agent and will is in the one who wills and afterwards of the power of God the principle of the divine operation as proceeding to the exterior effect Now because to understand is a kind of life after treating of the divine knowledge we consider the divine life And as knowledge concerns truth we consider truth and falsehood Further as everything known is in the knower and the types of things as existing in the knowledge of God are called ideas to the consideration of knowledge will be added the treatment of ideas Concerning knowledge there are sixteen points for inquiry one Whether there is knowledge in God two Whether God understands Himself three Whether He comprehends Himself four Whether His understanding is His substance five Whether He understands other things besides Himself six Whether He has a proper knowledge of them seven Whether the knowledge of God is discursive eight Whether the knowledge of God is the cause of things nine Whether God has knowledge of non existing things ten Whether He has knowledge of evil eleven Whether He has knowledge of individual things twelve Whether He knows the infinite thirteen Whether He knows future contingent things fourteen Whether He knows enunciable things fifteen Whether the knowledge of God is variable sixteen Whether God has speculative or practical knowledge of things FIRST ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art one Whether There Is Knowledge Scientia in God Objection one It seems that in God there is not knowledge For knowledge is a habit and habit does not belong to God since it is the mean between potentiality and act Therefore knowledge is not in God Obj two Further since science is about conclusions it is a kind of knowledge caused by something else which is the knowledge of principles But nothing is caused in God therefore science is not in God Obj three Further all knowledge is universal or particular But in God there is no universal or particular Q three A five Therefore in God there is not knowledge On the contrary The Apostle says O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God Rom eleven thirty three I answer that In God there exists the most perfect knowledge To prove this we must note that intelligent beings are distinguished from non intelligent beings in that the latter possess only their own form whereas the intelligent being is naturally adapted to have also the form of some other thing for the idea of the thing known is in the knower Hence it is manifest that the nature of a non intelligent being is more contracted and limited whereas the nature of intelligent beings has a greater amplitude and extension therefore the Philosopher says De Anima iii that the soul is in a sense all things Now the contraction of the form comes from the matter Hence as we have said above Q seven A one forms according as they are the more immaterial approach more nearly to a kind of infinity Therefore it is clear that the immateriality of a thing is the reason why it is cognitive and according to the mode of immateriality is the mode of knowledge Hence it is said in De Anima ii that plants do not know because they are wholly material But sense is cognitive because it can receive images free from matter and the intellect is still further cognitive because it is more separated from matter and unmixed as said in De Anima iii Since therefore God is in the highest degree of immateriality as stated above Q seven A one it follows that He occupies the highest place in knowledge Reply Obj one Because perfections flowing from God to creatures exist in a higher state in God Himself Q four A two whenever a name taken from any created perfection is attributed to God it must be separated in its signification from anything that belongs to that imperfect mode proper to creatures Hence knowledge is not a quality of God nor a habit but substance and pure act Reply Obj two Whatever is divided and multiplied in creatures exists in God simply and unitedly Q thirteen A four Now man has different kinds of knowledge according to the different objects of His knowledge He has intelligence as regards the knowledge of principles he has science as regards knowledge of conclusions he has wisdom according as he knows the highest cause he has counsel or prudence according as he knows what is to be done But God knows all these by one simple act of knowledge as will be shown A seven Hence the simple knowledge of God can be named by all these names in such a way however that there must be removed from each of them so far as they enter into divine predication everything that savors of imperfection and everything that expresses perfection is to be retained in them Hence it is said With Him is wisdom and strength He hath counsel and understanding Job twelve thirteen Reply Obj three Knowledge is according to the mode of the one who knows for the thing known is in the knower according to the mode of the knower Now since the mode of the divine essence is higher than that of creatures divine knowledge does not exist in God after the mode of created knowledge so as to be universal or particular or habitual or potential or existing according to any such mode SECOND ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art two Whether God Understands Himself Objection one It seems that God does not understand Himself For it is said by the Philosopher De Causis Every knower who knows his own essence returns completely to his own essence But God does not go out from His own essence nor is He moved at all thus He cannot return to His own essence Therefore He does not know His own essence Obj two Further to understand is a kind of passion and movement as the Philosopher says De Anima iii and knowledge also is a kind of assimilation to the object known and the thing known is the perfection of the knower But nothing is moved or suffers or is made perfect by itself nor as Hilary says De Trin iii is a thing its own likeness Therefore God does not understand Himself Obj three Further we are like to God chiefly in our intellect because we are the image of God in our mind as Augustine says general ad lit vi But our intellect understands itself only as it understands other things as is said in De Anima iii Therefore God understands Himself only so far perchance as He understands other things On the contrary It is written The things that are of God no man knoweth but the Spirit of God one Cor two eleven I answer that God understands Himself through Himself In proof whereof it must be known that although in operations which pass to an external effect the object of the operation which is taken as the term exists outside the operator nevertheless in operations that remain in the operator the object signified as the term of operation resides in the operator and accordingly as it is in the operator the operation is actual Hence the Philosopher says De Anima iii that the sensible in act is sense in act and the intelligible in act is intellect in act For the reason why we actually feel or know a thing is because our intellect or sense is actually informed by the sensible or intelligible species And because of this only it follows that sense or intellect is distinct from the sensible or intelligible object since both are in potentiality Since therefore God has nothing in Him of potentiality but is pure act His intellect and its object are altogether the same so that He neither is without the intelligible species as is the case with our intellect when it understands potentially nor does the intelligible species differ from the substance of the divine intellect as it differs in our intellect when it understands actually but the intelligible species itself is the divine intellect itself and thus God understands Himself through Himself Reply Obj one Return to its own essence means only that a thing subsists in itself Inasmuch as the form perfects the matter by giving it existence it is in a certain way diffused in it and it returns to itself inasmuch as it has existence in itself Therefore those cognitive faculties which are not subsisting but are the acts of organs do not know themselves as in the case of each of the senses whereas those cognitive faculties which are subsisting know themselves hence it is said in De Causis that whoever knows his essence returns to it Now it supremely belongs to God to be self subsisting Hence according to this mode of speaking He supremely returns to His own essence and knows Himself Reply Obj two Movement and passion are taken equivocally according as to understand is described as a kind of movement or passion as stated in De Anima iii For to understand is not a movement that is an act of something imperfect passing from one to another but it is an act existing in the agent itself of something perfect Likewise that the intellect is perfected by the intelligible object i e is assimilated to it this belongs to an intellect which is sometimes in potentiality because the fact of its being in a state of potentiality makes it differ from the intelligible object and assimilates it thereto through the intelligible species which is the likeness of the thing understood and makes it to be perfected thereby as potentiality is perfected by act On the other hand the divine intellect which is no way in potentiality is not perfected by the intelligible object nor is it assimilated thereto but is its own perfection and its own intelligible object Reply Obj three Existence in nature does not belong to primary matter which is a potentiality unless it is reduced to act by a form Now our passive intellect has the same relation to intelligible objects as primary matter has to natural things for it is in potentiality as regards intelligible objects just as primary matter is to natural things Hence our passive intellect can be exercised concerning intelligible objects only so far as it is perfected by the intelligible species of something and in that way it understands itself by an intelligible species as it understands other things for it is manifest that by knowing the intelligible object it understands also its own act of understanding and by this act knows the intellectual faculty But God is a pure act in the order of existence as also in the order of intelligible objects therefore He understands Himself through Himself THIRD ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art three Whether God Comprehends Himself Objection one It seems that God does not comprehend Himself For Augustine says Octog Tri Quaest xv that whatever comprehends itself is finite as regards itself But God is in all ways infinite Therefore He does not comprehend Himself Obj two If it is said that God is infinite to us and finite to Himself it can be urged to the contrary that everything in God is truer than it is in us If therefore God is finite to Himself but infinite to us then God is more truly finite than infinite which is against what was laid down above Q seven A one Therefore God does not comprehend Himself On the contrary Augustine says Octog Tri Quaest xv that Everything that understands itself comprehends itself But God understands Himself Therefore He comprehends Himself I answer that God perfectly comprehends Himself as can be thus proved A thing is said to be comprehended when the end of the knowledge of it is attained and this is accomplished when it is known as perfectly as it is knowable as for instance a demonstrable proposition is comprehended when known by demonstration not however when it is known by some probable reason Now it is manifest that God knows Himself as perfectly as He is perfectly knowable For everything is knowable according to the mode of its own actuality since a thing is not known according as it is in potentiality but in so far as it is in actuality as said in Metaph ix Now the power of God in knowing is as great as His actuality in existing because it is from the fact that He is in act and free from all matter and potentiality that God is cognitive as shown above AA one two Whence it is manifest that He knows Himself as much as He is knowable and for that reason He perfectly comprehends Himself Reply Obj one The strict meaning of comprehension signifies that one thing holds and includes another and in this sense everything comprehended is finite as also is everything included in another But God is not said to be comprehended by Himself in this sense as if His intellect were a faculty apart from Himself and as if it held and included Himself for these modes of speaking are to be taken by way of negation But as God is said to be in Himself forasmuch as He is not contained by anything outside of Himself so He is said to be comprehended by Himself forasmuch as nothing in Himself is hidden from Himself For Augustine says De Vid Deum ep cxii The whole is comprehended when seen if it is seen in such a way that nothing of it is hidden from the seer Reply Obj two When it is said God is finite to Himself this is to be understood according to a certain similitude of proportion because He has the same relation in not exceeding His intellect as anything finite has in not exceeding finite intellect But God is not to be called finite to Himself in this sense as if He understood Himself to be something finite FOURTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art four Whether the Act of God s Intellect Is His Substance Objection one It seems that the act of God s intellect is not His substance For to understand is an operation But an operation signifies something proceeding from the operator Therefore the act of God s intellect is not His substance Obj two Further to understand one s act of understanding is to understand something that is neither great nor chiefly understood but secondary and accessory If therefore God be his own act of understanding His act of understanding will be as when we understand our act of understanding and thus God s act of understanding will not be something great Obj three Further every act of understanding means understanding something When therefore God understands Himself if He Himself is not distinct from this act of understanding He understands that He understands Himself and so on to infinity Therefore the act of God s intellect is not His substance On the contrary Augustine says De Trin vii In God to be is the same as to be wise But to be wise is the same thing as to understand Therefore in God to be is the same thing as to understand But God s existence is His substance as shown above Q three A four Therefore the act of God s intellect is His substance I answer that It must be said that the act of God s intellect is His substance For if His act of understanding were other than His substance then something else as the Philosopher says Metaph xii would be the act and perfection of the divine substance to which the divine substance would be related as potentiality is to act which is altogether impossible because the act of understanding is the perfection and act of the one understanding Let us now consider how this is As was laid down above A two to understand is not an act passing to anything extrinsic for it remains in the operator as his own act and perfection as existence is the perfection of the one existing just as existence follows on the form so in like manner to understand follows on the intelligible species Now in God there is no form which is something other than His existence as shown above Q three Hence as His essence itself is also His intelligible species it necessarily follows that His act of understanding must be His essence and His existence Thus it follows from all the foregoing that in God intellect and the object understood and the intelligible species and His act of understanding are entirely one and the same Hence when God is said to be understanding no kind of multiplicity is attached to His substance Reply Obj one To understand is not an operation proceeding out of the operator but remaining in him Reply Obj two When that act of understanding which is not subsistent is understood something not great is understood as when we understand our act of understanding and so this cannot be likened to the act of the divine understanding which is subsistent Thus appears the Reply to the Third Objection For the act of divine understanding subsists in itself and belongs to its very self and is not another s hence it need not proceed to infinity FIFTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art five Whether God Knows Things Other Than Himself Objection one It seems that God does not know things besides Himself For all other things but God are outside of God But Augustine says Octog Tri Quaest qu xlvi that God does not behold anything out of Himself Therefore He does not know things other than Himself Obj two Further the object understood is the perfection of the one who understands If therefore God understands other things besides Himself something else will be the perfection of God and will be nobler than He which is impossible Obj three Further the act of understanding is specified by the intelligible object as is every other act from its own object Hence the intellectual act is so much the nobler the nobler the object understood But God is His own intellectual act If therefore God understands anything other than Himself then God Himself is specified by something else than Himself which cannot be Therefore He does not understand things other than Himself On the contrary It is written All things are naked and open to His eyes Heb four thirteen I answer that God necessarily knows things other than Himself For it is manifest that He perfectly understands Himself otherwise His existence would not be perfect since His existence is His act of understanding Now if anything is perfectly known it follows of necessity that its power is perfectly known But the power of anything can be perfectly known only by knowing to what its power extends Since therefore the divine power extends to other things by the very fact that it is the first effective cause of all things as is clear from the aforesaid Q two A three God must necessarily know things other than Himself And this appears still more plainly if we add that the very existence of the first effective cause viz God is His own act of understanding Hence whatever effects pre exist in God as in the first cause must be in His act of understanding and all things must be in Him according to an intelligible mode for everything which is in another is in it according to the mode of that in which it is Now in order to know how God knows things other than Himself we must consider that a thing is known in two ways in itself and in another A thing is known in itself when it is known by the proper species adequate to the knowable object as when the eye sees a man through the image of a man A thing is seen in another through the image of that which contains it as when a part is seen in the whole by the image of the whole or when a man is seen in a mirror by the image in the mirror or by any other mode by which one thing is seen in another So we say that God sees Himself in Himself because He sees Himself through His essence and He sees other things not in themselves but in Himself inasmuch as His essence contains the similitude of things other than Himself Reply Obj one The passage of Augustine in which it is said that God sees nothing outside Himself is not to be taken in such a way as if God saw nothing outside Himself but in the sense that what is outside Himself He does not see except in Himself as above explained Reply Obj two The object understood is a perfection of the one understanding not by its substance but by its image according to which it is in the intellect as its form and perfection as is said in De Anima iii For a stone is not in the soul but its image Now those things which are other than God are understood by God inasmuch as the essence of God contains their images as above explained hence it does not follow that there is any perfection in the divine intellect other than the divine essence Reply Obj three The intellectual act is not specified by what is understood in another but by the principal object understood in which other things are understood For the intellectual act is specified by its object inasmuch as the intelligible form is the principle of the intellectual operation since every operation is specified by the form which is its principle of operation as heating by heat Hence the intellectual operation is specified by that intelligible form which makes the intellect in act And this is the image of the principal thing understood which in God is nothing but His own essence in which all images of things are comprehended Hence it does not follow that the divine intellectual act or rather God Himself is specified by anything else than the divine essence itself SIXTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art six Whether God Knows Things Other Than Himself by Proper Knowledge Objection one It seems that God does not know things other than Himself by proper knowledge For as was shown A five God knows things other than Himself according as they are in Himself But other things are in Him as in their common and universal cause and are known by God as in their first and universal cause This is to know them by general and not by proper knowledge Therefore God knows things besides Himself by general and not by proper knowledge Obj two Further the created essence is as distant from the divine essence as the divine essence is distant from the created essence But the divine essence cannot be known by the created essence as said above Q twelve A two Therefore neither can the created essence be known by the divine essence Thus as God knows only by His essence it follows that He does not know what the creature is in its essence so as to know what it is which is to have proper knowledge of it Obj three Further proper knowledge of a thing can come only through its proper ratio i e concept But as God knows all things by His essence it seems that He does not know each thing by its proper ratio for one thing cannot be the proper ratio of many and diverse things Therefore God has not a proper knowledge of things but a general knowledge for to know things otherwise than by their proper ratio is to have only a common and general knowledge of them On the contrary To have a proper knowledge of things is to know them not only in general but as they are distinct from each other Now God knows things in that manner Hence it is written that He reaches even to the division of the soul and the spirit of the joints also and the marrow and is a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature invisible in His sight Heb four twelve thirteen I answer that Some have erred on this point saying that God knows things other than Himself only in general that is only as beings For as fire if it knew itself as the principle of heat would know the nature of heat and all things else in so far as they are hot so God through knowing Himself as the principle of being knows the nature of being and all other things in so far as they are beings But this cannot be For to know a thing in general and not in particular is to have an imperfect knowledge Hence our intellect when it is reduced from potentiality to act acquires first a universal and confused knowledge of things before it knows them in particular as proceeding from the imperfect to the perfect as is clear from Phys i If therefore the knowledge of God regarding things other than Himself is only universal and not special it would follow that His understanding would not be absolutely perfect therefore neither would His being be perfect and this is against what was said above Q four A one We must therefore hold that God knows things other than Himself with a proper knowledge not only in so far as being is common to them but in so far as one is distinguished from the other In proof thereof we may observe that some wishing to show that God knows many things by one bring forward some examples as for instance that if the centre knew itself it would know all lines that proceed from the centre or if light knew itself it would know all colors Now these examples although they are similar in part namely as regards universal causality nevertheless they fail in this respect that multitude and diversity are caused by the one universal principle not as regards that which is the principle of distinction but only as regards that in which they communicate For the diversity of colors is not caused by the light only but by the different disposition of the diaphanous medium which receives it and likewise the diversity of the lines is caused by their different position Hence it is that this kind of diversity and multitude cannot be known in its principle by proper knowledge but only in a general way In God however it is otherwise For it was shown above Q four A two that whatever perfection exists in any creature wholly pre exists and is contained in God in an excelling manner Now not only what is common to creatures viz being belongs to their perfection but also what makes them distinguished from each other as living and understanding and the like whereby living beings are distinguished from the non living and the intelligent from the non intelligent Likewise every form whereby each thing is constituted in its own species is a perfection and thus all things pre exist in God not only as regards what is common to all but also as regards what distinguishes one thing from another And therefore as God contains all perfections in Himself the essence of God is compared to all other essences of things not as the common to the proper as unity is to numbers or as the centre of a circle to the radiating lines but as perfect acts to imperfect as if I were to compare man to animal or six a perfect number to the imperfect numbers contained under it Now it is manifest that by a perfect act imperfect acts can be known not only in general but also by proper knowledge thus for example whoever knows a man knows an animal by proper knowledge and whoever knows the number six knows the number three also by proper knowledge As therefore the essence of God contains in itself all the perfection contained in the essence of any other being and far more God can know in Himself all of them with proper knowledge For the nature proper to each thing consists in some degree of participation in the divine perfection Now God could not be said to know Himself perfectly unless He knew all the ways in which His own perfection can be shared by others Neither could He know the very nature of being perfectly unless He knew all modes of being Hence it is manifest that God knows all things with proper knowledge in their distinction from each other Reply Obj one So to know a thing as it is in the knower may be understood in two ways In one way this adverb so imports the mode of knowledge on the part of the thing known and in that sense it is false For the knower does not always know the object known according to the existence it has in the knower since the eye does not know a stone according to the existence it has in the eye but by the image of the stone which is in the eye the eye knows the stone according to its existence outside the eye And if any knower has a knowledge of the object known according to the mode of existence it has in the knower the knower nevertheless knows it according to its mode of existence outside the knower thus the intellect knows a stone according to the intelligible existence it has in the intellect inasmuch as it knows that it understands while nevertheless it knows what a stone is in its own nature If however the adverb so be understood to import the mode of knowledge on the part of the knower in that sense it is true that only the knower has knowledge of the object known as it is in the knower for the more perfectly the thing known is in the knower the more perfect is the mode of knowledge We must say therefore that God not only knows that all things are in Himself but by the fact that they are in Him He knows them in their own nature and all the more perfectly the more perfectly each one is in Him Reply Obj two The created essence is compared to the essence of God as the imperfect to the perfect act Therefore the created essence cannot sufficiently lead us to the knowledge of the divine essence but rather the converse Reply Obj three The same thing cannot be taken in an equal manner as the ratio of different things But the divine essence excels all creatures Hence it can be taken as the proper ratio of each thing according to the diverse ways in which diverse creatures participate in and imitate it SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art seven Whether the Knowledge of God Is Discursive Objection one It seems that the knowledge of God is discursive For the knowledge of God is not habitual knowledge but actual knowledge Now the Philosopher says Topic ii The habit of knowledge may regard many things at once but actual understanding regards only one thing at a time Therefore as God knows many things Himself and others as shown above AA two five it seems that He does not understand all at once but discourses from one to another Obj two Further discursive knowledge is to know the effect through its cause But God knows things through Himself as an effect is known through its cause Therefore His knowledge is discursive Obj three Further God knows each creature more perfectly than we know it But we know the effects in their created causes and thus we go discursively from causes to things caused Therefore it seems that the same applies to God On the contrary Augustine says De Trin xv God does not see all things in their particularity or separately as if He saw alternately here and there but He sees all things together at once I answer that In the divine knowledge there is no discursion the proof of which is as follows In our knowledge there is a twofold discursion one is according to succession only as when we have actually understood anything we turn ourselves to understand something else while the other mode of discursion is according to causality as when through principles we arrive at the knowledge of conclusions The first kind of discursion cannot belong to God For many things which we understand in succession if each is considered in itself we understand simultaneously if we see them in some one thing if for instance we understand the parts in the whole or see different things in a mirror Now God sees all things in one thing which is Himself Therefore God sees all things together and not successively Likewise the second mode of discursion cannot be applied to God First because this second mode of discursion presupposes the first mode for whosoever proceeds from principles to conclusions does not consider both at once secondly because to discourse thus is to proceed from the known to the unknown Hence it is manifest that when the first is known the second is still unknown and thus the second is known not in the first but from the first Now the term of discursive reasoning is attained when the second is seen in the first by resolving the effects into their causes and then the discursion ceases Hence as God sees His effects in Himself as their cause His knowledge is not discursive Reply Obj one Although there is only one act of understanding in itself nevertheless many things may be understood in one medium as shown above Reply Obj two God does not know by their cause known as it were previously effects unknown but He knows the effects in the cause and hence His knowledge is not discursive as was shown above Reply Obj three God sees the effects of created causes in the causes themselves much better than we can but still not in such a manner that the knowledge of the effects is caused in Him by the knowledge of the created causes as is the case with us and hence His knowledge is not discursive EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art eight Whether the Knowledge of God Is the Cause of Things Objection one It seems that the knowledge of God is not the cause of things For Origen says on Rom eight thirty Whom He called them He also justified et cetera A thing will happen not because God knows it as future but because it is future it is on that account known by God before it exists Obj two Further given the cause the effect follows But the knowledge of God is eternal Therefore if the knowledge of God is the cause of things created it seems that creatures are eternal Obj three Further The thing known is prior to knowledge and is its measure as the Philosopher says Metaph x But what is posterior and measured cannot be a cause Therefore the knowledge of God is not the cause of things On the contrary Augustine says De Trin xv Not because they are does God know all creatures spiritual and temporal but because He knows them therefore they are I answer that The knowledge of God is the cause of things For the knowledge of God is to all creatures what the knowledge of the artificer is to things made by his art Now the knowledge of the artificer is the cause of the things made by his art from the fact that the artificer works by his intellect Hence the form of the intellect must be the principle of action as heat is the principle of heating Nevertheless we must observe that a natural form being a form that remains in that to which it gives existence denotes a principle of action according only as it has an inclination to an effect and likewise the intelligible form does not denote a principle of action in so far as it resides in the one who understands unless there is added to it the inclination to an effect which inclination is through the will For since the intelligible form has a relation to opposite things inasmuch as the same knowledge relates to opposites it would not produce a determinate effect unless it were determined to one thing by the appetite as the Philosopher says Metaph ix Now it is manifest that God causes things by His intellect since His being is His act of understanding and hence His knowledge must be the cause of things in so far as His will is joined to it Hence the knowledge of God as the cause of things is usually called the knowledge of approbation Reply Obj one Origen spoke in reference to that aspect of knowledge to which the idea of causality does not belong unless the will is joined to it as is said above But when he says the reason why God foreknows some things is because they are future this must be understood according to the cause of consequence and not according to the cause of essence For if things are in the future it follows that God knows them but not that the futurity of things is the cause why God knows them Reply Obj two The knowledge of God is the cause of things according as things are in His knowledge Now that things should be eternal was not in the knowledge of God hence although the knowledge of God is eternal it does not follow that creatures are eternal Reply Obj three Natural things are midway between the knowledge of God and our knowledge for we receive knowledge from natural things of which God is the cause by His knowledge Hence as the natural objects of knowledge are prior to our knowledge and are its measure so the knowledge of God is prior to natural things and is the measure of them as for instance a house is midway between the knowledge of the builder who made it and the knowledge of the one who gathers his knowledge of the house from the house already built NINTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art nine Whether God Has Knowledge of Things That Are Not Objection one It seems that God has not knowledge of things that are not For the knowledge of God is of true things But truth and being are convertible terms Therefore the knowledge of God is not of things that are not Obj two Further knowledge requires likeness between the knower and the thing known But those things that are not cannot have any likeness to God Who is very being Therefore what is not cannot be known by God Obj three Further the knowledge of God is the cause of what is known by Him But it is not the cause of things that are not because a thing that is not has no cause Therefore God has no knowledge of things that are not On the contrary The Apostle says Who calleth those things that are not as those that are Rom four seventeen I answer that God knows all things whatsoever that in any way are Now it is possible that things that are not absolutely should be in a certain sense For things absolutely are which are actual whereas things which are not actual are in the power either of God Himself or of a creature whether in active power or passive whether in power of thought or of imagination or of any other manner of meaning whatsoever Whatever therefore can be made or thought or said by the creature as also whatever He Himself can do all are known to God although they are not actual And in so far it can be said that He has knowledge even of things that are not Now a certain difference is to be noted in the consideration of those things that are not actual For though some of them may not be in act now still they were or they will be and God is said to know all these with the knowledge of vision for since God s act of understanding which is His being is measured by eternity and since eternity is without succession comprehending all time the present glance of God extends over all time and to all things which exist in any time as to objects present to Him But there are other things in God s power or the creature s which nevertheless are not nor will be nor were and as regards these He is said to have knowledge not of vision but of simple intelligence This is so called because the things we see around us have distinct being outside the seer Reply Obj one Those things that are not actual are true in so far as they are in potentiality for it is true that they are in potentiality and as such they are known by God Reply Obj two Since God is very being everything is in so far as it participates in the likeness of God as everything is hot in so far as it participates in heat So things in potentiality are known by God although they are not in act Reply Obj three The knowledge of God joined to His will is the cause of things Hence it is not necessary that what ever God knows is or was or will be but only is this necessary as regards what He wills to be or permits to be Further it is in the knowledge of God not that they be but that they be possible TENTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art ten Whether God Knows Evil Things Objection one It seems that God does not know evil things For the Philosopher De Anima iii says that the intellect which is not in potentiality does not know privation But evil is the privation of good as Augustine says Confess iii seven Therefore as the intellect of God is never in potentiality but is always in act as is clear from the foregoing A two it seems that God does not know evil things Obj two Further all knowledge is either the cause of the thing known or is caused by it But the knowledge of God is not the cause of evil nor is it caused by evil Therefore God does not know evil things Obj three Further everything known is known either by its likeness or by its opposite But whatever God knows He knows through His essence as is clear from the foregoing A five Now the divine essence neither is the likeness of evil nor is evil contrary to it for to the divine essence there is no contrary as Augustine says De Civ Dei xii Therefore God does not know evil things Obj four Further what is known through another and not through itself is imperfectly known But evil is not known by God for the thing known must be in the knower Therefore if evil is known through another namely through good it would be known by Him imperfectly which cannot be for the knowledge of God is not imperfect Therefore God does not know evil things On the contrary It is written Prov fifteen eleven Hell and destruction are before God Vulg the Lord I answer that Whoever knows a thing perfectly must know all that can be accidental to it Now there are some good things to which corruption by evil may be accidental Hence God would not know good things perfectly unless He also knew evil things Now a thing is knowable in the degree in which it is hence since this is the essence of evil that it is the privation of good by the fact that God knows good things He knows evil things also as by light is known darkness Hence Dionysius says Div Nom vii God through Himself receives the vision of darkness not otherwise seeing darkness except through light Reply Obj one The saying of the Philosopher must be understood as meaning that the intellect which is not in potentiality does not know privation by privation existing in it and this agrees with what he said previously that a point and every indivisible thing are known by privation of division This is because simple and indivisible forms are in our intellect not actually but only potentially for were they actually in our intellect they would not be known by privation It is thus that simple things are known by separate substances God therefore knows evil not by privation existing in Himself but by the opposite good Reply Obj two The knowledge of God is not the cause of evil but is the cause of the good whereby evil is known Reply Obj three Although evil is not opposed to the divine essence which is not corruptible by evil it is opposed to the effects of God which He knows by His essence and knowing them He knows the opposite evils Reply Obj four To know a thing by something else only belongs to imperfect knowledge if that thing is of itself knowable but evil is not of itself knowable forasmuch as the very nature of evil means the privation of good therefore evil can neither be defined nor known except by good ELEVENTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art eleven Whether God Knows Singular Things Objection one It seems that God does not know singular things For the divine intellect is more immaterial than the human intellect Now the human intellect by reason of its immateriality does not know singular things but as the Philosopher says De Anima ii reason has to do with universals sense with singular things Therefore God does not know singular things Obj two Further in us those faculties alone know the singular which receive the species not abstracted from material conditions But in God things are in the highest degree abstracted from all materiality Therefore God does not know singular things Obj three Further all knowledge comes about through the medium of some likeness But the likeness of singular things in so far as they are singular does not seem to be in God for the principle of singularity is matter which since it is in potentiality only is altogether unlike God Who is pure act Therefore God cannot know singular things On the contrary It is written Prov sixteen two All the ways of a man are open to His eyes I answer that God knows singular things For all perfections found in creatures pre exist in God in a higher way as is clear from the foregoing Q four A two Now to know singular things is part of our perfection Hence God must know singular things Even the Philosopher considers it incongruous that anything known by us should be unknown to God and thus against Empedocles he argues De Anima i and Metaph iii that God would be most ignorant if He did not know discord Now the perfections which are divided among inferior beings exist simply and unitedly in God hence although by one faculty we know the universal and immaterial and by another we know singular and material things nevertheless God knows both by His simple intellect Now some wishing to show how this can be said that God knows singular things by universal causes For nothing exists in any singular thing that does not arise from some universal cause They give the example of an astrologer who knows all the universal movements of the heavens and can thence foretell all eclipses that are to come This however is not enough for singular things from universal causes attain to certain forms and powers which however they may be joined together are not individualized except by individual matter Hence he who knows Socrates because he is white or because he is the son of Sophroniscus or because of something of that kind would not know him in so far as he is this particular man Hence according to the aforesaid mode God would not know singular things in their singularity On the other hand others have said that God knows singular things by the application of universal causes to particular effects But this will not hold forasmuch as no one can apply a thing to another unless he first knows that thing hence the said application cannot be the reason of knowing the particular for it presupposes the knowledge of singular things Therefore it must be said otherwise that since God is the cause of things by His knowledge as stated above A eight His knowledge extends as far as His causality extends Hence as the active power of God extends not only to forms which are the source of universality but also to matter as we shall prove further on Q forty four A two the knowledge of God must extend to singular things which are individualized by matter For since He knows things other than Himself by His essence as being the likeness of things or as their active principle His essence must be the sufficing principle of knowing all things made by Him not only in the universal but also in the singular The same would apply to the knowledge of the artificer if it were productive of the whole thing and not only of the form Reply Obj one Our intellect abstracts the intelligible species from the individualizing principles hence the intelligible species in our intellect cannot be the likeness of the individual principles and on that account our intellect does not know the singular But the intelligible species in the divine intellect which is the essence of God is immaterial not by abstraction but of itself being the principle of all the principles which enter into the composition of things whether principles of the species or principles of the individual hence by it God knows not only universal but also singular things Reply Obj two Although as regards the species in the divine intellect its being has no material conditions like the images received in the imagination and sense yet its power extends to both immaterial and material things Reply Obj three Although matter as regards its potentiality recedes from likeness to God yet even in so far as it has being in this wise it retains a certain likeness to the divine being TWELFTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art twelve Whether God Can Know Infinite Things Objection one It seems that God cannot know infinite things For the infinite as such is unknown since the infinite is that which to those who measure it leaves always something more to be measured as the Philosopher says Phys iii Moreover Augustine says De Civ Dei xii that whatever is comprehended by knowledge is bounded by the comprehension of the knower Now infinite things have no boundary Therefore they cannot be comprehended by the knowledge of God Obj two Further if we say that things infinite in themselves are finite in God s knowledge against this it may be urged that the essence of the infinite is that it is untraversable and the finite that it is traversable as said in Phys iii But the infinite is not traversable either by the finite or by the infinite as is proved in Phys vi Therefore the infinite cannot be bounded by the finite nor even by the infinite and so the infinite cannot be finite in God s knowledge which is infinite Obj three Further the knowledge of God is the measure of what is known But it is contrary to the essence of the infinite that it be measured Therefore infinite things cannot be known by God On the contrary Augustine says De Civ Dei xii Although we cannot number the infinite nevertheless it can be comprehended by Him whose knowledge has no bounds I answer that Since God knows not only things actual but also things possible to Himself or to created things as shown above A nine and as these must be infinite it must be held that He knows infinite things Although the knowledge of vision which has relation only to things that are or will be or were is not of infinite things as some say for we do not say that the world is eternal nor that generation and movement will go on for ever so that individuals be infinitely multiplied yet if we consider more attentively we must hold that God knows infinite things even by the knowledge of vision For God knows even the thoughts and affections of hearts which will be multiplied to infinity as rational creatures go on for ever The reason of this is to be found in the fact that the knowledge of every knower is measured by the mode of the form which is the principle of knowledge For the sensible image in sense is the likeness of only one individual thing and can give the knowledge of only one individual But the intelligible species of our intellect is the likeness of the thing as regards its specific nature which is participable by infinite particulars hence our intellect by the intelligible species of man in a certain way knows infinite men not however as distinguished from each other but as communicating in the nature of the species and the reason is because the intelligible species of our intellect is the likeness of man not as to the individual principles but as to the principles of the species On the other hand the divine essence whereby the divine intellect understands is a sufficing likeness of all things that are or can be not only as regards the universal principles but also as regards the principles proper to each one as shown above Hence it follows that the knowledge of God extends to infinite things even as distinct from each other Reply Obj one The idea of the infinite pertains to quantity as the Philosopher says Phys i But the idea of quantity implies the order of parts Therefore to know the infinite according to the mode of the infinite is to know part after part and in this way the infinite cannot be known for whatever quantity of parts be taken there will always remain something else outside But God does not know the infinite or infinite things as if He enumerated part after part since He knows all things simultaneously and not successively as said above A seven Hence there is nothing to prevent Him from knowing infinite things Reply Obj two Transition imports a certain succession of parts and hence it is that the infinite cannot be traversed by the finite nor by the infinite But equality suffices for comprehension because that is said to be comprehended which has nothing outside the comprehender Hence it is not against the idea of the infinite to be comprehended by the infinite And so what is infinite in itself can be called finite to the knowledge of God as comprehended but not as if it were traversable Reply Obj three The knowledge of God is the measure of things not quantitatively for the infinite is not subject to this kind of measure but it is the measure of the essence and truth of things For everything has truth of nature according to the degree in which it imitates the knowledge of God as the thing made by art agrees with the art Granted however an actually infinite number of things for instance an infinitude of men or an infinitude in continuous quantity as an infinitude of air as some of the ancients held yet it is manifest that these would have a determinate and finite being because their being would be limited to some determinate nature Hence they would be measurable as regards the knowledge of God THIRTEENTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art thirteen Whether the Knowledge of God Is of Future Contingent Things Objection one It seems that the knowledge of God is not of future contingent things For from a necessary cause proceeds a necessary effect But the knowledge of God is the cause of things known as said above A eight Since therefore that knowledge is necessary what He knows must also be necessary Therefore the knowledge of God is not of contingent things Obj two Further every conditional proposition of which the antecedent is absolutely necessary must have an absolutely necessary consequent For the antecedent is to the consequent as principles are to the conclusion and from necessary principles only a necessary conclusion can follow as is proved in Poster i But this is a true conditional proposition If God knew that this thing will be it will be for the knowledge of God is only of true things Now the antecedent conditional of this is absolutely necessary because it is eternal and because it is signified as past Therefore the consequent is also absolutely necessary Therefore whatever God knows is necessary and so the knowledge of God is not of contingent things Obj three Further everything known by God must necessarily be because even what we ourselves know must necessarily be and of course the knowledge of God is much more certain than ours But no future contingent things must necessarily be Therefore no contingent future thing is known by God On the contrary It is written Ps thirty two fifteen He Who hath made the hearts of every one of them Who understandeth all their works i e of men Now the works of men are contingent being subject to free will Therefore God knows future contingent things I answer that Since as was shown above A nine God knows all things not only things actual but also things possible to Him and creature and since some of these are future contingent to us it follows that God knows future contingent things In evidence of this we must consider that a contingent thing can be considered in two ways first in itself in so far as it is now in act and in this sense it is not considered as future but as present neither is it considered as contingent as having reference to one of two terms but as determined to one and on account of this it can be infallibly the object of certain knowledge for instance to the sense of sight as when I see that Socrates is sitting down In another way a contingent thing can be considered as it is in its cause and in this way it is considered as future and as a contingent thing not yet determined to one forasmuch as a contingent cause has relation to opposite things and in this sense a contingent thing is not subject to any certain knowledge Hence whoever knows a contingent effect in its cause only has merely a conjectural knowledge of it Now God knows all contingent things not only as they are in their causes but also as each one of them is actually in itself And although contingent things become actual successively nevertheless God knows contingent things not successively as they are in their own being as we do but simultaneously The reason is because His knowledge is measured by eternity as is also His being and eternity being simultaneously whole comprises all time as said above Q ten A two Hence all things that are in time are present to God from eternity not only because He has the types of things present within Him as some say but because His glance is carried from eternity over all things as they are in their presentiality Hence it is manifest that contingent things are infallibly known by God inasmuch as they are subject to the divine sight in their presentiality yet they are future contingent things in relation to their own causes Reply Obj one Although the supreme cause is necessary the effect may be contingent by reason of the proximate contingent cause just as the germination of a plant is contingent by reason of the proximate contingent cause although the movement of the sun which is the first cause is necessary So likewise things known by God are contingent on account of their proximate causes while the knowledge of God which is the first cause is necessary Reply Obj two Some say that this antecedent God knew this contingent to be future is not necessary but contingent because although it is past still it imports relation to the future This however does not remove necessity from it for whatever has had relation to the future must have had it although the future sometimes does not follow On the other hand some say that this antecedent is contingent because it is a compound of necessary and contingent as this saying is contingent Socrates is a white man But this also is to no purpose for when we say God knew this contingent to be future contingent is used here only as the matter of the word and not as the chief part of the proposition Hence its contingency or necessity has no reference to the necessity or contingency of the proposition or to its being true or false For it may be just as true that I said a man is an ass as that I said Socrates runs or God is and the same applies to necessary and contingent Hence it must be said that this antecedent is absolutely necessary Nor does it follow as some say that the consequent is absolutely necessary because the antecedent is the remote cause of the consequent which is contingent by reason of the proximate cause But this is to no purpose For the conditional would be false were its antecedent the remote necessary cause and the consequent a contingent effect as for example if I said if the sun moves the grass will grow Therefore we must reply otherwise that when the antecedent contains anything belonging to an act of the soul the consequent must be taken not as it is in itself but as it is in the soul for the existence of a thing in itself is different from the existence of a thing in the soul For example when I say What the soul understands is immaterial this is to be understood that it is immaterial as it is in the intellect not as it is in itself Likewise if I say If God knew anything it will be the consequent must be understood as it is subject to the divine knowledge i e as it is in its presentiality And thus it is necessary as also is the antecedent For everything that is while it is must be necessarily be as the Philosopher says in Peri Herm i Reply Obj three Things reduced to act in time as known by us successively in time but by God are known in eternity which is above time Whence to us they cannot be certain forasmuch as we know future contingent things as such but they are certain to God alone whose understanding is in eternity above time Just as he who goes along the road does not see those who come after him whereas he who sees the whole road from a height sees at once all travelling by the way Hence what is known by us must be necessary even as it is in itself for what is future contingent in itself cannot be known by us Whereas what is known by God must be necessary according to the mode in which they are subject to the divine knowledge as already stated but not absolutely as considered in their own causes Hence also this proposition Everything known by God must necessarily be is usually distinguished for this may refer to the thing or to the saying If it refers to the thing it is divided and false for the sense is Everything which God knows is necessary If understood of the saying it is composite and true for the sense is This proposition that which is known by God is is necessary Now some urge an objection and say that this distinction holds good with regard to forms that are separable from the subject thus if I said It is possible for a white thing to be black it is false as applied to the saying and true as applied to the thing for a thing which is white can become black whereas this saying a white thing is black can never be true But in forms that are inseparable from the subject this distinction does not hold for instance if I said A black crow can be white for in both senses it is false Now to be known by God is inseparable from the thing for what is known by God cannot be known This objection however would hold if these words that which is known implied any disposition inherent to the subject but since they import an act of the knower something can be attributed to the thing known in itself even if it always be known which is not attributed to it in so far as it stands under actual knowledge thus material existence is attributed to a stone in itself which is not attributed to it inasmuch as it is known FOURTEENTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art fourteen Whether God Knows Enunciable Things Objection one It seems that God does not know enunciable things For to know enunciable things belongs to our intellect as it composes and divides But in the divine intellect there is no composition Therefore God does not know enunciable things Obj two Further every kind of knowledge is made through some likeness But in God there is no likeness of enunciable things since He is altogether simple Therefore God does not know enunciable things On the contrary It is written The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men Ps ninety three eleven But enunciable things are contained in the thoughts of men Therefore God knows enunciable things I answer that Since it is in the power of our intellect to form enunciations and since God knows whatever is in His own power or in that of creatures as said above A nine it follows of necessity that God knows all enunciations that can be formed Now just as He knows material things immaterially and composite things simply so likewise He knows enunciable things not after the manner of enunciable things as if in His intellect there were composition or division of enunciations for He knows each thing by simple intelligence by understanding the essence of each thing as if we by the very fact that we understand what man is were to understand all that can be predicated of man This however does not happen in our intellect which discourses from one thing to another forasmuch as the intelligible species represents one thing in such a way as not to represent another Hence when we understand what man is we do not forthwith understand other things which belong to him but we understand them one by one according to a certain succession On this account the things we understand as separated we must reduce to one by way of composition or division by forming an enunciation Now the species of the divine intellect which is God s essence suffices to represent all things Hence by understanding His essence God knows the essences of all things and also whatever can be accidental to them Reply Obj one This objection would avail if God knew enunciable things after the manner of enunciable things Reply Obj two Enunciatory composition signifies some existence of a thing and thus God by His existence which is His essence is the similitude of all those things which are signified by enunciation FIFTEENTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art fifteen Whether the Knowledge of God Is Variable Objection one It seems that the knowledge of God is variable For knowledge is related to what is knowable But whatever imports relation to the creature is applied to God from time and varies according to the variation of creatures Therefore the knowledge of God is variable according to the variation of creatures Obj two Further whatever God can make He can know But God can make more than He does Therefore He can know more than He knows Thus His knowledge can vary according to increase and diminution Obj three Further God knew that Christ would be born But He does not know now that Christ will be born because Christ is not to be born in the future Therefore God does not know everything He once knew and thus the knowledge of God is variable On the contrary It is said that in God there is no change nor shadow of alteration James one seventeen I answer that Since the knowledge of God is His substance as is clear from the foregoing A four just as His substance is altogether immutable as shown above Q nine A one so His knowledge likewise must be altogether invariable Reply Obj one Lord Creator and the like import relations to creatures in so far as they are in themselves But the knowledge of God imports relation to creatures in so far as they are in God because everything is actually understood according as it is in the one who understands Now created things are in God in an invariable manner while they exist variably in themselves We may also say that Lord Creator and the like import the relations consequent upon the acts which are understood as terminating in the creatures themselves as they are in themselves and thus these relations are attributed to God variously according to the variation of creatures But knowledge and love and the like import relations consequent upon the acts which are understood to be in God and therefore these are predicated of God in an invariable manner Reply Obj two God knows also what He can make and does not make Hence from the fact that He can make more than He makes it does not follow that He can know more than He knows unless this be referred to the knowledge of vision according to which He is said to know those things which are in act in some period of time But from the fact that He knows some things might be which are not or that some things might not be which are it does not follow that His knowledge is variable but rather that He knows the variability of things If however anything existed which God did not previously know and afterwards knew then His knowledge would be variable But this could not be for whatever is or can be in any period of time is known by God in His eternity Therefore from the fact that a thing exists in some period of time it follows that it is known by God from eternity Therefore it cannot be granted that God can know more than He knows because such a proposition implies that first of all He did not know and then afterwards knew Reply Obj three The ancient Nominalists said that it was the same thing to say Christ is born and will be born and was born because the same thing is signified by these three viz the nativity of Christ Therefore it follows they said that whatever God knew He knows because now He knows that Christ is born which means the same thing as that Christ will be born This opinion however is false both because the diversity in the parts of a sentence causes a diversity of enunciations and because it would follow that a proposition which is true once would be always true which is contrary to what the Philosopher lays down Categor iii when he says that this sentence Socrates sits is true when he is sitting and false when he rises up Therefore it must be conceded that this proposition is not true Whatever God knew He knows if referred to enunciable propositions But because of this it does not follow that the knowledge of God is variable For as it is without variation in the divine knowledge that God knows one and the same thing sometime to be and sometime not to be so it is without variation in the divine knowledge that God knows an enunciable proposition is sometime true and sometime false The knowledge of God however would be variable if He knew enunciable things by way of enunciation by composition and division as occurs in our intellect Hence our knowledge varies either as regards truth and falsity for example if when either as regards truth and falsity for example if when a thing suffers change we retained the same opinion about it or as regards diverse opinions as if we first thought that anyone was sitting and afterwards thought that he was not sitting neither of which can be in God SIXTEENTH ARTICLE I Q fourteen Art sixteen Whether God Has a Speculative Knowledge of Things Objection one It seems that God has not a speculative knowledge of things For the knowledge of God is the cause of things as shown above A eight But speculative knowledge is not the cause of the things known Therefore the knowledge of God is not speculative Obj two Further speculative knowledge comes by abstraction from things which does not belong to the divine knowledge Therefore the knowledge of God is not speculative On the contrary Whatever is the more excellent must be attributed to God But speculative knowledge is more excellent than practical knowledge as the Philosopher says in the beginning of Metaphysics Therefore God has a speculative knowledge of things I answer that Some knowledge is speculative only some is practical only and some is partly speculative and partly practical In proof whereof it must be observed that knowledge can be called speculative in three ways first on the part of the things known which are not operable by the knower such is the knowledge of man about natural or divine thing s Secondly as regards the manner of knowing as for instance if a builder consider a house by defining and dividing and considering what belongs to it in general for this is to consider operable things in a speculative manner and not as practically operable for operable means the application of form to matter and not the resolution of the composite into its universal formal principles Thirdly as regards the end for the practical intellect differs in its end from the speculative as the Philosopher says De Anima iii For the practical intellect is ordered to the end of the operation whereas the end of the speculative intellect is the consideration of truth Hence if a builder should consider how a house can be made not ordering this to the end of operation but only to know how to do it this would be only a speculative considerations as regards the end although it concerns an operable thing Therefore knowledge which is speculative by reason of the thing itself known is merely speculative But that which is speculative either in its mode or as to its end is partly speculative and partly practical and when it is ordained to an operative end it is simply practical In accordance with this therefore it must be said that God has of Himself a speculative knowledge only for He Himself is not operable But of all other things He has both speculative and practical knowledge He has speculative knowledge as regards the mode for whatever we know speculatively in things by defining and dividing God knows all this much more perfectly Now of things which He can make but does not make at any time He has not a practical knowledge according as knowledge is called practical from the end But He has a practical knowledge of what He makes in some period of time And as regards evil things although they are not operable by Him yet they fall under His practical knowledge like good things inasmuch as He permits or impedes or directs them as also sicknesses fall under the practical knowledge of the physician inasmuch as he cures them by his art Reply Obj one The knowledge of God is the cause not indeed of Himself but of other things He is actually the cause of some that is of things that come to be in some period of time and He is virtually the cause of others that is of things which He can make and which nevertheless are never made Reply Obj two The fact that knowledge is derived from things known does not essentially belong to speculative knowledge but only accidentally in so far as it is human In answer to what is objected on the contrary we must say that perfect knowledge of operable things is obtainable only if they are known in so far as they are operable Therefore since the knowledge of God is in every way perfect He must know what is operable by Him formally as such and not only in so far as they are speculative Nevertheless this does not impair the nobility of His speculative knowledge forasmuch as He sees all things other than Himself in Himself and He knows Himself speculatively and so in the speculative knowledge of Himself he possesses both speculative and practical knowledge of all other things QUESTION fifteen OF IDEAS In Three Articles After considering the knowledge of God it remains to consider ideas And about this there are three points of inquiry one Whether there are ideas two Whether they are many or one only three Whether there are ideas of all things known by God FIRST ARTICLE I Q fifteen Art one Whether There Are Ideas Objection one It seems that there are no ideas For Dionysius says Div Nom vii that God does not know things by ideas But ideas are for nothing else except that things may be known through them Therefore there are no ideas Obj two Further God knows all things in Himself as has been already said Q fourteen A five But He does not know Himself through an idea neither therefore other things Obj three Further an idea is considered to be the principle of knowledge and action But the divine essence is a sufficient principle of knowing and effecting all things It is not therefore necessary to suppose ideas On the contrary Augustine says Octog Tri Quaest qu xlvi Such is the power inherent in ideas that no one can be wise unless they are understood I answer that It is necessary to suppose ideas in the divine mind For the Greek word Idea is in Latin Forma Hence by ideas are understood the forms of things existing apart from the things themselves Now the form of anything existing apart from the thing itself can be for one of two ends either to be the type of that of which it is called the form or to be the principle of the knowledge of that thing inasmuch as the forms of things knowable are said to be in him who knows them In either case we must suppose ideas as is clear for the following reason In all things not generated by chance the form must be the end of any generation whatsoever But an agent does not act on account of the form except in so far as the likeness of the form is in the agent as may happen in two ways For in some agents the form of the thing to be made pre exists according to its natural being as in those that act by their nature as a man generates a man or fire generates fire Whereas in other agents the form of the thing to be made pre exists according to intelligible being as in those that act by the intellect and thus the likeness of a house pre exists in the mind of the builder And this may be called the idea of the house since the builder intends to build his house like to the form conceived in his mind As then the world was not made by chance but by God acting by His intellect as will appear later Q forty six A one there must exist in the divine mind a form to the likeness of which the world was made And in this the notion of an idea consists Reply Obj one God does not understand things according to an idea existing outside Himself Thus Aristotle Metaph ix rejects the opinion of Plato who held that ideas existed of themselves and not in the intellect Reply Obj two Although God knows Himself and all else by His own essence yet His essence is the operative principle of all things except of Himself It has therefore the nature of an idea with respect to other things though not with respect to Himself Reply Obj three God is the similitude of all things according to His essence therefore an idea in God is identical with His essence SECOND ARTICLE I Q fifteen Art two Whether Ideas Are Many Objection one It seems that ideas are not many For an idea in God is His essence But God s essence is one only Therefore there is only one idea Obj two Further as the idea is the principle of knowing and operating so are art and wisdom But in God there are not several arts or wisdoms Therefore in Him there is no plurality of ideas Obj three Further if it be said that ideas are multiplied according to their relations to different creatures it may be argued on the contrary that the plurality of ideas is eternal If then ideas are many but creatures temporal then the temporal must be the cause of the eternal Obj four Further these relations are either real in creatures only or in God also If in creatures only since creatures are not from eternity the plurality of ideas cannot be from eternity if ideas are multiplied only according to these relations But if they are real in God it follows that there is a real plurality in God other than the plurality of Persons and this is against the teaching of Damascene De Fide Orth i ten who says in God all things are one except ingenerability generation and procession Ideas therefore are not many On the contrary Augustine says Octog Tri Quaest qu xlvi Ideas are certain principal forms or permanent and immutable types of things they themselves not being formed Thus they are eternal and existing always in the same manner as being contained in the divine intelligence Whilst however they themselves neither come into being nor decay yet we say that in accordance with them everything is formed that can rise or decay and all that actually does so I answer that It must necessarily be held that ideas are many In proof of which it is to be considered that in every effect the ultimate end is the proper intention of the principal agent as the order of an army is the proper intention of the general Now the highest good existing in things is the good of the order of the universe as the Philosopher clearly teaches in Metaph xii Therefore the order of the universe is properly intended by God and is not the accidental result of a succession of agents as has been supposed by those who have taught that God created only the first creature and that this creature created the second creature and so on until this great multitude of beings was produced According to this opinion God would have the idea of the first created thing alone whereas if the order itself of the universe was created by Him immediately and intended by Him He must have the idea of the order of the universe Now there cannot be an idea of any whole unless particular ideas are had of those parts of which the whole is made just as a builder cannot conceive the idea of a house unless he has the idea of each of its parts So then it must needs be that in the divine mind there are the proper ideas of all things Hence Augustine says Octog Tri Quaest qu xlvi that each thing was created by God according to the idea proper to it from which it follows that in the divine mind ideas are many Now it can easily be seen how this is not repugnant to the simplicity of God if we consider that the idea of a work is in the mind of the operator as that which is understood and not as the image whereby he understands which is a form that makes the intellect in act For the form of the house in the mind of the builder is something understood by him to the likeness of which he forms the house in matter Now it is not repugnant to the simplicity of the divine mind that it understand many things though it would be repugnant to its simplicity were His understanding to be formed by a plurality of images Hence many ideas exist in the divine mind as things understood by it as can be proved thus Inasmuch as He knows His own essence perfectly He knows it according to every mode in which it can be known Now it can be known not only as it is in itself but as it can be participated in by creatures according to some degree of likeness But every creature has its own proper species according to which it participates in some degree in likeness to the divine essence So far therefore as God knows His essence as capable of such imitation by any creature He knows it as the particular type and idea of that creature and in like manner as regards other creatures So it is clear that God understands many particular types of things and these are many ideas Reply Obj one The divine essence is not called an idea in so far as it is that essence but only in so far as it is the likeness or type of this or that thing Hence ideas are said to be many inasmuch as many types are understood through the self same essence Reply Obj two By wisdom and art we signify that by which God understands but an idea that which God understands For God by one understands many things and that not only according to what they are in themselves but also according as they are understood and this is to understand the several types of things In the same way an architect is said to understand a house when he understands the form of the house in matter But if he understands the form of a house as devised by himself from the fact that he understands that he understands it he thereby understands the type or idea of the house Now not only does God understand many things by His essence but He also understands that He understands many things by His essence And this means that He understands the several types of things or that many ideas are in His intellect as understood by Him Reply Obj three Such relations whereby ideas are multiplied are caused not by the things themselves but by the divine intellect comparing its own essence with these things Reply Obj four Relations multiplying ideas do not exist in created things but in God Yet they are not real relations such as those whereby the Persons are distinguished but relations understood by God THIRD ARTICLE I Q fifteen Art three Whether There Are Ideas of All Things That God Knows Objection one It seems that there are not ideas in God of all things that He knows For the idea of evil is not in God since it would follow that evil was in Him But evil things are known by God Therefore there are not ideas of all things that God knows Obj two Further God knows things that neither are nor will be nor have been as has been said above A nine But of such things there are no ideas since as Dionysius says Div Nom v Acts of the divine will are the determining and effective types of things Therefore there are not in God ideas of all things known by Him Obj three Further God knows primary matter of which there can be no idea since it has no form Hence the same conclusion Obj four Further it is certain that God knows not only species but also genera singulars and accidents But there are not ideas of these according to Plato s teaching who first taught ideas as Augustine says Octog Tri Quaest qu xlvi Therefore there are not ideas in God of all things known by Him On the contrary Ideas are types existing in the divine mind as is clear from Augustine Octog Tri Quaest qu xlvi But God has the proper types of all things that He knows and therefore He has ideas of all things known by Him I answer that As ideas according to Plato are principles of the knowledge of things and of their generation an idea has this twofold office as it exists in the mind of God So far as the idea is the principle of the making of things it may be called an exemplar and belongs to practical knowledge But so far as it is a principle of knowledge it is properly called a type and may belong to speculative knowledge also As an exemplar therefore it has respect to everything made by God in any period of time whereas as a principle of knowledge it has respect to all things known by God even though they never come to be in time and to all things that He knows according to their proper type in so far as they are known by Him in a speculative manner Reply Obj one Evil is known by God not through its own type but through the type of good Evil therefore has no idea in God neither in so far as an idea is an exemplar nor as a type Reply Obj two God has no practical knowledge except virtually of things which neither are nor will be nor have been Hence with respect to these there is no idea in God in so far as idea signifies an exemplar but only in so far as it denotes a type Reply Obj three Plato is said by some to have considered matter as not created and therefore he postulated not an idea of matter but a concause with matter Since however we hold matter to be created by God though not apart from form matter has its idea in God but not apart from the idea of the composite for matter in itself can neither exist nor be known Reply Obj four Genus can have no idea apart from the idea of species in so far as idea denotes an exemplar for genus cannot exist except in some species The same is the case with those accidents that inseparably accompany their subject for these come into being along with their subject But accidents which supervene to the subject have their special idea For an architect produces through the form of the house all the accidents that originally accompany it whereas those that are superadded to the house when completed such as painting or any other such thing are produced through some other form Now individual things according to Plato have no other idea than that of species both because particular things are individualized by matter which as some say he held to be uncreated and the concause with the idea and because the intention of nature regards the species and produces individuals only that in them the species may be preserved However divine providence extends not merely to species but to individuals as will be shown later Q twenty two A three QUESTION sixteen OF TRUTH In Eight Articles Since knowledge is of things that are true after the consideration of the knowledge of God we must inquire concerning truth About this there are eight points of inquiry one Whether truth resides in the thing or only in the intellect two Whether it resides only in the intellect composing and dividing three On the comparison of the true to being four On the comparison of the true to the good five Whether God is truth six Whether all things are true by one truth or by many seven On the eternity of truth eight On the unchangeableness of truth FIRST ARTICLE I Q sixteen Art one Whether Truth Resides Only in the Intellect Objection one It seems that truth does not reside only in the intellect but rather in things For Augustine Soliloq ii five condemns this definition of truth That is true which is seen since it would follow that stones hidden in the bosom of the earth would not be true stones as they are not seen He also condemns the following That is true which is as it appears to the knower who is willing and able to know for hence it would follow that nothing would be true unless someone could know it Therefore he defines truth thus That is true which is It seems then that truth resides in things and not in the intellect Obj two Further whatever is true is true by reason of truth If then truth is only in the intellect nothing will be true except in so far as it is understood But this is the error of the ancient philosophers who said that whatever seems to be true is so Consequently mutual contradictories seem to be true as seen by different persons at the same time Obj three Further that on account of which a thing is so is itself more so as is evident from the Philosopher Poster i But it is from the fact that a thing is or is not that our thought or word is true or false as the Philosopher teaches Praedicam iii Therefore truth resides rather in things than in the intellect On the contrary The Philosopher says Metaph vi The true and the false reside not in things but in the intellect I answer that As the good denotes that towards which the appetite tends so the true denotes that towards which the intellect tends Now there is this difference between the appetite and the intellect or any knowledge whatsoever that knowledge is according as the thing known is in the knower whilst appetite is according as the desirer tends towards the thing desired Thus the term of the appetite namely good is in the object desirable and the term of the intellect namely true is in the intellect itself Now as good exists in a thing so far as that thing is related to the appetite and hence the aspect of goodness passes on from the desirable thing to the appetite in so far as the appetite is called good if its object is good so since the true is in the intellect in so far as it is conformed to the object understood the aspect of the true must needs pass from the intellect to the object understood so that also the thing understood is said to be true in so far as it has some relation to the intellect Now a thing understood may be in relation to an intellect either essentially or accidentally It is related essentially to an intellect on which it depends as regards its essence but accidentally to an intellect by which it is knowable even as we may say that a house is related essentially to the intellect of the architect but accidentally to the intellect upon which it does not depend Now we do not judge of a thing by what is in it accidentally but by what is in it essentially Hence everything is said to be true absolutely in so far as it is related to the intellect from which it depends and thus it is that artificial things are said to be true as being related to our intellect For a house is said to be true that expresses the likeness of the form in the architect s mind and words are said to be true so far as they are the signs of truth in the intellect In the same way natural things are said to be true in so far as they express the likeness of the species that are in the divine mind For a stone is called true which possesses the nature proper to a stone according to the preconception in the divine intellect Thus then truth resides primarily in the intellect and secondarily in things according as they are related to the intellect as their principle Consequently there are various definitions of truth Augustine says De Vera Relig xxxvi Truth is that whereby is made manifest that which is and Hilary says De Trin v that Truth makes being clear and evident and this pertains to truth according as it is in the intellect As to the truth of things in so far as they are related to the intellect we have Augustine s definition De Vera Relig xxxvi Truth is a supreme likeness without any unlikeness to a principle also Anselm s definition De Verit xii Truth is rightness perceptible by the mind alone for that is right which is in accordance with the principle also Avicenna s definition Metaph viii six The truth of each thing is a property of the essence which is immutably attached to it The definition that Truth is the equation of thought and thing is applicable to it under either aspect Reply Obj one Augustine is speaking about the truth of things and excludes from the notion of this truth relation to our intellect for what is accidental is excluded from every definition Reply Obj two The ancient philosophers held that the species of natural things did not proceed from any intellect but were produced by chance But as they saw that truth implies relation to intellect they were compelled to base the truth of things on their relation to our intellect From this conclusions result that are inadmissible and which the Philosopher refutes Metaph iv Such however do not follow if we say that the truth of things consists in their relation to the divine intellect Reply Obj three Although the truth of our intellect is caused by the thing yet it is not necessary that truth should be there primarily any more than that health should be primarily in medicine rather than in the animal for the virtue of medicine and not its health is the cause of health for here the agent is not univocal In the same way the being of the thing not its truth is the cause of truth in the intellect Hence the Philosopher says that a thought or a word is true from the fact that a thing is not because a thing is true SECOND ARTICLE I Q sixteen Art two Whether Truth Resides Only in the Intellect Composing and Dividing Objection one It seems that truth does not reside only in the intellect composing and dividing For the Philosopher says De Anima iii that as the senses are always true as regards their proper sensible objects so is the intellect as regards what a thing is Now composition and division are neither in the senses nor in the intellect knowing what a thing is Therefore truth does not reside only in the intellect composing and dividing Obj two Further Isaac says in his book On Definitions that truth is the equation of thought and thing Now just as the intellect with regard to complex things can be equated to things so also with regard to simple things and this is true also of sense apprehending a thing as it is Therefore truth does not reside only in the intellect composing and dividing On the contrary the Philosopher says Metaph vi that with regard to simple things and what a thing is truth is found neither in the intellect nor in things I answer that As stated before truth resides in its primary aspect in the intellect Now since everything is true according as it has the form proper to its nature the intellect in so far as it is knowing must be true so far as it has the likeness of the thing known this being its form as knowing For this reason truth is defined by the conformity of intellect and thing and hence to know this conformity is to know truth But in no way can sense know this For although sight has the likeness of a visible thing yet it does not know the comparison which exists between the thing seen and that which itself apprehends concerning it But the intellect can know its own conformity with the intelligible thing yet it does not apprehend it by knowing of a thing what a thing is When however it judges that a thing corresponds to the form which it apprehends about that thing then first it knows and expresses truth This it does by composing and dividing for in every proposition it either applies to or removes from the thing signified by the subject some form signified by the predicate and this clearly shows that the sense is true of any thing as is also the intellect when it knows what a thing is but it does not thereby know or affirm truth This is in like manner the case with complex or non complex words Truth therefore may be in the senses or in the intellect knowing what a thing is as in anything that is true yet not as the thing known in the knower which is implied by the word truth for the perfection of the intellect is truth as known Therefore properly speaking truth resides in the intellect composing and dividing and not in the senses nor in the intellect knowing what a thing is And thus the Objections given are solved THIRD ARTICLE I Q sixteen Art three Whether the True and Being Are Convertible Terms Objection one It seems that the true and being are not convertible terms For the true resides properly in the intellect as stated A one but being is properly in things Therefore they are not convertible Obj two Further that which extends to being and not being is not convertible with being But the true extends to being and not being for it is true that what is is and that what is not is not Therefore the true and being are not convertible Obj three Further things which stand to each other in order of priority and posteriority seem not to be convertible But the true appears to be prior to being for being is not understood except under the aspect of the true Therefore it seems they are not convertible On the contrary the Philosopher says Metaph ii that there is the same disposition of things in being and in truth I answer that As good has the nature of what is desirable so truth is related to knowledge Now everything in as far as it has being so far is it knowable Wherefore it is said in De Anima iii that the soul is in some manner all things through the senses and the intellect And therefore as good is convertible with being so is the true But as good adds to being the notion of desirable so the true adds relation to the intellect Reply Obj one The true resides in things and in the intellect as said before A one But the true that is in things is convertible with being as to substance while the true that is in the intellect is convertible with being as the manifestation with the manifested for this belongs to the nature of truth as has been said already A one It may however be said that being also is in things and in the intellect as is the true although truth is primarily in the intellect while being is primarily in things and this is so because truth and being differ in idea Reply Obj two Not being has nothing in itself whereby it can be known yet it is known in so far as the intellect renders it knowable Hence the true is based on being inasmuch as not being is a kind of logical being apprehended that is by reason Reply Obj three When it is said that being cannot be apprehended except under the notion of the true this can be understood in two ways In the one way so as to mean that being is not apprehended unless the idea of the true follows apprehension of being and this is true In the other way so as to mean that being cannot be apprehended unless the idea of the true be apprehended also and this is false But the true cannot be apprehended unless the idea of being be apprehended also since being is included in the idea of the true The case is the same if we compare the intelligible object with being For being cannot be understood unless being is intelligible Yet being can be understood while its intelligibility is not understood Similarly being when understood is true yet the true is not understood by understanding being FOURTH ARTICLE I Q sixteen Art four Whether Good Is Logically Prior to the True Objection one It seems that good is logically prior to the true For what is more universal is logically prior as is evident from Phys i But the good is more universal than the true since the true is a kind of good namely of the intellect Therefore the good is logically prior to the true Obj two Further good is in things but the true in the intellect composing and dividing as said above A two But that which is in things is prior to that which is in the intellect Therefore good is logically prior to the true Obj three Further truth is a species of virtue as is clear from Ethic iv But virtue is included under good since as Augustine says De Lib Arbit ii nineteen it is a good quality of the mind Therefore the good is prior to the true On the contrary What is in more things is prior logically But the true is in some things wherein good is not as for instance in mathematics Therefore the true is prior to good I answer that Although the good and the true are convertible with being as to suppositum yet they differ logically And in this manner the true speaking absolutely is prior to good as appears from two reasons First because the true is more closely related to being than is good For the true regards being itself simply and immediately while the nature of good follows being in so far as being is in some way perfect for thus it is desirable Secondly it is evident from the fact that knowledge naturally precedes appetite Hence since the true regards knowledge but the good regards the appetite the true must be prior in idea to the good Reply Obj one The will and the intellect mutually include one another for the intellect understands the will and the will wills the intellect to understand So then among things directed to the object of the will are comprised also those that belong to the intellect and conversely Whence in the order of things desirable good stands as the universal and the true as the particular whereas in the order of intelligible things the converse is the case From the fact then that the true is a kind of good it follows that the good is prior in the order of things desirable but not that it is prior absolutely Reply Obj two A thing is prior logically in so far as it is prior to the intellect Now the intellect apprehends primarily being itself secondly it apprehends that it understands being and thirdly it apprehends that it desires being Hence the idea of being is first that of truth second and the idea of good third though good is in things Reply Obj three The virtue which is called truth is not truth in general but a certain kind of truth according to which man shows himself in deed and word as he really is But truth as applied to life is used in a particular sense inasmuch as a man fulfills in his life that to which he is ordained by the divine intellect as it has been said that truth exists in other things A one Whereas the truth of justice is found in man as he fulfills his duty to his neighbor as ordained by law Hence we cannot argue from these particular truths to truth in general FIFTH ARTICLE I Q sixteen Art five Whether God Is Truth Objection one It seems that God is not truth For truth consists in the intellect composing and dividing But in God there is not composition and division Therefore in Him there is not truth Obj two Further truth according to Augustine De Vera Relig xxxvi is a likeness to the principle But in God there is no likeness to a principle Therefore in God there is not truth Obj three Further whatever is said of God is said of Him as of the first cause of all things thus the being of God is the cause of all being and His goodness the cause of all good If therefore there is truth in God all truth will be from Him But it is true that someone sins Therefore this will be from God which is evidently false On the contrary Our Lord says I am the Way the Truth and the Life John fourteen six I answer that As said above A one truth is found in the intellect according as it apprehends a thing as it is and in things according as they have being conformable to an intellect This is to the greatest degree found in God For His being is not only conformed to His intellect but it is the very act of His intellect and His act of understanding is the measure and cause of every other being and of every other intellect and He Himself is His own existence and act of understanding Whence it follows not only that truth is in Him but that He is truth itself and the sovereign and first truth Reply Obj one Although in the divine intellect there is neither composition nor division yet in His simple act of intelligence He judges of all things and knows all things complex and thus there is truth in His intellect Reply Obj two The truth of our intellect is according to its conformity with its principle that is to say to the things from which it receives knowledge The truth also of things is according to their conformity with their principle namely the divine intellect Now this cannot be said properly speaking of divine truth unless perhaps in so far as truth is appropriated to the Son Who has a principle But if we speak of divine truth in its essence we cannot understand this unless the affirmative must be resolved into the negative as when one says the Father is of Himself because He is not from another Similarly the divine truth can be called a likeness to the principle inasmuch as His existence is not dissimilar to His intellect Reply Obj three Not being and privation have no truth of themselves but only in the apprehension of the intellect Now all apprehension of the intellect is from God Hence all the truth that exists in the statement that a person commits fornication is true is entirely from God But to argue Therefore that this person fornicates is from God is a fallacy of Accident SIXTH ARTICLE I Q sixteen Art six Whether There Is Only One Truth According to Which All Things Are True Objection one It seems that there is only one truth according to which all things are true For according to Augustine De Trin xv one nothing is greater than the mind of man except God Now truth is greater than the mind of man otherwise the mind would be the judge of truth whereas in fact it judges all things according to truth and not according to its own measure Therefore God alone is truth Therefore there is no other truth but God Obj two Further Anselm says De Verit xiv that as is the relation of time to temporal things so is that of truth to true things But there is only one time for all temporal things Therefore there is only one truth by which all things are true On the contrary it is written Ps eleven two Truths are decayed from among the children of men I answer that In one sense truth whereby all things are true is one and in another sense it is not In proof of which we must consider that when anything is predicated of many things univocally it is found in each of them according to its proper nature as animal is found in each species of animal But when anything is predicated of many things analogically it is found in only one of them according to its proper nature and from this one the rest are denominated So healthiness is predicated of animal of urine and of medicine not that health is only in the animal but from the health of the animal medicine is called healthy in so far as it is the cause of health and urine is called healthy in so far as it indicates health And although health is neither in medicine nor in urine yet in either there is something whereby the one causes and the other indicates health Now we have said A one that truth resides primarily in the intellect and secondarily in things according as they are related to the divine intellect If therefore we speak of truth as it exists in the intellect according to its proper nature then are there many truths in many created intellects and even in one and the same intellect according to the number of things known Whence a gloss on Ps eleven two Truths are decayed from among the children of men says As from one man s face many likenesses are reflected in a mirror so many truths are reflected from the one divine truth But if we speak of truth as it is in things then all things are true by one primary truth to which each one is assimilated according to its own entity And thus although the essences or forms of things are many yet the truth of the divine intellect is one in conformity to which all things are said to be true Reply Obj one The soul does not judge of things according to any kind of truth but according to the primary truth inasmuch as it is reflected in the soul as in a mirror by reason of the first principles of the understanding It follows therefore that the primary truth is greater than the soul And yet even created truth which resides in our intellect is greater than the soul not simply but in a certain degree in so far as it is its perfection even as science may be said to be greater than the soul Yet it is true that nothing subsisting is greater than the rational soul except God Reply Obj two The saying of Anselm is correct in so far as things are said to be true by their relation to the divine intellect SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q sixteen Art seven Whether Created Truth Is Eternal Objection one It seems that created truth is eternal For Augustine says De Lib Arbit ii eight Nothing is more eternal than the nature of a circle and that two added to three make five But the truth of these is a created truth Therefore created truth is eternal Obj two Further that which is always is eternal But universals are always and everywhere therefore they are eternal So therefore is truth which is the most universal Obj three Further it was always true that what is true in the present was to be in the future But as the truth of a proposition regarding the present is a created truth so is that of a proposition regarding the future Therefore some created truth is eternal Obj four Further all that is without beginning and end is eternal But the truth of enunciables is without beginning and end for if their truth had a beginning since it was not before it was true that truth was not and true of course by reason of truth so that truth was before it began to be Similarly if it be asserted that truth has an end it follows that it is after it has ceased to be for it will still be true that truth is not Therefore truth is eternal On the contrary God alone is eternal as laid down before Q ten Art three I answer that The truth of enunciations is no other than the truth of the intellect For an enunciation resides in the intellect and in speech Now according as it is in the intellect it has truth of itself but according as it is in speech it is called enunciable truth according as it signifies some truth of the intellect not on account of any truth residing in the enunciation as though in a subject Thus urine is called healthy not from any health within it but from the health of an animal which it indicates In like manner it has been already said that things are called true from the truth of the intellect Hence if no intellect were eternal no truth would be eternal Now because only the divine intellect is eternal in it alone truth has eternity Nor does it follow from this that anything else but God is eternal since the truth of the divine intellect is God Himself as shown already A five Reply Obj one The nature of a circle and the fact that two and three make five have eternity in the mind of God Reply Obj two That something is always and everywhere can be understood in two ways In one way as having in itself the power of extension to all time and to all places as it belongs to God to be everywhere and always In the other way as not having in itself determination to any place or time as primary matter is said to be one not because it has one form but by the absence of all distinguishing form In this manner all universals are said to be everywhere and always in so far as universals are independent of place and time It does not however follow from this that they are eternal except in an intellect if one exists that is eternal Reply Obj three That which now is was future before it actually was because it was in its cause that it would be Hence if the cause were removed that thing s coming to be was not future But the first cause is alone eternal Hence it does not follow that it was always true that what now is would be except in so far as its future being was in the sempiternal cause and God alone is such a cause Reply Obj four Because our intellect is not eternal neither is the truth of enunciable propositions which are formed by us eternal but it had a beginning in time Now before such truth existed it was not true to say that such a truth did exist except by reason of the divine intellect wherein alone truth is eternal But it is true now to say that that truth did not then exist and this is true only by reason of the truth that is now in our intellect and not by reason of any truth in the things For this is truth concerning not being and not being has not truth of itself but only so far as our intellect apprehends it Hence it is true to say that truth did not exist in so far as we apprehend its not being as preceding its being EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q sixteen Art eight Whether Truth Is Immutable Objection one It seems that truth is immutable For Augustine says De Lib Arbit ii twelve that Truth and mind do not rank as equals otherwise truth would be mutable as the mind is Obj two Further what remains after every change is immutable as primary matter is unbegotten and incorruptible since it remains after all generation and corruption But truth remains after all change for after every change it is true to say that a thing is or is not Therefore truth is immutable Obj three Further if the truth of an enunciation changes it changes mostly with the changing of the thing But it does not thus change For truth according to Anselm De Verit viii is a certain rightness in so far as a thing answers to that which is in the divine mind concerning it But this proposition that Socrates sits receives from the divine mind the signification that Socrates does sit and it has the same signification even though he does not sit Therefore the truth of the proposition in no way changes Obj four Further where there is the same cause there is the same effect But the same thing is the cause of the truth of the three propositions Socrates sits will sit sat Therefore the truth of each is the same But one or other of these must be the true one Therefore the truth of these propositions remains immutable and for the same reason that of any other On the contrary It is written Ps eleven two Truths are decayed from among the children of men I answer that Truth properly speaking resides only in the intellect as said before A one but things are called true in virtue of the truth residing in an intellect Hence the mutability of truth must be regarded from the point of view of the intellect the truth of which consists in its conformity to the thing understood Now this conformity may vary in two ways even as any other likeness through change in one of the two extremes Hence in one way truth varies on the part of the intellect from the fact that a change of opinion occurs about a thing which in itself has not changed and in another way when the thing is changed but not the opinion and in either way there can be a change from true to false If then there is an intellect wherein there can be no alternation of opinions and the knowledge of which nothing can escape in this is immutable truth Now such is the divine intellect as is clear from what has been said before Q fourteen A fifteen Hence the truth of the divine intellect is immutable But the truth of our intellect is mutable not because it is itself the subject of change but in so far as our intellect changes from truth to falsity for thus forms may be called mutable Whereas the truth of the divine intellect is that according to which natural things are said to be true and this is altogether immutable Reply Obj one Augustine is speaking of divine truth Reply Obj two The true and being are convertible terms Hence just as being is not generated nor corrupted of itself but accidentally in so far as this being or that is corrupted or generated as is said in Phys i so does truth change not so as that no truth remains but because that truth does not remain which was before Reply Obj three A proposition not only has truth as other things are said to have it in so far that is as they correspond to that which is the design of the divine intellect concerning them but it is said to have truth in a special way in so far as it indicates the truth of the intellect which consists in the conformity of the intellect with a thing When this disappears the truth of an opinion changes and consequently the truth of the proposition So therefore this proposition Socrates sits is true as long as he is sitting both with the truth of the thing in so far as the expression is significative and with the truth of signification in so far as it signifies a true opinion When Socrates rises the first truth remains but the second is changed Reply Obj four The sitting of Socrates which is the cause of the truth of the proposition Socrates sits has not the same meaning when Socrates sits after he sits and before he sits Hence the truth which results varies and is variously signified by these propositions concerning present past or future Thus it does not follow though one of the three propositions is true that the same truth remains invariable QUESTION seventeen CONCERNING FALSITY In Four Articles We next consider falsity About this four points of inquiry arise one Whether falsity exists in things two Whether it exists in the sense three Whether it exists in the intellect four Concerning the opposition of the true and the false FIRST ARTICLE I Q seventeen Art one Whether Falsity Exists in Things Objection one It appears that falsity does not exist in things For Augustine says Soliloq ii eight If the true is that which is it will be concluded that the false exists nowhere whatever reason may appear to the contrary Obj two Further false is derived from fallere to deceive But things do not deceive for as Augustine says De Vera Relig thirty three they show nothing but their own species Therefore the false is not found in things Obj three Further the true is said to exist in things by conformity to the divine intellect as stated above Q sixteen But everything in so far as it exists imitates God Therefore everything is true without admixture of falsity and thus nothing is false On the contrary Augustine says De Vera Relig thirty four Every body is a true body and a false unity for it imitates unity without being unity But everything imitates the divine unity yet falls short of it Therefore in all things falsity exists I answer that Since true and false are opposed and since opposites stand in relation to the same thing we must needs seek falsity where primarily we find truth that is to say in the intellect Now in things neither truth nor falsity exists except in relation to the intellect And since every thing is denominated simply by what belongs to it per se but is denominated relatively by what belongs to it accidentally a thing indeed may be called false simply when compared with the intellect on which it depends and to which it is compared per se but may be called false relatively as directed to another intellect to which it is compared accidentally Now natural things depend on the divine intellect as artificial things on the human Wherefore artificial things are said to be false simply and in themselves in so far as they fall short of the form of the art whence a craftsman is said to produce a false work if it falls short of the proper operation of his art In things that depend on God falseness cannot be found in so far as they are compared with the divine intellect since whatever takes place in things proceeds from the ordinance of that intellect unless perhaps in the case of voluntary agents only who have it in their power to withdraw themselves from what is so ordained wherein consists the evil of sin Thus sins themselves are called untruths and lies in the Scriptures according to the words of the text Why do you love vanity and seek after lying Ps four three as on the other hand virtuous deeds are called the truth of life as being obedient to the order of the divine intellect Thus it is said He that doth truth cometh to the light John three twenty one But in relation to our intellect natural things which are compared thereto accidentally can be called false not simply but relatively and that in two ways In one way according to the thing signified and thus a thing is said to be false as being signified or represented by word or thought that is false In this respect anything can be said to be false as regards any quality not possessed by it as if we should say that a diameter is a false commensurable thing as the Philosopher says Metaph v thirty four So too Augustine says Soliloq ii ten The true tragedian is a false Hector even as on the contrary anything can be called true in regard to that which is becoming to it In another way a thing can be called false by way of cause and thus a thing is said to be false that naturally begets a false opinion And whereas it is innate in us to judge things by external appearances since our knowledge takes its rise from sense which principally and naturally deals with external accidents therefore those external accidents which resemble things other than themselves are said to be false with respect to those things thus gall is falsely honey and tin false gold Regarding this Augustine says Soliloq ii six We call those things false that appear to our apprehension like the true and the Philosopher says Metaph v thirty four Things are called false that are naturally apt to appear such as they are not or what they are not In this way a man is called false as delighting in false opinions or words and not because he can invent them for in this way many wise and learned persons might be called false as stated in Metaph v thirty four Reply Obj one A thing compared with the intellect is said to be true in respect to what it is and false in respect to what it is not Hence The true tragedian is a false Hector as stated in Soliloq ii six As therefore in things that are is found a certain non being so in things that are is found a degree of falseness Reply Obj two Things do not deceive by their own nature but by accident For they give occasion to falsity by the likeness they bear to things which they actually are not Reply Obj three Things are said to be false not as compared with the divine intellect in which case they would be false simply but as compared with our intellect and thus they are false only relatively To the argument which is urged on the contrary likeness or defective representation does not involve the idea of falsity except in so far as it gives occasion to false opinion Hence a thing is not always said to be false because it resembles another thing but only when the resemblance is such as naturally to produce a false opinion not in any one case but in the majority of instances SECOND ARTICLE I Q seventeen Art two Whether There Is Falsity in the Senses Objection one It seems that falsity is not in the senses For Augustine says De Vera Relig thirty three If all the bodily senses report as they are affected I do not know what more we can require from them Thus it seems that we are not deceived by the senses and therefore that falsity is not in them Obj two Further the Philosopher says Metaph iv twenty four that falsity is not proper to the senses but to the imagination Obj three Further in non complex things there is neither true nor false but in complex things only But affirmation and negation do not belong to the senses Therefore in the senses there is no falsity On the contrary Augustine says Soliloq ii six It appears that the senses entrap us into error by their deceptive similitudes I answer that Falsity is not to be sought in the senses except as truth is in them Now truth is not in them in such a way as that the senses know truth but in so far as they apprehend sensible things truly as said above Q sixteen A two and this takes place through the senses apprehending things as they are and hence it happens that falsity exists in the senses through their apprehending or judging things to be otherwise than they really are The knowledge of things by the senses is in proportion to the existence of their likeness in the senses and the likeness of a thing can exist in the senses in three ways In the first way primarily and of its own nature as in sight there is the likeness of colors and of other sensible objects proper to it Secondly of its own nature though not primarily as in sight there is the likeness of shape size and of other sensible objects common to more than one sense Thirdly neither primarily nor of its own nature but accidentally as in sight there is the likeness of a man not as man but in so far as it is accidental to the colored object to be a man Sense then has no false knowledge about its proper objects except accidentally and rarely and then because of the unsound organ it does not receive the sensible form rightly just as other passive subjects because of their indisposition receive defectively the impressions of the agent Hence for instance it happens that on account of an unhealthy tongue sweet seems bitter to a sick person But as to common objects of sense and accidental objects even a rightly disposed sense may have a false judgment because it is referred to them not directly but accidentally or as a consequence of being directed to other things Reply Obj one The affection of sense is its sensation itself Hence from the fact that sense reports as it is affected it follows that we are not deceived in the judgment by which we judge that we experience sensation Since however sense is sometimes affected erroneously of that object it follows that it sometimes reports erroneously of that object and thus we are deceived by sense about the object but not about the fact of sensation Reply Obj two Falsity is said not to be proper to sense since sense is not deceived as to its proper object Hence in another translation it is said more plainly Sense about its proper object is never false Falsity is attributed to the imagination as it represents the likeness of something even in its absence Hence when anyone perceives the likeness of a thing as if it were the thing itself falsity results from such an apprehension and for this reason the Philosopher says Metaph v thirty four that shadows pictures and dreams are said to be false inasmuch as they convey the likeness of things that are not present in substance Reply Obj three This argument proves that the false is not in the sense as in that which knows the true and the false THIRD ARTICLE I Q seventeen Art three Whether Falsity Is in the Intellect Objection one It seems that falsity is not in the intellect For Augustine says Qq lxxxiii thirty two Everyone who is deceived understands not that in which he is deceived But falsity is said to exist in any knowledge in so far as we are deceived therein Therefore falsity does not exist in the intellect Obj two Further the Philosopher says De Anima iii fifty one that the intellect is always right Therefore there is no falsity in the intellect On the contrary It is said in De Anima iii twenty one twenty two that where there is composition of objects understood there is truth and falsehood But such composition is in the intellect Therefore truth and falsehood exist in the intellect I answer that Just as a thing has being by its proper form so the knowing faculty has knowledge by the likeness of the thing known Hence as natural things cannot fall short of the being that belongs to them by their form but may fall short of accidental or consequent qualities even as a man may fail to possess two feet but not fail to be a man so the faculty of knowing cannot fail in knowledge of the thing with the likeness of which it is informed but may fail with regard to something consequent upon that form or accidental thereto For it has been said A two that sight is not deceived in its proper sensible but about common sensibles that are consequent to that object or about accidental objects of sense Now as the sense is directly informed by the likeness of its proper object so is the intellect by the likeness of the essence of a thing Hence the intellect is not deceived about the essence of a thing as neither the sense about its proper object But in affirming and denying the intellect may be deceived by attributing to the thing of which it understands the essence something which is not consequent upon it or is opposed to it For the intellect is in the same position as regards judging of such things as sense is as to judging of common or accidental sensible objects There is however this difference as before mentioned regarding truth Q sixteen A two that falsity can exist in the intellect not only because the knowledge of the intellect is false but because the intellect is conscious of that knowledge as it is conscious of truth whereas in sense falsity does not exist as known as stated above A two But because falsity of the intellect is concerned essentially only with the composition of the intellect falsity occurs also accidentally in that operation of the intellect whereby it knows the essence of a thing in so far as composition of the intellect is mixed up in it This can take place in two ways In one way by the intellect applying to one thing the definition proper to another as that of a circle to a man Wherefore the definition of one thing is false of another In another way by composing a definition of parts which are mutually exclusive For thus the definition is not only false of the thing but false in itself A definition such as a reasonable four footed animal would be of this kind and the intellect false in making it for such a statement as some reasonable animals are four footed is false in itself For this reason the intellect cannot be false in its knowledge of simple essences but it is either true or it understands nothing at all Reply Obj one Because the essence of a thing is the proper object of the intellect we are properly said to understand a thing when we reduce it to its essence and judge of it thereby as takes place in demonstrations in which there is no falsity In this sense Augustine s words must be understood that he who is deceived understands not that wherein he is deceived and not in the sense that no one is ever deceived in any operation of the intellect Reply Obj two The intellect is always right as regards first principles since it is not deceived about them for the same reason that it is not deceived about what a thing is For self known principles are such as are known as soon as the terms are understood from the fact that the predicate is contained in the definition of the subject FOURTH ARTICLE I Q seventeen Art four Whether True and False Are Contraries Objection one It seems that true and false are not contraries For true and false are opposed as that which is to that which is not for truth as Augustine says Soliloq ii five is that which is But that which is and that which is not are not opposed as contraries Therefore true and false are not contrary things Obj two Further one of two contraries is not in the other But falsity is in truth because as Augustine says Soliloq ii ten A tragedian would not be a false Hector if he were not a true tragedian Therefore true and false are not contraries Obj three Further in God there is no contrariety for nothing is contrary to the Divine Substance as Augustine says De Civ Dei xii two But falsity is opposed to God for an idol is called in Scripture a lie They have laid hold on lying Jer eight five that is to say an idol as a gloss says Therefore false and true are not contraries On the contrary The Philosopher says Peri Herm ii that a false opinion is contrary to a true one I answer that True and false are opposed as contraries and not as some have said as affirmation and negation In proof of which it must be considered that negation neither asserts anything nor determines any subject and can therefore be said of being as of not being for instance not seeing or not sitting But privation asserts nothing whereas it determines its subject for it is negation in a subject as stated in Metaph iv four v twenty seven for blindness is not said except of one whose nature it is to see Contraries however both assert something and determine the subject for blackness is a species of color Falsity asserts something for a thing is false as the Philosopher says Metaph iv twenty seven inasmuch as something is said or seems to be something that it is not or not to be what it really is For as truth implies an adequate apprehension of a thing so falsity implies the contrary Hence it is clear that true and false are contraries Reply Obj one What is in things is the truth of the thing but what is apprehended is the truth of the intellect wherein truth primarily resides Hence the false is that which is not as apprehended To apprehend being and not being implies contrariety for as the Philosopher proves Peri Herm ii the contrary of this statement God is good is God is not good Reply Obj two Falsity is not founded in the truth which is contrary to it just as evil is not founded in the good which is contrary to it but in that which is its proper subject This happens in either because true and good are universals and convertible with being Hence as every privation is founded in a subject that is a being so every evil is founded in some good and every falsity in some truth Reply Obj three Because contraries and opposites by way of privation are by nature about one and the same thing therefore there is nothing contrary to God considered in Himself either with respect to His goodness or His truth for in His intellect there can be nothing false But in our apprehension of Him contraries exist for the false opinion concerning Him is contrary to the true So idols are called lies opposed to the divine truth inasmuch as the false opinion concerning them is contrary to the true opinion of the divine unity QUESTION eighteen THE LIFE OF GOD In Four Articles Since to understand belongs to living beings after considering the divine knowledge and intellect we must consider the divine life About this four points of inquiry arise one To whom does it belong to live two What is life three Whether life is properly attributed to God four Whether all things in God are life FIRST ARTICLE I Q eighteen Art one Whether to Live Belongs to All Natural Things Objection one It seems that to live belongs to all natural things For the Philosopher says Phys viii one that Movement is like a kind of life possessed by all things existing in nature But all natural things participate in movement Therefore all natural things partake of life Obj two Further plants are said to live inasmuch as they have in themselves a principle of movement of growth and decay But local movement is naturally more perfect than and prior to movement of growth and decay as the Philosopher shows Phys viii fifty six fifty seven Since then all natural bodies have in themselves some principle of local movement it seems that all natural bodies live Obj three Further amongst natural bodies the elements are the less perfect Yet life is attributed to them for we speak of living waters Much more therefore have other natural bodies life On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom vi one that The last echo of life is heard in the plants whereby it is inferred that their life is life in its lowest degree But inanimate bodies are inferior to plants Therefore they have not life I answer that We can gather to what things life belongs and to what it does not from such things as manifestly possess life Now life manifestly belongs to animals for it said in De Vegetab i De Plantis i one that in animals life is manifest We must therefore distinguish living from lifeless things by comparing them to that by reason of which animals are said to live and this it is in which life is manifested first and remains last We say then that an animal begins to live when it begins to move of itself and as long as such movement appears in it so long as it is considered to be alive When it no longer has any movement of itself but is only moved by another power then its life is said to fail and the animal to be dead Whereby it is clear that those things are properly called living that move themselves by some kind of movement whether it be movement properly so called as the act of an imperfect being i e of a thing in potentiality is called movement or movement in a more general sense as when said of the act of a perfect thing as understanding and feeling are called movement Accordingly all things are said to be alive that determine themselves to movement or operation of any kind whereas those things that cannot by their nature do so cannot be called living unless by a similitude Reply Obj one These words of the Philosopher may be understood either of the first movement namely that of the celestial bodies or of the movement in its general sense In either way is movement called the life as it were of natural bodies speaking by a similitude and not attributing it to them as their property The movement of the heavens is in the universe of corporeal natures as the movement of the heart whereby life is preserved is in animals Similarly also every natural movement in respect to natural things has a certain similitude to the operations of life Hence if the whole corporeal universe were one animal so that its movement came from an intrinsic moving force as some in fact have held in that case movement would really be the life of all natural bodies Reply Obj two To bodies whether heavy or light movement does not belong except in so far as they are displaced from their natural conditions and are out of their proper place for when they are in the place that is proper and natural to them then they are at rest Plants and other living things move with vital movement in accordance with the disposition of their nature but not by approaching thereto or by receding from it for in so far as they recede from such movement so far do they recede from their natural disposition Heavy and light bodies are moved by an extrinsic force either generating them and giving them form or removing obstacles from their way They do not therefore move themselves as do living bodies Reply Obj three Waters are called living that have a continuous current for standing waters that are not connected with a continually flowing source are called dead as in cisterns and ponds This is merely a similitude inasmuch as the movement they are seen to possess makes them look as if they were alive Yet this is not life in them in its real sense since this movement of theirs is not from themselves but from the cause that generates them The same is the case with the movement of other heavy and light bodies SECOND ARTICLE I Q eighteen Art two Whether Life Is an Operation Objection one It seems that life is an operation For nothing is divided except into parts of the same genus But life is divided by certain operations as is clear from the Philosopher De Anima ii thirteen who distinguishes four kinds of life namely nourishment sensation local movement and understanding Therefore life is an operation Obj two Further the active life is said to be different from the contemplative But the contemplative is only distinguished from the active by certain operations Therefore life is an operation Obj three Further to know God is an operation But this is life as is clear from the words of John eighteen three Now this is eternal life that they may know Thee the only true God Therefore life is an operation On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima ii thirty seven In living things to live is to be I answer that As is clear from what has been said Q seventeen A three our intellect which takes cognizance of the essence of a thing as its proper object gains knowledge from sense of which the proper objects are external accidents Hence from external appearances we come to the knowledge of the essence of things And because we name a thing in accordance with our knowledge of it as is clear from what has already been said Q thirteen A one so from external properties names are often imposed to signify essences Hence such names are sometimes taken strictly to denote the essence itself the signification of which is their principal object but sometimes and less strictly to denote the properties by reason of which they are imposed And so we see that the word body is used to denote a genus of substances from the fact of their possessing three dimensions and is sometimes taken to denote the dimensions themselves in which sense body is said to be a species of quantity The same must be said of life The name is given from a certain external appearance namely self movement yet not precisely to signify this but rather a substance to which self movement and the application of itself to any kind of operation belong naturally To live accordingly is nothing else than to exist in this or that nature and life signifies this though in the abstract just as the word running denotes to run in the abstract Hence living is not an accidental but an essential predicate Sometimes however life is used less properly for the operations from which its name is taken and thus the Philosopher says Ethic ix nine that to live is principally to sense or to understand Reply Obj one The Philosopher here takes to live to mean an operation of life Or it would be better to say that sensation and intelligence and the like are sometimes taken for the operations sometimes for the existence itself of the operator For he says Ethic ix nine that to live is to sense or to understand in other words to have a nature capable of sensation or understanding Thus then he distinguishes life by the four operations mentioned For in this lower world there are four kinds of living things It is the nature of some to be capable of nothing more than taking nourishment and as a consequence of growing and generating Others are able in addition to sense as we see in the case of shellfish and other animals without movement Others have the further power of moving from place to place as perfect animals such as quadrupeds and birds and so on Others as man have the still higher faculty of understanding Reply Obj two By vital operations are meant those whose principles are within the operator and in virtue of which the operator produces such operations of itself It happens that there exist in men not merely such natural principles of certain operations as are their natural powers but something over and above these such as habits inclining them like a second nature to particular kinds of operations so that the operations become sources of pleasure Thus as by a similitude any kind of work in which a man takes delight so that his bent is towards it his time spent in it and his whole life ordered with a view to it is said to be the life of that man Hence some are said to lead a life of self indulgence others a life of virtue In this way the contemplative life is distinguished from the active and thus to know God is said to be life eternal Wherefore the Reply to the Third Objection is clear THIRD ARTICLE I Q eighteen Art three Whether Life Is Properly Attributed to God Objection one It seems that life is not properly attributed to God For things are said to live inasmuch as they move themselves as previously stated A two But movement does not belong to God Neither therefore does life Obj two Further in all living things we must needs suppose some principle of life Hence it is said by the Philosopher De Anima ii four that the soul is the cause and principle of the living body But God has no principle Therefore life cannot be attributed to Him Obj three Further the principle of life in the living things that exist among us is the vegetative soul But this exists only in corporeal things Therefore life cannot be attributed to incorporeal things On the contrary It is said Ps eighty three three My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God I answer that Life is in the highest degree properly in God In proof of which it must be considered that since a thing is said to live in so far as it operates of itself and not as moved by another the more perfectly this power is found in anything the more perfect is the life of that thing In things that move and are moved a threefold order is found In the first place the end moves the agent and the principal agent is that which acts through its form and sometimes it does so through some instrument that acts by virtue not of its own form but of the principal agent and does no more than execute the action Accordingly there are things that move themselves not in respect of any form or end naturally inherent in them but only in respect of the executing of the movement the form by which they act and the end of the action being alike determined for them by their nature Of this kind are plants which move themselves according to their inherent nature with regard only to executing the movements of growth and decay Other things have self movement in a higher degree that is not only with regard to executing the movement but even as regards to the form the principle of movement which form they acquire of themselves Of this kind are animals in which the principle of movement is not a naturally implanted form but one received through sense Hence the more perfect is their sense the more perfect is their power of self movement Such as have only the sense of touch as shellfish move only with the motion of expansion and contraction and thus their movement hardly exceeds that of plants Whereas such as have the sensitive power in perfection so as to recognize not only connection and touch but also objects apart from themselves can move themselves to a distance by progressive movement Yet although animals of the latter kind receive through sense the form that is the principle of their movement nevertheless they cannot of themselves propose to themselves the end of their operation or movement for this has been implanted in them by nature and by natural instinct they are moved to any action through the form apprehended by sense Hence such animals as move themselves in respect to an end they themselves propose are superior to these This can only be done by reason and intellect whose province it is to know the proportion between the end and the means to that end and duly coordinate them Hence a more perfect degree of life is that of intelligent beings for their power of self movement is more perfect This is shown by the fact that in one and the same man the intellectual faculty moves the sensitive powers and these by their command move the organs of movement Thus in the arts we see that the art of using a ship i e the art of navigation rules the art of ship designing and this in its turn rules the art that is only concerned with preparing the material for the ship But although our intellect moves itself to some things yet others are supplied by nature as are first principles which it cannot doubt and the last end which it cannot but will Hence although with respect to some things it moves itself yet with regard to other things it must be moved by another Wherefore that being whose act of understanding is its very nature and which in what it naturally possesses is not determined by another must have life in the most perfect degree Such is God and hence in Him principally is life From this the Philosopher concludes Metaph xii fifty one after showing God to be intelligent that God has life most perfect and eternal since His intellect is most perfect and always in act Reply Obj one As stated in Metaph ix sixteen action is twofold Actions of one kind pass out to external matter as to heat or to cut whilst actions of the other kind remain in the agent as to understand to sense and to will The difference between them is this that the former action is the perfection not of the agent that moves but of the thing moved whereas the latter action is the perfection of the agent Hence because movement is an act of the thing in movement the latter action in so far as it is the act of the operator is called its movement by this similitude that as movement is an act of the thing moved so an act of this kind is the act of the agent although movement is an act of the imperfect that is of what is in potentiality while this kind of act is an act of the perfect that is to say of what is in act as stated in De Anima iii twenty eight In the sense therefore in which understanding is movement that which understands itself is said to move itself It is in this sense that Plato also taught that God moves Himself not in the sense in which movement is an act of the imperfect Reply Obj two As God is His own very existence and understanding so is He His own life and therefore He so lives that He has no principle of life Reply Obj three Life in this lower world is bestowed on a corruptible nature that needs generation to preserve the species and nourishment to preserve the individual For this reason life is not found here below apart from a vegetative soul but this does not hold good with incorruptible natures FOURTH ARTICLE I Q eighteen Art four Whether All Things Are Life in God Objection one It seems that not all things are life in God For it is said Acts seventeen twenty eight In Him we live and move and be But not all things in God are movement Therefore not all things are life in Him Obj two Further all things are in God as their first model But things modelled ought to conform to the model Since then not all things have life in themselves it seems that not all things are life in God Obj three Further as Augustine says De Vera Relig twenty nine a living substance is better than a substance that does not live If therefore things which in themselves have not life are life in God it seems that things exist more truly in God than themselves But this appears to be false since in themselves they exist actually but in God potentially Obj four Further just as good things and things made in time are known by God so are bad things and things that God can make but that never will be made If therefore all things are life in God inasmuch as known by Him it seems that even bad things and things that will never be made are life in God as known by Him and this appears inadmissible On the contrary John one three four it is said What was made in Him was life But all things were made except God Therefore all things are life in God I answer that In God to live is to understand as before stated A three In God intellect the thing understood and the act of understanding are one and the same Hence whatever is in God as understood is the very living or life of God Now wherefore since all things that have been made by God are in Him as things understood it follows that all things in Him are the divine life itself Reply Obj one Creatures are said to be in God in a twofold sense In one way so far are they are held together and preserved by the divine power even as we say that things that are in our power are in us And creatures are thus said to be in God even as they exist in their own natures In this sense we must understand the words of the Apostle when he says In Him we live move and be since our being living and moving are themselves caused by God In another sense things are said to be in God as in Him who knows them in which sense they are in God through their proper ideas which in God are not distinct from the divine essence Hence things as they are in God are the divine essence And since the divine essence is life and not movement it follows that things existing in God in this manner are not movement but life Reply Obj two The thing modelled must be like the model according to the form not the mode of being For sometimes the form has being of another kind in the model from that which it has in the thing modelled Thus the form of a house has in the mind of the architect immaterial and intelligible being but in the house that exists outside his mind material and sensible being Hence the ideas of things though not existing in themselves are life in the divine mind as having a divine existence in that mind Reply Obj three If form only and not matter belonged to natural things then in all respects natural things would exist more truly in the divine mind by the ideas of them than in themselves For which reason in fact Plato held that the separate man was the true man and that man as he exists in matter is man only by participation But since matter enters into the being of natural things we must say that those things have simply being in the divine mind more truly than in themselves because in that mind they have an uncreated being but in themselves a created being whereas this particular being a man or horse for example has this being more truly in its own nature than in the divine mind because it belongs to human nature to be material which as existing in the divine mind it is not Even so a house has nobler being in the architect s mind than in matter yet a material house is called a house more truly than the one which exists in the mind since the former is actual the latter only potential Reply Obj four Although bad things are in God s knowledge as being comprised under that knowledge yet they are not in God as created by Him or preserved by Him or as having their type in Him They are known by God through the types of good things Hence it cannot be said that bad things are life in God Those things that are not in time may be called life in God in so far as life means understanding only and inasmuch as they are understood by God but not in so far as life implies a principle of operation QUESTION nineteen THE WILL OF GOD In Twelve Articles After considering the things belonging to the divine knowledge we consider what belongs to the divine will The first consideration is about the divine will itself the second about what belongs strictly to His will the third about what belongs to the intellect in relation to His will About His will itself there are twelve points of inquiry one Whether there is will in God two Whether God wills things apart from Himself three Whether whatever God wills He wills necessarily four Whether the will of God is the cause of things five Whether any cause can be assigned to the divine will six Whether the divine will is always fulfilled seven Whether the will of God is mutable eight Whether the will of God imposes necessity on the things willed nine Whether there is in God the will of evil ten Whether God has free will eleven Whether the will of expression is distinguished in God twelve Whether five expressions of will are rightly assigned to the divine will FIRST ARTICLE I Q nineteen Art one Whether There Is Will in God Objection one It seems that there is not will in God For the object of will is the end and the good But we cannot assign to God any end Therefore there is not will in God Obj two Further will is a kind of appetite But appetite as it is directed to things not possessed implies imperfection which cannot be imputed to God Therefore there is not will in God Obj three Further according to the Philosopher De Anima iii fifty four the will moves and is moved But God is the first cause of movement and Himself is unmoved as proved in Phys viii forty nine Therefore there is not will in God On the contrary The Apostle says Rom twelve two That you may prove what is the will of God I answer that There is will in God as there is intellect since will follows upon intellect For as natural things have actual existence by their form so the intellect is actually intelligent by its intelligible form Now everything has this aptitude towards its natural form that when it has it not it tends towards it and when it has it it is at rest therein It is the same with every natural perfection which is a natural good This aptitude to good in things without knowledge is called natural appetite Whence also intellectual natures have a like aptitude as apprehended through its intelligible form so as to rest therein when possessed and when not possessed to seek to possess it both of which pertain to the will Hence in every intellectual being there is will just as in every sensible being there is animal appetite And so there must be will in God since there is intellect in Him And as His intellect is His own existence so is His will Reply Obj one Although nothing apart from God is His end yet He Himself is the end with respect to all things made by Him And this by His essence for by His essence He is good as shown above Q six A three for the end has the aspect of good Reply Obj two Will in us belongs to the appetitive part which although named from appetite has not for its only act the seeking what it does not possess but also the loving and the delighting in what it does possess In this respect will is said to be in God as having always good which is its object since as already said it is not distinct from His essence Reply Obj three A will of which the principal object is a good outside itself must be moved by another but the object of the divine will is His goodness which is His essence Hence since the will of God is His essence it is not moved by another than itself but by itself alone in the same sense as understanding and willing are said to be movement This is what Plato meant when he said that the first mover moves itself SECOND ARTICLE I Q nineteen Art two Whether God Wills Things Apart from Himself Objection one It seems that God does not will things apart from Himself For the divine will is the divine existence But God is not other than Himself Therefore He does not will things other than Himself Obj two Further the willed moves the willer as the appetible the appetite as stated in De Anima iii fifty four If therefore God wills anything apart from Himself His will must be moved by another which is impossible Obj three Further if what is willed suffices the willer he seeks nothing beyond it But His own goodness suffices God and completely satisfies His will Therefore God does not will anything apart from Himself Obj four Further acts of will are multiplied in proportion to the number of their objects If therefore God wills Himself and things apart from Himself it follows that the act of His will is manifold and consequently His existence which is His will

none	none	Therefore God does not will things apart from Himself On the contrary The Apostle says one Thess four three This is the will of God your sanctification I answer that God wills not only Himself but other things apart from Himself This is clear from the comparison which we made above A one For natural things have a natural inclination not only towards their own proper good to acquire it if not possessed and if possessed to rest therein but also to spread abroad their own good amongst others so far as possible Hence we see that every agent in so far as it is perfect and in act produces its like It pertains therefore to the nature of the will to communicate as far as possible to others the good possessed and especially does this pertain to the divine will from which all perfection is derived in some kind of likeness Hence if natural things in so far as they are perfect communicate their good to others much more does it appertain to the divine will to communicate by likeness its own good to others as much as possible Thus then He wills both Himself to be and other things to be but Himself as the end and other things as ordained to that end inasmuch as it befits the divine goodness that other things should be partakers therein Reply Obj one The divine will is God s own existence essentially yet they differ in aspect according to the different ways of understanding them and expressing them as is clear from what has already been said Q thirteen A four For when we say that God exists no relation to any other object is implied as we do imply when we say that God wills Therefore although He is not anything apart from Himself yet He does will things apart from Himself Reply Obj two In things willed for the sake of the end the whole reason for our being moved is the end and this it is that moves the will as most clearly appears in things willed only for the sake of the end He who wills to take a bitter draught in doing so wills nothing else than health and this alone moves his will It is different with one who takes a draught that is pleasant which anyone may will to do not only for the sake of health but also for its own sake Hence although God wills things apart from Himself only for the sake of the end which is His own goodness it does not follow that anything else moves His will except His goodness So as He understands things apart from Himself by understanding His own essence so He wills things apart from Himself by willing His own goodness Reply Obj three From the fact that His own goodness suffices the divine will it does not follow that it wills nothing apart from itself but rather that it wills nothing except by reason of its goodness Thus too the divine intellect though its perfection consists in its very knowledge of the divine essence yet in that essence knows other things Reply Obj four As the divine intellect is one as seeing the many only in the one in the same way the divine will is one and simple as willing the many only through the one that is through its own goodness THIRD ARTICLE I Q nineteen Art three Whether Whatever God Wills He Wills Necessarily Objection one It seems that whatever God wills He wills necessarily For everything eternal is necessary But whatever God wills He wills from eternity for otherwise His will would be mutable Therefore whatever He wills He wills necessarily Obj two Further God wills things apart from Himself inasmuch as He wills His own goodness Now God wills His own goodness necessarily Therefore He wills things apart from Himself necessarily Obj three Further whatever belongs to the nature of God is necessary for God is of Himself necessary being and the principle of all necessity as above shown Q two A three But it belongs to His nature to will whatever He wills since in God there can be nothing over and above His nature as stated in Metaph v six Therefore whatever He wills He wills necessarily Obj four Further being that is not necessary and being that is possible not to be are one and the same thing If therefore God does not necessarily will a thing that He wills it is possible for Him not to will it and therefore possible for Him to will what He does not will And so the divine will is contingent upon one or the other of two things and imperfect since everything contingent is imperfect and mutable Obj five Further on the part of that which is indifferent to one or the other of two things no action results unless it is inclined to one or the other by some other power as the Commentator Averroes says in Phys ii If then the Will of God is indifferent with regard to anything it follows that His determination to act comes from another and thus He has some cause prior to Himself Obj six Further whatever God knows He knows necessarily But as the divine knowledge is His essence so is the divine will Therefore whatever God wills He wills necessarily On the contrary The Apostle says Eph one eleven Who worketh all things according to the counsel of His will Now what we work according to the counsel of the will we do not will necessarily Therefore God does not will necessarily whatever He wills I answer that There are two ways in which a thing is said to be necessary namely absolutely and by supposition We judge a thing to be absolutely necessary from the relation of the terms as when the predicate forms part of the definition of the subject thus it is absolutely necessary that man is an animal It is the same when the subject forms part of the notion of the predicate thus it is absolutely necessary that a number must be odd or even In this way it is not necessary that Socrates sits wherefore it is not necessary absolutely though it may be so by supposition for granted that he is sitting he must necessarily sit as long as he is sitting Accordingly as to things willed by God we must observe that He wills something of absolute necessity but this is not true of all that He wills For the divine will has a necessary relation to the divine goodness since that is its proper object Hence God wills His own goodness necessarily even as we will our own happiness necessarily and as any other faculty has necessary relation to its proper and principal object for instance the sight to color since it tends to it by its own nature But God wills things apart from Himself in so far as they are ordered to His own goodness as their end Now in willing an end we do not necessarily will things that conduce to it unless they are such that the end cannot be attained without them as we will to take food to preserve life or to take ship in order to cross the sea But we do not necessarily will things without which the end is attainable such as a horse for a journey which we can take on foot for we can make the journey without one The same applies to other means Hence since the goodness of God is perfect and can exist without other things inasmuch as no perfection can accrue to Him from them it follows that His willing things apart from Himself is not absolutely necessary Yet it can be necessary by supposition for supposing that He wills a thing then He is unable not to will it as His will cannot change Reply Obj one From the fact that God wills from eternity whatever He wills it does not follow that He wills it necessarily except by supposition Reply Obj two Although God necessarily wills His own goodness He does not necessarily will things willed on account of His goodness for it can exist without other things Reply Obj three It is not natural to God to will any of those other things that He does not will necessarily and yet it is not unnatural or contrary to His nature but voluntary Reply Obj four Sometimes a necessary cause has a non necessary relation to an effect owing to a deficiency in the effect and not in the cause Even so the sun s power has a non necessary relation to some contingent events on this earth owing to a defect not in the solar power but in the effect that proceeds not necessarily from the cause In the same way that God does not necessarily will some of the things that He wills does not result from defect in the divine will but from a defect belonging to the nature of the thing willed namely that the perfect goodness of God can be without it and such defect accompanies all created good Reply Obj five A naturally contingent cause must be determined to act by some external power The divine will which by its nature is necessary determines itself to will things to which it has no necessary relation Reply Obj six As the divine essence is necessary of itself so is the divine will and the divine knowledge but the divine knowledge has a necessary relation to the thing known not the divine will to the thing willed The reason for this is that knowledge is of things as they exist in the knower but the will is directed to things as they exist in themselves Since then all other things have necessary existence inasmuch as they exist in God but no absolute necessity so as to be necessary in themselves in so far as they exist in themselves it follows that God knows necessarily whatever He wills but does not will necessarily whatever He wills FOURTH ARTICLE I Q nineteen Art four Whether the Will of God Is the Cause of Things Objection one It seems that the will of God is not the cause of things For Dionysius says Div Nom iv one As our sun not by reason nor by pre election but by its very being enlightens all things that can participate in its light so the divine good by its very essence pours the rays of goodness upon everything that exists But every voluntary agent acts by reason and pre election Therefore God does not act by will and so His will is not the cause of things Obj two Further The first in any order is that which is essentially so thus in the order of burning things that comes first which is fire by its essence But God is the first agent Therefore He acts by His essence and that is His nature He acts then by nature and not by will Therefore the divine will is not the cause of things Obj three Further Whatever is the cause of anything through being such a thing is the cause by nature and not by will For fire is the cause of heat as being itself hot whereas an architect is the cause of a house because he wills to build it Now Augustine says De Doctr Christ i thirty two Because God is good we exist Therefore God is the cause of things by His nature and not by His will Obj four Further Of one thing there is one cause But the cause of created things is the knowledge of God as said before Q fourteen A eight Therefore the will of God cannot be considered the cause of things On the contrary It is said Wis eleven twenty six How could anything endure if Thou wouldst not I answer that We must hold that the will of God is the cause of things and that He acts by the will and not as some have supposed by a necessity of His nature This can be shown in three ways First from the order itself of active causes Since both intellect and nature act for an end as proved in Phys ii forty nine the natural agent must have the end and the necessary means predetermined for it by some higher intellect as the end and definite movement is predetermined for the arrow by the archer Hence the intellectual and voluntary agent must precede the agent that acts by nature Hence since God is first in the order of agents He must act by intellect and will This is shown secondly from the character of a natural agent of which the property is to produce one and the same effect for nature operates in one and the same way unless it be prevented This is because the nature of the act is according to the nature of the agent and hence as long as it has that nature its acts will be in accordance with that nature for every natural agent has a determinate being Since then the Divine Being is undetermined and contains in Himself the full perfection of being it cannot be that He acts by a necessity of His nature unless He were to cause something undetermined and indefinite in being and that this is impossible has been already shown Q seven A two He does not therefore act by a necessity of His nature but determined effects proceed from His own infinite perfection according to the determination of His will and intellect Thirdly it is shown by the relation of effects to their cause For effects proceed from the agent that causes them in so far as they pre exist in the agent since every agent produces its like Now effects pre exist in their cause after the mode of the cause Wherefore since the Divine Being is His own intellect effects pre exist in Him after the mode of intellect and therefore proceed from Him after the same mode Consequently they proceed from Him after the mode of will for His inclination to put in act what His intellect has conceived appertains to the will Therefore the will of God is the cause of things Reply Obj one Dionysius in these words does not intend to exclude election from God absolutely but only in a certain sense in so far that is as He communicates His goodness not merely to certain things but to all and as election implies a certain distinction Reply Obj two Because the essence of God is His intellect and will from the fact of His acting by His essence it follows that He acts after the mode of intellect and will Reply Obj three Good is the object of the will The words therefore Because God is good we exist are true inasmuch as His goodness is the reason of His willing all other things as said before A two ad two Reply Obj four Even in us the cause of one and the same effect is knowledge as directing it whereby the form of the work is conceived and will as commanding it since the form as it is in the intellect only is not determined to exist or not to exist in the effect except by the will Hence the speculative intellect has nothing to say to operation But the power is cause as executing the effect since it denotes the immediate principle of operation But in God all these things are one FIFTH ARTICLE I Q nineteen Art five Whether Any Cause Can Be Assigned to the Divine Will Objection one It seems that some cause can be assigned to the divine will For Augustine says Qq lxxxiii forty six Who would venture to say that God made all things irrationally But to a voluntary agent what is the reason of operating is the cause of willing Therefore the will of God has some cause Obj two Further in things made by one who wills to make them and whose will is influenced by no cause there can be no cause assigned except by the will of him who wills But the will of God is the cause of all things as has been already shown A four If then there is no cause of His will we cannot seek in any natural things any cause except the divine will alone Thus all science would be in vain since science seeks to assign causes to effects This seems inadmissible and therefore we must assign some cause to the divine will Obj three Further what is done by the willer on account of no cause depends simply on his will If therefore the will of God has no cause it follows that all things made depend simply on His will and have no other cause But this also is not admissible On the contrary Augustine says Qq lxxxiii twenty eight Every efficient cause is greater than the thing effected But nothing is greater than the will of God We must not then seek for a cause of it I answer that In no wise has the will of God a cause In proof of which we must consider that since the will follows from the intellect there is cause of the will in the person who wills in the same way as there is a cause of the understanding in the person that understands The case with the understanding is this that if the premiss and its conclusion are understood separately from each other the understanding the premiss is the cause that the conclusion is known If the understanding perceive the conclusion in the premiss itself apprehending both the one and the other at the same glance in this case the knowing of the conclusion would not be caused by understanding the premisses since a thing cannot be its own cause and yet it would be true that the thinker would understand the premisses to be the cause of the conclusion It is the same with the will with respect to which the end stands in the same relation to the means to the end as do the premisses to the conclusion with regard to the understanding Hence if anyone in one act wills an end and in another act the means to that end his willing the end will be the cause of his willing the means This cannot be the case if in one act he wills both end and means for a thing cannot be its own cause Yet it will be true to say that he wills to order to the end the means to the end Now as God by one act understands all things in His essence so by one act He wills all things in His goodness Hence as in God to understand the cause is not the cause of His understanding the effect for He understands the effect in the cause so in Him to will an end is not the cause of His willing the means yet He wills the ordering of the means to the end Therefore He wills this to be as means to that but does not will this on account of that Reply Obj one The will of God is reasonable not because anything is to God a cause of willing but in so far as He wills one thing to be on account of another Reply Obj two Since God wills effects to proceed from definite causes for the preservation of order in the universe it is not unreasonable to seek for causes secondary to the divine will It would however be unreasonable to do so if such were considered as primary and not as dependent on the will of God In this sense Augustine says De Trin iii two Philosophers in their vanity have thought fit to attribute contingent effects to other causes being utterly unable to perceive the cause that is shown above all others the will of God Reply Obj three Since God wills effects to come from causes all effects that presuppose some other effect do not depend solely on the will of God but on something else besides but the first effect depends on the divine will alone Thus for example we may say that God willed man to have hands to serve his intellect by their work and intellect that he might be man and willed him to be man that he might enjoy Him or for the completion of the universe But this cannot be reduced to other created secondary ends Hence such things depend on the simple will of God but the others on the order of other causes SIXTH ARTICLE I Q nineteen Art six Whether the Will of God Is Always Fulfilled Objection one It seems that the will of God is not always fulfilled For the Apostle says one Tim two four God will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth But this does not happen Therefore the will of God is not always fulfilled Obj two Further as is the relation of knowledge to truth so is that of the will to good Now God knows all truth Therefore He wills all good But not all good actually exists for much more good might exist Therefore the will of God is not always fulfilled Obj three Further since the will of God is the first cause it does not exclude intermediate causes But the effect of a first cause may be hindered by a defect of a secondary cause as the effect of the motive power may be hindered by the weakness of the limb Therefore the effect of the divine will may be hindered by a defect of the secondary causes The will of God therefore is not always fulfilled On the contrary It is said Ps one hundred thirteen eleven God hath done all things whatsoever He would I answer that The will of God must needs always be fulfilled In proof of which we must consider that since an effect is conformed to the agent according to its form the rule is the same with active causes as with formal causes The rule in forms is this that although a thing may fall short of any particular form it cannot fall short of the universal form For though a thing may fail to be for example a man or a living being yet it cannot fail to be a being Hence the same must happen in active causes Something may fall outside the order of any particular active cause but not outside the order of the universal cause under which all particular causes are included and if any particular cause fails of its effect this is because of the hindrance of some other particular cause which is included in the order of the universal cause Therefore an effect cannot possibly escape the order of the universal cause Even in corporeal things this is clearly seen For it may happen that a star is hindered from producing its effects yet whatever effect does result in corporeal things from this hindrance of a corporeal cause must be referred through intermediate causes to the universal influence of the first heaven Since then the will of God is the universal cause of all things it is impossible that the divine will should not produce its effect Hence that which seems to depart from the divine will in one order returns into it in another order as does the sinner who by sin falls away from the divine will as much as lies in him yet falls back into the order of that will when by its justice he is punished Reply Obj one The words of the Apostle God will have all men to be saved et cetera can be understood in three ways First by a restricted application in which case they would mean as Augustine says De praed sanct i eight Enchiridion one hundred three God wills all men to be saved that are saved not because there is no man whom He does not wish saved but because there is no man saved whose salvation He does not will Secondly they can be understood as applying to every class of individuals not to every individual of each class in which case they mean that God wills some men of every class and condition to be saved males and females Jews and Gentiles great and small but not all of every condition Thirdly according to Damascene De Fide Orth ii twenty nine they are understood of the antecedent will of God not of the consequent will This distinction must not be taken as applying to the divine will itself in which there is nothing antecedent nor consequent but to the things willed To understand this we must consider that everything in so far as it is good is willed by God A thing taken in its primary sense and absolutely considered may be good or evil and yet when some additional circumstances are taken into account by a consequent consideration may be changed into the contrary Thus that a man should live is good and that a man should be killed is evil absolutely considered But if in a particular case we add that a man is a murderer or dangerous to society to kill him is a good that he live is an evil Hence it may be said of a just judge that antecedently he wills all men to live but consequently wills the murderer to be hanged In the same way God antecedently wills all men to be saved but consequently wills some to be damned as His justice exacts Nor do we will simply what we will antecedently but rather we will it in a qualified manner for the will is directed to things as they are in themselves and in themselves they exist under particular qualifications Hence we will a thing simply inasmuch as we will it when all particular circumstances are considered and this is what is meant by willing consequently Thus it may be said that a just judge wills simply the hanging of a murderer but in a qualified manner he would will him to live to wit inasmuch as he is a man Such a qualified will may be called a willingness rather than an absolute will Thus it is clear that whatever God simply wills takes place although what He wills antecedently may not take place Reply Obj two An act of the cognitive faculty is according as the thing known is in the knower while an act of the appetite faculty is directed to things as they exist in themselves But all that can have the nature of being and truth virtually exists in God though it does not all exist in created things Therefore God knows all truth but does not will all good except in so far as He wills Himself in Whom all good virtually exists Reply Obj three A first cause can be hindered in its effect by deficiency in the secondary cause when it is not the universal first cause including within itself all causes for then the effect could in no way escape its order And thus it is with the will of God as said above SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q nineteen Art seven Whether the Will of God Is Changeable Objection one It seems that the will of God is changeable For the Lord says general six seven It repenteth Me that I have made man But whoever repents of what he has done has a changeable will Therefore God has a changeable will Obj two Further it is said in the person of the Lord I will speak against a nation and against a kingdom to root out and to pull down and to destroy it but if that nation shall repent of its evil I also will repent of the evil that I have thought to do to them Jer eighteen seven eight Therefore God has a changeable will Obj three Further whatever God does He does voluntarily But God does not always do the same thing for at one time He ordered the law to be observed and at another time forbade it Therefore He has a changeable will Obj four Further God does not will of necessity what He wills as said before A three Therefore He can both will and not will the same thing But whatever can incline to either of two opposites is changeable substantially and that which can exist in a place or not in that place is changeable locally Therefore God is changeable as regards His will On the contrary It is said God is not as a man that He should lie nor as the son of man that He should be changed Num twenty three nineteen I answer that The will of God is entirely unchangeable On this point we must consider that to change the will is one thing to will that certain things should be changed is another It is possible to will a thing to be done now and its contrary afterwards and yet for the will to remain permanently the same whereas the will would be changed if one should begin to will what before he had not willed or cease to will what he had willed before This cannot happen unless we presuppose change either in the knowledge or in the disposition of the substance of the willer For since the will regards good a man may in two ways begin to will a thing In one way when that thing begins to be good for him and this does not take place without a change in him Thus when the cold weather begins it becomes good to sit by the fire though it was not so before In another way when he knows for the first time that a thing is good for him though he did not know it before hence we take counsel in order to know what is good for us Now it has already been shown that both the substance of God and His knowledge are entirely unchangeable QQ nine A one fourteen A fifteen Therefore His will must be entirely unchangeable Reply Obj one These words of the Lord are to be understood metaphorically and according to the likeness of our nature For when we repent we destroy what we have made although we may even do so without change of will as when a man wills to make a thing at the same time intending to destroy it later Therefore God is said to have repented by way of comparison with our mode of acting in so far as by the deluge He destroyed from the face of the earth man whom He had made Reply Obj two The will of God as it is the first and universal cause does not exclude intermediate causes that have power to produce certain effects Since however all intermediate causes are inferior in power to the first cause there are many things in the divine power knowledge and will that are not included in the order of inferior causes Thus in the case of the raising of Lazarus one who looked only on inferior causes might have said Lazarus will not rise again but looking at the divine first cause might have said Lazarus will rise again And God wills both that is that in the order of the inferior cause a thing shall happen but that in the order of the higher cause it shall not happen or He may will conversely We may say then that God sometimes declares that a thing shall happen according as it falls under the order of inferior causes as of nature or merit which yet does not happen as not being in the designs of the divine and higher cause Thus He foretold to Ezechias Take order with thy house for thou shalt die and not live Isa thirty eight one Yet this did not take place since from eternity it was otherwise disposed in the divine knowledge and will which is unchangeable Hence Gregory says Moral xvi five The sentence of God changes but not His counsel that is to say the counsel of His will When therefore He says I also will repent His words must be understood metaphorically For men seem to repent when they do not fulfill what they have threatened Reply Obj three It does not follow from this argument that God has a will that changes but that He sometimes wills that things should change Reply Obj four Although God s willing a thing is not by absolute necessity yet it is necessary by supposition on account of the unchangeableness of the divine will as has been said above A three EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q nineteen Art eight Whether the Will of God Imposes Necessity on the Things Willed Objection one It seems that the will of God imposes necessity on the things willed For Augustine says Enchiridion one hundred three No one is saved except whom God has willed to be saved He must therefore be asked to will it for if He wills it it must necessarily be Obj two Further every cause that cannot be hindered produces its effect necessarily because as the Philosopher says Phys ii eighty four Nature always works in the same way if there is nothing to hinder it But the will of God cannot be hindered For the Apostle says Rom nine nineteen Who resisteth His will Therefore the will of God imposes necessity on the things willed Obj three Further whatever is necessary by its antecedent cause is necessary absolutely it is thus necessary that animals should die being compounded of contrary elements Now things created by God are related to the divine will as to an antecedent cause whereby they have necessity For the conditional statement is true that if God wills a thing it comes to pass and every true conditional statement is necessary It follows therefore that all that God wills is necessary absolutely On the contrary All good things that exist God wills to be If therefore His will imposes necessity on things willed it follows that all good happens of necessity and thus there is an end of free will counsel and all other such things I answer that The divine will imposes necessity on some things willed but not on all The reason of this some have chosen to assign to intermediate causes holding that what God produces by necessary causes is necessary and what He produces by contingent causes contingent This does not seem to be a sufficient explanation for two reasons First because the effect of a first cause is contingent on account of the secondary cause from the fact that the effect of the first cause is hindered by deficiency in the second cause as the sun s power is hindered by a defect in the plant But no defect of a secondary cause can hinder God s will from producing its effect Secondly because if the distinction between the contingent and the necessary is to be referred only to secondary causes this must be independent of the divine intention and will which is inadmissible It is better therefore to say that this happens on account of the efficacy of the divine will For when a cause is efficacious to act the effect follows upon the cause not only as to the thing done but also as to its manner of being done or of being Thus from defect of active power in the seed it may happen that a child is born unlike its father in accidental points that belong to its manner of being Since then the divine will is perfectly efficacious it follows not only that things are done which God wills to be done but also that they are done in the way that He wills Now God wills some things to be done necessarily some contingently to the right ordering of things for the building up of the universe Therefore to some effects He has attached necessary causes that cannot fail but to others defectible and contingent causes from which arise contingent effects Hence it is not because the proximate causes are contingent that the effects willed by God happen contingently but because God prepared contingent causes for them it being His will that they should happen contingently Reply Obj one By the words of Augustine we must understand a necessity in things willed by God that is not absolute but conditional For the conditional statement that if God wills a thing it must necessarily be is necessarily true Reply Obj two From the very fact that nothing resists the divine will it follows that not only those things happen that God wills to happen but that they happen necessarily or contingently according to His will Reply Obj three Consequents have necessity from their antecedents according to the mode of the antecedents Hence things effected by the divine will have that kind of necessity that God wills them to have either absolute or conditional Not all things therefore are absolute necessities NINTH ARTICLE I Q nineteen Art eight Whether God Wills Evils Objection one It seems that God wills evils For every good that exists God wills But it is a good that evil should exist For Augustine says Enchiridion ninety five Although evil in so far as it is evil is not a good yet it is good that not only good things should exist but also evil things Therefore God wills evil things Obj two Further Dionysius says Div Nom iv twenty three Evil would conduce to the perfection of everything i e the universe And Augustine says Enchiridion ten eleven Out of all things is built up the admirable beauty of the universe wherein even that which is called evil properly ordered and disposed commends the good more evidently in that good is more pleasing and praiseworthy when contrasted with evil But God wills all that appertains to the perfection and beauty of the universe for this is what God desires above all things in His creatures Therefore God wills evil Obj three Further that evil should exist and should not exist are contradictory opposites But God does not will that evil should not exist otherwise since various evils do exist God s will would not always be fulfilled Therefore God wills that evil should exist On the contrary Augustine says Qq eight hundred thirty three No wise man is the cause of another man becoming worse Now God surpasses all men in wisdom Much less therefore is God the cause of man becoming worse and when He is said to be the cause of a thing He is said to will it Therefore it is not by God s will that man becomes worse Now it is clear that every evil makes a thing worse Therefore God wills not evil things I answer that Since the ratio of good is the ratio of appetibility as said before Q five A one and since evil is opposed to good it is impossible that any evil as such should be sought for by the appetite either natural or animal or by the intellectual appetite which is the will Nevertheless evil may be sought accidentally so far as it accompanies a good as appears in each of the appetites For a natural agent intends not privation or corruption but the form to which is annexed the privation of some other form and the generation of one thing which implies the corruption of another Also when a lion kills a stag his object is food to obtain which the killing of the animal is only the means Similarly the fornicator has merely pleasure for his object and the deformity of sin is only an accompaniment Now the evil that accompanies one good is the privation of another good Never therefore would evil be sought after not even accidentally unless the good that accompanies the evil were more desired than the good of which the evil is the privation Now God wills no good more than He wills His own goodness yet He wills one good more than another Hence He in no way wills the evil of sin which is the privation of right order towards the divine good The evil of natural defect or of punishment He does will by willing the good to which such evils are attached Thus in willing justice He wills punishment and in willing the preservation of the natural order He wills some things to be naturally corrupted Reply Obj one Some have said that although God does not will evil yet He wills that evil should be or be done because although evil is not a good yet it is good that evil should be or be done This they said because things evil in themselves are ordered to some good end and this order they thought was expressed in the words that evil should be or be done This however is not correct since evil is not of itself ordered to good but accidentally For it is beside the intention of the sinner that any good should follow from his sin as it was beside the intention of tyrants that the patience of the martyrs should shine forth from all their persecutions It cannot therefore be said that such an ordering to good is implied in the statement that it is a good thing that evil should be or be done since nothing is judged of by that which appertains to it accidentally but by that which belongs to it essentially Reply Obj two Evil does not operate towards the perfection and beauty of the universe except accidentally as said above ad one Therefore Dionysius in saying that evil would conduce to the perfection of the universe draws a conclusion by reduction to an absurdity Reply Obj three The statements that evil exists and that evil exists not are opposed as contradictories yet the statements that anyone wills evil to exist and that he wills it not to be are not so opposed since either is affirmative God therefore neither wills evil to be done nor wills it not to be done but wills to permit evil to be done and this is a good TENTH ARTICLE I Q nineteen Art ten Whether God Has Free Will Objection one It seems that God has not free will For Jerome says in a homily on the prodigal son Ep one hundred forty six ad Damas God alone is He who is not liable to sin nor can be liable all others as having free will can be inclined to either side Obj two Further free will is the faculty of the reason and will by which good and evil are chosen But God does not will evil as has been said A nine Therefore there is not free will in God On the contrary Ambrose says De Fide ii three The Holy Spirit divideth unto each one as He will namely according to the free choice of the will not in obedience to necessity I answer that We have free will with respect to what we will not of necessity nor by natural instinct For our will to be happy does not appertain to free will but to natural instinct Hence other animals that are moved to act by natural instinct are not said to be moved by free will Since then God necessarily wills His own goodness but other things not necessarily as shown above A three He has free will with respect to what He does not necessarily will Reply Obj one Jerome seems to deny free will to God not simply but only as regards the inclination to sin Reply Obj two Since the evil of sin consists in turning away from the divine goodness by which God wills all things as above shown it is manifestly impossible for Him to will the evil of sin yet He can make choice of one of two opposites inasmuch as He can will a thing to be or not to be In the same way we ourselves without sin can will to sit down and not will to sit down ELEVENTH ARTICLE I Q nineteen Art eleven Whether the Will of Expression Is to Be Distinguished in God Objection one It seems that the will of expression is not to be distinguished in God For as the will of God is the cause of things so is His wisdom But no expressions are assigned to the divine wisdom Therefore no expressions ought to be assigned to the divine will Obj two Further every expression that is not in agreement with the mind of him who expresses himself is false If therefore the expressions assigned to the divine will are not in agreement with that will they are false But if they do agree they are superfluous No expressions therefore must be assigned to the divine will On the contrary The will of God is one since it is the very essence of God Yet sometimes it is spoken of as many as in the words of Ps one hundred ten two Great are the works of the Lord sought out according to all His wills Therefore sometimes the sign must be taken for the will I answer that Some things are said of God in their strict sense others by metaphor as appears from what has been said before Q thirteen A three When certain human passions are predicated of the Godhead metaphorically this is done because of a likeness in the effect Hence a thing that is in us a sign of some passion is signified metaphorically in God under the name of that passion Thus with us it is usual for an angry man to punish so that punishment becomes an expression of anger Therefore punishment itself is signified by the word anger when anger is attributed to God In the same way what is usually with us an expression of will is sometimes metaphorically called will in God just as when anyone lays down a precept it is a sign that he wishes that precept obeyed Hence a divine precept is sometimes called by metaphor the will of God as in the words Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven Matt six ten There is however this difference between will and anger that anger is never attributed to God properly since in its primary meaning it includes passion whereas will is attributed to Him properly Therefore in God there are distinguished will in its proper sense and will as attributed to Him by metaphor Will in its proper sense is called the will of good pleasure and will metaphorically taken is the will of expression inasmuch as the sign itself of will is called will Reply Obj one Knowledge is not the cause of a thing being done unless through the will For we do not put into act what we know unless we will to do so Accordingly expression is not attributed to knowledge but to will Reply Obj two Expressions of will are called divine wills not as being signs that God wills anything but because what in us is the usual expression of our will is called the divine will in God Thus punishment is not a sign that there is anger in God but it is called anger in Him from the fact that it is an expression of anger in ourselves TWELFTH ARTICLE I Q nineteen Art twelve Whether Five Expressions of Will Are Rightly Assigned to the Divine Will Objection one It seems that five expressions of will namely prohibition precept counsel operation and permission are not rightly assigned to the divine will For the same things that God bids us do by His precept or counsel these He sometimes operates in us and the same things that He prohibits these He sometimes permits They ought not therefore to be enumerated as distinct Obj two Further God works nothing unless He wills it as the Scripture says Wis eleven twenty six But the will of expression is distinct from the will of good pleasure Therefore operation ought not to be comprehended in the will of expression Obj three Further operation and permission appertain to all creatures in common since God works in them all and permits some action in them all But precept counsel and prohibition belong to rational creatures only Therefore they do not come rightly under one division not being of one order Obj four Further evil happens in more ways than good since good happens in one way but evil in all kinds of ways as declared by the Philosopher Ethic ii six and Dionysius Div Nom iv twenty two It is not right therefore to assign one expression only in the case of evil namely prohibition and two namely counsel and precept in the case of good I answer that By these signs we name the expression of will by which we are accustomed to show that we will something A man may show that he wills something either by himself or by means of another He may show it by himself by doing something either directly or indirectly and accidentally He shows it directly when he works in his own person in that way the expression of his will is his own working He shows it indirectly by not hindering the doing of a thing for what removes an impediment is called an accidental mover In this respect the expression is called permission He declares his will by means of another when he orders another to perform a work either by insisting upon it as necessary by precept and by prohibiting its contrary or by persuasion which is a part of counsel Since in these ways the will of man makes itself known the same five are sometimes denominated with regard to the divine will as the expression of that will That precept counsel and prohibition are called the will of God is clear from the words of Matt six ten Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven That permission and operation are called the will of God is clear from Augustine Enchiridion ninety five who says Nothing is done unless the Almighty wills it to be done either by permitting it or by actually doing it Or it may be said that permission and operation refer to present time permission being with respect to evil operation with regard to good Whilst as to future time prohibition is in respect to evil precept to good that is necessary and counsel to good that is of supererogation Reply Obj one There is nothing to prevent anyone declaring his will about the same matter in different ways thus we find many words that mean the same thing Hence there is no reason why the same thing should not be the subject of precept operation and counsel or of prohibition or permission Reply Obj two As God may by metaphor be said to will what by His will properly speaking He wills not so He may by metaphor be said to will what He does properly speaking will Hence there is nothing to prevent the same thing being the object of the will of good pleasure and of the will of expression But operation is always the same as the will of good pleasure while precept and counsel are not both because the former regards the present and the two latter the future and because the former is of itself the effect of the will the latter its effect as fulfilled by means of another Reply Obj three Rational creatures are masters of their own acts and for this reason certain special expressions of the divine will are assigned to their acts inasmuch as God ordains rational creatures to act voluntarily and of themselves Other creatures act only as moved by the divine operation therefore only operation and permission are concerned with these Reply Obj four All evil of sin though happening in many ways agrees in being out of harmony with the divine will Hence with regard to evil only one expression is assigned that of prohibition On the other hand good stands in various relations to the divine goodness since there are good deeds without which we cannot attain to the fruition of that goodness and these are the subject of precept and there are others by which we attain to it more perfectly and these are the subject of counsel Or it may be said that counsel is not only concerned with the obtaining of greater good but also with the avoiding of lesser evils QUESTION twenty GOD S LOVE In Four Articles We next consider those things that pertain absolutely to the will of God In the appetitive part of the soul there are found in ourselves both the passions of the soul as joy love and the like and the habits of the moral virtues as justice fortitude and the like Hence we shall first consider the love of God and secondly His justice and mercy About the first there are four points of inquiry one Whether love exists in God two Whether He loves all things three Whether He loves one thing more than another four Whether He loves more the better things FIRST ARTICLE I Q twenty Art one Whether Love Exists in God Objection one It seems that love does not exist in God For in God there are no passions Now love is a passion Therefore love is not in God Obj two Further love anger sorrow and the like are mutually divided against one another But sorrow and anger are not attributed to God unless by metaphor Therefore neither is love attributed to Him Obj three Further Dionysius says Div Nom iv Love is a uniting and binding force But this cannot take place in God since He is simple Therefore love does not exist in God On the contrary It is written God is love John four sixteen I answer that We must needs assert that in God there is love because love is the first movement of the will and of every appetitive faculty For since the acts of the will and of every appetitive faculty tend towards good and evil as to their proper objects and since good is essentially and especially the object of the will and the appetite whereas evil is only the object secondarily and indirectly as opposed to good it follows that the acts of the will and appetite that regard good must naturally be prior to those that regard evil thus for instance joy is prior to sorrow love to hate because what exists of itself is always prior to that which exists through another Again the more universal is naturally prior to what is less so Hence the intellect is first directed to universal truth and in the second place to particular and special truths Now there are certain acts of the will and appetite that regard good under some special condition as joy and delight regard good present and possessed whereas desire and hope regard good not as yet possessed Love however regards good universally whether possessed or not Hence love is naturally the first act of the will and appetite for which reason all the other appetite movements presuppose love as their root and origin For nobody desires anything nor rejoices in anything except as a good that is loved nor is anything an object of hate except as opposed to the object of love Similarly it is clear that sorrow and other things like to it must be referred to love as to their first principle Hence in whomsoever there is will and appetite there must also be love since if the first is wanting all that follows is also wanting Now it has been shown that will is in God Q nineteen A one and hence we must attribute love to Him Reply Obj one The cognitive faculty does not move except through the medium of the appetitive and just as in ourselves the universal reason moves through the medium of the particular reason as stated in De Anima iii fifty eight seventy five so in ourselves the intellectual appetite or the will as it is called moves through the medium of the sensitive appetite Hence in us the sensitive appetite is the proximate motive force of our bodies Some bodily change therefore always accompanies an act of the sensitive appetite and this change affects especially the heart which as the Philosopher says De part animal iii four is the first principle of movement in animals Therefore acts of the sensitive appetite inasmuch as they have annexed to them some bodily change are called passions whereas acts of the will are not so called Love therefore and joy and delight are passions in so far as they denote acts of the intellective appetite they are not passions It is in this latter sense that they are in God Hence the Philosopher says Ethic vii God rejoices by an operation that is one and simple and for the same reason He loves without passion Reply Obj two In the passions of the sensitive appetite there may be distinguished a certain material element namely the bodily change and a certain formal element which is on the part of the appetite Thus in anger as the Philosopher says De Anima iii fifteen sixty three sixty four the material element is the kindling of the blood about the heart but the formal the appetite for revenge Again as regards the formal element of certain passions a certain imperfection is implied as in desire which is of the good we have not and in sorrow which is about the evil we have This applies also to anger which supposes sorrow Certain other passions however as love and joy imply no imperfection Since therefore none of these can be attributed to God on their material side as has been said ad one neither can those that even on their formal side imply imperfection be attributed to Him except metaphorically and from likeness of effects as already show Q three A two ad two Q nineteen A eleven Whereas those that do not imply imperfection such as love and joy can be properly predicated of God though without attributing passion to Him as said before Q nineteen A eleven Reply Obj three An act of love always tends towards two things to the good that one wills and to the person for whom one wills it since to love a person is to wish that person good Hence inasmuch as we love ourselves we wish ourselves good and so far as possible union with that good So love is called the unitive force even in God yet without implying composition for the good that He wills for Himself is no other than Himself Who is good by His essence as above shown Q six AA one three And by the fact that anyone loves another he wills good to that other Thus he puts the other as it were in the place of himself and regards the good done to him as done to himself So far love is a binding force since it aggregates another to ourselves and refers his good to our own And then again the divine love is a binding force inasmuch as God wills good to others yet it implies no composition in God SECOND ARTICLE I Q twenty Art two Whether God Loves All Things Objection one It seems that God does not love all things For according to Dionysius Div Nom iv one love places the lover outside himself and causes him to pass as it were into the object of his love But it is not admissible to say that God is placed outside of Himself and passes into other things Therefore it is inadmissible to say that God loves things other than Himself Obj two Further the love of God is eternal But things apart from God are not from eternity except in God Therefore God does not love anything except as it exists in Himself But as existing in Him it is no other than Himself Therefore God does not love things other than Himself Obj three Further love is twofold the love namely of desire and the love of friendship Now God does not love irrational creatures with the love of desire since He needs no creature outside Himself Nor with the love of friendship since there can be no friendship with irrational creatures as the Philosopher shows Ethic viii two Therefore God does not love all things Obj four Further it is written Ps five seven Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity Now nothing is at the same time hated and loved Therefore God does not love all things On the contrary It is said Wis eleven twenty five Thou lovest all things that are and hatest none of the things which Thou hast made I answer that God loves all existing things For all existing things in so far as they exist are good since the existence of a thing is itself a good and likewise whatever perfection it possesses Now it has been shown above Q nineteen A four that God s will is the cause of all things It must needs be therefore that a thing has existence or any kind of good only inasmuch as it is willed by God To every existing thing then God wills some good Hence since to love anything is nothing else than to will good to that thing it is manifest that God loves everything that exists Yet not as we love Because since our will is not the cause of the goodness of things but is moved by it as by its object our love whereby we will good to anything is not the cause of its goodness but conversely its goodness whether real or imaginary calls forth our love by which we will that it should preserve the good it has and receive besides the good it has not and to this end we direct our actions whereas the love of God infuses and creates goodness Reply Obj one A lover is placed outside himself and made to pass into the object of his love inasmuch as he wills good to the beloved and works for that good by his providence even as he works for his own Hence Dionysius says Div Nom iv one On behalf of the truth we must make bold to say even this that He Himself the cause of all things by His abounding love and goodness is placed outside Himself by His providence for all existing things Reply Obj two Although creatures have not existed from eternity except in God yet because they have been in Him from eternity God has known them eternally in their proper natures and for that reason has loved them even as we by the images of things within us know things existing in themselves Reply Obj three Friendship cannot exist except towards rational creatures who are capable of returning love and communicating one with another in the various works of life and who may fare well or ill according to the changes of fortune and happiness even as to them is benevolence properly speaking exercised But irrational creatures cannot attain to loving God nor to any share in the intellectual and beatific life that He lives Strictly speaking therefore God does not love irrational creatures with the love of friendship but as it were with the love of desire in so far as He orders them to rational creatures and even to Himself Yet this is not because He stands in need of them but only on account of His goodness and of the services they render to us For we can desire a thing for others as well as for ourselves Reply Obj four Nothing prevents one and the same thing being loved under one aspect while it is hated under another God loves sinners in so far as they are existing natures for they have existence and have it from Him In so far as they are sinners they have not existence at all but fall short of it and this in them is not from God Hence under this aspect they are hated by Him THIRD ARTICLE I Q twenty Art three Whether God Loves All Things Equally Objection one It seems that God loves all things equally For it is said He hath equally care of all Wis six eight But God s providence over things comes from the love wherewith He loves them Therefore He loves all things equally Obj two Further the love of God is His essence But God s essence does not admit of degree neither therefore does His love He does not therefore love some things more than others Obj three Further as God s love extends to created things so do His knowledge and will extend But God is not said to know some things more than others nor will one thing more than another Neither therefore does He love some things more than others On the contrary Augustine says Tract in Joan cx God loves all things that He has made and amongst them rational creatures more and of these especially those who are members of His only begotten Son Himself I answer that Since to love a thing is to will it good in a twofold way anything may be loved more or less In one way on the part of the act of the will itself which is more or less intense In this way God does not love some things more than others because He loves all things by an act of the will that is one simple and always the same In another way on the part of the good itself that a person wills for the beloved In this way we are said to love that one more than another for whom we will a greater good though our will is not more intense In this way we must needs say that God loves some things more than others For since God s love is the cause of goodness in things as has been said A two no one thing would be better than another if God did not will greater good for one than for another Reply Obj one God is said to have equally care of all not because by His care He deals out equal good to all but because He administers all things with a like wisdom and goodness Reply Obj two This argument is based on the intensity of love on the part of the act of the will which is the divine essence But the good that God wills for His creatures is not the divine essence Therefore there is no reason why it may not vary in degree Reply Obj three To understand and to will denote the act alone and do not include in their meaning objects from the diversity of which God may be said to know or will more or less as has been said with respect to God s love FOURTH ARTICLE I Q twenty Art four Whether God Always Loves More the Better Things Objection one It seems that God does not always love more the better things For it is manifest that Christ is better than the whole human race being God and man But God loved the human race more than He loved Christ for it is said He spared not His own Son but delivered Him up for us all Rom eight thirty two Therefore God does not always love more the better things Obj two Further an angel is better than a man Hence it is said of man Thou hast made him a little less than the angels Ps eight six But God loved men more than He loved the angels for it is said Nowhere doth He take hold of the angels but of the seed of Abraham He taketh hold Heb two sixteen Therefore God does not always love more the better things Obj three Further Peter was better than John since he loved Christ more Hence the Lord knowing this to be true asked Peter saying Simon son of John lovest thou Me more than these Yet Christ loved John more than He loved Peter For as Augustine says commenting on the words Simon son of John lovest thou Me By this very mark is John distinguished from the other disciples not that He loved him only but that He loved him more than the rest Therefore God does not always love more the better things Obj four Further the innocent man is better than the repentant since repentance is as Jerome says Cap three in Isa a second plank after shipwreck But God loves the penitent more than the innocent since He rejoices over him the more For it is said I say to you that there shall be joy in heaven upon the one sinner that doth penance more than upon ninety nine just who need not penance Luke fifteen seven Therefore God does not always love more the better things Obj five Further the just man who is foreknown is better than the predestined sinner Now God loves more the predestined sinner since He wills for him a greater good life eternal Therefore God does not always love more the better things On the contrary Everything loves what is like it as appears from Ecclus thirteen nineteen Every beast loveth its like Now the better a thing is the more like is it to God Therefore the better things are more loved by God I answer that It must needs be according to what has been said before that God loves more the better things For it has been shown AA two three that God s loving one thing more than another is nothing else than His willing for that thing a greater good because God s will is the cause of goodness in things and the reason why some things are better than others is that God wills for them a greater good Hence it follows that He loves more the better things Reply Obj one God loves Christ not only more than He loves the whole human race but more than He loves the entire created universe because He willed for Him the greater good in giving Him a name that is above all names in so far as He was true God Nor did anything of His excellence diminish when God delivered Him up to death for the salvation of the human race rather did He become thereby a glorious conqueror The government was placed upon His shoulder according to Isa nine six Reply Obj two God loves the human nature assumed by the Word of God in the person of Christ more than He loves all the angels for that nature is better especially on the ground of the union with the Godhead But speaking of human nature in general and comparing it with the angelic the two are found equal in the order of grace and of glory since according to reverend twenty one seventeen the measure of a man and of an angel is the same Yet so that in this respect some angels are found nobler than some men and some men nobler than some angels But as to natural condition an angel is better than a man God therefore did not assume human nature because He loved man absolutely speaking more but because the needs of man were greater just as the master of a house may give some costly delicacy to a sick servant that he does not give to his own son in sound health Reply Obj three This doubt concerning Peter and John has been solved in various ways Augustine interprets it mystically and says that the active life signified by Peter loves God more than the contemplative signified by John because the former is more conscious of the miseries of this present life and therefore the more ardently desires to be freed from them and depart to God God he says loves more the contemplative life since He preserves it longer For it does not end as the active life does with the life of the body Some say that Peter loved Christ more in His members and therefore was loved more by Christ also for which reason He gave him the care of the Church but that John loved Christ more in Himself and so was loved more by Him on which account Christ commended His mother to his care Others say that it is uncertain which of them loved Christ more with the love of charity and uncertain also which of them God loved more and ordained to a greater degree of glory in eternal life Peter is said to have loved more in regard to a certain promptness and fervor but John to have been more loved with respect to certain marks of familiarity which Christ showed to him rather than to others on account of his youth and purity While others say that Christ loved Peter more from his more excellent gift of charity but John more from his gifts of intellect Hence absolutely speaking Peter was the better and more beloved but in a certain sense John was the better and was loved the more However it may seem presumptuous to pass judgment on these matters since the Lord and no other is the weigher of spirits Prov sixteen two Reply Obj four The penitent and the innocent are related as exceeding and exceeded For whether innocent or penitent those are the better and better loved who have most grace Other things being equal innocence is the nobler thing and the more beloved God is said to rejoice more over the penitent than over the innocent because often penitents rise from sin more cautious humble and fervent Hence Gregory commenting on these words Hom thirty four in Ev says that In battle the general loves the soldier who after flight returns and bravely pursues the enemy more than him who has never fled but has never done a brave deed Or it may be answered that gifts of grace equal in themselves are more as conferred on the penitent who deserved punishment than as conferred on the innocent to whom no punishment was due just as a hundred pounds marcoe are a greater gift to a poor man than to a king Reply Obj five Since God s will is the cause of goodness in things the goodness of one who is loved by God is to be reckoned according to the time when some good is to be given to him by divine goodness According therefore to the time when there is to be given by the divine will to the predestined sinner a greater good the sinner is better although according to some other time he is the worse because even according to some time he is neither good nor bad QUESTION twenty one THE JUSTICE AND MERCY OF GOD In Four Articles After considering the divine love we must treat of God s justice and mercy 
8742_245707_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Under this head there are four points of inquiry 
none	none	one Whether there is justice in God two Whether His justice can be called truth three Whether there is mercy in God four Whether in every work of God there are justice and mercy FIRST ARTICLE I Q twenty one Art one Whether There Is Justice in God Objection one It seems that there is not justice in God For justice is divided against temperance But temperance does not exist in God neither therefore does justice Obj two Further he who does whatsoever he wills and pleases does not work according to justice But as the Apostle says God worketh all things according to the counsel of His will Eph one eleven Therefore justice cannot be attributed to Him Obj three Further the act of justice is to pay what is due But God is no man s debtor Therefore justice does not belong to God Obj four Further whatever is in God is His essence But justice cannot belong to this For Boethius says De Hebdom Good regards the essence justice the act Therefore justice does not belong to God On the contrary It is said Ps ten eight The Lord is just and hath loved justice I answer that There are two kinds of justice The one consists in mutual giving and receiving as in buying and selling and other kinds of intercourse and exchange This the Philosopher Ethic v four calls commutative justice that directs exchange and intercourse of business This does not belong to God since as the Apostle says Who hath first given to Him and recompense shall be made him Rom eleven thirty five The other consists in distribution and is called distributive justice whereby a ruler or a steward gives to each what his rank deserves As then the proper order displayed in ruling a family or any kind of multitude evinces justice of this kind in the ruler so the order of the universe which is seen both in effects of nature and in effects of will shows forth the justice of God Hence Dionysius says Div Nom viii four We must needs see that God is truly just in seeing how He gives to all existing things what is proper to the condition of each and preserves the nature of each in the order and with the powers that properly belong to it Reply Obj one Certain of the moral virtues are concerned with the passions as temperance with concupiscence fortitude with fear and daring meekness with anger Such virtues as these can only metaphorically be attributed to God since as stated above Q twenty A one in God there are no passions nor a sensitive appetite which is as the Philosopher says Ethic iii ten the subject of those virtues On the other hand certain moral virtues are concerned with works of giving and expending such as justice liberality and magnificence and these reside not in the sensitive faculty but in the will Hence there is nothing to prevent our attributing these virtues to God although not in civil matters but in such acts as are not unbecoming to Him For as the Philosopher says Ethic x eight it would be absurd to praise God for His political virtues Reply Obj two Since good as perceived by intellect is the object of the will it is impossible for God to will anything but what His wisdom approves This is as it were His law of justice in accordance with which His will is right and just Hence what He does according to His will He does justly as we do justly what we do according to law But whereas law comes to us from some higher power God is a law unto Himself Reply Obj three To each one is due what is his own Now that which is directed to a man is said to be his own Thus the master owns the servant and not conversely for that is free which is its own cause In the word debt therefore is implied a certain exigence or necessity of the thing to which it is directed Now a twofold order has to be considered in things the one whereby one created thing is directed to another as the parts of the whole accident to substance and all things whatsoever to their end the other whereby all created things are ordered to God Thus in the divine operations debt may be regarded in two ways as due either to God or to creatures and in either way God pays what is due It is due to God that there should be fulfilled in creatures what His will and wisdom require and what manifests His goodness In this respect God s justice regards what befits Him inasmuch as He renders to Himself what is due to Himself It is also due to a created thing that it should possess what is ordered to it thus it is due to man to have hands and that other animals should serve him Thus also God exercises justice when He gives to each thing what is due to it by its nature and condition This debt however is derived from the former since what is due to each thing is due to it as ordered to it according to the divine wisdom And although God in this way pays each thing its due yet He Himself is not the debtor since He is not directed to other things but rather other things to Him Justice therefore in God is sometimes spoken of as the fitting accompaniment of His goodness sometimes as the reward of merit Anselm touches on either view where he says Prosolog ten When Thou dost punish the wicked it is just since it agrees with their deserts and when Thou dost spare the wicked it is also just since it befits Thy goodness Reply Obj four Although justice regards act this does not prevent its being the essence of God since even that which is of the essence of a thing may be the principle of action But good does not always regard act since a thing is called good not merely with respect to act but also as regards perfection in its essence For this reason it is said De Hebdom that the good is related to the just as the general to the special SECOND ARTICLE I Q twenty one Art two Whether the Justice of God Is Truth Objection one It seems that the justice of God is not truth For justice resides in the will since as Anselm says Dial Verit thirteen it is a rectitude of the will whereas truth resides in the intellect as the Philosopher says Metaph vi Ethic vi twenty six Therefore justice does not appertain to truth Obj two Further according to the Philosopher Ethic iv seven truth is a virtue distinct from justice Truth therefore does not appertain to the idea of justice On the contrary it is said Ps eighty four eleven Mercy and truth have met each other where truth stands for justice I answer that Truth consists in the equation of mind and thing as said above Q sixteen A one Now the mind that is the cause of the thing is related to it as its rule and measure whereas the converse is the case with the mind that receives its knowledge from things When therefore things are the measure and rule of the mind truth consists in the equation of the mind to the thing as happens in ourselves For according as a thing is or is not our thoughts or our words about it are true or false But when the mind is the rule or measure of things truth consists in the equation of the thing to the mind just as the work of an artist is said to be true when it is in accordance with his art Now as works of art are related to art so are works of justice related to the law with which they accord Therefore God s justice which establishes things in the order conformable to the rule of His wisdom which is the law of His justice is suitably called truth Thus we also in human affairs speak of the truth of justice Reply Obj one Justice as to the law that governs resides in the reason or intellect but as to the command whereby our actions are governed according to the law it resides in the will Reply Obj two The truth of which the Philosopher is speaking in this passage is that virtue whereby a man shows himself in word and deed such as he really is Thus it consists in the conformity of the sign with the thing signified and not in that of the effect with its cause and rule as has been said regarding the truth of justice THIRD ARTICLE I Q twenty one Art three Whether Mercy Can Be Attributed to God Objection one It seems that mercy cannot be attributed to God For mercy is a kind of sorrow as Damascene says De Fide Orth ii fourteen But there is no sorrow in God and therefore there is no mercy in Him Obj two Further mercy is a relaxation of justice But God cannot remit what appertains to His justice For it is said two Tim two thirteen If we believe not He continueth faithful He cannot deny Himself But He would deny Himself as a gloss says if He should deny His words Therefore mercy is not becoming to God On the contrary it is said Ps one hundred ten four He is a merciful and gracious Lord I answer that Mercy is especially to be attributed to God as seen in its effect but not as an affection of passion In proof of which it must be considered that a person is said to be merciful misericors as being so to speak sorrowful at heart miserum cor being affected with sorrow at the misery of another as though it were his own Hence it follows that he endeavors to dispel the misery of this other as if it were his and this is the effect of mercy To sorrow therefore over the misery of others belongs not to God but it does most properly belong to Him to dispel that misery whatever be the defect we call by that name Now defects are not removed except by the perfection of some kind of goodness and the primary source of goodness is God as shown above Q six A four It must however be considered that to bestow perfections appertains not only to the divine goodness but also to His justice liberality and mercy yet under different aspects The communicating of perfections absolutely considered appertains to goodness as shown above Q six AA one four in so far as perfections are given to things in proportion the bestowal of them belongs to justice as has been already said A one in so far as God does not bestow them for His own use but only on account of His goodness it belongs to liberality in so far as perfections given to things by God expel defects it belongs to mercy Reply Obj one This argument is based on mercy regarded as an affection of passion Reply Obj two God acts mercifully not indeed by going against His justice but by doing something more than justice thus a man who pays another two hundred pieces of money though owing him only one hundred does nothing against justice but acts liberally or mercifully The case is the same with one who pardons an offence committed against him for in remitting it he may be said to bestow a gift Hence the Apostle calls remission a forgiving Forgive one another as Christ has forgiven you Eph four thirty two Hence it is clear that mercy does not destroy justice but in a sense is the fulness thereof And thus it is said Mercy exalteth itself above judgement James two thirteen FOURTH ARTICLE I Q twenty one Art four Whether in Every Work of God There Are Mercy and Justice Objection one It seems that not in every work of God are mercy and justice For some works of God are attributed to mercy as the justification of the ungodly and others to justice as the damnation of the wicked Hence it is said Judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy James two thirteen Therefore not in every work of God do mercy and justice appear Obj two Further the Apostle attributes the conversion of the Jews to justice and truth but that of the Gentiles to mercy Rom fifteen Therefore not in every work of God are justice and mercy Obj three Further many just persons are afflicted in this world which is unjust Therefore not in every work of God are justice and mercy Obj four Further it is the part of justice to pay what is due but of mercy to relieve misery Thus both justice and mercy presuppose something in their works whereas creation presupposes nothing Therefore in creation neither mercy nor justice is found On the contrary It is said Ps twenty four ten All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth I answer that Mercy and truth are necessarily found in all God s works if mercy be taken to mean the removal of any kind of defect Not every defect however can properly be called a misery but only defect in a rational nature whose lot is to be happy for misery is opposed to happiness For this necessity there is a reason because since a debt paid according to the divine justice is one due either to God or to some creature neither the one nor the other can be lacking in any work of God because God can do nothing that is not in accord with His wisdom and goodness and it is in this sense as we have said that anything is due to God Likewise whatever is done by Him in created things is done according to proper order and proportion wherein consists the idea of justice Thus justice must exist in all God s works Now the work of divine justice always presupposes the work of mercy and is founded thereupon For nothing is due to creatures except for something pre existing in them or foreknown Again if this is due to a creature it must be due on account of something that precedes And since we cannot go on to infinity we must come to something that depends only on the goodness of the divine will which is the ultimate end We may say for instance that to possess hands is due to man on account of his rational soul and his rational soul is due to him that he may be man and his being man is on account of the divine goodness So in every work of God viewed at its primary source there appears mercy In all that follows the power of mercy remains and works indeed with even greater force as the influence of the first cause is more intense than that of second causes For this reason does God out of abundance of His goodness bestow upon creatures what is due to them more bountifully than is proportionate to their deserts since less would suffice for preserving the order of justice than what the divine goodness confers because between creatures and God s goodness there can be no proportion Reply Obj one Certain works are attributed to justice and certain others to mercy because in some justice appears more forcibly and in others mercy Even in the damnation of the reprobate mercy is seen which though it does not totally remit yet somewhat alleviates in punishing short of what is deserved In the justification of the ungodly justice is seen when God remits sins on account of love though He Himself has mercifully infused that love So we read of Magdalen Many sins are forgiven her because she hath loved much Luke seven forty seven Reply Obj two God s justice and mercy appear both in the conversion of the Jews and of the Gentiles But an aspect of justice appears in the conversion of the Jews which is not seen in the conversion of the Gentiles inasmuch as the Jews were saved on account of the promises made to the fathers Reply Obj three Justice and mercy appear in the punishment of the just in this world since by afflictions lesser faults are cleansed in them and they are the more raised up from earthly affections to God As to this Gregory says Moral xxvi nine The evils that press on us in this world force us to go to God Reply Obj four Although creation presupposes nothing in the universe yet it does presuppose something in the knowledge of God In this way too the idea of justice is preserved in creation by the production of beings in a manner that accords with the divine wisdom and goodness And the idea of mercy also is preserved in the change of creatures from non existence to existence QUESTION twenty two THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD In Four Articles Having considered all that relates to the will absolutely we must now proceed to those things which have relation to both the intellect and the will namely providence in respect to all created things predestination and reprobation and all that is connected with these acts in respect especially of man as regards his eternal salvation For in the science of morals after the moral virtues themselves comes the consideration of prudence to which providence would seem to belong Concerning God s providence there are four points of inquiry one Whether providence is suitably assigned to God two Whether everything comes under divine providence three Whether divine providence is immediately concerned with all things four Whether divine providence imposes any necessity upon things foreseen FIRST ARTICLE I Q twenty two Art one Whether Providence Can Suitably Be Attributed to God Objection one It seems that providence is not becoming to God For providence according to Tully De Invent ii is a part of prudence But prudence since according to the Philosopher Ethic vi five nine eighteen it gives good counsel cannot belong to God Who never has any doubt for which He should take counsel Therefore providence cannot belong to God Obj two Further whatever is in God is eternal But providence is not anything eternal for it is concerned with existing things that are not eternal according to Damascene De Fide Orth ii twenty nine Therefore there is no providence in God Obj three Further there is nothing composite in God But providence seems to be something composite because it includes both the intellect and the will Therefore providence is not in God On the contrary It is said Wis fourteen three But Thou Father governest all things by providence Vulg But Thy providence O Father governeth it I answer that It is necessary to attribute providence to God For all the good that is in created things has been created by God as was shown above Q six A four In created things good is found not only as regards their substance but also as regards their order towards an end and especially their last end which as was said above is the divine goodness Q twenty one A four This good of order existing in things created is itself created by God Since however God is the cause of things by His intellect and thus it behooves that the type of every effect should pre exist in Him as is clear from what has gone before Q nineteen A four it is necessary that the type of the order of things towards their end should pre exist in the divine mind and the type of things ordered towards an end is properly speaking providence For it is the chief part of prudence to which two other parts are directed namely remembrance of the past and understanding of the present inasmuch as from the remembrance of what is past and the understanding of what is present we gather how to provide for the future Now it belongs to prudence according to the Philosopher Ethic vi twelve to direct other things towards an end whether in regard to oneself as for instance a man is said to be prudent who orders well his acts towards the end of life or in regard to others subject to him in a family city or kingdom in which sense it is said Matt twenty four forty five a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath appointed over his family In this way prudence or providence may suitably be attributed to God For in God Himself there can be nothing ordered towards an end since He is the last end This type of order in things towards an end is therefore in God called providence Whence Boethius says De Consol iv six that Providence is the divine type itself seated in the Supreme Ruler which disposeth all things which disposition may refer either to the type of the order of things towards an end or to the type of the order of parts in the whole Reply Obj one According to the Philosopher Ethic vi nine ten Prudence is what strictly speaking commands all that ebulia has rightly counselled and synesis rightly judged Cf I II Q fifty seven A six Whence though to take counsel may not be fitting to God from the fact that counsel is an inquiry into matters that are doubtful nevertheless to give a command as to the ordering of things towards an end the right reason of which He possesses does belong to God according to Ps one hundred forty eight six He hath made a decree and it shall not pass away In this manner both prudence and providence belong to God Although at the same time it may be said that the very reason of things to be done is called counsel in God not because of any inquiry necessitated but from the certitude of the knowledge to which those who take counsel come by inquiry Whence it is said Who worketh all things according to the counsel of His will Eph one eleven Reply Obj two Two things pertain to the care of providence namely the reason of order which is called providence and disposition and the execution of order which is termed government Of these the first is eternal and the second is temporal Reply Obj three Providence resides in the intellect but presupposes the act of willing the end Nobody gives a precept about things done for an end unless he will that end Hence prudence presupposes the moral virtues by means of which the appetitive faculty is directed towards good as the Philosopher says Even if Providence has to do with the divine will and intellect equally this would not affect the divine simplicity since in God both the will and intellect are one and the same thing as we have said above Q nineteen SECOND ARTICLE I Q twenty two Art two Whether Everything Is Subject to the Providence of God Objection one It seems that everything is not subject to divine providence For nothing foreseen can happen by chance If then everything was foreseen by God nothing would happen by chance And thus hazard and luck would disappear which is against common opinion Obj two Further a wise provider excludes any defect or evil as far as he can from those over whom he has a care But we see many evils existing Either then God cannot hinder these and thus is not omnipotent or else He does not have care for everything Obj three Further whatever happens of necessity does not require providence or prudence Hence according to the Philosopher Ethic vi five nine ten eleven Prudence is the right reason of things contingent concerning which there is counsel and choice Since then many things happen from necessity everything cannot be subject to providence Obj four Further whatsoever is left to itself cannot be subject to the providence of a governor But men are left to themselves by God in accordance with the words God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel Ecclus fifteen fourteen And particularly in reference to the wicked I let them go according to the desires of their heart Ps eighty thirteen Everything therefore cannot be subject to divine providence Obj five Further the Apostle says one Cor nine nine God doth not care for oxen Vulg Doth God take care for oxen and we may say the same of other irrational creatures Thus everything cannot be under the care of divine providence On the contrary It is said of Divine Wisdom She reacheth from end to end mightily and ordereth all things sweetly Wis eight one I answer that Certain persons totally denied the existence of providence as Democritus and the Epicureans maintaining that the world was made by chance Others taught that incorruptible things only were subject to providence and corruptible things not in their individual selves but only according to their species for in this respect they are incorruptible They are represented as saying Job twenty two fourteen The clouds are His covert and He doth not consider our things and He walketh about the poles of heaven Rabbi Moses however excluded men from the generality of things corruptible on account of the excellence of the intellect which they possess but in reference to all else that suffers corruption he adhered to the opinion of the others We must say however that all things are subject to divine providence not only in general but even in their own individual selves This is made evident thus For since every agent acts for an end the ordering of effects towards that end extends as far as the causality of the first agent extends Whence it happens that in the effects of an agent something takes place which has no reference towards the end because the effect comes from a cause other than and outside the intention of the agent But the causality of God Who is the first agent extends to all being not only as to constituent principles of species but also as to the individualizing principles not only of things incorruptible but also of things corruptible Hence all things that exist in whatsoever manner are necessarily directed by God towards some end as the Apostle says Those things that are of God are well ordered Vulg Those powers that are are ordained of God Quae autem sunt a Deo ordinatae sunt saint Thomas often quotes this passage and invariably reads Quae a Deo sunt ordinata sunt Rom thirteen one Since therefore as the providence of God is nothing less than the type of the order of things towards an end as we have said it necessarily follows that all things inasmuch as they participate in existence must likewise be subject to divine providence It has also been shown Q fourteen AA six eleven that God knows all things both universal and particular And since His knowledge may be compared to the things themselves as the knowledge of art to the objects of art all things must of necessity come under His ordering as all things wrought by art are subject to the ordering of that art Reply Obj one There is a difference between universal and particular causes A thing can escape the order of a particular cause but not the order of a universal cause For nothing escapes the order of a particular cause except through the intervention and hindrance of some other particular cause as for instance wood may be prevented from burning by the action of water Since then all particular causes are included under the universal cause it could not be that any effect should take place outside the range of that universal cause So far then as an effect escapes the order of a particular cause it is said to be casual or fortuitous in respect to that cause but if we regard the universal cause outside whose range no effect can happen it is said to be foreseen Thus for instance the meeting of two servants although to them it appears a chance circumstance has been fully foreseen by their master who has purposely sent them to meet at the one place in such a way that the one knows not about the other Reply Obj two It is otherwise with one who has care of a particular thing and one whose providence is universal because a particular provider excludes all defects from what is subject to his care as far as he can whereas one who provides universally allows some little defect to remain lest the good of the whole should be hindered Hence corruption and defects in natural things are said to be contrary to some particular nature yet they are in keeping with the plan of universal nature inasmuch as the defect in one thing yields to the good of another or even to the universal good for the corruption of one is the generation of another and through this it is that a species is kept in existence Since God then provides universally for all being it belongs to His providence to permit certain defects in particular effects that the perfect good of the universe may not be hindered for if all evil were prevented much good would be absent from the universe A lion would cease to live if there were no slaying of animals and there would be no patience of martyrs if there were no tyrannical persecution Thus Augustine says Enchiridion two Almighty God would in no wise permit evil to exist in His works unless He were so almighty and so good as to produce good even from evil It would appear that it was on account of these two arguments to which we have just replied that some were persuaded to consider corruptible things e g casual and evil things as removed from the care of divine providence Reply Obj three Man is not the author of nature but he uses natural things in applying art and virtue to his own use Hence human providence does not reach to that which takes place in nature from necessity but divine providence extends thus far since God is the author of nature Apparently it was this argument that moved those who withdrew the course of nature from the care of divine providence attributing it rather to the necessity of matter as Democritus and others of the ancients Reply Obj four When it is said that God left man to himself this does not mean that man is exempt from divine providence but merely that he has not a prefixed operating force determined to only the one effect as in the case of natural things which are only acted upon as though directed by another towards an end and do not act of themselves as if they directed themselves towards an end like rational creatures through the possession of free will by which these are able to take counsel and make a choice Hence it is significantly said In the hand of his own counsel But since the very act of free will is traced to God as to a cause it necessarily follows that everything happening from the exercise of free will must be subject to divine providence For human providence is included under the providence of God as a particular under a universal cause God however extends His providence over the just in a certain more excellent way than over the wicked inasmuch as He prevents anything happening which would impede their final salvation For to them that love God all things work together unto good Rom eight twenty eight But from the fact that He does not restrain the wicked from the evil of sin He is said to abandon them not that He altogether withdraws His providence from them otherwise they would return to nothing if they were not preserved in existence by His providence This was the reason that had weight with Tully who withdrew from the care of divine providence human affairs concerning which we take counsel Reply Obj five Since a rational creature has through its free will control over its actions as was said above Q nineteen A ten it is subject to divine providence in an especial manner so that something is imputed to it as a fault or as a merit and there is given it accordingly something by way of punishment or reward In this way the Apostle withdraws oxen from the care of God not however that individual irrational creatures escape the care of divine providence as was the opinion of the Rabbi Moses THIRD ARTICLE I Q twenty two Art three Whether God Has Immediate Providence Over Everything Objection one It seems that God has not immediate providence over all things For whatever is contained in the notion of dignity must be attributed to God But it belongs to the dignity of a king that he should have ministers through whose mediation he provides for his subjects Therefore much less has God Himself immediate providence over all things Obj two Further it belongs to providence to order all things to an end Now the end of everything is its perfection and its good But it appertains to every cause to direct its effect to good wherefore every active cause is a cause of the effect of providence If therefore God were to have immediate providence over all things all secondary causes would be withdrawn Obj three Further Augustine says Enchiridion seventeen that It is better to be ignorant of some things than to know them for example vile things and the Philosopher says the same Metaph xii fifty one But whatever is better must be assigned to God Therefore He has not immediate providence over bad and vile things On the contrary It is said Job thirty four thirteen What other hath He appointed over the earth or whom hath He set over the world which He made On which passage Gregory says Moral xxiv twenty Himself He ruleth the world which He Himself hath made I answer that Two things belong to providence namely the type of the order of things foreordained towards an end and the execution of this order which is called government As regards the first of these God has immediate providence over everything because He has in His intellect the types of everything even the smallest and whatsoever causes He assigns to certain effects He gives them the power to produce those effects Whence it must be that He has beforehand the type of those effects in His mind As to the second there are certain intermediaries of God s providence for He governs things inferior by superior not on account of any defect in His power but by reason of the abundance of His goodness so that the dignity of causality is imparted even to creatures Thus Plato s opinion as narrated by Gregory of Nyssa De Provid viii three is exploded He taught a threefold providence First one which belongs to the supreme Deity Who first and foremost has provision over spiritual things and thus over the whole world as regards genus species and universal causes The second providence which is over the individuals of all that can be generated and corrupted he attributed to the divinities who circulate in the heavens that is certain separate substances which move corporeal things in a circular direction The third providence over human affairs he assigned to demons whom the Platonic philosophers placed between us and the gods as Augustine tells us De Civ Dei one two viii fourteen Reply Obj one It pertains to a king s dignity to have ministers who execute his providence But the fact that he has not the plan of those things which are done by them arises from a deficiency in himself For every operative science is the more perfect the more it considers the particular things with which its action is concerned Reply Obj two God s immediate provision over everything does not exclude the action of secondary causes which are the executors of His order as was said above Q nineteen AA five eight Reply Obj three It is better for us not to know low and vile things because by them we are impeded in our knowledge of what is better and higher for we cannot understand many things simultaneously because the thought of evil sometimes perverts the will towards evil This does not hold with God Who sees everything simultaneously at one glance and whose will cannot turn in the direction of evil FOURTH ARTICLE I Q twenty two Art four Whether Providence Imposes Any Necessity on Things Foreseen Objection one It seems that divine providence imposes necessity upon things foreseen For every effect that has a per se cause either present or past which it necessarily follows happens from necessity as the Philosopher proves Metaph vi seven But the providence of God since it is eternal pre exists and the effect flows from it of necessity for divine providence cannot be frustrated Therefore divine providence imposes a necessity upon things foreseen Obj two Further every provider makes his work as stable as he can lest it should fail But God is most powerful Therefore He assigns the stability of necessity to things provided Obj three Further Boethius says De Consol iv six Fate from the immutable source of providence binds together human acts and fortunes by the indissoluble connection of causes It seems therefore that providence imposes necessity upon things foreseen On the contrary Dionysius says that Div Nom iv twenty three to corrupt nature is not the work of providence But it is in the nature of some things to be contingent Divine providence does not therefore impose any necessity upon things so as to destroy their contingency I answer that Divine providence imposes necessity upon some things not upon all as some formerly believed For to providence it belongs to order things towards an end Now after the divine goodness which is an extrinsic end to all things the principal good in things themselves is the perfection of the universe which would not be were not all grades of being found in things Whence it pertains to divine providence to produce every grade of being And thus it has prepared for some things necessary causes so that they happen of necessity for others contingent causes that they may happen by contingency according to the nature of their proximate causes Reply Obj one The effect of divine providence is not only that things should happen somehow but that they should happen either by necessity or by contingency Therefore whatsoever divine providence ordains to happen infallibly and of necessity happens infallibly and of necessity and that happens from contingency which the plan of divine providence conceives to happen from contingency Reply Obj two The order of divine providence is unchangeable and certain so far as all things foreseen happen as they have been foreseen whether from necessity or from contingency Reply Obj three That indissolubility and unchangeableness of which Boethius speaks pertain to the certainty of providence which fails not to produce its effect and that in the way foreseen but they do not pertain to the necessity of the effects We must remember that properly speaking necessary and contingent are consequent upon being as such Hence the mode both of necessity and of contingency falls under the foresight of God who provides universally for all being not under the foresight of causes that provide only for some particular order of things QUESTION twenty three OF PREDESTINATION In Eight Articles After consideration of divine providence we must treat of predestination and the book of life Concerning predestination there are eight points of inquiry one Whether predestination is suitably attributed to God two What is predestination and whether it places anything in the predestined three Whether to God belongs the reprobation of some men four On the comparison of predestination to election whether that is to say the predestined are chosen five Whether merits are the cause or reason of predestination or reprobation or election six of the certainty of predestination whether the predestined will infallibly be saved seven Whether the number of the predestined is certain eight Whether predestination can be furthered by the prayers of the saints FIRST ARTICLE I Q twenty three Art one Whether Men Are Predestined by God Objection one It seems that men are not predestined by God for Damascene says De Fide Orth ii thirty It must be borne in mind that God foreknows but does not predetermine everything since He foreknows all that is in us but does not predetermine it all But human merit and demerit are in us forasmuch as we are the masters of our own acts by free will All that pertains therefore to merit or demerit is not predestined by God and thus man s predestination is done away Obj two Further all creatures are directed to their end by divine providence as was said above Q twenty two AA one two But other creatures are not said to be predestined by God Therefore neither are men Obj three Further the angels are capable of beatitude as well as men But predestination is not suitable to angels since in them there never was any unhappiness miseria for predestination as Augustine says De praedest sanct seventeen is the purpose to take pity miserendi See Q twenty two A three Therefore men are not predestined Obj four Further the benefits God confers upon men are revealed by the Holy Ghost to holy men according to the saying of the Apostle one Cor two twelve Now we have received not the spirit of this world but the Spirit that is of God that we may know the things that are given us from God Therefore if man were predestined by God since predestination is a benefit from God his predestination would be made known to each predestined which is clearly false On the contrary It is written Rom eight thirty Whom He predestined them He also called I answer that It is fitting that God should predestine men For all things are subject to His providence as was shown above Q twenty two A two Now it belongs to providence to direct things towards their end as was also said Q twenty two AA one two The end towards which created things are directed by God is twofold one which exceeds all proportion and faculty of created nature and this end is life eternal that consists in seeing God which is above the nature of every creature as shown above Q twelve A four The other end however is proportionate to created nature to which end created being can attain according to the power of its nature Now if a thing cannot attain to something by the power of its nature it must be directed thereto by another thus an arrow is directed by the archer towards a mark Hence properly speaking a rational creature capable of eternal life is led towards it directed as it were by God The reason of that direction pre exists in God as in Him is the type of the order of all things towards an end which we proved above to be providence Now the type in the mind of the doer of something to be done is a kind of pre existence in him of the thing to be done Hence the type of the aforesaid direction of a rational creature towards the end of life eternal is called predestination For to destine is to direct or send Thus it is clear that predestination as regards its objects is a part of providence Reply Obj one Damascene calls predestination an imposition of necessity after the manner of natural things which are predetermined towards one end This is clear from his adding He does not will malice nor does He compel virtue Whence predestination is not excluded by Him Reply Obj two Irrational creatures are not capable of that end which exceeds the faculty of human nature Whence they cannot be properly said to be predestined although improperly the term is used in respect of any other end Reply Obj three Predestination applies to angels just as it does to men although they have never been unhappy For movement does not take its species from the term wherefrom but from the term whereto Because it matters nothing in respect of the notion of making white whether he who is made white was before black yellow or red Likewise it matters nothing in respect of the notion of predestination whether one is predestined to life eternal from the state of misery or not Although it may be said that every conferring of good above that which is due pertains to mercy as was shown previously Q twenty one AA three four Reply Obj four Even if by a special privilege their predestination were revealed to some it is not fitting that it should be revealed to everyone because if so those who were not predestined would despair and security would beget negligence in the predestined SECOND ARTICLE I Q twenty three Art two Whether Predestination Places Anything in the Predestined Objection one It seems that predestination does place something in the predestined For every action of itself causes passion If therefore predestination is action in God predestination must be passion in the predestined Obj two Further Origen says on the text He who was predestined et cetera Rom one four Predestination is of one who is not destination of one who is And Augustine says De Praed Sanct What is predestination but the destination of one who is Therefore predestination is only of one who actually exists and it thus places something in the predestined Obj three Further preparation is something in the thing prepared But predestination is the preparation of God s benefits as Augustine says De Praed Sanct ii fourteen Therefore predestination is something in the predestined Obj four Further nothing temporal enters into the definition of eternity But grace which is something temporal is found in the definition of predestination For predestination is the preparation of grace in the present and of glory in the future Therefore predestination is not anything eternal So it must needs be that it is in the predestined and not in God for whatever is in Him is eternal On the contrary Augustine says De Praed Sanct ii fourteen that predestination is the foreknowledge of God s benefits But foreknowledge is not in the things foreknown but in the person who foreknows them Therefore predestination is in the one who predestines and not in the predestined I answer that Predestination is not anything in the predestined but only in the person who predestines We have said above that predestination is a part of providence Now providence is not anything in the things provided for but is a type in the mind of the provider as was proved above Q twenty two A one But the execution of providence which is called government is in a passive way in the thing governed and in an active way in the governor Whence it is clear that predestination is a kind of type of the ordering of some persons towards eternal salvation existing in the divine mind The execution however of this order is in a passive way in the predestined but actively in God The execution of predestination is the calling and magnification according to the Apostle Rom eight thirty Whom He predestined them He also called and whom He called them He also magnified Vulg justified Reply Obj one Actions passing out to external matter imply of themselves passion for example the actions of warming and cutting but not so actions remaining in the agent as understanding and willing as said above Q fourteen A two Q eighteen A three ad one Predestination is an action of this latter class Wherefore it does not put anything in the predestined But its execution which passes out to external things has an effect in them Reply Obj two Destination sometimes denotes a real mission of someone to a given end thus destination can only be said of someone actually existing It is taken however in another sense for a mission which a person conceives in the mind and in this manner we are said to destine a thing which we firmly propose in our mind In this latter way it is said that Eleazar determined not to do any unlawful things for the love of life two Macc six twenty Thus destination can be of a thing which does not exist Predestination however by reason of the antecedent nature it implies can be attributed to a thing which does not actually exist in whatsoever way destination is accepted Reply Obj three Preparation is twofold of the patient in respect to passion and this is in the thing prepared and of the agent to action and this is in the agent Such a preparation is predestination and as an agent by intellect is said to prepare itself to act accordingly as it preconceives the idea of what is to be done Thus God from all eternity prepared by predestination conceiving the idea of the order of some towards salvation Reply Obj four Grace does not come into the definition of predestination as something belonging to its essence but inasmuch as predestination implies a relation to grace as of cause to effect and of act to its object Whence it does not follow that predestination is anything temporal THIRD ARTICLE I Q twenty three Art three Whether God Reprobates Any Man Objection one It seems that God reprobates no man For nobody reprobates what he loves But God loves every man according to Wis eleven twenty five Thou lovest all things that are and Thou hatest none of the things Thou hast made Therefore God reprobates no man Obj two Further if God reprobates any man it would be necessary for reprobation to have the same relation to the reprobates as predestination has to the predestined But predestination is the cause of the salvation of the predestined Therefore reprobation will likewise be the cause of the loss of the reprobate But this false For it is said Osee thirteen nine Destruction is thy own O Israel Thy help is only in Me God does not then reprobate any man Obj three Further to no one ought anything be imputed which he cannot avoid But if God reprobates anyone that one must perish For it is said Eccles seven fourteen Consider the works of God that no man can correct whom He hath despised Therefore it could not be imputed to any man were he to perish But this is false Therefore God does not reprobate anyone On the contrary It is said Malachi one twenty three I have loved Jacob but have hated Esau I answer that God does reprobate some For it was said above A one that predestination is a part of providence To providence however it belongs to permit certain defects in those things which are subject to providence as was said above Q twenty two A two Thus as men are ordained to eternal life through the providence of God it likewise is part of that providence to permit some to fall away from that end this is called reprobation Thus as predestination is a part of providence in regard to those ordained to eternal salvation so reprobation is a part of providence in regard to those who turn aside from that end Hence reprobation implies not only foreknowledge but also something more as does providence as was said above Q twenty two A one Therefore as predestination includes the will to confer grace and glory so also reprobation includes the will to permit a person to fall into sin and to impose the punishment of damnation on account of that sin Reply Obj one God loves all men and all creatures inasmuch as He wishes them all some good but He does not wish every good to them all So far therefore as He does not wish this particular good namely eternal life He is said to hate or reprobated them Reply Obj two Reprobation differs in its causality from predestination This latter is the cause both of what is expected in the future life by the predestined namely glory and of what is received in this life namely grace Reprobation however is not the cause of what is in the present namely sin but it is the cause of abandonment by God It is the cause however of what is assigned in the future namely eternal punishment But guilt proceeds from the free will of the person who is reprobated and deserted by grace In this way the word of the prophet is true namely Destruction is thy own O Israel Reply Obj three Reprobation by God does not take anything away from the power of the person reprobated Hence when it is said that the reprobated cannot obtain grace this must not be understood as implying absolute impossibility but only conditional impossibility as was said above Q nineteen A three that the predestined must necessarily be saved yet a conditional necessity which does not do away with the liberty of choice Whence although anyone reprobated by God cannot acquire grace nevertheless that he falls into this or that particular sin comes from the use of his free will Hence it is rightly imputed to him as guilt FOURTH ARTICLE I Q twenty three Art four Whether the Predestined Are Chosen by God Eligantur Objection one It seems that the predestined are not chosen by God For Dionysius says Div Nom iv one that as the corporeal sun sends his rays upon all without selection so does God His goodness But the goodness of God is communicated to some in an especial manner through a participation of grace and glory Therefore God without any selection communicates His grace and glory and this belongs to predestination Obj two Further election is of things that exist But predestination from all eternity is also of things which do not exist Therefore some are predestined without election Obj three Further election implies some discrimination Now God wills all men to be saved one Tim two four Therefore predestination which ordains men towards eternal salvation is without election On the contrary It is said Eph one four He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world I answer that Predestination presupposes election in the order of reason and election presupposes love The reason of this is that predestination as stated above A one is a part of providence Now providence as also prudence is the plan existing in the intellect directing the ordering of some things towards an end as was proved above Q twenty two A two But nothing is directed towards an end unless the will for that end already exists Whence the predestination of some to eternal salvation presupposes in the order of reason that God wills their salvation and to this belong both election and love love inasmuch as He wills them this particular good of eternal salvation since to love is to wish well to anyone as stated above Q twenty AA two three election inasmuch as He wills this good to some in preference to others since He reprobates some as stated above A three Election and love however are differently ordered in God and in ourselves because in us the will in loving does not cause good but we are incited to love by the good which already exists and therefore we choose someone to love and so election in us precedes love In God however it is the reverse For His will by which in loving He wishes good to someone is the cause of that good possessed by some in preference to others Thus it is clear that love precedes election in the order of reason and election precedes predestination Whence all the predestinate are objects of election and love Reply Obj one If the communication of the divine goodness in general be considered God communicates His goodness without election inasmuch as there is nothing which does not in some way share in His goodness as we said above Q six A four But if we consider the communication of this or that particular good He does not allot it without election since He gives certain goods to some men which He does not give to others Thus in the conferring of grace and glory election is implied Reply Obj two When the will of the person choosing is incited to make a choice by the good already pre existing in the object chosen the choice must needs be of those things which already exist as happens in our choice In God it is otherwise as was said above Q twenty A two Thus as Augustine says De Verb Ap Serm eleven Those are chosen by God who do not exist yet He does not err in His choice Reply Obj three God wills all men to be saved by His antecedent will which is to will not simply but relatively and not by His consequent will which is to will simply FIFTH ARTICLE I Q twenty three Art five Whether the Foreknowledge of Merits Is the Cause of Predestination Objection one It seems that foreknowledge of merits is the cause of predestination For the Apostle says Rom eight twenty nine Whom He foreknew He also predestined Again a gloss of Ambrose on Rom nine fifteen I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy says I will give mercy to him who I foresee will turn to Me with his whole heart Therefore it seems the foreknowledge of merits is the cause of predestination Obj two Further Divine predestination includes the divine will which by no means can be irrational since predestination is the purpose to have mercy as Augustine says De Praed Sanct ii seventeen But there can be no other reason for predestination than the foreknowledge of merits Therefore it must be the cause of reason of predestination Obj three Further There is no injustice in God Rom nine fourteen Now it would seem unjust that unequal things be given to equals But all men are equal as regards both nature and original sin and inequality in them arises from the merits or demerits of their actions Therefore God does not prepare unequal things for men by predestinating and reprobating unless through the foreknowledge of their merits and demerits On the contrary The Apostle says Titus three five Not by works of justice which we have done but according to His mercy He saved us But as He saved us so He predestined that we should be saved Therefore foreknowledge of merits is not the cause or reason of predestination I answer that Since predestination includes will as was said above A four the reason of predestination must be sought for in the same way as was the reason of the will of God Now it was shown above Q nineteen A five that we cannot assign any cause of the divine will on the part of the act of willing but a reason can be found on the part of the things willed inasmuch as God wills one thing on account of something else Wherefore nobody has been so insane as to say that merit is the cause of divine predestination as regards the act of the predestinator But this is the question whether as regards the effect predestination has any cause or what comes to the same thing whether God pre ordained that He would give the effect of predestination to anyone on account of any merits Accordingly there were some who held that the effect of predestination was pre ordained for some on account of pre existing merits in a former life This was the opinion of Origen who thought that the souls of men were created in the beginning and according to the diversity of their works different states were assigned to them in this world when united with the body The Apostle however rebuts this opinion where he says Rom nine eleven twelve For when they were not yet born nor had done any good or evil not of works but of Him that calleth it was said of her The elder shall serve the younger Others said that pre existing merits in this life are the reason and cause of the effect of predestination For the Pelagians taught that the beginning of doing well came from us and the consummation from God so that it came about that the effect of predestination was granted to one and not to another because the one made a beginning by preparing whereas the other did not But against this we have the saying of the Apostle two Cor three five that we are not sufficient to think anything of ourselves as of ourselves Now no principle of action can be imagined previous to the act of thinking Wherefore it cannot be said that anything begun in us can be the reason of the effect of predestination And so others said that merits following the effect of predestination are the reason of predestination giving us to understand that God gives grace to a person and pre ordains that He will give it because He knows beforehand that He will make good use of that grace as if a king were to give a horse to a soldier because he knows he will make good use of it But these seem to have drawn a distinction between that which flows from grace and that which flows from free will as if the same thing cannot come from both It is however manifest that what is of grace is the effect of predestination and this cannot be considered as the reason of predestination since it is contained in the notion of predestination Therefore if anything else in us be the reason of predestination it will outside the effect of predestination Now there is no distinction between what flows from free will and what is of predestination as there is not distinction between what flows from a secondary cause and from a first cause For the providence of God produces effects through the operation of secondary causes as was above shown Q twenty two A three Wherefore that which flows from free will is also of predestination We must say therefore that the effect of predestination may be considered in a twofold light in one way in particular and thus there is no reason why one effect of predestination should not be the reason or cause of another a subsequent effect being the reason of a previous effect as its final cause and the previous effect being the reason of the subsequent as its meritorious cause which is reduced to the disposition of the matter Thus we might say that God pre ordained to give glory on account of merit and that He pre ordained to give grace to merit glory In another way the effect of predestination may be considered in general Thus it is impossible that the whole of the effect of predestination in general should have any cause as coming from us because whatsoever is in man disposing him towards salvation is all included under the effect of predestination even the preparation for grace For neither does this happen otherwise than by divine help according to the prophet Jeremias Lam five twenty one convert us O Lord to Thee and we shall be converted Yet predestination has in this way in regard to its effect the goodness of God for its reason towards which the whole effect of predestination is directed as to an end and from which it proceeds as from its first moving principle Reply Obj one The use of grace foreknown by God is not the cause of conferring grace except after the manner of a final cause as was explained above Reply Obj two Predestination has its foundation in the goodness of God as regards its effects in general Considered in its particular effects however one effect is the reason of another as already stated Reply Obj three The reason for the predestination of some and reprobation of others must be sought for in the goodness of God Thus He is said to have made all things through His goodness so that the divine goodness might be represented in things Now it is necessary that God s goodness which in itself is one and undivided should be manifested in many ways in His creation because creatures in themselves cannot attain to the simplicity of God Thus it is that for the completion of the universe there are required different grades of being some of which hold a high and some a low place in the universe That this multiformity of grades may be preserved in things God allows some evils lest many good things should never happen as was said above Q twenty two A two Let us then consider the whole of the human race as we consider the whole universe God wills to manifest His goodness in men in respect to those whom He predestines by means of His mercy as sparing them and in respect of others whom he reprobates by means of His justice in punishing them This is the reason why God elects some and rejects others To this the Apostle refers saying Rom nine twenty two twenty three What if God willing to show His wrath that is the vengeance of His justice and to make His power known endured that is permitted with much patience vessels of wrath fitted for destruction that He might show the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy which He hath prepared unto glory and two Tim two twenty But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and of earth and some indeed unto honor but some unto dishonor Yet why He chooses some for glory and reprobates others has no reason except the divine will Whence Augustine says Tract xxvi in Joan Why He draws one and another He draws not seek not to judge if thou dost not wish to err Thus too in the things of nature a reason can be assigned since primary matter is altogether uniform why one part of it was fashioned by God from the beginning under the form of fire another under the form of earth that there might be a diversity of species in things of nature Yet why this particular part of matter is under this particular form and that under another depends upon the simple will of God as from the simple will of the artificer it depends that this stone is in part of the wall and that in another although the plan requires that some stones should be in this place and some in that place Neither on this account can there be said to be injustice in God if He prepares unequal lots for not unequal things This would be altogether contrary to the notion of justice if the effect of predestination were granted as a debt and not gratuitously In things which are given gratuitously a person can give more or less just as he pleases provided he deprives nobody of his due without any infringement of justice This is what the master of the house said Take what is thine and go thy way Is it not lawful for me to do what I will Matt twenty fourteen fifteen SIXTH ARTICLE I Q twenty three Art six Whether Predestination Is Certain Objection one It seems that predestination is not certain Because on the words Hold fast that which thou hast that no one take thy crown reverend three eleven Augustine says De Corr et Grat fifteen Another will not receive unless this one were to lose it Hence the crown which is the effect of predestination can be both acquired and lost Therefore predestination cannot be certain Obj two Further granted what is possible nothing impossible follows But it is possible that one predestined e g Peter may sin and then be killed But if this were so it would follow that the effect of predestination would be thwarted This then is not impossible Therefore predestination is not certain Obj three Further whatever God could do in the past He can do now But He could have not predestined whom He hath predestined Therefore now He is able not to predestine him Therefore predestination is not certain On the contrary A gloss on Rom eight twenty nine Whom He foreknew He also predestinated says Predestination is the foreknowledge and preparation of the benefits of God by which whosoever are freed will most certainly be freed I answer that Predestination most certainly and infallibly takes effect yet it does not impose any necessity so that namely its effect should take place from necessity For it was said above A one that predestination is a part of providence But not all things subject to providence are necessary some things happening from contingency according to the nature of the proximate causes which divine providence has ordained for such effects Yet the order of providence is infallible as was shown above Q twenty two A four So also the order of predestination is certain yet free will is not destroyed whence the effect of predestination has its contingency Moreover all that has been said about the divine knowledge and will Q fourteen A thirteen Q nineteen A four must also be taken into consideration since they do not destroy contingency in things although they themselves are most certain and infallible Reply Obj one The crown may be said to belong to a person in two ways first by God s predestination and thus no one loses his crown secondly by the merit of grace for what we merit in a certain way is ours and thus anyone may lose his crown by mortal sin Another person receives that crown thus lost inasmuch as he takes the former s place For God does not permit some to fall without raising others according to Job thirty four twenty four He shall break in pieces many and innumerable and make others to stand in their stead Thus men are substituted in the place of the fallen angels and the Gentiles in that of the Jews He who is substituted for another in the state of grace also receives the crown of the fallen in that in eternal life he will rejoice at the good the other has done in which life he will rejoice at all good whether done by himself or by others Reply Obj two Although it is possible for one who is predestinated considered in himself to die in mortal sin yet it is not possible supposed as in fact it is supposed that he is predestinated Whence it does not follow that predestination can fall short of its effect Reply Obj three Since predestination includes the divine will as stated above A four and the fact that God wills any created thing is necessary on the supposition that He so wills on account of the immutability of the divine will but is not necessary absolutely so the same must be said of predestination Wherefore one ought not to say that God is able not to predestinate one whom He has predestinated taking it in a composite sense thought absolutely speaking God can predestinate or not But in this way the certainty of predestination is not destroyed SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q twenty three Art seven Whether the Number of the Predestined Is Certain Objection one It seems that the number of the predestined is not certain For a number to which an addition can be made is not certain But there can be an addition to the number of the predestined as it seems for it is written Deut one eleven The Lord God adds to this number many thousands and a gloss adds fixed by God who knows those who belong to Him Therefore the number of the predestined is not certain Obj two Further no reason can be assigned why God pre ordains to salvation one number of men more than another But nothing is arranged by God without a reason Therefore the number to be saved pre ordained by God cannot be certain Obj three Further the operations of God are more perfect than those of nature But in the works of nature good is found in the majority of things defect and evil in the minority If then the number of the saved were fixed by God at a certain figure there would be more saved than lost Yet the contrary follows from Matt seven thirteen fourteen For wide is the gate and broad the way that leadeth to destruction and many there are who go in thereat How narrow is the gate and strait is the way that leadeth to life and few there are who find it Therefore the number of those pre ordained by God to be saved is not certain On the contrary Augustine says De Corr et Grat thirteen The number of the predestined is certain and can neither be increased nor diminished I answer that The number of the predestined is certain Some have said that it was formally but not materially certain as if we were to say that it was certain that a hundred or a thousand would be saved not however these or those individuals But this destroys the certainty of predestination of which we spoke above A six Therefore we must say that to God the number of the predestined is certain not only formally but also materially It must however be observed that the number of the predestined is said to be certain to God not by reason of His knowledge because that is to say He knows how many will be saved for in this way the number of drops of rain and the sands of the sea are certain to God but by reason of His deliberate choice and determination For the further evidence of which we must remember that every agent intends to make something finite as is clear from what has been said above when we treated of the infinite Q seven AA two three Now whosoever intends some definite measure in his effect thinks out some definite number in the essential parts which are by their very nature required for the perfection of the whole For of those things which are required not principally but only on account of something else he does not select any definite number per se but he accepts and uses them in such numbers as are necessary on account of that other thing For instance a builder thinks out the definite measurements of a house and also the definite number of rooms which he wishes to make in the house and definite measurements of the walls and roof he does not however select a definite number of stones but accepts and uses just so many as are sufficient for the required measurements of the wall So also must we consider concerning God in regard to the whole universe which is His effect For He pre ordained the measurements of the whole of the universe and what number would befit the essential parts of that universe that is to say which have in some way been ordained in perpetuity how many spheres how many stars how many elements and how many species Individuals however which undergo corruption are not ordained as it were chiefly for the good of the universe but in a secondary way inasmuch as the good of the species is preserved through them Whence although God knows the total number of individuals the number of oxen flies and such like is not pre ordained by God per se but divine providence produces just so many as are sufficient for the preservation of the species Now of all creatures the rational creature is chiefly ordained for the good of the universe being as such incorruptible more especially those who attain to eternal happiness since they more immediately reach the ultimate end Whence the number of the predestined is certain to God not only by way of knowledge but also by way of a principal pre ordination It is not exactly the same thing in the case of the number of the reprobate who would seem to be pre ordained by God for the good of the elect in whose regard all things work together unto good Rom eight twenty eight Concerning the number of all the predestined some say that so many men will be saved as angels fell some so many as there were angels left others as many as the number of angels created by God It is however better to say that to God alone is known the number for whom is reserved eternal happiness From the secret prayer of the missal pro vivis et defunctis Reply Obj one These words of Deuteronomy must be taken as applied to those who are marked out by God beforehand in respect to present righteousness For their number is increased and diminished but not the number of the predestined Reply Obj two The reason of the quantity of any one part must be judged from the proportion of that part of the whole Thus in God the reason why He has made so many stars or so many species of things or predestined so many is according to the proportion of the principal parts to the good of the whole universe Reply Obj three The good that is proportionate to the common state of nature is to be found in the majority and is wanting in the minority The good that exceeds the common state of nature is to be found in the minority and is wanting in the majority Thus it is clear that the majority of men have a sufficient knowledge for the guidance of life and those who have not this knowledge are said to be half witted or foolish but they who attain to a profound knowledge of things intelligible are a very small minority in respect to the rest Since their eternal happiness consisting in the vision of God exceeds the common state of nature and especially in so far as this is deprived of grace through the corruption of original sin those who are saved are in the minority In this especially however appears the mercy of God that He has chosen some for that salvation from which very many in accordance with the common course and tendency of nature fall short EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q twenty three Art eight Whether Predestination Can Be Furthered by the Prayers of the Saints Objection one It seems that predestination cannot be furthered by the prayers of the saints For nothing eternal can be preceded by anything temporal and in consequence nothing temporal can help towards making something else eternal But predestination is eternal Therefore since the prayers of the saints are temporal they cannot so help as to cause anyone to become predestined Predestination therefore is not furthered by the prayers of the saints Obj two Further as there is no need of advice except on account of defective knowledge so there is no need of help except through defective power But neither of these things can be said of God when He predestines Whence it is said Who hath helped the Spirit of the Lord Vulg Who hath known the mind of the Lord Or who hath been His counsellor Rom eleven thirty four Therefore predestination cannot be furthered by the prayers of the saints Obj three Further if a thing can be helped it can also be hindered But predestination cannot be hindered by anything Therefore it cannot be furthered by anything On the contrary It is said that Isaac besought the Lord for his wife because she was barren and He heard him and made Rebecca to conceive general twenty five twenty one But from that conception Jacob was born and he was predestined Now his predestination would not have happened if he had never been born Therefore predestination can be furthered by the prayers of the saints I answer that Concerning this question there were different errors Some regarding the certainty of divine predestination said that prayers were superfluous as also anything else done to attain salvation because whether these things were done or not the predestined would attain and the reprobate would not attain eternal salvation But against this opinion are all the warnings of Holy Scripture exhorting us to prayer and other good works Others declared that the divine predestination was altered through prayer This is stated to have the opinion of the Egyptians who thought that the divine ordination which they called fate could be frustrated by certain sacrifices and prayers Against this also is the authority of Scripture For it is said But the triumpher in Israel will not spare and will not be moved to repentance one Kings fifteen twenty nine and that the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance Rom eleven twenty nine Wherefore we must say otherwise that in predestination two things are to be considered namely the divine ordination and its effect As regards the former in no possible way can predestination be furthered by the prayers of the saints For it is not due to their prayers that anyone is predestined by God As regards the latter predestination is said to be helped by the prayers of the saints and by other good works because providence of which predestination is a part does not do away with secondary causes but so provides effects that the order of secondary causes falls also under providence So as natural effects are provided by God in such a way that natural causes are directed to bring about those natural effects without which those effects would not happen so the salvation of a person is predestined by God in such a way that whatever helps that person towards salvation falls under the order of predestination whether it be one s own prayers or those of another or other good works and such like without which one would not attain to salvation Whence the predestined must strive after good works and prayer because through these means predestination is most certainly fulfilled For this reason it is said Labor more that by good works you may make sure your calling and election two Pet one ten Reply Obj one This argument shows that predestination is not furthered by the prayers of the saints as regards the preordination Reply Obj two One is said to be helped by another in two ways in one way inasmuch as he receives power from him and to be helped thus belongs to the weak but this cannot be said of God and thus we are to understand Who hath helped the Spirit of the Lord In another way one is said to be helped by a person through whom he carries out his work as a master through a servant In this way God is helped by us inasmuch as we execute His orders according to one Cor three nine We are God s company adjutors Nor is this on account of any defect in the power of God but because He employs intermediary causes in order that the beauty of order may be preserved in the universe and also that He may communicate to creatures the dignity of causality Reply Obj three Secondary causes cannot escape the order of the first universal cause as has been said above Q nineteen A six indeed they execute that order And therefore predestination can be furthered by creatures but it cannot be impeded by them QUESTION twenty four THE BOOK OF LIFE In Three Articles We now consider the book of life concerning which there are three points of inquiry one What is the book of life two Of what life is it the book three Whether anyone can be blotted out of the book of life FIRST ARTICLE I Q twenty four Art one Whether the Book of Life Is the Same As Predestination Objection one It seems that the book of life is not the same thing as predestination For it is said All things are the book of life Ecclus four thirty two i e the Old and New Testament according to a gloss This however is not predestination Therefore the book of life is not predestination Obj two Further Augustine says De Civ Dei xx fourteen that the book of life is a certain divine energy by which it happens that to each one his good or evil works are recalled to memory But divine energy belongs seemingly not to predestination but rather to divine power Therefore the book of life is not the same thing as predestination Obj three Further reprobation is opposed to predestination So if the book of life were the same as predestination there should also be a book of death as there is a book of life On the contrary It is said in a gloss upon Ps sixty eight twenty nine Let them be blotted out of the book of the living This book is the knowledge of God by which He hath predestined to life those whom He foreknew I answer that The book of life is in God taken in a metaphorical sense according to a comparison with human affairs For it is usual among men that they who are chosen for any office should be inscribed in a book as for instance soldiers or counsellors who formerly were called conscript fathers Now it is clear from the preceding Q twenty three A four that all the predestined are chosen by God to possess eternal life This conscription therefore of the predestined is called the book of life A thing is said metaphorically to be written upon the mind of anyone when it is firmly held in the memory according to Prov three three Forget not My Law and let thy heart keep My commandments and further on Write them in the tables of thy heart For things are written down in material books to help the memory Whence the knowledge of God by which He firmly remembers that He has predestined some to eternal life is called the book of life For as the writing in a book is the sign of things to be done so the knowledge of God is a sign in Him of those who are to be brought to eternal life according to two Tim eleven nineteen The sure foundation of God standeth firm having this seal the Lord knoweth who are His Reply Obj one The book of life may be understood in two senses In one sense as the inscription of those who are chosen to life thus we now speak of the book of life In another sense the inscription of those things which lead us to life may be called the book of life and this also is twofold either as of things to be done and thus the Old and New Testament are called a book of life or of things already done and thus that divine energy by which it happens that to each one his deeds will be recalled to memory is spoken of as the book of life Thus that also may be called the book of war whether it contains the names inscribed of those chosen for military service or treats of the art of warfare or relates the deeds of soldiers Hence the solution of the Second Objection Reply Obj three It is the custom to inscribe not those who are rejected but those who are chosen Whence there is no book of death corresponding to reprobation as the book of life to predestination Reply Obj four Predestination and the book of life are different aspects of the same thing For this latter implies the knowledge of predestination as also is made clear from the gloss quoted above SECOND ARTICLE I Q twenty four Art two Whether the Book of Life Regards Only the Life of Glory of the Predestined Objection one It seems that the book of life does not only regard the life of glory of the predestined For the book of life is the knowledge of life But God through His own life knows all other life Therefore the book of life is so called in regard to divine life and not only in regard to the life of the predestined Obj two Further as the life of glory comes from God so also does the life of nature Therefore if the knowledge of the life of glory is called the book of life so also should the knowledge of the life of nature be so called Obj three Further some are chosen to the life of grace who are not chosen to the life of glory as it is clear from what is said Have not I chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil John six seventy one But the book of life is the inscription of the divine election as stated above A one Therefore it applies also to the life of grace On the contrary The book of life is the knowledge of predestination as stated above ibid But predestination does not regard the life of grace except so far as it is directed to glory for those are not predestined who have grace and yet fail to obtain glory The book of life altogether is only so called in regard to the life of glory I answer that The book of life as stated above A one implies a conscription or a knowledge of those chosen to life Now a man is chosen for something which does not belong to him by nature and again that to which a man is chosen has the aspect of an end For a soldier is not chosen or inscribed merely to put on armor but to fight since this is the proper duty to which military service is directed But the life of glory is an end exceeding human nature as said above Q twenty three A one Wherefore strictly speaking the book of life regards the life of glory Reply Obj one The divine life even considered as a life of glory is natural to God whence in His regard there is no election and in consequence no book of life for we do not say that anyone is chosen to possess the power of sense or any of those things that are consequent on nature From this we gather the Reply to the Second Objection For there is no election nor a book of life as regards the life of nature Reply Obj three The life of grace has the aspect not of an end but of something directed towards an end Hence nobody is said to be chosen to the life of grace except so far as the life of grace is directed to glory For this reason those who possessing grace fail to obtain glory are not said to be chosen simply but relatively Likewise they are not said to be written in the book of life simply but relatively that is to say that it is in the ordination and knowledge of God that they are to have some relation to eternal life according to their participation in grace THIRD ARTICLE I Q twenty four Art three Whether Anyone May Be Blotted Out of the Book of Life Objection one It seems that no one may be blotted out of the book of life For Augustine says De Civ Dei xx fifteen God s foreknowledge which cannot be deceived is the book of life But nothing can be taken away from the foreknowledge of God nor from predestination Therefore neither can anyone be blotted out from the book of life Obj two Further whatever is in a thing is in it according to the disposition of that thing But the book of life is something eternal and immutable Therefore whatsoever is written therein is there not in a temporary way but immovably and indelibly Obj three Further blotting out is the contrary to inscription But nobody can be written a second time in the book of life Neither therefore can he be blotted out On the contrary It is said Let them be blotted out from the book of the living Ps sixty eight twenty nine I answer that Some have said that none could be blotted out of the book of life as a matter of fact but only in the opinion of men For it is customary in the Scriptures to say that something is done when it becomes known Thus some are said to be written in the book of life inasmuch as men think they are written therein on account of the present righteousness they see in them but when it becomes evident either in this world or in the next that they have fallen from that state of righteousness they are then said to be blotted out And thus a gloss explains the passage Let them be blotted out of the book of the living But because not to be blotted out of the book of life is placed among the rewards of the just according to the text He that shall overcome shall thus be clothed in white garments and I will not blot his name out of the book of life Apoc three five and what is promised to holy men is not merely something in the opinion of men it can therefore be said that to be blotted out and not blotted out of the book of life is not only to be referred to the opinion of man but to the reality of the fact For the book of life is the inscription of those ordained to eternal life to which one is directed from two sources namely from predestination which direction never fails and from grace for whoever has grace by this very fact becomes fitted for eternal life This direction fails sometimes because some are directed by possessing grace to obtain eternal life yet they fail to obtain it through mortal sin Therefore those who are ordained to possess eternal life through divine predestination are written down in the book of life simply because they are written therein to have eternal life in reality such are never blotted out from the book of life Those however who are ordained to eternal life not through divine predestination but through grace are said to be written in the book of life not simply but relatively for they are written therein not to have eternal life in itself but in its cause only Yet though these latter can be said to be blotted out of the book of life this blotting out must not be referred to God as if God foreknew a thing and afterwards knew it not but to the thing known namely because God knows one is first ordained to eternal life and afterwards not ordained when he falls from grace Reply Obj one The act of blotting out does not refer to the book of life as regards God s foreknowledge as if in God there were any change but as regards things foreknown which can change Reply Obj two Although things are immutably in God yet in themselves they are subject to change To this it is that the blotting out of the book of life refers Reply Obj three The way in which one is said to be blotted out of the book of life is that in which one is said to be written therein anew either in the opinion of men or because he begins again to have relation towards eternal life through grace which also is included in the knowledge of God although not anew QUESTION twenty five THE POWER OF GOD In Six Articles After considering the divine foreknowledge and will and other things pertaining thereto it remains for us to consider the power of God About this are six points of inquiry one Whether there is power in God two Whether His power is infinite three Whether He is almighty four Whether He could make the past not to have been five Whether He could do what He does not or not do what He does six Whether what He makes He could make better FIRST ARTICLE I Q twenty five Art one Whether There Is Power in God Objection one It seems that power is not in God For as primary matter is to power so God who is the first agent is to act But primary matter considered in itself is devoid of all act Therefore the first agent namely God is devoid of power Obj two Further according to the Philosopher Metaph vi nineteen better than every power is its act For form is better than matter and action than active power since it is its end But nothing is better than what is in God because whatsoever is in God is God as was shown above Q three A three Therefore there is no power in God Obj three Further Power is the principle of operation But the divine power is God s essence since there is nothing accidental in God and of the essence of God there is no principle Therefore there is no power in God Obj four Further it was shown above Q fourteen A eight Q nineteen A four that God s knowledge and will are the cause of things But the cause and principle of a thing are identical We ought not therefore to assign power to God but only knowledge and will On the contrary It is said Thou art mighty O Lord and Thy truth is round about Thee Ps eighty eight nine I answer that Power is twofold namely passive which exists not at all in God and active which we must assign to Him in the highest degree For it is manifest that everything according as it is in act and is perfect is the active principle of something whereas everything is passive according as it is deficient and imperfect Now it was shown above Q three A two Q four AA one two that God is pure act simply and in all ways perfect nor in Him does any imperfection find place Whence it most fittingly belongs to Him to be an active principle and in no way whatsoever to be passive On the other hand the notion of active principle is consistent with active power For active power is the principle of acting upon something else whereas passive power is the principle of being acted upon by something else as the Philosopher says Metaph v seventeen It remains therefore that in God there is active power in the highest degree Reply Obj one Active power is not contrary to act but is founded upon it for everything acts according as it is actual but passive power is contrary to act for a thing is passive according as it is potential Whence this potentiality is not in God but only active power Reply Obj two Whenever act is distinct from power act must be nobler than power But God s action is not distinct from His power for both are His divine essence neither is His existence distinct from His essence Hence it does not follow that there should be anything in God nobler than His power Reply Obj three In creatures power is the principle not only of action but likewise of effect Thus in God the idea of power is retained inasmuch as it is the principle of an effect not however as it is a principle of action for this is the divine essence itself except perchance after our manner of understanding inasmuch as the divine essence which pre contains in itself all perfection that exists in created things can be understood either under the notion of action or under that of power as also it is understood under the notion of suppositum possessing nature and under that of nature Accordingly the notion of power is retained in God in so far as it is the principle of an effect Reply Obj four Power is predicated of God not as something really distinct from His knowledge and will but as differing from them logically inasmuch as power implies a notion of a principle putting into execution what the will commands and what knowledge directs which three things in God are identified Or we may say that the knowledge or will of God according as it is the effective principle has the notion of power contained in it Hence the consideration of the knowledge and will of God precedes the consideration of His power as the cause precedes the operation and effect SECOND ARTICLE I Q twenty five Art two Whether the Power of God Is Infinite Objection one It seems that the power of God is not infinite For everything that is infinite is imperfect according to the Philosopher Phys iii six But the power of God is far from imperfect Therefore it is not infinite Obj two Further every power is made known by its effect otherwise it would be ineffectual If then the power of God were infinite it could produce an infinite effect but this is impossible Obj three Further the Philosopher proves Phys viii seventy nine that if the power of any corporeal thing were infinite it would cause instantaneous movement God however does not cause instantaneous movement but moves the spiritual creature in time and the corporeal creature in place and time as Augustine says general ad lit twenty twenty two twenty three Therefore His power is not infinite On the contrary Hilary says De Trin viii that God s power is immeasurable He is the living mighty one Now everything that is immeasurable is infinite Therefore the power of God is infinite I answer that As stated above A one active power exists in God according to the measure in which He is actual Now His existence is infinite inasmuch as it is not limited by anything that receives it as is clear from what has been said when we discussed the infinity of the divine essence Q seven A one Wherefore it is necessary that the active power in God should be infinite For in every agent is it found that the more perfectly an agent has the form by which it acts the greater its power to act For instance the hotter a thing is the greater the power has it to give heat and it would have infinite power to give heat were its own heat infinite Whence since the divine essence through which God acts is infinite as was shown above Q seven A one it follows that His power likewise is infinite Reply Obj one The Philosopher is here speaking of an infinity in regard to matter not limited by any form and such infinity belongs to quantity But the divine essence is otherwise as was shown above Q seven A one and consequently so also His power It does not follow therefore that it is imperfect Reply Obj two The power of a univocal agent is wholly manifested in its effect The generative power of man for example is not able to do more than beget man But the power of a non univocal agent does not wholly manifest itself in the production of its effect as for example the power of the sun does not wholly manifest itself in the production of an animal generated from putrefaction Now it is clear that God is not a univocal agent For nothing agrees with Him either in species or in genus as was shown above Q three A five Q four A three Whence it follows that His effect is always less than His power It is not necessary therefore that the infinite power of God should be manifested so as to produce an infinite effect Yet even if it were to produce no effect the power of God would not be ineffectual because a thing is ineffectual which is ordained towards an end to which it does not attain But the power of God is not ordered toward its effect as towards an end rather it is the end of the effect produced by it Reply Obj three The Philosopher Phys viii seventy nine proves that if a body had infinite power it would cause a non temporal movement And he shows that the power of the mover of heaven is infinite because it can move in an infinite time It remains therefore according to his reckoning that the infinite power of a body if such existed would move without time not however the power of an incorporeal mover The reason of this is that one body moving another is a univocal agent wherefore it follows that the whole power of the agent is made known in its motion Since then the greater the power of a moving body the more quickly does it move the necessary conclusion is that if its power were infinite it would move beyond comparison faster and this is to move without time An incorporeal mover however is not a univocal agent whence it is not necessary that the whole of its power should be manifested in motion so as to move without time and especially since it moves in accordance with the disposition of its will THIRD ARTICLE I Q twenty five Art three Whether God Is Omnipotent Objection one It seems that God is not omnipotent For movement and passiveness belong to everything But this is impossible with God for He is immovable as was said above Q two A three Therefore He is not omnipotent Obj two Further sin is an act of some kind But God cannot sin nor deny Himself as it is said in two Tim two thirteen Therefore He is not omnipotent Obj three Further it is said of God that He manifests His omnipotence especially by sparing and having mercy Collect tenth Sunday after Pentecost Therefore the greatest act possible to the divine power is to spare and have mercy There are things much greater however than sparing and having mercy for example to create another world and the like Therefore God is not omnipotent Obj four Further upon the text God hath made foolish the wisdom of this world one Cor one twenty a gloss says God hath made the wisdom of this world foolish Vulg Hath not God et cetera by showing those things to be possible which it judges to be impossible Whence it would seem that nothing is to be judged possible or impossible in reference to inferior causes as the wisdom of this world judges them but in reference to the divine power If God then were omnipotent all things would be possible nothing therefore impossible But if we take away the impossible then we destroy also the necessary for what necessarily exists is impossible not to exist Therefore there would be nothing at all that is necessary in things if God were omnipotent But this is an impossibility Therefore God is not omnipotent On the contrary It is said No word shall be impossible with God Luke one thirty seven I answer that All confess that God is omnipotent but it seems difficult to explain in what His omnipotence precisely consists for there may be doubt as to the precise meaning of the word all when we say that God can do all things If however we consider the matter aright since power is said in reference to possible things this phrase God can do all things is rightly understood to mean that God can do all things that are possible and for this reason He is said to be omnipotent Now according to the Philosopher Metaph v seventeen a thing is said to be possible in two ways First in relation to some power thus whatever is subject to human power is said to be possible to man Secondly absolutely on account of the relation in which the very terms stand to each other Now God cannot be said to be omnipotent through being able to do all things that are possible to created nature for the divine power extends farther than that If however we were to say that God is omnipotent because He can do all things that are possible to His power there would be a vicious circle in explaining the nature of His power For this would be saying nothing else but that God is omnipotent because He can do all that He is able to do It remains therefore that God is called omnipotent because He can do all things that are possible absolutely which is the second way of saying a thing is possible For a thing is said to be possible or impossible absolutely according to the relation in which the very terms stand to one another possible if the predicate is not incompatible with the subject as that Socrates sits and absolutely impossible when the predicate is altogether incompatible with the subject as for instance that a man is a donkey It must however be remembered that since every agent produces an effect like itself to each active power there corresponds a thing possible as its proper object according to the nature of that act on which its active power is founded for instance the power of giving warmth is related as to its proper object to the being capable of being warmed The divine existence however upon which the nature of power in God is founded is infinite and is not limited to any genus of being but possesses within itself the perfection of all being Whence whatsoever has or can have the nature of being is numbered among the absolutely possible things in respect of which God is called omnipotent Now nothing is opposed to the idea of being except non being Therefore that which implies being and non being at the same time is repugnant to the idea of an absolutely possible thing within the scope of the divine omnipotence For such cannot come under the divine omnipotence not because of any defect in the power of God but because it has not the nature of a feasible or possible thing Therefore everything that does not imply a contradiction in terms is numbered amongst those possible things in respect of which God is called omnipotent whereas whatever implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine omnipotence because it cannot have the aspect of possibility Hence it is better to say that such things cannot be done than that God cannot do them Nor is this contrary to the word of the angel saying No word shall be impossible with God For whatever implies a contradiction cannot be a word because no intellect can possibly conceive such a thing Reply Obj one God is said to be omnipotent in respect to His active power not to passive power as was shown above A one Whence the fact that He is immovable or impassible is not repugnant to His omnipotence Reply Obj two To sin is to fall short of a perfect action hence to be able to sin is to be able to fall short in action which is repugnant to omnipotence Therefore it is that God cannot sin because of His omnipotence Nevertheless the Philosopher says Topic iv three that God can deliberately do what is evil But this must be understood either on a condition the antecedent of which is impossible as for instance if we were to say that God can do evil things if He will For there is no reason why a conditional proposition should not be true though both the antecedent and consequent are impossible as if one were to say If man is a donkey he has four feet Or he may be understood to mean that God can do some things which now seem to be evil which however if He did them would then be good Or he is perhaps speaking after the common manner of the heathen who thought that men became gods like Jupiter or Mercury Reply Obj three God s omnipotence is particularly shown in sparing and having mercy because in this is it made manifest that God has supreme power that He freely forgives sins For it is not for one who is bound by laws of a superior to forgive sins of his own free will Or because by sparing and having mercy upon men He leads them on to the participation of an infinite good which is the ultimate effect of the divine power Or because as was said above Q twenty one A four the effect of the divine mercy is the foundation of all the divine works For nothing is due to anyone except on account of something already given him gratuitously by God In this way the divine omnipotence is particularly made manifest because to it pertains the first foundation of all good things Reply Obj four The absolute possible is not so called in reference either to higher causes or to inferior causes but in reference to itself But the possible in reference to some power is named possible in reference to its proximate cause Hence those things which it belongs to God alone to do immediately as for example to create to justify and the like are said to be possible in reference to a higher cause Those things however which are of such kind as to be done by inferior causes are said to be possible in reference to those inferior causes For it is according to the condition of the proximate cause that the effect has contingency or necessity as was shown above Q fourteen A one ad two Thus is it that the wisdom of the world is deemed foolish because what is impossible to nature it judges to be impossible to God So it is clear that the omnipotence of God does not take away from things their impossibility and necessity FOURTH ARTICLE I Q twenty five Art four Whether God Can Make the Past Not to Have Been Objection one It seems that God can make the past not to have been For what is impossible in itself is much more impossible than that which is only impossible accidentally But God can do what is impossible in itself as to give sight to the blind or to raise the dead Therefore and much more can He do what is only impossible accidentally Now for the past not to have been is impossible accidentally thus for Socrates not to be running is accidentally impossible from the fact that his running is a thing of the past Therefore God can make the past not to have been Obj two Further what God could do He can do now since His power is not lessened But God could have effected before Socrates ran that he should not run Therefore when he has run God could effect that he did not run Obj three Further charity is a more excellent virtue than virginity But God can supply charity that is lost therefore also lost virginity Therefore He can so effect that what was corrupt should not have been corrupt On the contrary Jerome says Ep twenty two ad Eustoch Although God can do all things He cannot make a thing that is corrupt not to have been corrupted Therefore for the same reason He cannot effect that anything else which is past should not have been I answer that As was said above Q seven A two there does not fall under the scope of God s omnipotence anything that implies a contradiction Now that the past should not have been implies a contradiction For as it implies a contradiction to say that Socrates is sitting and is not sitting so does it to say that he sat and did not sit But to say that he did sit is to say that it happened in the past To say that he did not sit is to say that it did not happen Whence that the past should not have been does not come under the scope of divine power This is what Augustine means when he says Contra Faust xxix five Whosoever says If God is almighty let Him make what is done as if it were not done does not see that this is to say If God is almighty let Him effect that what is true by the very fact that it is true be false and the Philosopher says Ethic vi two Of this one thing alone is God deprived namely to make undone the things that have been done Reply Obj one Although it is impossible accidentally for the past not to have been if one considers the past thing itself as for instance the running of Socrates nevertheless if the past thing is considered as past that it should not have been is impossible not only in itself but absolutely since it implies a contradiction Thus it is more impossible than the raising of the dead in which there is nothing contradictory because this is reckoned impossible in reference to some power that is to say some natural power for such impossible things do come beneath the scope of divine power Reply Obj two As God in accordance with the perfection of the divine power can do all things and yet some things are not subject to His power because they fall short of being possible so also if we regard the immutability of the divine power whatever God could do He can do now Some things however at one time were in the nature of possibility whilst they were yet to be done which now fall short of the nature of possibility when they have been done So is God said not to be able to do them because they themselves cannot be done Reply Obj three God can remove all corruption of the mind and body from a woman who has fallen but the fact that she had been corrupt cannot be removed from her as also is it impossible that the fact of having sinned or having lost charity thereby can be removed from the sinner FIFTH ARTICLE I Q twenty five Art five Whether God Can Do What He Does Not Objection one It seems that God cannot do other than what He does For God cannot do what He has not foreknown and pre ordained that He would do But He neither foreknew nor pre ordained that He would do anything except what He does Therefore He cannot do except what He does Obj two Further God can only do what ought to be done and what is right to be done But God is not bound to do what He does not nor is it right that He should do what He does not Therefore He cannot do except what He does Obj three Further God cannot do anything that is not good and befitting creation But it is not good for creatures nor befitting them to be otherwise than as they are Therefore God cannot do except what He does On the contrary It is said Thinkest thou that I cannot ask My Father and He will give Me presently more than twelve legions of angels Matt twenty six fifty three But He neither asked for them nor did His Father show them to refute the Jews Therefore God can do what He does not I answer that In this matter certain persons erred in two ways Some laid it down that God acts from natural necessity in such way that as from the action of nature nothing else can happen beyond what actually takes place as for instance from the seed of man a man must come and from that of an olive an olive so from the divine operation there could not result other things nor another order of things than that which now is But we showed above Q nineteen A three that God does not act from natural necessity but that His will is the cause of all things nor is that will naturally and from any necessity determined to those things Whence in no way at all is the present course of events produced by God from any necessity so that other things could not happen Others however said that the divine power is restricted to this present course of events through the order of the divine wisdom and justice without which God does nothing But since the power of God which is His essence is nothing else but His wisdom it can indeed be fittingly said that there is nothing in the divine power which is not in the order of the divine wisdom for the divine wisdom includes the whole potency of the divine power Yet the order placed in creation by divine wisdom in which order the notion of His justice consists as said above Q twenty one A two is not so adequate to the divine wisdom that the divine wisdom should be restricted to this present order of things Now it is clear that the whole idea of order which a wise man puts into things made by him is taken from their end So when the end is proportionate to the things made for that end the wisdom of the maker is restricted to some definite order But the divine goodness is an end exceeding beyond all proportion things created Whence the divine wisdom is not so restricted to any particular order that no other course of events could happen Wherefore we must simply say that God can do other things than those He has done Reply Obj one In ourselves in whom power and essence are distinct from will and intellect and again intellect from wisdom and will from justice there can be something in the power which is not in the just will nor in the wise intellect But in God power and essence will and intellect wisdom and justice are one and the same Whence there can be nothing in the divine power which cannot also be in His just will or in His wise intellect Nevertheless because His will cannot be determined from necessity to this or that order of things except upon supposition as was said above Q nineteen A three neither are the wisdom and justice of God restricted to this present order as was shown above so nothing prevents there being something in the divine power which He does not will and which is not included in the order which He has place in things Again because power is considered as executing the will as commanding and the intellect and wisdom as directing what is attributed to His power considered in itself God is said to be able to do in accordance with His absolute power Of such a kind is everything which has the nature of being as was said above A three What is however attributed to the divine power according as it carries into execution the command of a just will God is said to be able to do by His ordinary power In this manner we must say that God can do other things by His absolute power than those He has foreknown and pre ordained He would do But it could not happen that He should do anything which He had not foreknown and had not pre ordained that He would do because His actual doing is subject to His foreknowledge and pre ordination though His power which is His nature is not so For God does things because He wills so to do yet the power to do them does not come from His will but from His nature Reply Obj two God is bound to nobody but Himself Hence when it is said that God can only do what He ought nothing else is meant by this than that God can do nothing but what is befitting to Himself and just But these words befitting and just may be understood in two ways one in direct connection with the verb is and thus they would be restricted to the present order of things and would concern His power Then what is said in the objection is false for the sense is that God can do nothing except what is now fitting and just If however they be joined directly with the verb can which has the effect of extending the meaning and then secondly with is the present will be signified but in a confused and general way The sentence would then be true in this sense God cannot do anything except that which if He did it would be suitable and just Reply Obj three Although this order of things be restricted to what now exists the divine power and wisdom are not thus restricted Whence although no other order would be suitable and good to the things which now are yet God can do other things and impose upon them another order SIXTH ARTICLE I Q twenty five Art six Whether God Can Do Better Than What He Does Objection one It seems that God cannot do better than He does For whatever God does He does in a most powerful and wise way But a thing is so much the better done as it is more powerfully and wisely done Therefore God cannot do anything better than He does Obj two Further Augustine thus argues Contra Maximin iii eight If God could but would not beget a Son His equal He would have been envious For the same reason if God could have made better things than He has done but was not willing so to do He would have been envious But envy is far removed from God Therefore God makes everything of the best He cannot therefore make anything better than He does Obj three Further what is very good and the best of all cannot be bettered because nothing is better than the best But as Augustine says Enchiridion ten each thing that God has made is good and taken all together they are very good because in them all consists the wondrous beauty of the universe Therefore the good in the universe could not be made better by God Obj four Further Christ as man is full of grace and truth and has the Spirit without measure and so He cannot be better Again created happiness is described as the highest good and thus cannot be better And the Blessed Virgin Mary is raised above all the choirs of angels and so cannot be better than she is God cannot therefore make all things better than He has made them On the contrary It is said Eph three twenty God is able to do all things more abundantly than we desire or understand I answer that The goodness of anything is twofold one which is of the essence of it thus for instance to be rational pertains to the essence of man As regards this good God cannot make a thing better than it is itself although He can make another thing better than it even as He cannot make the number four greater than it is because if it were greater it would no longer be four but another number For the addition of a substantial difference in definitions is after the manner of the addition of unity of numbers Metaph viii ten Another kind of goodness is that which is over and above the essence thus the good of a man is to be virtuous or wise As regards this kind of goodness God can make better the things He has made Absolutely speaking however God can make something else better than each thing made by Him Reply Obj one When it is said that God can make a thing better than He makes it if better is taken substantively this proposition is true For He can always make something else better than each individual thing and He can make the same thing in one way better than it is and in another way not as was explained above If however better is taken as an adverb implying the manner of the making thus God cannot make anything better than He makes it because He cannot make it from greater wisdom and goodness But if it implies the manner of the thing done He can make something better because He can give to things made by Him a better manner of existence as regards the accidents although not as regards the substance Reply Obj two It is of the nature of a son that he should be equal to his father when he comes to maturity But it is not of the nature of anything created that it should be better than it was made by God Hence the comparison fails Reply Obj three The universe the present creation being supposed cannot be better on account of the most beautiful order given to things by God in which the good of the universe consists For if any one thing were bettered the proportion of order would be destroyed as if one string were stretched more than it ought to be the melody of the harp would be destroyed Yet God could make other things or add something to the present creation and then there would be another and a better universe Reply Obj four The humanity of Christ from the fact that it is united to the Godhead and created happiness from the fact that it is the fruition of God and the Blessed Virgin from the fact that she is the mother of God have all a certain infinite dignity from the infinite good which is God And on this account there cannot be anything better than these just as there cannot be anything better than God QUESTION twenty six OF THE DIVINE BEATITUDE In Four Articles After considering all that pertains to the unity of the divine essence we come to treat of the divine beatitude Concerning this there are four points of inquiry one Whether beatitude belongs to God two In regard to what is God called blessed does this regard His act of intellect three Whether He is essentially the beatitude of each of the blessed four Whether all other beatitude is included in the divine beatitude FIRST ARTICLE I Q twenty six Art one Whether Beatitude Belongs to God Objection one It seems that beatitude does not belong to God For beatitude according to Boethius De Consol iv is a state made perfect by the aggregation of all good things But the aggregation of goods has no place in God nor has composition Therefore beatitude does not belong to God Obj two Further beatitude or happiness is the reward of virtue according to the Philosopher Ethic i nine But reward does not apply to God as neither does merit Therefore neither does beatitude On the contrary The Apostle says Which in His times He shall show who is the Blessed and only Almighty the King of Kings and Lord of Lords one Tim six fifteen I answer that Beatitude belongs to God in a very special manner For nothing else is understood to be meant by the term beatitude than the perfect good of an intellectual nature which is capable of knowing that it has a sufficiency of the good which it possesses to which it is competent that good or ill may befall and which can control its own actions All of these things belong in a most excellent manner to God namely to be perfect and to possess intelligence Whence beatitude belongs to God in the highest degree Reply Obj one Aggregation of good is in God after the manner not of composition but of simplicity for those things which in creatures is manifold pre exist in God as was said above Q four A two Q thirteen A four in simplicity and unity Reply Obj two It belongs as an accident to beatitude or happiness to be the reward of virtue so far as anyone attains to beatitude even as to be the term of generation belongs accidentally to a being so far as it passes from potentiality to act As then God has being though not begotten so He has beatitude although not acquired by merit SECOND ARTICLE I Q twenty six Art two Whether God Is Called Blessed in Respect of His Intellect Objection one It seems that God is not called blessed in respect to His intellect For beatitude is the highest good But good is said to be in God in regard to His essence because good has reference to being which is according to essence according to Boethius De Hebdom Therefore beatitude also is said to be in God in regard to His essence and not to His intellect Obj two Further Beatitude implies the notion of end Now the end is the object of the will as also is the good Therefore beatitude is said to be in God with reference to His will and not with reference to His intellect On the contrary Gregory says Moral xxxii seven He is in glory Who whilst He rejoices in Himself needs not further praise To be in glory however is the same as to be blessed Therefore since we enjoy God in respect to our intellect because vision is the whole of the reward as Augustine says De Civ Dei xxii it would seem that beatitude is said to be in God in respect of His intellect it would seem that beatitude is said to be in God in respect of His intellect I answer that Beatitude as stated above A one is the perfect good of an intellectual nature Thus it is that as everything desires the perfection of its nature intellectual nature desires naturally to be happy Now that which is most perfect in any intellectual nature is the intellectual operation by which in some sense it grasps everything Whence the beatitude of every intellectual nature consists in understanding Now in God to be and to understand are one and the same thing differing only in the manner of our understanding them Beatitude must therefore be assigned to God in respect of His intellect as also to the blessed who are called blessed beati by reason of the assimilation to His beatitude Reply Obj one This argument proves that beatitude belongs to God not that beatitude pertains essentially to Him under the aspect of His essence but rather under the aspect of His intellect Reply Obj two Since beatitude is a good it is the object of the will now the object is understood as prior to the act of a power Whence in our manner of understanding divine beatitude precedes the act of the will at rest in it This cannot be other than the act of the intellect and thus beatitude is to be found in an act of the intellect THIRD ARTICLE I Q twenty six Art three Whether God Is the Beatitude of Each of the Blessed Objection one It seems that God is the beatitude of each of the blessed For God is the supreme good as was said above Q six AA two four But it is quite impossible that there should be many supreme goods as also is clear from what has been said above Q eleven A three Therefore since it is of the essence of beatitude that it should be the supreme good it seems that beatitude is nothing else but God Himself Obj two Further beatitude is the last end of the rational nature But to be the last end of the rational nature belongs only to God Therefore the beatitude of every blessed is God alone On the contrary The beatitude of one is greater than that of another according to one Cor fifteen forty one Star differeth from star in glory But nothing is greater than God Therefore beatitude is something different from God I answer that The beatitude of an intellectual nature consists in an act of the intellect In this we may consider two things namely the object of the act which is the thing understood and the act itself which is to understand If then beatitude be considered on the side of the object God is the only beatitude for everyone is blessed from this sole fact that he understands God in accordance with the saying of Augustine Confess v four Blessed is he who knoweth Thee though he know nought else But as regards the act of understanding beatitude is a created thing in beatified creatures but in God even in this way it is an uncreated thing Reply Obj one Beatitude as regards its object is the supreme good absolutely but as regards its act in beatified creatures it is their supreme good not absolutely but in that kind of goods which a creature can participate Reply Obj two End is twofold namely objective and subjective as the Philosopher says Greater Ethics i three namely the thing itself and its use Thus to a miser the end is money and its acquisition Accordingly God is indeed the last end of a rational creature as the thing itself but created beatitude is the end as the use or rather fruition of the thing FOURTH ARTICLE I Q twenty six Art four Whether All Other Beatitude Is Included in the Beatitude of God Objection one It seems that the divine beatitude does not embrace all other beatitudes For there are some false beatitudes But nothing false can be in God Therefore the divine beatitude does not embrace all other beatitudes Obj two Further a certain beatitude according to some consists in things corporeal as in pleasure riches and such like Now none of these have to do with God since He is incorporeal Therefore His beatitude does not embrace all other beatitudes On the contrary Beatitude is a certain perfection But the divine perfection embraces all other perfection as was shown above Q four A two Therefore the divine beatitude embraces all other beatitudes I answer that Whatever is desirable in whatsoever beatitude whether true or false pre exists wholly and in a more eminent degree in the divine beatitude As to contemplative happiness God possesses a continual and most certain contemplation of Himself and of all things else and as to that which is active He has the governance of the whole universe As to earthly happiness which consists in delight riches power dignity and fame according to Boethius De Consol iii ten He possesses joy in Himself and all things else for His delight instead of riches He has that complete self sufficiency which is promised by riches in place of power He has omnipotence for dignities the government of all things and in place of fame He possesses the admiration of all creatures Reply Obj one A particular kind of beatitude is false according as it falls short of the idea of true beatitude and thus it is not in God But whatever semblance it has howsoever slight of beatitude the whole of it pre exists in the divine beatitude Reply Obj two The good that exists in things corporeal in a corporeal manner is also in God but in a spiritual manner We have now spoken enough concerning what pertains to the unity of the divine essence TREATISE ON THE MOST HOLY TRINITY QQ twenty seven forty three QUESTION twenty seven THE PROCESSION OF THE DIVINE PERSONS In Five Articles Having considered what belongs to the unity of the divine essence it remains to treat of what belongs to the Trinity of the persons in God And because the divine Persons are distinguished from each other according to the relations of origin the order of the doctrine leads us to consider firstly the question of origin or procession secondly the relations of origin thirdly the persons Concerning procession there are five points of inquiry one Whether there is procession in God two Whether any procession in God can be called generation three Whether there can be any other procession in God besides generation four Whether that other procession can be called generation five Whether there are more than two processions in God FIRST ARTICLE I Q twenty seven Art one Whether There Is Procession in God Objection one It would seem that there cannot be any procession in God For procession signifies outward movement But in God there is nothing mobile nor anything extraneous Therefore neither is there procession in God Obj two Further everything which proceeds differs from that whence it proceeds But in God there is no diversity but supreme simplicity Therefore in God there is no procession Obj three Further to proceed from another seems to be against the nature of the first principle But God is the first principle as shown above Q two A three Therefore in God there is no procession On the contrary Our Lord says From God I proceeded John eight forty two I answer that Divine Scripture uses in relation to God names which signify procession This procession has been differently understood Some have understood it in the sense of an effect proceeding from its cause so Arius took it saying that the Son proceeds from the Father as His primary creature and that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son as the creature of both In this sense neither the Son nor the Holy Ghost would be true God and this is contrary to what is said of the Son That we may be in His true Son This is true God one John five twenty Of the Holy Ghost it is also said Know you not that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost one Cor six nineteen Now to have a temple is God s prerogative Others take this procession to mean the cause proceeding to the effect as moving it or impressing its own likeness on it in which sense it was understood by Sabellius who said that God the Father is called Son in assuming flesh from the Virgin and that the Father also is called Holy Ghost in sanctifying the rational creature and moving it to life The words of the Lord contradict such a meaning when He speaks of Himself The Son cannot of Himself do anything John five nineteen while many other passages show the same whereby we know that the Father is not the Son Careful examination shows that both of these opinions take procession as meaning an outward act hence neither of them affirms procession as existing in God Himself whereas since procession always supposes action and as there is an outward procession corresponding to the act tending to external matter so there must be an inward procession corresponding to the act remaining within the agent This applies most conspicuously to the intellect the action of which remains in the intelligent agent For whenever we understand by the very fact of understanding there proceeds something within us which is a conception of the object understood a conception issuing from our intellectual power and proceeding from our knowledge of that object This conception is signified by the spoken word and it is called the word of the heart signified by the word of the voice As God is above all things we should understand what is said of God not according to the mode of the lowest creatures namely bodies but from the similitude of the highest creatures the intellectual substances while even the similitudes derived from these fall short in the representation of divine objects Procession therefore is not to be understood from what it is in bodies either according to local movement or by way of a cause proceeding forth to its exterior effect as for instance like heat from the agent to the thing made hot Rather it is to be understood by way of an intelligible emanation for example of the intelligible word which proceeds from the speaker yet remains in him In that sense the Catholic Faith understands procession as existing in God Reply Obj one This objection comes from the idea of procession in the sense of local motion or of an action tending to external matter or to an exterior effect which kind of procession does not exist in God as we have explained Reply Obj two Whatever proceeds by way of outward procession is necessarily distinct from the source whence it proceeds whereas whatever proceeds within by an intelligible procession is not necessarily distinct indeed the more perfectly it proceeds the more closely it is one with the source whence it proceeds For it is clear that the more a thing is understood the more closely is the intellectual conception joined and united to the intelligent agent since the intellect by the very act of understanding is made one with the object understood Thus as the divine intelligence is the very supreme perfection of God Q fourteen A two the divine Word is of necessity perfectly one with the source whence He proceeds without any kind of diversity Reply Obj three To proceed from a principle so as to be something outside and distinct from that principle is irreconcilable with the idea of a first principle whereas an intimate and uniform procession by way of an intelligible act is included in the idea of a first principle For when we call the builder the principle of the house in the idea of such a principle is included that of his art and it would be included in the idea of the first principle were the builder the first principle of the house God Who is the first principle of all things may be compared to things created as the architect is to things designed SECOND ARTICLE I Q twenty seven Art two Whether Any Procession in God Can Be Called Generation Objection one It would seem that no procession in God can be called generation For generation is change from non existence to existence and is opposed to corruption while matter is the subject of both Nothing of all this belongs to God Therefore generation cannot exist in God Obj two Further procession exists in God according to an intelligible mode as above explained A one But such a process is not called generation in us therefore neither is it to be so called in God Obj three Further anything that is generated derives existence from its generator Therefore such existence is a derived existence But no derived existence can be a self subsistence Therefore since the divine existence is self subsisting Q three A four it follows that no generated existence can be the divine existence Therefore there is no generation in God On the contrary It is said Ps two seven This day have I begotten Thee I answer that The procession of the Word in God is called generation In proof whereof we must observe that generation has a twofold meaning one common to everything subject to generation and corruption in which sense generation is nothing but change from non existence to existence In another sense it is proper and belongs to living things in which sense it signifies the origin of a living being from a conjoined living principle and this is properly called birth Not everything of that kind however is called begotten but strictly speaking only what proceeds by way of similitude Hence a hair has not the aspect of generation and sonship but only that has which proceeds by way of a similitude Nor will any likeness suffice for a worm which is generated from animals has not the aspect of generation and sonship although it has a generic similitude for this kind of generation requires that there should be a procession by way of similitude in the same specific nature as a man proceeds from a man and a horse from a horse So in living things which proceed from potential to actual life such as men and animals generation includes both these kinds of generation But if there is a being whose life does not proceed from potentiality to act procession if found in such a being excludes entirely the first kind of generation whereas it may have that kind of generation which belongs to living things So in this manner the procession of the Word in God is generation for He proceeds by way of intelligible action which is a vital operation from a conjoined principle as above described by way of similitude inasmuch as the concept of the intellect is a likeness of the object conceived and exists in the same nature because in God the act of understanding and His existence are the same as shown above Q fourteen A four Hence the procession of the Word in God is called generation and the Word Himself proceeding is called the Son Reply Obj one This objection is based on the idea of generation in the first sense importing the issuing forth from potentiality to act in which sense it is not found in God Reply Obj two The act of human understanding in ourselves is not the substance itself of the intellect hence the word which proceeds within us by intelligible operation is not of the same nature as the source whence it proceeds so the idea of generation cannot be properly and fully applied to it But the divine act of intelligence is the very substance itself of the one who understands Q fourteen A four The Word proceeding therefore proceeds as subsisting in the same nature and so is properly called begotten and Son Hence Scripture employs terms which denote generation of living things in order to signify the procession of the divine Wisdom namely conception and birth as is declared in the person of the divine Wisdom The depths were not as yet and I was already conceived before the hills I was brought forth Prov eight twenty four In our way of understanding we use the word conception in order to signify that in the word of our intellect is found the likeness of the thing understood although there be no identity of nature Reply Obj three Not everything derived from another has existence in another subject otherwise we could not say that the whole substance of created being comes from God since there is no subject that could receive the whole substance So then what is generated in God receives its existence from the generator not as though that existence were received into matter or into a subject which would conflict with the divine self subsistence but when we speak of His existence as received we mean that He Who proceeds receives divine existence from another not however as if He were other from the divine nature For in the perfection itself of the divine existence are contained both the Word intelligibly proceeding and the principle of the Word with whatever belongs to His perfection Q four A two THIRD ARTICLE I Q twenty seven Art three Whether Any Other Procession Exists in God Besides That of the Word Objection one It would seem that no other procession exists in God besides the generation of the Word Because for whatever reason we admit another procession we should be led to admit yet another and so on to infinitude which cannot be Therefore we must stop at the first and hold that there exists only one procession in God Obj two Further every nature possesses but one mode of self communication because operations derive unity and diversity from their terms But procession in God is only by way of communication of the divine nature Therefore as there is only one divine nature Q eleven A four it follows that only one procession exists in God Obj three Further if any other procession but the intelligible procession of the Word existed in God it could only be the procession of love which is by the operation of the will But such a procession is identified with the intelligible procession of the intellect inasmuch as the will in God is the same as His intellect Q nineteen A one Therefore in God there is no other procession but the procession of the Word On the contrary The Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father John fifteen twenty six and He is distinct from the Son according to the words I will ask My Father and He will give you another Paraclete John fourteen sixteen Therefore in God another procession exists besides the procession of the Word I answer that There are two processions in God the procession of the Word and another In evidence whereof we must observe that procession exists in God only according to an action which does not tend to anything external but remains in the agent itself Such an action in an intellectual nature is that of the intellect and of the will The procession of the Word is by way of an intelligible operation The operation of the will within ourselves involves also another procession that of love whereby the object loved is in the lover as by the conception of the word the object spoken of or understood is in the intelligent agent Hence besides the procession of the Word in God there exists in Him another procession called the procession of love Reply Obj one There is no need to go on to infinitude in the divine processions for the procession which is accomplished within the agent in an intellectual nature terminates in the procession of the will Reply Obj two All that exists in God is God Q three AA three four whereas the same does not apply to others Therefore the divine nature is communicated by every procession which is not outward and this does not apply to other natures Reply Obj three Though will and intellect are not diverse in God nevertheless the nature of will and intellect requires the processions belonging to each of them to exist in a certain order For the procession of love occurs in due order as regards the procession of the Word since nothing can be loved by the will unless it is conceived in the intellect So as there exists a certain order of the Word to the principle whence He proceeds although in God the substance of the intellect and its concept are the same so although in God the will and the intellect are the same still inasmuch as love requires by its very nature that it proceed only from the concept of the intellect there is a distinction of order between the procession of love and the procession of the Word in God FOURTH ARTICLE I Q twenty seven Art four Whether the Procession of Love in God Is Generation Objection one It would seem that the procession of love in God is generation For what proceeds by way of likeness of nature among living things is said to be generated and born But what proceeds in God by way of love proceeds in the likeness of nature otherwise it would be extraneous to the divine nature and would be an external procession Therefore what proceeds in God by way of love proceeds as generated and born Obj two Further as similitude is of the nature of the word so does it belong to love Hence it is said that every beast loves its like Ecclus thirteen nineteen Therefore if the Word is begotten and born by way of likeness it seems becoming that love should proceed by way of generation Obj three Further what is not in any species is not in the genus So if there is a procession of love in God there ought to be some special name besides this common name of procession But no other name is applicable but generation Therefore the procession of love in God is generation On the contrary Were this true it would follow that the Holy Ghost Who proceeds as love would proceed as begotten which is against the statement of Athanasius The Holy Ghost is from the Father and the Son not made nor begotten but proceeding I answer that The procession of love in God ought not to be called generation In evidence whereof we must consider that the intellect and the will differ in this respect that the intellect is made actual by the object understood residing according to its own likeness in the intellect whereas the will is made actual not by any similitude of the object willed within it but by its having a certain inclination to the thing willed Thus the procession of the intellect is by way of similitude and is called generation because every generator begets its own like whereas the procession of the will is not by way of similitude but rather by way of impulse and movement towards an object So what proceeds in God by way of love does not proceed as begotten or as son but proceeds rather as spirit which name expresses a certain vital movement and impulse accordingly as anyone is described as moved or impelled by love to perform an action Reply Obj one All that exists in God is one with the divine nature Hence the proper notion of this or that procession by which one procession is distinguished from another cannot be on the part of this unity but the proper notion of this or that procession must be taken from the order of one procession to another which order is derived from the nature of the will and intellect Hence each procession in God takes its name from the proper notion of will and intellect the name being imposed to signify what its nature really is and so it is that the Person proceeding as love receives the divine nature but is not said to be born Reply Obj two Likeness belongs in a different way to the word and to love It belongs to the word as being the likeness of the object understood as the thing generated is the likeness of the generator but it belongs to love not as though love itself were a likeness but because likeness is the principle of loving Thus it does not follow that love is begotten but that the one begotten is the principle of love Reply Obj three We can name God only from creatures Q thirteen A one As in creatures generation is the only principle of communication of nature procession in God has no proper or special name except that of generation Hence the procession which is not generation has remained without a special name but it can be called spiration as it is the procession of the Spirit FIFTH ARTICLE I Q twenty seven Art five Whether There Are More Than Two Processions in God Objection one It would seem that there are more than two processions in God As knowledge and will are attributed to God so is power Therefore if two processions exist in God of intellect and will it seems that there must also be a third procession of power Obj two Further goodness seems to be the greatest principle of procession since goodness is diffusive of itself Therefore there must be a procession of goodness in God Obj three Further in God there is greater power of fecundity than in us But in us there is not only one procession of the word but there are many for in us from one word proceeds another and also from one love proceeds another Therefore in God there are more than two processions On the contrary In God there are not more than two who proceed the Son and the Holy Ghost Therefore there are in Him but two processions I answer that The divine processions can be derived only from the actions which remain within the agent In a nature which is intellectual and in the divine nature these actions are two the acts of intelligence and of will The act of sensation which also appears to be an operation within the agent takes place outside the intellectual nature nor can it be reckoned as wholly removed from the sphere of external actions for the act of sensation is perfected by the action of the sensible object upon sense It follows that no other procession is possible in God but the procession of the Word and of Love Reply Obj one Power is the principle whereby one thing acts on another Hence it is that external action points to power Thus the divine power does not imply the procession of a divine person but is indicated by the procession therefrom of creatures Reply Obj two As Boethius says De Hebdom goodness belongs to the essence and not to the operation unless considered as the object of the will Thus as the divine processions must be denominated from certain actions no other processions can be understood in God according to goodness and the like attributes except those of the Word and of love according as God understands and loves His own essence truth and goodness Reply Obj three As above explained Q fourteen A five Q nineteen A five God understands all things by one simple act and by one act also He wills all things Hence there cannot exist in Him a procession of Word from Word nor of Love from Love for there is in Him only one perfect Word and one perfect Love thereby being manifested His perfect fecundity QUESTION twenty eight THE DIVINE RELATIONS In Four Articles The divine relations are next to be considered in four points of inquiry one Whether there are real relations in God two Whether those relations are the divine essence itself or are extrinsic to it three Whether in God there can be several relations distinct from each other four The number of these relations FIRST ARTICLE I Q twenty eight Art one Whether There Are Real Relations in God Objection one It would seem that there are no real relations in God For Boethius says De Trin iv All possible predicaments used as regards the Godhead refer to the substance for nothing can be predicated relatively But whatever really exists in God can be predicated of Him Therefore no real relation exists in God Obj two Further Boethius says De Trin iv that Relation in the Trinity of the Father to the Son and of both to the Holy Ghost is the relation of the same to the same But a relation of this kind is only a logical one for every real relation requires and implies in reality two terms Therefore the divine relations are not real relations but are formed only by the mind Obj three Further the relation of paternity is the relation of a principle But to say that God is the principle of creatures does not import any real relation but only a logical one Therefore paternity in God is not a real relation while the same applies for the same reason to the other relations in God Obj four Further the divine generation proceeds by way of an intelligible word But the relations following upon the operation of the intellect are logical relations Therefore paternity and filiation in God consequent upon generation are only logical relations On the contrary The Father is denominated only from paternity and the Son only from filiation Therefore if no real paternity or filiation existed in God it would follow that God is not really Father or Son but only in our manner of understanding and this is the Sabellian heresy I answer that relations exist in God really in proof whereof we may consider that in relations alone is found something which is only in the apprehension and not in reality This is not found in any other genus forasmuch as other genera as quantity and quality in their strict and proper meaning signify something inherent in a subject But relation in its own proper meaning signifies only what refers to another Such regard to another exists sometimes in the nature of things as in those things which by their own very nature are ordered to each other and have a mutual inclination and such relations are necessarily real relations as in a heavy body is found an inclination and order to the centre and hence there exists in the heavy body a certain respect in regard to the centre and the same applies to other things Sometimes however this regard to another signified by relation is to be found only in the apprehension of reason comparing one thing to another and this is a logical relation only as for instance when reason compares man to animal as the species to the genus But when something proceeds from a principle of the same nature then both the one proceeding and the source of procession agree in the same order and then they have real relations to each other Therefore as the divine processions are in the identity of the same nature as above explained Q twenty seven AA two four these relations according to the divine processions are necessarily real relations Reply Obj one Relationship is not predicated of God according to its proper and formal meaning that is to say in so far as its proper meaning denotes comparison to that in which relation is inherent but only as denoting regard to another Nevertheless Boethius did not wish to exclude relation in God but he wished to show that it was not to be predicated of Him as regards the mode of inherence in Himself in the strict meaning of relation but rather by way of relation to another Reply Obj two The relation signified by the term the same is a logical relation only if in regard to absolutely the same thing because such a relation can exist only in a certain order observed by reason as regards the order of anything to itself according to some two aspects thereof The case is otherwise however when things are called the same not numerically but generically or specifically Thus Boethius likens the divine relations to a relation of identity not in every respect but only as regards the fact that the substance is not diversified by these relations as neither is it by relation of identity Reply Obj three As the creature proceeds from God in diversity of nature God is outside the order of the whole creation nor does any relation to the creature arise from His nature for He does not produce the creature by necessity of His nature but by His intellect and will as is above explained Q fourteen AA three four Q nineteen A eight Therefore there is no real relation in God to the creature whereas in creatures there is a real relation to God because creatures are contained under the divine order and their very nature entails dependence on God On the other hand the divine processions are in one and the same nature Hence no parallel exists Reply Obj four Relations which result from the mental operation alone in the objects understood are logical relations only inasmuch as reason observes them as existing between two objects perceived by the mind Those relations however which follow the operation of the intellect and which exist between the word intellectually proceeding and the source whence it proceeds are not logical relations only but are real relations inasmuch as the intellect and the reason are real things and are really related to that which proceeds from them intelligibly as a corporeal thing is related to that which proceeds from it corporeally Thus paternity and filiation are real relations in God SECOND ARTICLE I Q twenty eight Art two Whether Relation in God Is the Same As His Essence Objection one It would seem that the divine relation is not the same as the divine essence For Augustine says De Trin v that not all that is said of God is said of His substance for we say some things relatively as Father in respect of the Son but such things do not refer to the substance Therefore the relation is not the divine essence Obj two Further Augustine says De Trin vii that every relative expression is something besides the relation expressed as master is a man and slave is a man Therefore if relations exist in God there must be something else besides relation in God This can only be His essence Therefore essence differs from relation Obj three Further the essence of relation is the being referred to another as the Philosopher says Praedic v So if relation is the divine essence it follows that the divine essence is essentially itself a relation to something else whereas this is repugnant to the perfection of the divine essence which is supremely absolute and self subsisting Q three A four Therefore relation is not the divine essence On the contrary Everything which is not the divine essence is a creature But relation really belongs to God and if it is not the divine essence it is a creature and it cannot claim the adoration of latria contrary to what is sung in the Preface Let us adore the distinction of the Persons and the equality of their Majesty I answer that It is reported that Gilbert de la Porree erred on this point but revoked his error later at the council of Rheims For he said that the divine relations are assistant or externally affixed To perceive the error here expressed we must consider that in each of the nine genera of accidents there are two points for remark One is the nature belonging to each one of them considered as an accident which commonly applies to each of them as inherent in a subject for the essence of an accident is to inhere The other point of remark is the proper nature of each one of these genera In the genera apart from that of relation as in quantity and quality even the true idea of the genus itself is derived from a respect to the subject for quantity is called the measure of substance and quality is the disposition of substance But the true idea of relation is not taken from its respect to that in which it is but from its respect to something outside So if we consider even in creatures relations formally as such in that aspect they are said to be assistant and not intrinsically affixed for in this way they signify a respect which affects a thing related and tends from that thing to something else whereas if relation is considered as an accident it inheres in a subject and has an accidental existence in it Gilbert de la Porree considered relation in the former mode only Now whatever has an accidental existence in creatures when considered as transferred to God has a substantial existence for there is no accident in God since all in Him is His essence So in so far as relation has an accidental existence in creatures relation really existing in God has the existence of the divine essence in no way distinct therefrom But in so far as relation implies respect to something else no respect to the essence is signified but rather to its opposite term Thus it is manifest that relation really existing in God is really the same as His essence and only differs in its mode of intelligibility as in relation is meant that regard to its opposite which is not expressed in the name of essence Thus it is clear that in God relation and essence do not differ from each other but are one and the same Reply Obj one These words of Augustine do not imply that paternity or any other relation which is in God is not in its very being the same as the divine essence but that it is not predicated under the mode of substance as existing in Him to Whom it is applied but as a relation So there are said to be two predicaments only in God since other predicaments import habitude to that of which they are spoken both in their generic and in their specific nature but nothing that exists in God can have any relation to that wherein it exists or of whom it is spoken except the relation of identity and this by reason of God s supreme simplicity Reply Obj two As the relation which exists in creatures involves not only a regard to another but also something absolute so the same applies to God yet not in the same way What is contained in the creature above and beyond what is contained in the meaning of relation is something else besides that relation whereas in God there is no distinction but both are one and the same and this is not perfectly expressed by the word relation as if it were comprehended in the ordinary meaning of that term For it was above explained Q thirteen A two in treating of the divine names that more is contained in the perfection of the divine essence than can be signified by any name Hence it does not follow that there exists in God anything besides relation in reality but only in the various names imposed by us Reply Obj three If the divine perfection contained only what is signified by relative names it would follow that it is imperfect being thus related to something else as in the same way if nothing more were contained in it than what is signified by the word wisdom it would not in that case be a subsistence But as the perfection of the divine essence is greater than can be included in any name it does not follow if a relative term or any other name applied to God signify something imperfect that the divine essence is in any way imperfect for the divine essence comprehends within itself the perfection of every genus Q four A two THIRD ARTICLE I Q twenty eight Art three Whether the Relations in God Are Really Distinguished from Each Other Objection one It would seem that the divine relations are not really distinguished from each other For things which are identified with the same are identified with each other But every relation in God is really the same as the divine essence Therefore the relations are not really distinguished from each other Obj two Further as paternity and filiation are by name distinguished from the divine essence so likewise are goodness and power But this kind of distinction does not make any real distinction of the divine goodness and power Therefore neither does it make any real distinction of paternity and filiation Obj three Further in God there is no real distinction but that of origin But one relation does not seem to arise from another Therefore the relations are not really distinguished from each other On the contrary Boethius says De Trin that in God the substance contains the unity and relation multiplies the trinity Therefore if the relations were not really distinguished from each other there would be no real trinity in God but only an ideal trinity which is the error of Sabellius I answer that The attributing of anything to another involves the attribution likewise of whatever is contained in it So when man is attributed to anyone a rational nature is likewise attributed to him The idea of relation however necessarily means regard of one to another according as one is relatively opposed to another So as in God there is a real relation A one there must also be a real opposition The very nature of relative opposition includes distinction Hence there must be real distinction in God not indeed according to that which is absolute namely essence wherein there is supreme unity and simplicity but according to that which is relative Reply Obj one According to the Philosopher Phys iii this argument holds that whatever things are identified with the same thing are identified with each other if the identity be real and logical as for instance a tunic and a garment but not if they differ logically Hence in the same place he says that although action is the same as motion and likewise passion still it does not follow that action and passion are the same because action implies reference as of something from which there is motion in the thing moved whereas passion implies reference as of something which is from another Likewise although paternity just as filiation is really the same as the divine essence nevertheless these two in their own proper idea and definitions import opposite respects Hence they are distinguished from each other Reply Obj two Power and goodness do not import any opposition in their respective natures and hence there is no parallel argument Reply Obj three Although relations properly speaking do not arise or proceed from each other nevertheless they are considered as opposed according to the procession of one from another FOURTH ARTICLE I Q twenty eight Art three Whether in God There Are Only Four Real Relations Paternity Filiation Spiration and Procession Objection one It would seem that in God there are not only four real relations paternity filiation spiration and procession For it must be observed that in God there exist the relations of the intelligent agent to the object understood and of the one willing to the object willed which are real relations not comprised under those above specified Therefore there are not only four real relations in God Obj two Further real relations in God are understood as coming from the intelligible procession of the Word But intelligible relations are infinitely multiplied as Avicenna says Therefore in God there exists an infinite series of real relations Obj three Further ideas in God are eternal Q fifteen A one and are only distinguished from each other by reason of their regard to things as above stated Therefore in God there are many more eternal relations Obj four Further equality and likeness and identity are relations and they are in God from eternity Therefore several more relations are eternal in God than the above named Obj five Further it may also contrariwise be said that there are fewer relations in God than those above named For according to the Philosopher Phys iii text twenty four It is the same way from Athens to Thebes as from Thebes to Athens By the same way of reasoning there is the same relation from the Father to the Son that of paternity and from the Son to the Father that of filiation and thus there are not four relations in God I answer that According to the Philosopher Metaph v every relation is based either on quantity as double and half or on action and passion as the doer and the deed the father and the son the master and the servant and the like Now as there is no quantity in God for He is great without quantity as Augustine says De Trin i one it follows that a real relation in God can be based only on action Such relations are not based on the actions of God according to any extrinsic procession forasmuch as the relations of God to creatures are not real in Him Q thirteen A seven Hence it follows that real relations in God can be understood only in regard to those actions according to which there are internal and not external processions in God These processions are two only as above explained Q twenty seven A five one derived from the action of the intellect the procession of the Word and the other from the action of the will the procession of love In respect of each of these processions two opposite relations arise one of which is the relation of the person proceeding from the principle the other is the relation of the principle Himself The procession of the Word is called generation in the proper sense of the term whereby it is applied to living things Now the relation of the principle of generation in perfect living beings is called paternity and the relation of the one proceeding from the principle is called filiation But the procession of Love has no proper name of its own Q twenty seven A four and so neither have the ensuing relations a proper name of their own The relation of the principle of this procession is called spiration and the relation of the person proceeding is called procession although these two names belong to the processions or origins themselves and not to the relations Reply Obj one In those things in which there is a difference between the intellect and its object and the will and its object there can be a real relation both of science to its object and of the willer to the object willed In God however the intellect and its object are one and the same because by understanding Himself God understands all other things and the same applies to His will and the object that He wills Hence it follows that in God these kinds of relations are not real as neither is the relation of a thing to itself Nevertheless the relation to the word is a real relation because the word is understood as proceeding by an intelligible action and not as a thing understood For when we understand a stone that which the intellect conceives from the thing understood is called the word Reply Obj two Intelligible relations in ourselves are infinitely multiplied because a man understands a stone by one act and by another act understands that he understands the stone and again by another understands that he understands this thus the acts of understanding are infinitely multiplied and consequently also the relations understood This does not apply to God inasmuch as He understands all things by one act alone Reply Obj three Ideal relations exist as understood by God Hence it does not follow from their plurality that there are many relations in God but that God knows these many relations Reply Obj four Equality and similitude in God are not real relations but are only logical relations Q forty two A three ad four Reply Obj five The way from one term to another and conversely is the same nevertheless the mutual relations are not the same Hence we cannot conclude that the relation of the father to the son is the same as that of the son to the father but we could conclude this of something absolute if there were such between them QUESTION twenty nine THE DIVINE PERSONS In Four Articles Having premised what have appeared necessary notions concerning the processions and the relations we must now approach the subject of the persons First we shall consider the persons absolutely and then comparatively as regards each other We must consider the persons absolutely first in common and then singly The general consideration of the persons seemingly involves four points one The signification of this word person two the number of the persons three what is involved in the number of persons or is opposed thereto as diversity and similitude and the like and four what belongs to our knowledge of the persons Four subjects of inquiry are comprised in the first point one The definition of person two The comparison of person to essence subsistence and hypostasis three Whether the name of person is becoming to God four What does it signify in Him FIRST ARTICLE I Q twenty nine Art one The Definition of Person Objection one It would seem that the definition of person given by Boethius De Duab Nat is insufficient that is a person is an individual substance of a rational nature For nothing singular can be subject to definition But person signifies something singular Therefore person is improperly defined Obj two Further substance as placed above in the definition of person is either first substance or second substance If it is the former the word individual is superfluous because first substance is individual substance if it stands for second substance the word individual is false for there is contradiction of terms since second substances are the genera or species Therefore this definition is incorrect Obj three Further an intentional term must not be included in the definition of a thing For to define a man as a species of animal would not be a correct definition since man is the name of a thing and species is a name of an intention Therefore since person is the name of a thing for it signifies a substance of a rational nature the word individual which is an intentional name comes improperly into the definition Obj four Further Nature is the principle of motion and rest in those things in which it is essentially and not accidentally as Aristotle says Phys ii But person exists in things immovable as in God and in the angels Therefore the word nature ought not to enter into the definition of person but the word should rather be essence Obj five Further the separated soul is an individual substance of the rational nature but it is not a person Therefore person is not properly defined as above I answer that Although the universal and particular exist in every genus nevertheless in a certain special way the individual belongs to the genus of substance For substance is individualized by itself whereas the accidents are individualized by the subject which is the substance since this particular whiteness is called this because it exists in this particular subject And so it is reasonable that the individuals of the genus substance should have a special name of their own for they are called hypostases or first substances Further still in a more special and perfect way the particular and the individual are found in the rational substances which have dominion over their own actions and which are not only made to act like others but which can act of themselves for actions belong to singulars Therefore also the individuals of the rational nature have a special name even among other substances and this name is person Thus the term individual substance is placed in the definition of person as signifying the singular in the genus of substance and the term rational nature is added as signifying the singular in rational substances Reply Obj one Although this or that singular may not be definable yet what belongs to the general idea of singularity can be defined and so the Philosopher De Praedic cap De substantia gives a definition of first substance and in this way Boethius defines person Reply Obj two In the opinion of some the term substance in the definition of person stands for first substance which is the hypostasis nor is the term individual superfluously added forasmuch as by the name of hypostasis or first substance the idea of universality and of part is excluded For we do not say that man in general is an hypostasis nor that the hand is since it is only a part But where individual is added the idea of assumptibility is excluded from person for the human nature in Christ is not a person since it is assumed by a greater that is by the Word of God It is however better to say that substance is here taken in a general sense as divided into first and second and when individual is added it is restricted to first substance Reply Obj three Substantial differences being unknown to us or at least unnamed by us it is sometimes necessary to use accidental differences in the place of substantial as for example we may say that fire is a simple hot and dry body for proper accidents are the effects of substantial forms and make them known Likewise terms expressive of intention can be used in defining realities if used to signify things which are unnamed And so the term individual is placed in the definition of person to signify the mode of subsistence which belongs to particular substances Reply Obj four According to the Philosopher Metaph v five the word nature was first used to signify the generation of living things which is called nativity And because this kind of generation comes from an intrinsic principle this term is extended to signify the intrinsic principle of any kind of movement In this sense he defines nature Phys ii three And since this kind of principle is either formal or material both matter and form are commonly called nature And as the essence of anything is completed by the form so the essence of anything signified by the definition is commonly called nature And here nature is taken in that sense Hence Boethius says De Duab Nat that nature is the specific difference giving its form to each thing for the specific difference completes the definition and is derived from the special form of a thing So in the definition of person which means the singular in a determined genus it is more correct to use the term nature than essence because the latter is taken from being which is most common Reply Obj five The soul is a part of the human species and so although it may exist in a separate state yet since it ever retains its nature of unibility it cannot be called an individual substance which is the hypostasis or first substance as neither can the hand nor any other part of man thus neither the definition nor the name of person belongs to it SECOND ARTICLE I Q twenty nine Art two Whether Person Is the Same As Hypostasis Subsistence and Essence Objection one It would seem that person is the same as hypostasis subsistence and essence For Boethius says De Duab Nat that the Greeks called the individual substance of the rational nature by the name hypostasis But this with us signifies person Therefore person is altogether the same as hypostasis Obj two Further as we say there are three persons in God so we say there are three subsistences in God which implies that person and subsistence have the same meaning Therefore person and subsistence mean the same Obj three Further Boethius says Com Praed that the Greek ousia which means essence signifies a being composed of matter and form Now that which is composed of matter and form is the individual substance called hypostasis and person Therefore all the aforesaid names seem to have the same meaning Obj four On the contrary Boethius says De Duab Nat that genera and species only subsist whereas individuals are not only subsistent but also substand But subsistences are so called from subsisting as substance or hypostasis is so called from substanding Therefore since genera and species are not hypostases or persons these are not the same as subsistences Obj five Further Boethius says Com Praed that matter is called hypostasis and form is called ousiosis that is subsistence But neither form nor matter can be called person Therefore person differs from the others I answer that According to the Philosopher Metaph v substance is twofold In one sense it means the quiddity of a thing signified by its definition and thus we say that the definition means the substance of a thing in which sense substance is called by the Greeks ousia what we may call essence In another sense substance means a subject or suppositum which subsists in the genus of substance To this taken in a general sense can be applied a name expressive of an intention and thus it is called suppositum It is also called by three names signifying a reality that is a thing of nature subsistence and hypostasis according to a threefold consideration of the substance thus named For as it exists in itself and not in another it is called subsistence as we say that those things subsist which exist in themselves and not in another As it underlies some common nature it is called a thing of nature as for instance this particular man is a human natural thing As it underlies the accidents it is called hypostasis or substance What these three names signify in common to the whole genus of substances this name person signifies in the genus of rational substances Reply Obj one Among the Greeks the term hypostasis taken in the strict interpretation of the word signifies any individual of the genus substance but in the usual way of speaking it means the individual of the rational nature by reason of the excellence of that nature Reply Obj two As we say three persons plurally in God and three subsistences so the Greeks say three hypostases But because the word substance which properly speaking corresponds in meaning to hypostasis is used among us in an equivocal sense since it sometimes means essence and sometimes means hypostasis in order to avoid any occasion of error it was thought preferable to use subsistence for hypostasis rather than substance Reply Obj three Strictly speaking the essence is what is expressed by the definition Now the definition comprises the principles of the species but not the individual principles Hence in things composed of matter and form the essence signifies not only the form nor only the matter but what is composed of matter and the common form as the principles of the species But what is composed of this matter and this form has the nature of hypostasis and person For soul flesh and bone belong to the nature of man whereas this soul this flesh and this bone belong to the nature of this man Therefore hypostasis and person add the individual principles to the idea of essence nor are these identified with the essence in things composed of matter and form as we said above when treating of divine simplicity Q three A three Reply Obj four Boethius says that genera and species subsist inasmuch as it belongs to some individual things to subsist from the fact that they belong to genera and species comprised in the predicament of substance but not because the species and genera themselves subsist except in the opinion of Plato who asserted that the species of things subsisted separately from singular things To substand however belongs to the same individual things in relation to the accidents which are outside the essence of genera and species Reply Obj five The individual composed of matter and form substands in relation to accident from the very nature of matter Hence Boethius says De Trin A simple form cannot be a subject Its self subsistence is derived from the nature of its form which does not supervene to the things subsisting but gives actual existence to the matter and makes it subsist as an individual On this account therefore he ascribes hypostasis to matter and ousiosis or subsistence to the form because the matter is the principle of substanding and form is the principle of subsisting THIRD ARTICLE I Q twenty nine Art three Whether the Word Person Should Be Said of God Objection one It would seem that the name person should not be said of God For Dionysius says Div Nom No one should ever dare to say or think anything of the supersubstantial and hidden Divinity beyond what has been divinely expressed to us by the oracles But the name person is not expressed to us in the Old or New Testament Therefore person is not to be applied to God Obj two Further Boethius says De Duab Nat The word person seems to be taken from those persons who represented men in comedies and tragedies For person comes from sounding through personando since a greater volume of sound is produced through the cavity in the mask These persons or masks the Greeks called prosopa as they were placed on the face and covered the features before the eyes This however can apply to God only in a metaphorical sense Therefore the word person is only applied to God metaphorically Obj three Further every person is a hypostasis But the word hypostasis does not apply to God since as Boethius says De Duab Nat it signifies what is the subject of accidents which do not exist in God Jerome also says Ep ad Damas that in this word hypostasis poison lurks in honey Therefore the word person should not be said of God Obj four Further if a definition is denied of anything the thing defined is also denied of it But the definition of person as given above does not apply to God Both because reason implies a discursive knowledge which does not apply to God as we proved above Q fourteen A twelve and thus God cannot be said to have a rational nature And also because God cannot be called an individual substance since the principle of individuation is matter while God is immaterial nor is He the subject of accidents so as to be called a substance Therefore the word person ought not to be attributed to God On the contrary In the Creed of Athanasius we say One is the person of the Father another of the Son another of the Holy Ghost I answer that Person signifies what is most perfect in all nature that is a subsistent individual of a rational nature Hence since everything that is perfect must be attributed to God forasmuch as His essence contains every perfection this name person is fittingly applied to God not however as it is applied to creatures but in a more excellent way as other names also which while giving them to creatures we attribute to God as we showed above when treating of the names of God Q thirteen A two Reply Obj one Although the word person is not found applied to God in Scripture either in the Old or New Testament nevertheless what the word signifies is found to be affirmed of God in many places of Scripture as that He is the supreme self subsisting being and the most perfectly intelligent being If we could speak of God only in the very terms themselves of Scripture it would follow that no one could speak about God in any but the original language of the Old or New Testament The urgency of confuting heretics made it necessary to find new words to express the ancient faith about God Nor is such a kind of novelty to be shunned since it is by no means profane for it does not lead us astray from the sense of Scripture The Apostle warns us to avoid profane novelties of words one Tim six twenty Reply Obj two Although this name person may not belong to God as regards the origin of the term nevertheless it excellently belongs to God in its objective meaning For as famous men were represented in comedies and tragedies the name person was given to signify those who held high dignity Hence those who held high rank in the Church came to be called persons Thence by some the definition of person is given as hypostasis distinct by reason of dignity And because subsistence in a rational nature is of high dignity therefore every individual of the rational nature is called a person Now the dignity of the divine nature excels every other dignity and thus the name person pre eminently belongs to God Reply Obj three The word hypostasis does not apply to God as regards its source of origin since He does not underlie accidents but it applies to Him in its objective sense for it is imposed to signify the subsistence Jerome said that poison lurks in this word forasmuch as before it was fully understood by the Latins the heretics used this term to deceive the simple to make people profess many essences as they profess several hypostases inasmuch as the word substance which corresponds to hypostasis in Greek is commonly taken amongst us to mean essence Reply Obj four It may be said that God has a rational nature if reason be taken to mean not discursive thought but in a general sense an intelligent nature But God cannot be called an individual in the sense that His individuality comes from matter but only in the sense which implies incommunicability Substance can be applied to God in the sense of signifying self subsistence There are some however who say that the definition of Boethius quoted above A one is not a definition of person in the sense we use when speaking of persons in God Therefore Richard of saint Victor amends this definition by adding that Person in God is the incommunicable existence of the divine nature FOURTH ARTICLE I Q twenty nine Art four Whether This Word Person Signifies Relation Objection one It would seem that this word person as applied to God does not signify relation but substance For Augustine says De Trin vii six When we speak of the person of the Father we mean nothing else but the substance of the Father for person is said in regard to Himself and not in regard to the Son Obj two Further the interrogation What refers to essence But as Augustine says When we say there are three who bear witness in heaven the Father the Word and the Holy Ghost and it is asked Three what the answer is Three persons Therefore person signifies essence Obj three According to the Philosopher Metaph iv the meaning of a word is its definition But the definition of person is this The individual substance of the rational nature as above stated Therefore person signifies substance Obj four Further person in men and angels does not signify relation but something absolute Therefore if in God it signified relation it would bear an equivocal meaning in God in man and in angels On the contrary Boethius says De Trin that every word that refers to the persons signifies relation But no word belongs to person more strictly than the very word person itself Therefore this word person signifies relation I answer that A difficulty arises concerning the meaning of this word person in God from the fact that it is predicated plurally of the Three in contrast to the nature of the names belonging to the essence nor does it in itself refer to another as do the words which express relation Hence some have thought that this word person of itself expresses absolutely the divine essence as this name God and this word Wise but that to meet heretical attack it was ordained by conciliar decree that it was to be taken in a relative sense and especially in the plural or with the addition of a distinguishing adjective as when we say Three persons or one is the person of the Father another of the Son et cetera Used however in the singular it may be either absolute or relative But this does not seem to be a satisfactory explanation for if this word person by force of its own signification expresses the divine essence only it follows that forasmuch as we speak of three persons so far from the heretics being silenced they had still more reason to argue Seeing this others maintained that this word person in God signifies both the essence and the relation Some of these said that it signifies directly the essence and relation indirectly forasmuch as person means as it were by itself one per se una and unity belongs to the essence And what is by itself implies relation indirectly for the Father is understood to exist by Himself as relatively distinct from the Son Others however said on the contrary that it signifies relation directly and essence indirectly forasmuch as in the definition of person the term nature is mentioned indirectly and these come nearer to the truth To determine the question we must consider that something may be included in the meaning of a less common term which is not included in the more common term as rational is included in the meaning of man and not in the meaning of animal So that it is one thing to ask the meaning of the word animal and another to ask its meaning when the animal in question is man Also it is one thing to ask the meaning of this word person in general and another to ask the meaning of person as applied to God For person in general signifies the individual substance of a rational figure The individual in itself is undivided but is distinct from others Therefore person in any nature signifies what is distinct in that nature thus in human nature it signifies this flesh these bones and this soul which are the individuating principles of a man and which though not belonging to person in general nevertheless do belong to the meaning of a particular human person Now distinction in God is only by relation of origin as stated above Q twenty eight AA two three while relation in God is not as an accident in a subject but is the divine essence itself and so it is subsistent for the divine essence subsists Therefore as the Godhead is God so the divine paternity is God the Father Who is a divine person Therefore a divine person signifies a relation as subsisting And this is to signify relation by way of substance and such a relation is a hypostasis subsisting in the divine nature although in truth that which subsists in the divine nature is the divine nature itself Thus it is true to say that the name person signifies relation directly and the essence indirectly not however the relation as such but as expressed by way of a hypostasis So likewise it signifies directly the essence and indirectly the relation inasmuch as the essence is the same as the hypostasis while in God the hypostasis is expressed as distinct by the relation and thus relation as such enters into the notion of the person indirectly Thus we can say that this signification of the word person was not clearly perceived before it was attacked by heretics Hence this word person was used just as any other absolute term But afterwards it was applied to express relation as it lent itself to that signification so that this word person means relation not only by use and custom according to the first opinion but also by force of its own proper signification Reply Obj one This word person is said in respect to itself not to another forasmuch as it signifies relation not as such but by way of a substance which is a hypostasis In that sense Augustine says that it signifies the essence inasmuch as in God essence is the same as the hypostasis because in God what He is and whereby He is are the same Reply Obj two The term what refers sometimes to the nature expressed by the definition as when we ask What is man and we answer A mortal rational animal Sometimes it refers to the suppositum as when we ask What swims in the sea and answer A fish So to those who ask Three what we answer Three persons Reply Obj three In God the individual i e distinct and incommunicable substance includes the idea of relation as above explained Reply Obj four The different sense of the less common term does not produce equivocation in the more common Although a horse and an ass have their own proper definitions nevertheless they agree univocally in animal because the common definition of animal applies to both So it does not follow that although relation is contained in the signification of divine person but not in that of an angelic or of a human person the word person is used in an equivocal sense Though neither is it applied univocally since nothing can be said univocally of God and creatures Q thirteen A five QUESTION thirty THE PLURALITY OF PERSONS IN GOD In Four Articles We are now led to consider the plurality of the persons about which there are four points of inquiry one Whether there are several persons in God two How many are they three What the numeral terms signify in God four The community of the term person FIRST ARTICLE I Q thirty Art one Whether There Are Several Persons in God Objection one It would seem that there are not several persons in God For person is the individual substance of a rational nature If then there are several persons in God there must be several substances which appears to be heretical Obj two Further Plurality of absolute properties does not make a distinction of persons either in God or in ourselves Much less therefore is this effected by a plurality of relations But in God there is no plurality but of relations Q twenty eight A three Therefore there cannot be several persons in God Obj three Further Boethius says of God De Trin i that this is truly one which has no number But plurality implies number Therefore there are not several persons in God Obj four Further where number is there is whole and part Thus if in God there exist a number of persons there must be whole and part in God which is inconsistent with the divine simplicity On the contrary Athanasius says One is the person of the Father another of the Son another of the Holy Ghost Therefore the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are several persons I answer that It follows from what precedes that there are several persons in God For it was shown above Q twenty nine A four that this word person signifies in God a relation as subsisting in the divine nature It was also established Q twenty eight A one that there are several real relations in God and hence it follows that there are also several realities subsistent in the divine nature which means that there are several persons in God Reply Obj one The definition of person includes substance not as meaning the essence but the suppositum which is made clear by the addition of the term individual To signify the substance thus understood the Greeks use the name hypostasis So as we say Three persons they say Three hypostases We are not however accustomed to say Three substances lest we be understood to mean three essences or natures by reason of the equivocal signification of the term Reply Obj two The absolute properties in God such as goodness and wisdom are not mutually opposed and hence neither are they really distinguished from each other Therefore although they subsist nevertheless they are not several subsistent realities that is several persons But the absolute properties in creatures do not subsist although they are really distinguished from each other as whiteness and sweetness on the other hand the relative properties in God subsist and are really distinguished from each other Q twenty eight A three Hence the plurality of persons in God Reply Obj three The supreme unity and simplicity of God exclude every kind of plurality of absolute things but not plurality of relations Because relations are predicated relatively and thus the relations do not import composition in that of which they are predicated as Boethius teaches in the same book Reply Obj four Number is twofold simple or absolute as two and three and four and number as existing in things numbered as two men and two horses So if number in God is taken absolutely or abstractedly there is nothing to prevent whole and part from being in Him and thus number in Him is only in our way of understanding forasmuch as number regarded apart from things numbered exists only in the intellect But if number be taken as it is in the things numbered in that sense as existing in creatures one is part of two and two of three as one man is part of two men and two of three but this does not apply to God because the Father is of the same magnitude as the whole Trinity as we shall show further on Q forty two AA one four SECOND ARTICLE I Q thirty Art two Whether There Are More Than Three Persons in God Objection one It would seem that there are more than three persons in God For the plurality of persons in God arises from the plurality of the relative properties as stated above A one But there are four relations in God as stated above Q twenty eight A four paternity filiation common spiration and procession Therefore there are four persons in God Obj two The nature of God does not differ from His will more than from His intellect But in God one person proceeds from the will as love and another proceeds from His nature as Son Therefore another proceeds from His intellect as Word besides the one Who proceeds from His nature as Son thus again it follows that there are not only three persons in God Obj three Further the more perfect a creature is the more interior operations it has as a man has understanding and will beyond other animals But God infinitely excels every creature Therefore in God not only is there a person proceeding from the will and another from the intellect but also in an infinite number of ways Therefore there are an infinite number of persons in God Obj four Further it is from the infinite goodness of the Father that He communicates Himself infinitely in the production of a divine person But also in the Holy Ghost is infinite goodness Therefore the Holy Ghost produces a divine person and that person another and so to infinity Obj five Further everything within a determinate number is measured for number is a measure But the divine persons are immense as we say in the Creed of Athanasius The Father is immense the Son is immense the Holy Ghost is immense Therefore the persons are not contained within the number three On the contrary It is said There are three who bear witness in heaven the Father the Word and the Holy Ghost one John five seven To those who ask Three what we answer with Augustine De Trin vii four Three persons Therefore there are but three persons in God I answer that As was explained above there can be only three persons in God For it was shown above that the several persons are the several subsisting relations really distinct from each other But a real distinction between the divine relations can come only from relative opposition Therefore two opposite relations must needs refer to two persons and if any relations are not opposite they must needs belong to the same person Since then paternity and filiation are opposite relations they belong necessarily to two persons Therefore the subsisting paternity is the person of the Father and the subsisting filiation is the person of the Son The other two relations are not opposed to each other therefore these two cannot belong to one person hence either one of them must belong to both of the aforesaid persons or one must belong to one person and the other to the other Now procession cannot belong to the Father and the Son or to either of them for thus it would follows that the procession of the intellect which in God is generation wherefrom paternity and filiation are derived would issue from the procession of love whence spiration and procession are derived if the person generating and the person generated proceeded from the person spirating and this is against what was laid down above Q twenty seven AA three four We must consequently admit that spiration belongs to the person of the Father and to the person of the Son forasmuch as it has no relative opposition either to paternity or to filiation and consequently that procession belongs to the other person who is called the person of the Holy Ghost who proceeds by way of love as above explained Therefore only three persons exist in God the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost Reply Obj one Although there are four relations in God one of them spiration is not separated from the person of the Father and of the Son but belongs to both thus although it is a relation it is not called a property because it does not belong to only one person nor is it a personal relation i e constituting a person The three relations paternity filiation and procession are called personal properties constituting as it were the persons for paternity is the person of the Father filiation is the person of the Son procession is the person of the Holy Ghost proceeding Reply Obj two That which proceeds by way of intelligence as word proceeds according to similitude as also that which proceeds by way of nature thus as above explained Q twenty seven A three the procession of the divine Word is the very same as generation by way of nature But love as such does not proceed as the similitude of that whence it proceeds although in God love is company essential as being divine and therefore the procession of love is not called generation in God Reply Obj three As man is more perfect than other animals he has more intrinsic operations than other animals because his perfection is something composite Hence the angels who are more perfect and more simple have fewer intrinsic operations than man for they have no imagination or feeling or the like In God there exists only one real operation that is His essence How there are in Him two processions was above explained Q twenty seven AA one four Reply Obj four This argument would prove if the Holy Ghost possessed another goodness apart from the goodness of the Father for then if the Father produced a divine person by His goodness the Holy Ghost also would do so But the Father and the Holy Ghost have one and the same goodness Nor is there any distinction between them except by the personal relations So goodness belongs to the Holy Ghost as derived from another and it belongs to the Father as the principle of its communication to another The opposition of relation does not allow the relation of the Holy Ghost to be joined with the relation of principle of another divine person because He Himself proceeds from the other persons who are in God Reply Obj five A determinate number if taken as a simple number existing in the mind only is measured by one But when we speak of a number of things as applied to the persons in God the notion of measure has no place because the magnitude of the three persons is the same Q forty two AA one four and the same is not measured by the same THIRD ARTICLE I Q thirty Art three Whether the Numeral Terms Denote Anything Real in God Objection one It would seem that the numeral terms denote something real in God For the divine unity is the divine essence But every number is unity repeated Therefore every numeral term in God signifies the essence and therefore it denotes something real in God Obj two Further whatever is said of God and of creatures belongs to God in a more eminent manner than to creatures But the numeral terms denote something real in creatures therefore much more so in God Obj three Further if the numeral terms do not denote anything real in God and are introduced simply in a negative and removing sense as plurality is employed to remove unity and unity to remove plurality it follows that a vicious circle results confusing the mind and obscuring the truth and this ought not to be Therefore it must be said that the numeral terms denote something real in God On the contrary Hilary says De Trin iv If we admit companionship that is plurality we exclude the idea of oneness and of solitude and Ambrose says De Fide i When we say one God unity excludes plurality of gods and does not imply quantity in God Hence we see that these terms are applied to God in order to remove something and not to denote anything positive I answer that The Master Sent i D twenty four considers that the numeral terms do not denote anything positive in God but have only a negative meaning Others however assert the contrary In order to resolve this point we may observe that all plurality is a consequence of division Now division is twofold one is material and is division of the continuous from this results number which is a species of quantity Number in this sense is found only in material things which have quantity The other kind of division is called formal and is effected by opposite or diverse forms and this kind of division results in a multitude which does not belong to a genus but is transcendental in the sense in which being is divided by one and by many This kind of multitude is found only in immaterial things Some considering only that multitude which is a species of discrete quantity and seeing that such kind of quantity has no place in God asserted that the numeral terms do not denote anything real in God but remove something from Him Others considering the same kind of multitude said that as knowledge exists in God according to the strict sense of the word but not in the sense of its genus as in God there is no such thing as a quality so number exists in God in the proper sense of number but not in the sense of its genus which is quantity But we say that numeral terms predicated of God are not derived from number a species of quantity for in that sense they could bear only a metaphorical sense in God like other corporeal properties such as length breadth and the like but that they are taken from multitude in a transcendent sense Now multitude so understood has relation to the many of which it is predicated as one convertible with being is related to being which kind of oneness does not add anything to being except a negation of division as we saw when treating of the divine unity Q eleven A one for one signifies undivided being So of whatever we say one we imply its undivided reality thus for instance one applied to man signifies the undivided nature or substance of a man In the same way when we speak of many things multitude in this latter sense points to those things as being each undivided in itself But number if taken as a species of quantity denotes an accident added to being as also does one which is the principle of that number Therefore the numeral terms in God signify the things of which they are said and beyond this they add negation only as stated Sent i D twenty four in which respect the Master was right Sent i D twenty four So when we say the essence is one the term one signifies the essence undivided and when we say the person is one it signifies the person undivided and when we say the persons are many we signify those persons and their individual undividedness for it is of the very nature of multitude that it should be composed of units Reply Obj one One as it is a transcendental is wider and more general than substance and relation And so likewise is multitude hence in God it may mean both substance and relation according to the context Still the very signification of such names adds a negation of division beyond substance and relation as was explained above Reply Obj two Multitude which denotes something real in creatures is a species of quantity and cannot be used when speaking of God unlike transcendental multitude which adds only indivision to those of which it is predicated Such a kind of multitude is applicable to God Reply Obj three One does not exclude multitude but division which logically precedes one or multitude Multitude does not remove unity but division from each of the individuals which compose the multitude This was explained when we treated of the divine unity Q eleven A two It must be observed nevertheless that the opposite arguments do not sufficiently prove the point advanced Although the idea of solitude is excluded by plurality and the plurality of gods by unity it does not follow that these terms express this signification alone For blackness is excluded by whiteness nevertheless the term whiteness does not signify the mere exclusion of blackness FOURTH ARTICLE I Q thirty Art four Whether This Term Person Can Be Common to the Three Persons Objection one It would seem that this term person cannot be common to the three persons For nothing is common to the three persons but the essence But this term person does not signify the essence directly Therefore it is not common to all three Obj two Further the common is the opposite to the incommunicable But the very meaning of person is that it is incommunicable as appears from the definition given by Richard of saint Victor Q twenty nine A three ad four Therefore this term person is not common to all the three persons Obj three Further if the name person is common to the three it is common either really or logically But it is not so really otherwise the three persons would be one person nor again is it so logically otherwise person would be a universal But in God there is neither universal nor particular neither genus nor species as we proved above Q three A five Therefore this term person is not common to the three On the contrary Augustine says De Trin vii four that when we ask Three what we say Three persons because what a person is is common to them I answer that The very mode of expression itself shows that this term person is common to the three when we say three persons for when we say three men we show that man is common to the three Now it is clear that this is not community of a real thing as if one essence were common to the three otherwise there would be only one person of the three as also one essence What is meant by such a community has been variously determined by those who have examined the subject Some have called it a community of exclusion forasmuch as the definition of person contains the word incommunicable Others thought it to be a community of intention as the definition of person contains the word individual as we say that to be a species is common to horse and ox Both of these explanations however are excluded by the fact that person is not a name of exclusion nor of intention but the name of a reality We must therefore resolve that even in human affairs this name person is common by a community of idea not as genus or species but as a vague individual thing The names of genera and species as man or animal are given to signify the common natures themselves but not the intentions of those common natures signified by the terms genus or species The vague individual thing as some man signifies the common nature with the determinate mode of existence of singular things that is something self subsisting as distinct from others But the name of a designated singular thing signifies that which distinguishes the determinate thing as the name Socrates signifies this flesh and this bone But there is this difference that the term some man signifies the nature or the individual on the part of its nature with the mode of existence of singular things while this name person is not given to signify the individual on the part of the nature but the subsistent reality in that nature Now this is common in idea to the divine persons that each of them subsists distinctly from the others in the divine nature Thus this name person is common in idea to the three divine persons Reply Obj one This argument is founded on a real community Reply Obj two Although person is incommunicable yet the mode itself of incommunicable existence can be common to many Reply Obj three Although this community is logical and not real yet it does not follow that in God there is universal or particular or genus or species both because neither in human affairs is the community of person the same as community of genus or species and because the divine persons have one being whereas genus and species and every other universal are predicated of many which differ in being QUESTION thirty one OF WHAT BELONGS TO THE UNITY OR PLURALITY IN GOD In Four Articles We now consider what belongs to the unity or plurality in God which gives rise to four points of inquiry one Concerning the word Trinity two Whether we can say that the Son is other than the Father three Whether an exclusive term which seems to exclude otherness can be joined to an essential name in God four Whether it can be joined to a personal term FIRST ARTICLE I Q thirty one Art one Whether There Is Trinity in God Objection one It would seem there is not trinity in God For every name in God signifies substance or relation But this name Trinity does not signify the substance otherwise it would be predicated of each one of the persons nor does it signify relation for it does not express a name that refers to another Therefore the word Trinity is not to be applied to God Obj two Further this word trinity is a collective term since it signifies multitude But such a word does not apply to God as the unity of a collective name is the least of unities whereas in God there exists the greatest possible unity Therefore this word trinity does not apply to God Obj three Further every trine is threefold But in God there is not triplicity since triplicity is a kind of inequality Therefore neither is there trinity in God Obj four Further all that exists in God exists in the unity of the divine essence because God is His own essence Therefore if Trinity exists in God it exists in the unity of the divine essence and thus in God there would be three essential unities which is heresy Obj five Further in all that is said of God the concrete is predicated of the abstract for Deity is God and paternity is the Father But the Trinity cannot be called trine otherwise there would be nine realities in God which of course is erroneous Therefore the word trinity is not to be applied to God On the contrary Athanasius says Unity in Trinity and Trinity in Unity is to be revered I answer that The name Trinity in God signifies the determinate number of persons And so the plurality of persons in God requires that we should use the word trinity because what is indeterminately signified by plurality is signified by trinity in a determinate manner Reply Obj one In its etymological sense this word Trinity seems to signify the one essence of the three persons according as trinity may mean trine unity But in the strict meaning of the term it rather signifies the number of persons of one essence and on this account we cannot say that the Father is the Trinity as He is not three persons Yet it does not mean the relations themselves of the Persons but rather the number of persons related to each other and hence it is that the word in itself does not express regard to another Reply Obj two Two things are implied in a collective term plurality of the supposita and a unity of some kind of order For people is a multitude of men comprehended under a certain order In the first sense this word trinity is like other collective words but in the second sense it differs from them because in the divine Trinity not only is there unity of order but also with this there is unity of essence Reply Obj three Trinity is taken in an absolute sense for it signifies the threefold number of persons Triplicity signifies a proportion of inequality for it is a species of unequal proportion according to Boethius Arithm i twenty three Therefore in God there is not triplicity but Trinity Reply Obj four In the divine Trinity is to be understood both number and the persons numbered So when we say Trinity in Unity we do not place number in the unity of the essence as if we meant three times one but we place the Persons numbered in the unity of nature as the supposita of a nature are said to exist in that nature On the other hand we say Unity in Trinity meaning that the nature is in its supposita Reply Obj five When we say Trinity is trine by reason of the number implied we signify the multiplication of that number by itself since the word trine imports a distinction in the supposita of which it is spoken Therefore it cannot be said that the Trinity is trine otherwise it follows that if the Trinity be trine there would be three supposita of the Trinity as when we say God is trine it follows that there are three supposita of the Godhead SECOND ARTICLE I Q thirty one Art two Whether the Son Is Other Than the Father Objection one It would seem that the Son is not other than the Father For other is a relative term implying diversity of substance If then the Son is other than the Father He must be different from the Father which is contrary to what Augustine says De Trin vii that when we speak of three persons we do not mean to imply diversity Obj two Further whosoever are other from one another differ in some way from one another Therefore if the Son is other than the Father it follows that He differs from the Father which is against what Ambrose says De Fide i that the Father and the Son are one in Godhead nor is there any difference in substance between them nor any diversity Obj three Further the term alien is taken from alius other But the Son is not alien from the Father for Hilary says De Trin vii that in the divine persons there is nothing diverse nothing alien nothing separable Therefore the Son is not other than the Father Obj four Further the terms other person and other thing alius et aliud have the same meaning differing only in gender So if the Son is another person from the Father it follows that the Son is a thing apart from the Father On the contrary Augustine Fulgentius De Fide ad Petrum i says There is one essence of the Father and Son and Holy Ghost in which the Father is not one thing the Son another and the Holy Ghost another although the Father is one person the Son another and the Holy Ghost another I answer that Since as Jerome remarks In substance Ep lvii a heresy arises from words wrongly used when we speak of the Trinity we must proceed with care and with befitting modesty because as Augustine says De Trin i three nowhere is error more harmful the quest more toilsome the finding more fruitful Now in treating of the Trinity we must beware of two opposite errors and proceed cautiously between them namely the error of Arius who placed a Trinity of substance with the Trinity of persons and the error of Sabellius who placed unity of person with the unity of essence Thus to avoid the error of Arius we must shun the use of the terms diversity and difference in God lest we take away the unity of essence we may however use the term distinction on account of the relative opposition Hence whenever we find terms of diversity or difference of Persons used in an authentic work these terms of diversity or difference are taken to mean distinction But lest the simplicity and singleness of the divine essence be taken away the terms separation and division which belong to the parts of a whole are to be avoided and lest quality be taken away we avoid the use of the term disparity and lest we remove similitude we avoid the terms alien and discrepant For Ambrose says De Fide i that in the Father and the Son there is no discrepancy but one Godhead and according to Hilary as quoted above in God there is nothing alien nothing separable To avoid the heresy of Sabellius we must shun the term singularity lest we take away the communicability of the divine essence Hence Hilary says De Trin vii It is sacrilege to assert that the Father and the Son are separate in Godhead We must avoid the adjective only unici lest we take away the number of persons Hence Hilary says in the same book We exclude from God the idea of singularity or uniqueness Nevertheless we say the only Son for in God there is no plurality of Sons Yet we do not say the only God for the Deity is common to several We avoid the word confused lest we take away from the Persons the order of their nature Hence Ambrose says De Fide i What is one is not confused and there is no multiplicity where there is no difference The word solitary is also to be avoided lest we take away the society of the three persons for as Hilary says De Trin iv We confess neither a solitary nor a diverse God This word other alius however in the masculine sense means only a distinction of suppositum and hence we can properly say that the Son is other than the Father because He is another suppositum of the divine nature as He is another person and another hypostasis Reply Obj one Other being like the name of a particular thing refers to the suppositum and so there is sufficient reason for using it where there is a distinct substance in the sense of hypostasis or person But diversity requires a distinct substance in the sense of essence Thus we cannot say that the Son is diverse from the Father although He is another Reply Obj two Difference implies distinction of form There is one form in God as appears from the text Who when He was in the form of God Phil two six Therefore the term difference does not properly apply to God as appears from the authority quoted Yet Damascene De Fide Orth i five employs the term difference in the divine persons as meaning that the relative property is signified by way of form Hence he says that the hypostases do not differ from each other in substance but according to determinate properties But difference is taken for distinction as above stated Reply Obj three The term alien means what is extraneous and dissimilar which is not expressed by the term other alius and therefore we say that the Son is other than the Father but not that He is anything alien Reply Obj four The neuter gender is formless whereas the masculine is formed and distinct and so is the feminine So the common essence is properly and aptly expressed by the neuter gender but by the masculine and feminine is expressed the determined subject in the common nature Hence also in human affairs if we ask Who is this man we answer Socrates which is the name of the suppositum whereas if we ask What is he we reply A rational and mortal animal So because in God distinction is by the persons and not by the essence we say that the Father is other than the Son but not something else while conversely we say that they are one thing but not one person THIRD ARTICLE I Q thirty one Art three Whether the Exclusive Word Alone Should Be Added to the Essential Term in God Objection one It would seem that the exclusive word alone solus is not to be added to an essential term in God For according to the Philosopher Elench ii three He is alone who is not with another But God is with the angels and the souls of the saints Therefore we cannot say that God is alone Obj two Further whatever is joined to the essential term in God can be predicated of every person per se and of all the persons together for as we can properly say that God is wise we can say the Father is a wise God and the Trinity is a wise God But Augustine says De Trin vi nine We must consider the opinion that the Father is not true God alone Therefore God cannot be said to be alone Obj three Further if this expression alone is joined to an essential term it would be so joined as regards either the personal predicate or the essential predicate But it cannot be the former as it is false to say God alone is Father since man also is a father nor again can it be applied as regards the latter for if this saying were true God alone creates it would follow that the Father alone creates as whatever is said of God can be said of the Father and it would be false as the Son also creates Therefore this expression alone cannot be joined to an essential term in God On the contrary It is said To the King of ages immortal invisible the only God one Tim one seventeen I answer that This term alone can be taken as a categorematical term or as a syncategorematical term A categorematical term is one which ascribes absolutely its meaning to a given suppositum as for instance white to man as when we say a white man If the term alone is taken in this sense it cannot in any way be joined to any term in God for it would mean solitude in the term to which it is joined and it would follow that God was solitary against what is above stated A two A syncategorematical term imports the order of the predicate to the subject as this expression every one or no one and likewise the term alone as excluding every other suppositum from the predicate Thus when we say Socrates alone writes we do not mean that Socrates is solitary but that he has no companion in writing though many others may be with him In this way nothing prevents the term alone being joined to any essential term in God as excluding the predicate from all things but God as if we said God alone is eternal because nothing but God is eternal Reply Obj one Although the angels and the souls of the saints are always with God nevertheless if plurality of persons did not exist in God He would be alone or solitary For solitude is not removed by association with anything that is extraneous in nature thus anyone is said to be alone in a garden though many plants and animals are with him in the garden Likewise God would be alone or solitary though angels and men were with Him supposing that several persons were not within Him Therefore the society of angels and of souls does not take away absolute solitude from God much less does it remove respective solitude in reference to a predicate Reply Obj two This expression alone properly speaking does not affect the predicate which is taken formally for it refers to the suppositum as excluding any other suppositum from the one which it qualifies But the adverb only being exclusive can be applied either to subject or predicate For we can say Only Socrates that is no one else runs and Socrates runs only that is he does nothing else Hence it is not properly said that the Father is God alone or the Trinity is God alone unless some implied meaning be assumed in the predicate as for instance The Trinity is God Who alone is God In that sense it can be true to say that the Father is that God Who alone is God if the relative be referred to the predicate and not to the suppositum So when Augustine says that the Father is not God alone but that the Trinity is God alone he speaks expositively as he might explain the words To the King of ages invisible the only God as applying not to the Father but to the Trinity alone Reply Obj three In both ways can the term alone be joined to an essential term For this proposition God alone is Father can mean two things because the word Father can signify the person of the Father and then it is true for no man is that person or it can signify that relation only and thus it is false because the relation of paternity is found also in others though not in a univocal sense Likewise it is true to say God alone creates nor does it follow therefore the Father alone creates because as logicians say an exclusive diction so fixes the term to which it is joined that what is said exclusively of that term cannot be said exclusively of an individual contained in that term for instance from the premiss Man alone is a mortal rational animal we cannot conclude therefore Socrates alone is such FOURTH ARTICLE I Q thirty one Art four Whether an Exclusive Diction Can Be Joined to the Personal Term Objection one It would seem that an exclusive diction can be joined to the personal term even though the predicate is common For our Lord speaking to the Father said That they may know Thee the only true God John seventeen three Therefore the Father alone is true God Obj two Further He said No one knows the Son but the Father Matt eleven twenty seven which means that the Father alone knows the Son But to know the Son is common to the persons Therefore the same conclusion follows Obj three Further an exclusive diction does not exclude what enters into the concept of the term to which it is joined Hence it does not exclude the part nor the universal for it does not follow that if we say Socrates alone is white that therefore his hand is not white or that man is not white But one person is in the concept of another as the Father is in the concept of the Son and conversely Therefore when we say The Father alone is God we do not exclude the Son nor the Holy Ghost so that such a mode of speaking is true Obj four Further the Church sings Thou alone art Most High O Jesus Christ On the contrary This proposition The Father alone is God includes two assertions namely that the Father is God and that no other besides the Father is God But this second proposition is false for the Son is another from the Father and He is God Therefore this is false The Father alone is God and the same of the like sayings I answer that When we say The Father alone is God such a proposition can be taken in several senses If alone means solitude in the Father it is false in a categorematical sense but if taken in a syncategorematical sense it can again be understood in several ways For if it exclude all others from the form of the subject it is true the sense being the Father alone is God that is He who with no other is the Father is God In this way Augustine expounds when he says De Trin vi six We say the Father alone not because He is separate from the Son or from the Holy Ghost but because they are not the Father together with Him This however is not the usual way of speaking unless we understand another implication as though we said He who alone is called the Father is God But in the strict sense the exclusion affects the predicate And thus the proposition is false if it excludes another in the masculine sense but true if it excludes it in the neuter sense because the Son is another person than the Father but not another thing and the same applies to the Holy Ghost But because this diction alone properly speaking refers to the subject it tends to exclude another Person rather than other things Hence such a way of speaking is not to be taken too literally but it should be piously expounded whenever we find it in an authentic work Reply Obj one When we say Thee the only true God we do not understand it as referring to the person of the Father but to the whole Trinity as Augustine expounds De Trin vi nine Or if understood of the person of the Father the other persons are not excluded by reason of the unity of essence in so far as the word only excludes another thing as above explained The same Reply can be given to Obj two For an essential term applied to the Father does not exclude the Son or the Holy Ghost by reason of the unity of essence Hence we must understand that in the text quoted the term no one Nemo non homo i e no man is not the same as no man which the word itself would seem to signify for the person of the Father could not be excepted but is taken according to the usual way of speaking in a distributive sense to mean any rational nature Reply Obj three The exclusive diction does not exclude what enters into the concept of the term to which it is adjoined if they do not differ in suppositum as part and universal But the Son differs in suppositum from the Father and so there is no parity Reply Obj four We do not say absolutely that the Son alone is Most High but that He alone is Most High with the Holy Ghost in the glory of God the Father QUESTION thirty two THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DIVINE PERSONS In Four Articles We proceed to inquire concerning the knowledge of the divine persons and this involves four points of inquiry one Whether the divine persons can be known by natural reason two Whether notions are to be attributed to the divine persons three The number of the notions four Whether we may lawfully have various contrary opinions of these notions FIRST ARTICLE I Q thirty two Art one Whether the Trinity of the Divine Persons Can Be Known by Natural Reason Objection one It would seem that the trinity of the divine persons can be known by natural reason For philosophers came to the knowledge of God not otherwise than by natural reason Now we find that they said many things about the trinity of persons for Aristotle says De Coelo et Mundo i two Through this number namely three we bring ourselves to acknowledge the greatness of one God surpassing all things created And Augustine says Confess vii nine I have read in their works not in so many words but enforced by many and various reasons that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and so on in which passage the distinction of persons is laid down We read moreover in a gloss on Rom one and Ex eight that the magicians of Pharaoh failed in the third sign that is as regards knowledge of a third person i e of the Holy Ghost and thus it is clear that they knew at least two persons Likewise Trismegistus says The monad begot a monad and reflected upon itself its own heat By which words the generation of the Son and procession of the Holy Ghost seem to be indicated Therefore knowledge of the divine persons can be obtained by natural reason Obj two Further Richard saint Victor says De Trin i four I believe without doubt that probable and even necessary arguments can be found for any explanation of the truth So even to prove the Trinity some have brought forward a reason from the infinite goodness of God who communicates Himself infinitely in the procession of the divine persons while some are moved by the consideration that no good thing can be joyfully possessed without partnership Augustine proceeds De Trin x four x eleven twelve to prove the trinity of persons by the procession of the word and of love in our own mind and we have followed him in this Q twenty seven AA one three Therefore the trinity of persons can be known by natural reason Obj three Further it seems to be superfluous to teach what cannot be known by natural reason But it ought not to be said that the divine tradition of the Trinity is superfluous Therefore the trinity of persons can be known by natural reason On the contrary Hilary says De Trin i Let no man think to reach the sacred mystery of generation by his own mind And Ambrose says De Fide ii five It is impossible to know the secret of generation The mind fails the voice is silent But the trinity of the divine persons is distinguished by origin of generation and procession Q thirty A two Since therefore man cannot know and with his understanding grasp that for which no necessary reason can be given it follows that the trinity of persons cannot be known by reason I answer that It is impossible to attain to the knowledge of the Trinity by natural reason For as above explained Q twelve AA four twelve man cannot obtain the knowledge of God by natural reason except from creatures Now creatures lead us to the knowledge of God as effects do to their cause Accordingly by natural reason we can know of God that only which of necessity belongs to Him as the principle of things and we have cited this fundamental principle in treating of God as above Q twelve A twelve Now the creative power of God is common to the whole Trinity and hence it belongs to the unity of the essence and not to the distinction of the persons Therefore by natural reason we can know what belongs to the unity of the essence but not what belongs to the distinction of the persons Whoever then tries to prove the trinity of persons by natural reason derogates from faith in two ways Firstly as regards the dignity of faith itself which consists in its being concerned with invisible things that exceed human reason wherefore the Apostle says that faith is of things that appear not Heb eleven one and the same Apostle says also We speak wisdom among the perfect but not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery which is hidden one Cor two six seven Secondly as regards the utility of drawing others to the faith For when anyone in the endeavor to prove the faith brings forward reasons which are not cogent he falls under the ridicule of the unbelievers since they suppose that we stand upon such reasons and that we believe on such grounds Therefore we must not attempt to prove what is of faith except by authority alone to those who receive the authority while as regards others it suffices to prove that what faith teaches is not impossible Hence it is said by Dionysius Div Nom ii Whoever wholly resists the word is far off from our philosophy whereas if he regards the truth of the word i e the sacred word we too follow this rule Reply Obj one The philosophers did not know the mystery of the trinity of the divine persons by its proper attributes such as paternity filiation and procession according to the Apostle s words We speak the wisdom of God which none of the princes of the world i e the philosophers knew one Cor two six Nevertheless they knew some of the essential attributes appropriated to the persons as power to the Father wisdom to the Son goodness to the Holy Ghost as will later on appear So when Aristotle said By this number et cetera we must not take it as if he affirmed a threefold number in God but that he wished to say that the ancients used the threefold number in their sacrifices and prayers on account of some perfection residing in the number three In the Platonic books also we find In the beginning was the word not as meaning the Person begotten in God but as meaning the ideal type whereby God made all things and which is appropriated to the Son And although they knew these were appropriated to the three persons yet they are said to have failed in the third sign that is in the knowledge of the third person because they deviated from the goodness appropriated to the Holy Ghost in that knowing God they did not glorify Him as God Rom one or because the Platonists asserted the existence of one Primal Being whom they also declared to be the father of the universe they consequently maintained the existence of another substance beneath him which they called mind or the paternal intellect containing the idea of all things as Macrobius relates Som Scip iv They did not however assert the existence of a third separate substance which might correspond to the Holy Ghost So also we do not assert that the Father and the Son differ in substance which was the error of Origen and Arius who in this followed the Platonists When Trismegistus says Monad begot monad et cetera this does not refer to the generation of the Son or to the procession of the Holy Ghost but to the production of the world For one God produced one world by reason of His love for Himself Reply Obj two Reason may be employed in two ways to establish a point firstly for the purpose of furnishing sufficient proof of some principle as in natural science where sufficient proof can be brought to show that the movement of the heavens is always of uniform velocity Reason is employed in another way not as furnishing a sufficient proof of a principle but as confirming an already established principle by showing the congruity of its results as in astrology the theory of eccentrics and epicycles is considered as established because thereby the sensible appearances of the heavenly movements can be explained not however as if this proof were sufficient forasmuch as some other theory might explain them In the first way we can prove that God is one and the like In the second way reasons avail to prove the Trinity as when assumed to be true such reasons confirm it We must not however think that the trinity of persons is adequately proved by such reasons This becomes evident when we consider each point for the infinite goodness of God is manifested also in creation because to produce from nothing is an act of infinite power For if God communicates Himself by His infinite goodness it is not necessary that an infinite effect should proceed from God but that according to its own mode and capacity it should receive the divine goodness Likewise when it is said that joyous possession of good requires partnership this holds in the case of one not having perfect goodness hence it needs to share some other s good in order to have the goodness of complete happiness Nor is the image in our mind an adequate proof in the case of God forasmuch as the intellect is not in God and ourselves univocally Hence Augustine says Tract xxvii in Joan that by faith we arrive at knowledge and not conversely Reply Obj three There are two reasons why the knowledge of the divine persons was necessary for us It was necessary for the right idea of creation The fact of saying that God made all things by His Word excludes the error of those who say that God produced things by necessity When we say that in Him there is a procession of love we show that God produced creatures not because He needed them nor because of any other extrinsic reason but on account of the love of His own goodness So Moses when he had said In the beginning God created heaven and earth subjoined God said Let there be light to manifest the divine Word and then said God saw the light that it was good to show proof of the divine love The same is also found in the other works of creation In another way and chiefly that we may think rightly concerning the salvation of the human race accomplished by the Incarnate Son and by the gift of the Holy Ghost SECOND ARTICLE I Q thirty two Art two Whether There Are Notions in God Objection one It would seem that in God there are no notions For Dionysius says Div Nom i We must not dare to say anything of God but what is taught to us by the Holy Scripture But Holy Scripture does not say anything concerning notions Therefore there are none in God Obj two Further all that exists in God concerns the unity of the essence or the trinity of the persons But the notions do not concern the unity of the essence nor the trinity of the persons for neither can what belongs to the essence be predicated of the notions for instance we do not say that paternity is wise or creates nor can what belongs to the persons be so predicated for example we do not say that paternity begets nor that filiation is begotten Therefore there do not exist notions in God Obj three Further we do not require to presuppose any abstract notions as principles of knowing things which are devoid of composition for they are known of themselves But the divine persons are supremely simple Therefore we are not to suppose any notions in God On the contrary Damascene says De Fide Orth iii five We recognize difference of hypostases i e of persons in the three properties i e in the paternal the filial and the processional Therefore we must admit properties and notions in God I answer that Prepositivus considering the simplicity of the persons said that in God there were no properties or notions and wherever there were mentioned he propounded the abstract for the concrete For as we are accustomed to say I beseech your kindness i e you who are kind so when we speak of paternity in God we mean God the Father But as shown above Q three A three ad one the use of concrete and abstract names in God is not in any way repugnant to the divine simplicity forasmuch as we always name a thing as we understand it Now our intellect cannot attain to the absolute simplicity of the divine essence considered in itself and therefore our human intellect apprehends and names divine things according to its own mode that is in so far as they are found in sensible objects whence its knowledge is derived In these things we use abstract terms to signify simple forms and to signify subsistent things we use concrete terms Hence also we signify divine things as above stated by abstract names to express their simplicity whereas to express their subsistence and completeness we use concrete names But not only must essential names be signified in the abstract and in the concrete as when we say Deity and God or wisdom and wise but the same applies to the personal names so that we may say paternity and Father Two chief motives for this can be cited The first arises from the obstinacy of heretics For since we confess the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost to be one God and three persons to those who ask Whereby are They one God and whereby are They three persons as we answer that They are one in essence or deity so there must also be some abstract terms whereby we may answer that the persons are distinguished and these are the properties or notions signified by an abstract term as paternity and filiation Therefore the divine essence is signified as What and the person as Who and the property as Whereby The second motive is because one person in God is related to two persons namely the person of the Father to the person of the Son and the person of the Holy Ghost This is not however by one relation otherwise it would follow that the Son also and the Holy Ghost would be related to the Father by one and the same relation Thus since relation alone multiplies the Trinity it would follow that the Son and the Holy Ghost would not be two persons Nor can it be said with Prepositivus that as God is related in one way to creatures while creatures are related to Him in divers ways so the Father is related by one relation to the Son and to the Holy Ghost whereas these two persons are related to the Father by two relations For since the very specific idea of a relation is that it refers to another it must be said that two relations are not specifically different if but one opposite relation corresponds to them For the relation of lord and father must differ according to the difference of filiation and servitude Now all creatures are related to God as His creatures by one specific relation But the Son and the Holy Ghost are not related to the Father by one and the same kind of relation Hence there is no parity Further in God there is no need to admit any real relation to the creature Q twenty eight A one three while there is no reason against our admitting in God many logical relations But in the Father there must be a real relation to the Son and to the Holy Ghost Hence corresponding to the two relations of the Son and of the Holy Ghost whereby they are related to the Father we must understand two relations in the Father whereby He is related to the Son and to the Holy Ghost Hence since there is only one Person of the Father it is necessary that the relations should be separately signified in the abstract and these are what we mean by properties and notions Reply Obj one Although the notions are not mentioned in Holy Scripture yet the persons are mentioned comprising the idea of notions as the abstract is contained in the concrete Reply Obj two In God the notions have their significance not after the manner of realities but by way of certain ideas whereby the persons are known although in God these notions or relations are real as stated above Q twenty eight A one Therefore whatever has order to any essential or personal act cannot be applied to the notions forasmuch as this is against their mode of signification Hence we cannot say that paternity begets or creates or is wise or is intelligent The essentials however which are not ordered to any act but simply remove created conditions from God can be predicated of the notions for we can say that paternity is eternal or immense or such like So also on account of the real identity substantive terms whether personal or essential can be predicated of the notions for we can say that paternity is God and that paternity is the Father Reply Obj three Although the persons are simple still without prejudice to their simplicity the proper ideas of the persons can be abstractedly signified as above explained THIRD ARTICLE I Q thirty two Art three Whether There Are Five Notions Objection one It would seem that there are not five notions For the notions proper to the persons are the relations whereby they are distinguished from each other But the relations in God are only four Q twenty eight A four Therefore the notions are only four in number Obj two Further as there is only one essence in God He is called one God and because in Him there are three persons He is called the Trine God Therefore if in God there are five notions He may be called quinary which cannot be allowed Obj three Further if there are five notions for the three persons in God there must be in some one person two or more notions as in the person of the Father there is innascibility and paternity and common spiration Either these three notions really differ or not If they really differ it follows that the person of the Father is composed of several things But if they differ only logically it follows that one of them can be predicated of another so that we can say that as the divine goodness is the same as the divine wisdom by reason of the common reality so common spiration is paternity which is not to be admitted Therefore there are not five notions Obj four On the contrary It seems that there are more because as the Father is from no one and therefrom is derived the notion of innascibility so from the Holy Ghost no other person proceeds And in this respect there ought to be a sixth notion Obj five Further as the Father and the Son are the common origin of the Holy Ghost so it is common to the Son and the Holy Ghost to proceed from the Father Therefore as one notion is common to the Father and the Son so there ought to be one notion common to the Son and to the Holy Ghost I answer that A notion is the proper idea whereby we know a divine Person Now the divine persons are multiplied by reason of their origin and origin includes the idea of someone from whom another comes and of someone that comes from another and by these two modes a person can be known Therefore the Person of the Father cannot be known by the fact that He is from another but by the fact that He is from no one and thus the notion that belongs to Him is called innascibility As the source of another He can be known in two ways because as the Son is from Him the Father is known by the notion of paternity and as the Holy Ghost is from Him He is known by the notion of common spiration The Son can be known as begotten by another and thus He is known by filiation and also by another person proceeding from Him the Holy Ghost and thus He is known in the same way as the Father is known by common spiration The Holy Ghost can be known by the fact that He is from another or from others thus He is known by procession but not by the fact that another is from Him as no divine person proceeds from Him Therefore there are Five notions in God innascibility paternity filiation common spiration and procession Of these only four are relations for innascibility is not a relation except by reduction as will appear later Q thirty three A four ad three Four only are properties For common spiration is not a property because it belongs to two persons Three are personal notions i e constituting persons paternity filiation and procession Common spiration and innascibility are called notions of Persons but not personal notions as we shall explain further on Q forty A one ad one Reply Obj one Besides the four relations another notion must be admitted as above explained Reply Obj two The divine essence is signified as a reality and likewise the persons are signified as realities whereas the notions are signified as ideas notifying the persons Therefore although God is one by unity of essence and trine by trinity of persons nevertheless He is not quinary by the five notions Reply Obj three Since the real plurality in God is founded only on relative opposition the several properties of one Person as they are not relatively opposed to each other do not really differ Nor again are they predicated of each other because they are different ideas of the persons as we do not say that the attribute of power is the attribute of knowledge although we do say that knowledge is power Reply Obj four Since Person implies dignity as stated above Q nineteen A three we cannot derive a notion of the Holy Spirit from the fact that no person is from Him For this does not belong to His dignity as it belongs to the authority of the Father that He is from no one Reply Obj five The Son and the Holy Ghost do not agree in one special mode of existence derived from the Father as the Father and the Son agree in one special mode of producing the Holy Ghost But the principle on which a notion is based must be something special thus no parity of reasoning exists FOURTH ARTICLE I Q thirty two Art four Whether It Is Lawful to Have Various Contrary Opinions of Notions Objection one It would seem that it is not lawful to have various contrary opinions of the notions For Augustine says De Trin i three No error is more dangerous than any as regards the Trinity to which mystery the notions assuredly belong But contrary opinions must be in some way erroneous Therefore it is not right to have contrary opinions of the notions Obj two Further the persons are known by the notions But no contrary opinion concerning the persons is to be tolerated Therefore neither can there be about the notions On the contrary The notions are not articles of faith Therefore different opinions of the notions are permissible I answer that Anything is of faith in two ways directly where any truth comes to us principally as divinely taught as the trinity and unity of God the Incarnation of the Son and the like and concerning these truths a false opinion of itself involves heresy especially if it be held obstinately A thing is of faith indirectly if the denial of it involves as a consequence something against faith as for instance if anyone said that Samuel was not the son of Elcana for it follows that the divine Scripture would be false Concerning such things anyone may have a false opinion without danger of heresy before the matter has been considered or settled as involving consequences against faith and particularly if no obstinacy be shown whereas when it is manifest and especially if the Church has decided that consequences follow against faith then the error cannot be free from heresy For this reason many things are now considered as heretical which were formerly not so considered as their consequences are now more manifest So we must decide that anyone may entertain contrary opinions about the notions if he does not mean to uphold anything at variance with faith If however anyone should entertain a false opinion of the notions knowing or thinking that consequences against the faith would follow he would lapse into heresy By what has been said all the objections may be solved QUESTION thirty three OF THE PERSON OF THE FATHER In Four Articles We now consider the persons singly and first the Person of the Father concerning Whom there are four points of inquiry one Whether the Father is the Principle two Whether the person of the Father is properly signified by this name Father three Whether Father in God is said personally before it is said essentially four Whether it belongs to the Father alone to be unbegotten FIRST ARTICLE I Q thirty three Art one Whether It Belongs to the Father to Be the Principle Objection one It would seem that the Father cannot be called the principle of the Son or of the Holy Ghost For principle and cause are the same according to the Philosopher Metaph iv But we do not say that the Father is the cause of the Son Therefore we must not say that He is the principle of the Son Obj two Further a principle is so called in relation to the thing principled So if the Father is the principle of the Son it follows that the Son is a person principled and is therefore created which appears false Obj three Further the word principle is taken from priority But in God there is no before and after as Athanasius says Therefore in speaking of God we ought not to used the term principle On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iv twenty The Father is the Principle of the whole Deity I answer that The word principle signifies only that whence another proceeds since anything whence something proceeds in any way we call a principle and conversely As the Father then is the one whence another proceeds it follows that the Father is a principle Reply Obj one The Greeks use the words cause and principle indifferently when speaking of God whereas the Latin Doctors do not use the word cause but only principle The reason is because principle is a wider term than cause as cause is more common than element For the first term of a thing as also the first part is called the principle but not the cause Now the wider a term is the more suitable it is to use as regards God Q thirteen A eleven because the more special terms are the more they determine the mode adapted to the creature Hence this term cause seems to mean diversity of substance and dependence of one from another which is not implied in the word principle For in all kinds of causes there is always to be found between the cause and the effect a distance of perfection or of power whereas we use the term principle even in things which have no such difference but have only a certain order to each other as when we say that a point is the principle of a line or also when we say that the first part of a line is the principle of a line Reply Obj two It is the custom with the Greeks to say that the Son and the Holy Ghost are principled This is not however the custom with our Doctors because although we attribute to the Father something of authority by reason of His being the principle still we do not attribute any kind of subjection or inferiority to the Son or to the Holy Ghost to avoid any occasion of error In this way Hilary says De Trin ix By authority of the Giver the Father is the greater nevertheless the Son is not less to Whom oneness of nature is give Reply Obj three Although this word principle as regards its derivation seems to be taken from priority still it does not signify priority but origin For what a term signifies and the reason why it was imposed are not the same thing as stated above Q thirteen A eight SECOND ARTICLE I Q thirty three Art two Whether This Name Father Is Properly the Name of a Divine Person Objection one It would seem that this name Father is not properly the name of a divine person For the name Father signifies relation Moreover person is an individual substance Therefore this name Father is not properly a name signifying a Person Obj two Further a begetter is more common than father for every father begets but it is not so conversely But a more common term is more properly applied to God as stated above Q thirteen A eleven Therefore the more proper name of the divine person is begetter and genitor than Father Obj three Further a metaphorical term cannot be the proper name of anyone But the word is by us metaphorically called begotten or offspring and consequently he of whom is the word is metaphorically called father Therefore the principle of the Word in God is not properly called Father Obj four Further everything which is said properly of God is said of God first before creatures But generation appears to apply to creatures before God because generation seems to be truer when the one who proceeds is distinct from the one whence it proceeds not only by relation but also by essence Therefore the name Father taken from generation does not seem to be the proper name of any divine person On the contrary It is said Ps eighty eight twenty seven He shall cry out to me Thou art my Father I answer that The proper name of any person signifies that whereby the person is distinguished from all other persons For as body and soul belong to the nature of man so to the concept of this particular man belong this particular soul and this particular body and by these is this particular man distinguished from all other men Now it is paternity which distinguishes the person of the Father from all other persons Hence this name Father whereby paternity is signified is the proper name of the person of the Father Reply Obj one Among us relation is not a subsisting person So this name father among us does not signify a person but the relation of a person In God however it is not so as some wrongly thought for in God the relation signified by the name Father is a subsisting person Hence as above explained Q twenty nine A four this name person in God signifies a relation subsisting in the divine nature Reply Obj two According to the Philosopher De Anima ii text forty nine a thing is denominated chiefly by its perfection and by its end Now generation signifies something in process of being made whereas paternity signifies the complement of generation and therefore the name Father is more expressive as regards the divine person than genitor or begettor Reply Obj three In human nature the word is not a subsistence and hence is not properly called begotten or son But the divine Word is something subsistent in the divine nature and hence He is properly and not metaphorically called Son and His principle is called Father Reply Obj four The terms generation and paternity like the other terms properly applied to God are said of God before creatures as regards the thing signified but not as regards the mode of signification Hence also the Apostle says I bend my knee to the Father of my Lord Jesus Christ from whom all paternity in heaven and on earth is named Eph three fourteen This is explained thus It is manifest that generation receives its species from the term which is the form of the thing generated and the nearer it is to the form of the generator the truer and more perfect is the generation as univocal generation is more perfect than non univocal for it belongs to the essence of a generator to generate what is like itself in form Hence the very fact that in the divine generation the form of the Begetter and Begotten is numerically the same whereas in creatures it is not numerically but only specifically the same shows that generation and consequently paternity is applied to God before creatures Hence the very fact that in God a distinction exists of the Begotten from the Begetter as regards relation only belongs to the truth of the divine generation and paternity THIRD ARTICLE I Q thirty three Art three Whether This Name Father Is Applied to God Firstly As a Personal Name Objection one It would seem that this name Father is not applied to God firstly as a personal name For in the intellect the common precedes the particular But this name Father as a personal name belongs to the person of the Father and taken in an essential sense it is common to the whole Trinity for we say Our Father to the whole Trinity Therefore Father comes first as an essential name before its personal sense Obj two Further in things of which the concept is the same there is no priority of predication But paternity and filiation seem to be of the same nature according as a divine person is Father of the Son and the whole Trinity is our Father or the creature s since according to Basil Hom xv De Fide to receive is common to the creature and to the Son Therefore Father in God is not taken as an essential name before it is taken personally Obj three Further it is not possible to compare things which have not a common concept But the Son is compared to the creature by reason of filiation or generation according to colonel one fifteen Who is the image of the invisible God the first born of every creature Therefore paternity taken in a personal sense is not prior to but has the same concept as paternity taken essentially On the contrary The eternal comes before the temporal But God is the Father of the Son from eternity while He is the Father of the creature in time Therefore paternity in God is taken in a personal sense as regards the Son before it is so taken as regards the creature I answer that A name is applied to that wherein is perfectly contained its whole signification before it is applied to that which only partially contains it for the latter bears the name by reason of a kind of similitude to that which answers perfectly to the signification of the name since all imperfect things are taken from perfect things Hence this name lion is applied first to the animal containing the whole nature of a lion and which is properly so called before it is applied to a man who shows something of a lion s nature as courage or strength or the like and of whom it is said by way of similitude Now it is manifest from the foregoing Q twenty seven A two Q twenty eight A four that the perfect idea of paternity and filiation is to be found in God the Father and in God the Son because one is the nature and glory of the Father and the Son But in the creature filiation is found in relation to God not in a perfect manner since the Creator and the creature have not the same nature but by way of a certain likeness which is the more perfect the nearer we approach to the true idea of filiation For God is called the Father of some creatures by reason only of a trace for instance of irrational creatures according to Job thirty eight twenty eight Who is the father of the rain or who begot the drops of dew Of some namely the rational creature He is the Father by reason of the likeness of His image according to Deut thirty two six Is He not thy Father who possessed and made and created thee And of others He is the Father by similitude of grace and these are also called adoptive sons as ordained to the heritage of eternal glory by the gift of grace which they have received according to Rom eight sixteen seventeen The Spirit Himself gives testimony to our spirit that we are the sons of God and if sons heirs also Lastly He is the Father of others by similitude of glory forasmuch as they have obtained possession of the heritage of glory according to Rom five two We glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God Therefore it is plain that paternity is applied to God first as importing regard of one Person to another Person before it imports the regard of God to creatures Reply Obj one Common terms taken absolutely in the order of our intelligence come before proper terms because they are included in the understanding of proper terms but not conversely For in the concept of the person of the Father God is understood but not conversely But common terms which import relation to the creature come after proper terms which import personal relations because the person proceeding in God proceeds as the principle of the production of creatures For as the word conceived in the mind of the artist is first understood to proceed from the artist before the thing designed which is produced in likeness to the word conceived in the artist s mind so the Son proceeds from the Father before the creature to which the name of filiation is applied as it participates in the likeness of the Son as is clear from the words of Rom eight twenty nine Whom He foreknew and predestined to be made conformable to the image of His Son Reply Obj two To receive is said to be common to the creature and to the Son not in a univocal sense but according to a certain remote similitude whereby He is called the First Born of creatures Hence the authority quoted subjoins That He may be the First Born among many brethren after saying that some were conformed to the image of the Son of God But the Son of God possesses a position of singularity above others in having by nature what He receives as Basil also declares Hom xv De Fide hence He is called the only begotten John one eighteen The only begotten Who is in the bosom of the Father He hath declared unto us From this appears the Reply to the Third Objection FOURTH ARTICLE I Q thirty three Art four Whether It Is Proper to the Father to Be Unbegotten Objection one It would seem that it is not proper to the Father to be unbegotten For every property supposes something in that of which it is the property But unbegotten supposes nothing in the Father it only removes something Therefore it does not signify a property of the Father Obj two Further Unbegotten is taken either in a privative or in a negative sense If in a negative sense then whatever is not begotten can be called unbegotten But the Holy Ghost is not begotten neither is the divine essence Therefore to be unbegotten belongs also to the essence thus it is not proper to the Father But if it be taken in a privative sense as every privation signifies imperfection in the thing which is the subject of privation it follows that the Person of the Father is imperfect which cannot be Obj three Further in God unbegotten does not signify relation for it is not used relatively Therefore it signifies substance therefore unbegotten and begotten differ in substance But the Son Who is begotten does not differ from the Father in substance Therefore the Father ought not to be called unbegotten Obj four Further property means what belongs to one alone Since then there are more than one in God proceeding from another there is nothing to prevent several not receiving their being from another Therefore the Father is not alone unbegotten Obj five Further as the Father is the principle of the person begotten so is He of the person proceeding So if by reason of his opposition to the person begotten it is proper to the Father to be unbegotten it follows that it is proper to Him also to be unproceeding On the contrary Hilary says De Trin iv One is from one that is the Begotten is from the Unbegotten namely by the property in each one respectively of innascibility and origin I answer that As in creatures there exist a first and a secondary principle so also in the divine Persons in Whom there is no before or after is formed the principle not from a principle Who is the Father and the principle from a principle Who is the Son Now in things created a first principle is known in two ways in one way as the first principle by reason of its having a relation to what proceeds from itself in another way inasmuch as it is a first principle by reason of its not being from another Thus therefore the Father is known both by paternity and by common spiration as regards the persons proceeding from Himself But as the principle not from a principle He is known by the fact that He is not from another and this belongs to the property of innascibility signified by this word begotten Reply Obj one Some there are who say that innascibility signified by the word unbegotten as a property of the Father is not a negative term only but either that it means both these things together namely that the Father is from no one and that He is the principle of others or that it imports universal authority or also His plenitude as the source of all This however does not seem true because thus innascibility would not be a property distinct from paternity and spiration but would include them as the proper is included in the common For source and authority signify in God nothing but the principle of origin We must therefore say with Augustine De Trin v seven that unbegotten imports the negation of passive generation For he says that unbegotten has the same meaning as not a son Nor does it follow that unbegotten is not the proper notion of the Father for primary and simple things are notified by negations as for instance a point is defined as what has no part Reply Obj two Unbegotten is taken sometimes in a negative sense only and in that sense Jerome says that the Holy Ghost is unbegotten that is He is not begotten Otherwise unbegotten may be taken in a kind of privative sense but not as implying any imperfection For privation can be taken in many ways in one way when a thing has not what is naturally belongs to another even though it is not of its own nature to have it as for instance if a stone be called a dead thing as wanting life which naturally belongs to some other things In another sense privation is so called when something has not what naturally belongs to some members of its genus as for instance when a mole is called blind In a third sense privation means the absence of what something ought to have in which sense privation imports an imperfection In this sense unbegotten is not attributed to the Father as a privation but it may be so attributed in the second sense meaning that a certain person of the divine nature is not begotten while some person of the same nature is begotten In this sense the term unbegotten can be applied also to the Holy Ghost Hence to consider it as a term proper to the Father alone it must be further understood that the name unbegotten belongs to a divine person as the principle of another person so that it be understood to imply negation in the genus of principle taken personally in God Or that there be understood in the term unbegotten that He is not in any way derived from another and not only that He is not from another by way only of generation In this sense the term unbegotten does not belong at all to the Holy Ghost Who is from another by procession as a subsisting person nor does it belong to the divine essence of which it may be said that it is in the Son or in the Holy Ghost from another namely from the Father Reply Obj three According to Damascene De Fide Orth ii nine unbegotten in one sense signifies the same as uncreated and thus it applies to the substance for thereby does the created substance differ from the uncreated In another sense it signifies what is not begotten and in this sense it is a relative term just as negation is reduced to the genus of affirmation as not man is reduced to the genus of substance and not white to the genus of quality Hence since begotten implies relation in God unbegotten belongs also to relation Thus it does not follow that the Father unbegotten is substantially distinguished from the Son begotten but only by relation that is as the relation of Son is denied of the Father Reply Obj four In every genus there must be something first so in the divine nature there must be some one principle which is not from another and which we call unbegotten To admit two innascibles is to suppose the existence of two Gods and two divine natures Hence Hilary says De Synod As there is one God so there cannot be two innascibles And this especially because did two innascibles exist one would not be from the other and they would not be distinguished by relative opposition therefore they would be distinguished from each other by diversity of nature Reply Obj five The property of the Father whereby He is not from another is more clearly signified by the removal of the nativity of the Son than by the removal of the procession of the Holy Ghost both because the procession of the Holy Ghost has no special name as stated above Q twenty seven A four ad three and because also in the order of nature it presupposes the generation of the Son Hence it being denied of the Father that He is begotten although He is the principle of generation it follows as a consequence that He does not proceed by the procession of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is not the principle of generation but proceeds from the person begotten QUESTION thirty four OF THE PERSON OF THE SON In Three Articles We next consider the person of the Son Three names are attributed to the Son namely Son Word and Image The idea of Son is gathered from the idea of Father Hence it remains for us to consider Word and Image Concerning Word there are three points of inquiry one Whether Word is an essential term in God or a personal term two Whether it is the proper name of the Son three Whether in the name of Word is expressed relation to creatures FIRST ARTICLE I Q thirty four Art one Whether Word in God Is a Personal Name Objection one It would seem that Word in God is not a personal name For personal names are applied to God in a proper sense as Father and Son But Word is applied to God metaphorically as Origen says on John one one In the beginning was the Word Therefore Word is not a personal name in God Obj two Further according to Augustine De Trin ix ten The Word is knowledge with love and according to Anselm Monol lx To speak is to the Supreme Spirit nothing but to see by thought But knowledge and thought and sight are essential terms in God Therefore Word is not a personal term in God Obj three Further it is essential to word to be spoken But according to Anselm Monol lix as the Father is intelligent the Son is intelligent and the Holy Ghost is intelligent so the Father speaks the Son speaks and the Holy Ghost speaks and likewise each one of them is spoken Therefore the name Word is used as an essential term in God and not in a personal sense Obj four Further no divine person is made But the Word of God is something made For it is said Fire hail snow ice the storms which do His Word Ps one hundred forty eight eight Therefore the Word is not a personal name in God On the contrary Augustine says De Trin vii eleven As the Son is related to the Father so also is the Word to Him Whose Word He is But the Son is a personal name since it is said relatively Therefore so also is Word I answer that The name of Word in God if taken in its proper sense is a personal name and in no way an essential name To see how this is true we must know that our own word taken in its proper sense has a threefold meaning while in a fourth sense it is taken improperly or figuratively The clearest and most common sense is when it is said of the word spoken by the voice and this proceeds from an interior source as regards two things found in the exterior word that is the vocal sound itself and the signification of the sound For according to the Philosopher Peri Herm i vocal sound signifies the concept of the intellect Again the vocal sound proceeds from the signification or the imagination as stated in De Anima ii text ninety The vocal sound which has no signification cannot be called a word wherefore the exterior vocal sound is called a word from the fact the it signifies the interior concept of the mind Therefore it follows that first and chiefly the interior concept of the mind is called a word secondarily the vocal sound itself signifying the interior concept is so called and thirdly the imagination of the vocal sound is called a word Damascene mentions these three kinds of words De Fide Orth i seventeen saying that word is called the natural movement of the intellect whereby it is moved and understands and thinks as light and splendor which is the first kind Again he says the word is what is not pronounced by a vocal word but is uttered in the heart which is the third kind Again also the word is the angel that is the messenger of intelligence which is the second kind Word is also used in a fourth way figuratively for that which is signified or effected by a word thus we are wont to say this is the word I have said or which the king has commanded alluding to some deed signified by the word either by way of assertion or of command Now word is taken strictly in God as signifying the concept of the intellect Hence Augustine says De Trin xv ten Whoever can understand the word not only before it is sounded but also before thought has clothed it with imaginary sound can already see some likeness of that Word of Whom it is said In the beginning was the Word The concept itself of the heart has of its own nature to proceed from something other than itself namely from the knowledge of the one conceiving Hence Word according as we use the term strictly of God signifies something proceeding from another which belongs to the nature of personal terms in God inasmuch as the divine persons are distinguished by origin Q twenty seven AA three four five Hence the term Word according as we use the term strictly of God is to be taken as said not essentially but personally Reply Obj one The Arians who sprang from Origen declared that the Son differed in substance from the Father Hence they endeavored to maintain that when the Son of God is called the Word this is not to be understood in a strict sense lest the idea of the Word proceeding should compel them to confess that the Son of God is of the same substance as the Father For the interior word proceeds in such a manner from the one who pronounces it as to remain within him But supposing Word to be said metaphorically of God we must still admit Word in its strict sense For if a thing be called a word metaphorically this can only be by reason of some manifestation either it makes something manifest as a word or it is manifested by a word If manifested by a word there must exist a word whereby it is manifested If it is called a word because it exteriorly manifests what it exteriorly manifests cannot be called word except in as far as it signifies the interior concept of the mind which anyone may also manifest by exterior signs Therefore although Word may be sometimes said of God metaphorically nevertheless we must also admit Word in the proper sense and which is said personally Reply Obj two Nothing belonging to the intellect can be applied to God personally except word alone for word alone signifies that which emanates from another For what the intellect forms in its conception is the word Now the intellect itself according as it is made actual by the intelligible species is considered absolutely likewise the act of understanding which is to the actual intellect what existence is to actual being since the act of understanding does not signify an act going out from the intelligent agent but an act remaining in the agent Therefore when we say that word is knowledge the term knowledge does not mean the act of a knowing intellect or any one of its habits but stands for what the intellect conceives by knowing Hence also Augustine says De Trin vii one that the Word is begotten wisdom for it is nothing but the concept of the Wise One and in the same way It can be called begotten knowledge Thus can also be explained how to speak is in God to see by thought forasmuch as the Word is conceived by the gaze of the divine thought Still the term thought does not properly apply to the Word of God For Augustine says De Trin xv sixteen Therefore do we speak of the Word of God and not of the Thought of God lest we believe that in God there is something unstable now assuming the form of Word now putting off that form and remaining latent and as it were formless For thought consists properly in the search after the truth and this has no place in God But when the intellect attains to the form of truth it does not think but perfectly contemplates the truth Hence Anselm Monol lx takes thought in an improper sense for contemplation Reply Obj three As properly speaking Word in God is said personally and not essentially so likewise is to speak Hence as the Word is not common to the Father Son and Holy Ghost so it is not true that the Father Son and Holy Ghost are one speaker So Augustine says De Trin vii one He who speaks in that company eternal Word is understood as not alone in God but as being with that very Word without which forsooth He would not be speaking On the other hand to be spoken belongs to each Person for not only is the word spoken but also the thing understood or signified by the word Therefore in this manner to one person alone in God does it belong to be spoken in the same way as a word is spoken whereas in the way whereby a thing is spoken as being understood in the word it belongs to each Person to be spoken For the Father by understanding Himself the Son and the Holy Ghost and all other things comprised in this knowledge conceives the Word so that thus the whole Trinity is spoken in the Word and likewise also all creatures as the intellect of a man by the word he conceives in the act of understanding a stone speaks a stone Anselm took the term speak improperly for the act of understanding whereas they really differ from each other for to understand means only the habitude of the intelligent agent to the thing understood in which habitude no trace of origin is conveyed but only a certain information of our intellect forasmuch as our intellect is made actual by the form of the thing understood In God however it means complete identity because in God the intellect and the thing understood are altogether the same as was proved above Q fourteen AA four five Whereas to speak means chiefly the habitude to the word conceived for to speak is nothing but to utter a word But by means of the word it imports a habitude to the thing understood which in the word uttered is manifested to the one who understands Thus only the Person who utters the Word is speaker in God although each Person understands and is understood and consequently is spoken by the Word Reply Obj four The term word is there taken figuratively as the thing signified or effected by word is called word For thus creatures are said to do the word of God as executing any effect whereto they are ordained from the word conceived of the divine wisdom as anyone is said to do the word of the king when he does the work to which he is appointed by the king s word SECOND ARTICLE I Q thirty four Art two Whether Word Is the Son s Proper Name Objection one It would seem that Word is not the proper name of the Son For the Son is a subsisting person in God But word does not signify a subsisting thing as appears in ourselves Therefore word cannot be the proper name of the person of the Son Obj two Further the word proceeds from the speaker by being uttered Therefore if the Son is properly the word He proceeds from the Father by way only of utterance which is the heresy of Valentine as appears from Augustine De Haeres xi Obj three Further every proper name of a person signifies some property of that person Therefore if the Word is the Son s proper name it signifies some property of His and thus there will be several more properties in God than those above mentioned Obj four Further whoever understands conceives a word in the act of understanding But the Son understands Therefore some word belongs to the Son and consequently to be Word is not proper to the Son Obj five Further it is said of the Son Heb one three Bearing all things by the word of His power whence Basil infers Cont Eunom v eleven that the Holy Ghost is the Son s Word Therefore to be Word is not proper to the Son On the contrary Augustine says De Trin vi eleven By Word we understand the Son alone I answer that Word said of God in its proper sense is used personally and is the proper name of the person of the Son For it signifies an emanation of the intellect and the person Who proceeds in God by way of emanation of the intellect is called the Son and this procession is called generation as we have shown above Q twenty seven A two Hence it follows that the Son alone is properly called Word in God Reply Obj one To be and to understand are not the same in us Hence that which in us has intellectual being does not belong to our nature But in God to be and to understand are one and the same hence the Word of God is not an accident in Him or an effect of His but belongs to His very nature And therefore it must needs be something subsistent for whatever is in the nature of God subsists and so Damascene says De Fide Orth i eighteen that the Word of God is substantial and has a hypostatic being but other words as our own are activities if the soul Reply Obj two The error of Valentine was condemned not as the Arians pretended because he asserted that the Son was born by being uttered as Hilary relates De Trin vi but on account of the different mode of utterance proposed by its author as appears from Augustine De Haeres xi Reply Obj three In the term Word the same property is comprised as in the name Son Hence Augustine says De Trin vii eleven Word and Son express the same For the Son s nativity which is His personal property is signified by different names which are attributed to the Son to express His perfection in various ways To show that He is of the same nature as the Father He is called the Son to show that He is company eternal He is called the Splendor to show that He is altogether like He is called the Image to show that He is begotten immaterially He is called the Word All these truths cannot be expressed by only one name Reply Obj four To be intelligent belongs to the Son in the same way as it belongs to Him to be God since to understand is said of God essentially as stated above Q fourteen AA two four Now the Son is God begotten and not God begetting and hence He is intelligent not as producing a Word but as the Word proceeding forasmuch as in God the Word proceeding does not differ really from the divine intellect but is distinguished from the principle of the Word only by relation Reply Obj five When it is said of the Son Bearing all things by the word of His power word is taken figuratively for the effect of the Word Hence a gloss says that word is here taken to mean command inasmuch as by the effect of the power of the Word things are kept in being as also by the effect of the power of the Word things are brought into being Basil speaks widely and figuratively in applying Word to the Holy Ghost in the sense perhaps that everything that makes a person known may be called his word and so in that way the Holy Ghost may be called the Son s Word because He manifests the Son THIRD ARTICLE I Q thirty four Art three Whether the Name Word Imports Relation to Creatures Objection one It would seem that the name Word does not import relation to creatures For every name that connotes some effect in creatures is said of God essentially But Word is not said essentially but personally Therefore Word does not import relation to creatures Obj two Further whatever imports relation to creatures is said of God in time as Lord and Creator But Word is said of God from eternity Therefore it does not import relation to the creature Obj three Further Word imports relation to the source whence it proceeds Therefore if it imports relation to the creature it follows that the Word proceeds from the creature Obj four Further ideas in God are many according to their various relations to creatures Therefore if Word imports relation to creatures it follows that in God there is not one Word only but many Obj five Further if Word imports relation to the creature this can only be because creatures are known by God But God does not know beings only He knows also non beings Therefore in the Word are implied relations to non beings which appears to be false On the contrary Augustine says QQ lxxxiii qu sixty three that the name Word signifies not only relation to the Father but also relation to those beings which are made through the Word by His operative power I answer that Word implies relation to creatures For God by knowing Himself knows every creature Now the word conceived in the mind is representative of everything that is actually understood Hence there are in ourselves different words for the different things which we understand But because God by one act understands Himself and all things His one only Word is expressive not only of the Father but of all creatures And as the knowledge of God is only cognitive as regards God whereas as regards creatures it is both cognitive and operative so the Word of God is only expressive of what is in God the Father but is both expressive and operative of creatures and therefore it is said Ps thirty two nine He spake and they were made because in the Word is implied the operative idea of what God makes Reply Obj one The nature is also included indirectly in the name of the person for person is an individual substance of a rational nature Therefore the name of a divine person as regards the personal relation does not imply relation to the creature but it is implied in what belongs to the nature Yet there is nothing to prevent its implying relation to creatures so far as the essence is included in its meaning for as it properly belongs to the Son to be the Son so it properly belongs to Him to be God begotten or the Creator begotten and in this way the name Word imports relation to creatures Reply Obj two Since the relations result from actions some names import the relation of God to creatures which relation follows on the action of God which passes into some exterior effect as to create and to govern and the like are applied to God in time But others import a relation which follows from an action which does not pass into an exterior effect but abides in the agent as to know and to will such are not applied to God in time and this kind of relation to creatures is implied in the name of the Word Nor is it true that all names which import the relation of God to creatures are applied to Him in time but only those names are applied in time which import relation following on the action of God passing into exterior effect Reply Obj three Creatures are known to God not by a knowledge derived from the creatures themselves but by His own essence Hence it is not necessary that the Word should proceed from creatures although the Word is expressive of creatures Reply Obj four The name of Idea is imposed chiefly to signify relation to creatures and therefore it is applied in a plural sense to God and it is not said personally But the name of Word is imposed chiefly to signify the speaker and consequently relation to creatures inasmuch as God by understanding Himself understands every creature and so there is only one Word in God and that is a personal one Reply Obj five God s knowledge of non beings and God s Word about non beings are the same because the Word of God contains no less than does the knowledge of God as Augustine says De Trin xv fourteen Nevertheless the Word is expressive and operative of beings but is expressive and manifestive of non beings QUESTION thirty five OF THE IMAGE In Two Articles We next inquire concerning the image about which there are two points of inquiry one Whether Image in God is said personally two Whether this name belongs to the Son alone FIRST ARTICLE I Q thirty five Art one Whether Image in God Is Said Personally Objection one It would seem that image is not said personally of God For Augustine Fulgentius De Fide ad Petrum i says The Godhead of the Holy Trinity and the Image whereunto man is made are one Therefore Image is said of God essentially and not personally Obj two Further Hilary says De Synod An image is a like species of that which it represents But species or form is said of God essentially Therefore so also is Image Obj three Further Image is derived from imitation which implies before and after But in the divine persons there is no before and after Therefore Image cannot be a personal name in God On the contrary Augustine says De Trin vii one What is more absurd than to say that an image is referred to itself Therefore the Image in God is a relation and is thus a personal name I answer that Image includes the idea of similitude Still not any kind of similitude suffices for the notion of image but only similitude of species or at least of some specific sign In corporeal things the specific sign consists chiefly in the figure For we see that the species of different animals are of different figures but not of different colors Hence if the color of anything is depicted on a wall this is not called an image unless the figure is likewise depicted Further neither the similitude of species or of figure is enough for an image which requires also the idea of origin because as Augustine says QQ lxxxiii qu seventy four One egg is not the image of another because it is not derived from it Therefore for a true image it is required that one proceeds from another like to it in species or at least in specific sign Now whatever imports procession or origin in God belongs to the persons Hence the name Image is a personal name Reply Obj one Image properly speaking means whatever proceeds forth in likeness to another That to the likeness of which anything proceeds is properly speaking called the exemplar and is improperly called the image Nevertheless Augustine Fulgentius uses the name of Image in this sense when he says that the divine nature of the Holy Trinity is the Image to whom man was made Reply Obj two species as mentioned by Hilary in the definition of image means the form derived from one thing to another In this sense image is said to be the species of anything as that which is assimilated to anything is called its form inasmuch as it has a like form Reply Obj three Imitation in God does not signify posteriority but only assimilation SECOND ARTICLE I Q thirty five Art two Whether the Name of Image Is Proper to the Son Objection one It would seem that the name of Image is not proper to the Son because as Damascene says De Fide Orth i eighteen The Holy Ghost is the Image of the Son Therefore Image does not belong to the Son alone Obj two Further similitude in expression belongs to the nature of an image as Augustine says QQ lxxxiii qu seventy four But this belongs to the Holy Ghost Who proceeds from another by way of similitude Therefore the Holy Ghost is an Image and so to be Image does not belong to the Son alone Obj three Further man is also called the image of God according to one Cor eleven seven The man ought not to cover his head for he is the image and the glory of God Therefore Image is not proper to the Son On the contrary Augustine says De Trin vi two The Son alone is the Image of the Father I answer that The Greek Doctors commonly say that the Holy Ghost is the Image of both the Father and of the Son but the Latin Doctors attribute the name Image to the Son alone For it is not found in the canonical Scripture except as applied to the Son as in the words Who is the Image of the invisible God the firstborn of creatures colonel one fifteen and again Who being the brightness of His glory and the figure of His substance Heb one three Some explain this by the fact that the Son agrees with the Father not in nature only but also in the notion of principle whereas the Holy Ghost agrees neither with the Son nor with the Father in any notion This however does not seem to suffice Because as it is not by reason of the relations that we consider either equality or inequality in God as Augustine says De Trin v six so neither by reason thereof do we consider that similitude which is essential to image Hence others say that the Holy Ghost cannot be called the Image of the Son because there cannot be an image of an image nor of the Father because again the image must be immediately related to that which it is the image and the Holy Ghost is related to the Father through the Son nor again is He the Image of the Father and the Son because then there would be one image of two which is impossible Hence it follows that the Holy Ghost is in no way an Image But this is no proof for the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost as we shall explain further on Q thirty six A four Hence there is nothing to prevent there being one Image of the Father and of the Son inasmuch as they are one since even man is one image of the whole Trinity Therefore we must explain the matter otherwise by saying that as the Holy Ghost although by His procession He receives the nature of the Father as the Son also receives it nevertheless is not said to be born so although He receives the likeness of the Father He is not called the Image because the Son proceeds as word and it is essential to word to be like species with that whence it proceeds whereas this does not essentially belong to love although it may belong to that love which is the Holy Ghost inasmuch as He is the divine love Reply Obj one Damascene and the other Greek Doctors commonly employ the term image as meaning a perfect similitude Reply Obj two Although the Holy Ghost is like to the Father and the Son still it does not follow that He is the Image as above explained Reply Obj three The image of a thing may be found in something in two ways In one way it is found in something of the same specific nature as the image of the king is found in his son In another way it is found in something of a different nature as the king s image on the coin In the first sense the Son is the Image of the Father in the second sense man is called the image of God and therefore in order to express the imperfect character of the divine image in man man is not simply called the image but to the image whereby is expressed a certain movement of tendency to perfection But it cannot be said that the Son of God is to the image because He is the perfect Image of the Father QUESTION thirty six OF THE PERSON OF THE HOLY GHOST In Four Articles We proceed to treat of what belongs to the person of the Holy Ghost Who is called not only the Holy Ghost but also the Love and Gift of God Concerning the name Holy Ghost there are four points of inquiry one Whether this name Holy Ghost is the proper name of one divine Person two Whether that divine person Who is called the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son three Whether He proceeds from the Father through the Son four Whether the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost FIRST ARTICLE I Q thirty six Art one Whether This Name Holy Ghost Is the Proper Name of One Divine Person Objection one It would seem that this name Holy Ghost is not the proper name of one divine person For no name which is common to the three persons is the proper name of any one person But this name of Holy Ghost It should be borne in mind that the word ghost is the old English equivalent for the Latin spiritus whether in the sense of breath or blast or in the sense of spirit as an immaterial substance Thus we read in the former sense Hampole Psalter x seven The Gost of Storms spiritus procellarum and in the latter Trubled gost is sacrifice of God Prose Psalter A D thirteen twenty five and Oure wrestlynge is against the spiritual wicked gostes of the ayre More Comfort against Tribulation and in our modern expression of giving up the ghost As applied to God and not specially to the third Holy Person we have an example from Maunder Jhesu Criste was the worde and the goste of Good See Oxford Dictionary is common to the three persons for Hilary De Trin viii shows that the Spirit of God sometimes means the Father as in the words of Isa sixty one one The Spirit of the Lord is upon me and sometimes the Son as when the Son says In the Spirit of God I cast out devils Matt twelve twenty eight showing that He cast out devils by His own natural power and that sometimes it means the Holy Ghost as in the words of Joel two twenty eight I will pour out of My Spirit over all flesh Therefore this name Holy Ghost is not the proper name of a divine person Obj two Further the names of the divine persons are relative terms as Boethius says De Trin But this name Holy Ghost is not a relative term Therefore this name is not the proper name of a divine Person Obj three Further because the Son is the name of a divine Person He cannot be called the Son of this or of that But the spirit is spoken of as of this or that man as appears in the words The Lord said to Moses I will take of thy spirit and will give to them Num eleven seventeen and also The Spirit of Elias rested upon Eliseus four Kings two fifteen Therefore Holy Ghost does not seem to be the proper name of a divine Person On the contrary It is said one John five seven There are three who bear witness in heaven the Father the Word and the Holy Ghost As Augustine says De Trin vii four When we ask Three what we say Three persons Therefore the Holy Ghost is the name of a divine person I answer that While there are two processions in God one of these the procession of love has no proper name of its own as stated above Q twenty seven A four ad three Hence the relations also which follow from this procession are without a name Q twenty eight A four for which reason the Person proceeding in that manner has not a proper name But as some names are accommodated by the usual mode of speaking to signify the aforesaid relations as when we use the names of procession and spiration which in the strict sense more fittingly signify the notional acts than the relations so to signify the divine Person Who proceeds by way of love this name Holy Ghost is by the use of scriptural speech accommodated to Him The appropriateness of this name may be shown in two ways Firstly from the fact that the person who is called Holy Ghost has something in common with the other Persons For as Augustine says De Trin xv seventeen v eleven Because the Holy Ghost is common to both He Himself is called that properly which both are called in common For the Father also is a spirit and the Son is a spirit and the Father is holy and the Son is holy Secondly from the proper signification of the name For the name spirit in things corporeal seems to signify impulse and motion for we call the breath and the wind by the term spirit Now it is a property of love to move and impel the will of the lover towards the object loved Further holiness is attributed to whatever is ordered to God Therefore because the divine person proceeds by way of the love whereby God is loved that person is most properly named The Holy Ghost Reply Obj one The expression Holy Spirit if taken as two words is applicable to the whole Trinity because by spirit the immateriality of the divine substance is signified for corporeal spirit is invisible and has but little matter hence we apply this term to all immaterial and invisible substances And by adding the word holy we signify the purity of divine goodness But if Holy Spirit be taken as one word it is thus that the expression in the usage of the Church is accommodated to signify one of the three persons the one who proceeds by way of love for the reason above explained Reply Obj two Although this name Holy Ghost does not indicate a relation still it takes the place of a relative term inasmuch as it is accommodated to signify a Person distinct from the others by relation only Yet this name may be understood as including a relation if we understand the Holy Spirit as being breathed spiratus Reply Obj three In the name Son we understand that relation only which is of something from a principle in regard to that principle but in the name Father we understand the relation of principle and likewise in the name of Spirit inasmuch as it implies a moving power But to no creature does it belong to be a principle as regards a divine person but rather the reverse Therefore we can say our Father and our Spirit but we cannot say our Son SECOND ARTICLE I Q thirty six Art two Whether the Holy Ghost Proceeds from the Son Objection one It would seem that the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Son For as Dionysius says Div Nom i We must not dare to say anything concerning the substantial Divinity except what has been divinely expressed to us by the sacred oracles But in the Sacred Scripture we are not told that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son but only that He proceeds from the Father as appears from John fifteen twenty six The Spirit of truth Who proceeds from the Father Therefore the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Son Obj two Further In the creed of the council of Constantinople Can vii we read We believe in the Holy Ghost the Lord and Life giver who proceeds from the Father with the Father and the Son to be adored and glorified Therefore it should not be added in our Creed that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son and those who added such a thing appear to be worthy of anathema Obj three Further Damascene says De Fide Orth i We say that the Holy Ghost is from the Father and we name Him the spirit of the Father but we do not say that the Holy Ghost is from the Son yet we name Him the Spirit of the Son Therefore the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Son Obj four Further Nothing proceeds from that wherein it rests But the Holy Ghost rests in the Son for it is said in the legend of saint Andrew Peace be to you and to all who believe in the one God the Father and in His only Son our Lord Jesus Christ and in the one Holy Ghost proceeding from the Father and abiding in the Son Therefore the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Son Obj five Further the Son proceeds as the Word But our breath spiritus does not seem to proceed in ourselves from our word Therefore the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Son Obj six Further the Holy Ghost proceeds perfectly from the Father Therefore it is superfluous to say that He proceeds from the Son Obj seven Further the actual and the possible do not differ in things perpetual Phys iii text thirty two and much less so in God But it is possible for the Holy Ghost to be distinguished from the Son even if He did not proceed from Him For Anselm says De Process Spir Sancti ii The Son and the Holy Ghost have their Being from the Father but each in a different way one by Birth the other by Procession so that they are thus distinct from one another And further on he says For even if for no other reason were the Son and the Holy Ghost distinct this alone would suffice Therefore the Holy Spirit is distinct from the Son without proceeding from Him On the contrary Athanasius says The Holy Ghost is from the Father and the Son not made nor created nor begotten but proceeding I answer that It must be said that the Holy Ghost is from the Son For if He were not from Him He could in no wise be personally distinguished from Him as appears from what has been said above Q twenty eight A three Q thirty A two For it cannot be said that the divine Persons are distinguished from each other in any absolute sense for it would follow that there would not be one essence of the three persons since everything that is spoken of God in an absolute sense belongs to the unity of essence Therefore it must be said that the divine persons are distinguished from each other only by the relations Now the relations cannot distinguish the persons except forasmuch as they are opposite relations which appears from the fact that the Father has two relations by one of which He is related to the Son and by the other to the Holy Ghost but these are not opposite relations and therefore they do not make two persons but belong only to the one person of the Father If therefore in the Son and the Holy Ghost there were two relations only whereby each of them were related to the Father these relations would not be opposite to each other as neither would be the two relations whereby the Father is related to them Hence as the person of the Father is one it would follow that the person of the Son and of the Holy Ghost would be one having two relations opposed to the two relations of the Father But this is heretical since it destroys the Faith in the Trinity Therefore the Son and the Holy Ghost must be related to each other by opposite relations Now there cannot be in God any relations opposed to each other except relations of origin as proved above Q twenty eight A four And opposite relations of origin are to be understood as of a principle and of what is from the principle Therefore we must conclude that it is necessary to say that either the Son is from the Holy Ghost which no one says or that the Holy Ghost is from the Son as we confess Furthermore the order of the procession of each one agrees with this conclusion For it was said above Q twenty seven AA two four Q twenty eight A four that the Son proceeds by the way of the intellect as Word and the Holy Ghost by way of the will as Love Now love must proceed from a word For we do not love anything unless we apprehend it by a mental conception Hence also in this way it is manifest that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son We derive a knowledge of the same truth from the very order of nature itself For we nowhere find that several things proceed from one without order except in those which differ only by their matter as for instance one smith produces many knives distinct from each other materially with no order to each other whereas in things in which there is not only a material distinction we always find that some order exists in the multitude produced Hence also in the order of creatures produced the beauty of the divine wisdom is displayed So if from the one Person of the Father two persons proceed the Son and the Holy Ghost there must be some order between them Nor can any other be assigned except the order of their nature whereby one is from the other Therefore it cannot be said that the Son and the Holy Ghost proceed from the Father in such a way as that neither of them proceeds from the other unless we admit in them a material distinction which is impossible Hence also the Greeks themselves recognize that the procession of the Holy Ghost has some order to the Son For they grant that the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of the Son and that He is from the Father through the Son Some of them are said also to concede that He is from the Son or that He flows from the Son but not that He proceeds which seems to come from ignorance or obstinacy For a just consideration of the truth will convince anyone that the word procession is the one most commonly applied to all that denotes origin of any kind For we use the term to describe any kind of origin as when we say that a line proceeds from a point a ray from the sun a stream from a source and likewise in everything else Hence granted that the Holy Ghost originates in any way from the Son we can conclude that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son Reply Obj one We ought not to say about God anything which is not found in Holy Scripture either explicitly or implicitly But although we do not find it verbally expressed in Holy Scripture that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son still we do find it in the sense of Scripture especially where the Son says speaking of the Holy Ghost He will glorify Me because He shall receive of Mine John sixteen fourteen It is also a rule of Holy Scripture that whatever is said of the Father applies to the Son although there be added an exclusive term except only as regards what belongs to the opposite relations whereby the Father and the Son are distinguished from each other For when the Lord says No one knoweth the Son but the Father the idea of the Son knowing Himself is not excluded So therefore when we say that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father even though it be added that He proceeds from the Father alone the Son would not thereby be at all excluded because as regards being the principle of the Holy Ghost the Father and the Son are not opposed to each other but only as regards the fact that one is the Father and the other is the Son Reply Obj two In every council of the Church a symbol of faith has been drawn up to meet some prevalent error condemned in the council at that time Hence subsequent councils are not to be described as making a new symbol of faith but what was implicitly contained in the first symbol was explained by some addition directed against rising heresies Hence in the decision of the council of Chalcedon it is declared that those who were congregated together in the council of Constantinople handed down the doctrine about the Holy Ghost not implying that there was anything wanting in the doctrine of their predecessors who had gathered together at Nicaea but explaining what those fathers had understood of the matter Therefore because at the time of the ancient councils the error of those who said that the Holy Ghost did not proceed from the Son had not arisen it was not necessary to make any explicit declaration on that point whereas later on when certain errors rose up another council Council of Rome under Pope Damasus assembled in the west the matter was explicitly defined by the authority of the Roman Pontiff by whose authority also the ancient councils were summoned and confirmed Nevertheless the truth was contained implicitly in the belief that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father Reply Obj three The Nestorians were the first to introduce the error that the Holy Ghost did not proceed from the Son as appears in a Nestorian creed condemned in the council of Ephesus This error was embraced by Theodoric the Nestorian and several others after him among whom was also Damascene Hence in that point his opinion is not to be held Although too it has been asserted by some that while Damascene did not confess that the Holy Ghost was from the Son neither do those words of his express a denial thereof Reply Obj four When the Holy Ghost is said to rest or abide in the Son it does not mean that He does not proceed from Him for the Son also is said to abide in the Father although He proceeds from the Father Also the Holy Ghost is said to rest in the Son as the love of the lover abides in the beloved or in reference to the human nature of Christ by reason of what is written On whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him He it is who baptizes John one thirty three Reply Obj five The Word in God is not taken after the similitude of the vocal word whence the breath spiritus does not proceed for it would then be only metaphorical but after the similitude of the mental word whence proceeds love Reply Obj six For the reason that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father perfectly not only is it not superfluous to say He proceeds from the Son but rather it is absolutely necessary Forasmuch as one power belongs to the Father and the Son and because whatever is from the Father must be from the Son unless it be opposed to the property of filiation for the Son is not from Himself although He is from the Father Reply Obj seven The Holy Ghost is distinguished from the Son inasmuch as the origin of one is distinguished from the origin of the other but the difference itself of origin comes from the fact that the Son is only from the Father whereas the Holy Ghost is from the Father and the Son for otherwise the processions would not be distinguished from each other as explained above and in Q twenty seven THIRD ARTICLE I Q thirty six Art three Whether the Holy Ghost Proceeds from the Father Through the Son Objection one It would seem that the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Father through the Son For whatever proceeds from one through another does not proceed immediately Therefore if the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father through the Son He does not proceed immediately which seems to be unfitting Obj two Further if the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father through the Son He does not proceed from the Son except on account of the Father But whatever causes a thing to be such is yet more so Therefore He proceeds more from the Father than from the Son Obj three Further the Son has His being by generation Therefore if the Holy Ghost is from the Father through the Son it follows that the Son is first generated and afterwards the Holy Ghost proceeds and thus the procession of the Holy Ghost is not eternal which is heretical Obj four Further when anyone acts through another the same may be said conversely For as we say that the king acts through the bailiff so it can be said conversely that the bailiff acts through the king But we can never say that the Son spirates the Holy Ghost through the Father Therefore it can never be said that the Father spirates the Holy Ghost through the Son On the contrary Hilary says De Trin xii Keep me I pray in this expression of my faith that I may ever possess the Father namely Thyself that I may adore Thy Son together with Thee and that I may deserve Thy Holy Spirit who is through Thy Only Begotten I answer that Whenever one is said to act through another this preposition through points out in what is covered by it some cause or principle of that act But since action is a mean between the agent and the thing done sometimes that which is covered by the preposition through is the cause of the action as proceeding from the agent and in that case it is the cause of why the agent acts whether it be a final cause or a formal cause whether it be effective or motive It is a final cause when we say for instance that the artisan works through love of gain It is a formal cause when we say that he works through his art It is a motive cause when we say that he works through the command of another Sometimes however that which is covered by this preposition through is the cause of the action regarded as terminated in the thing done as for instance when we say the artisan acts through the mallet for this does not mean that the mallet is the cause why the artisan acts but that it is the cause why the thing made proceeds from the artisan and that it has even this effect from the artisan This is why it is sometimes said that this preposition through sometimes denotes direct authority as when we say the king works through the bailiff and sometimes indirect authority as when we say the bailiff works through the king Therefore because the Son receives from the Father that the Holy Ghost proceeds from Him it can be said that the Father spirates the Holy Ghost through the Son or that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father through the Son which has the same meaning Reply Obj one In every action two things are to be considered the suppositum acting and the power whereby it acts as for instance fire heats through heat So if we consider in the Father and the Son the power whereby they spirate the Holy Ghost there is no mean for this is one and the same power But if we consider the persons themselves spirating then as the Holy Ghost proceeds both from the Father and from the Son the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father immediately as from Him and mediately as from the Son and thus He is said to proceed from the Father through the Son So also did Abel proceed immediately from Adam inasmuch as Adam was his father and mediately as Eve was his mother who proceeded from Adam although indeed this example of a material procession is inept to signify the immaterial procession of the divine persons Reply Obj two If the Son received from the Father a numerically distinct power for the spiration of the Holy Ghost it would follow that He would be a secondary and instrumental cause and thus the Holy Ghost would proceed more from the Father than from the Son whereas on the contrary the same spirative power belongs to the Father and to the Son and therefore the Holy Ghost proceeds equally from both although sometimes He is said to proceed principally or properly from the Father because the Son has this power from the Father Reply Obj three As the begetting of the Son is company eternal with the begetter and hence the Father does not exist before begetting the Son so the procession of the Holy Ghost is company eternal with His principle Hence the Son was not begotten before the Holy Ghost proceeded but each of the operations is eternal Reply Obj four When anyone is said to work through anything the converse proposition is not always true For we do not say that the mallet works through the carpenter whereas we can say that the bailiff acts through the king because it is the bailiff s place to act since he is master of his own act but it is not the mallet s place to act but only to be made to act and hence it is used only as an instrument The bailiff is however said to act through the king although this preposition through denotes a medium for the more a suppositum is prior in action so much the more is its power immediate as regards the effect inasmuch as the power of the first cause joins the second cause to its effect Hence also first principles are said to be immediate in the demonstrative sciences Therefore so far as the bailiff is a medium according to the order of the subject s acting the king is said to work through the bailiff but according to the order of powers the bailiff is said to act through the king forasmuch as the power of the king gives the bailiff s action its effect Now there is no order of power between Father and Son but only order of supposita and hence we say that the Father spirates through the Son and not conversely FOURTH ARTICLE I Q thirty six Art four Whether the Father and the Son Are One Principle of the Holy Ghost Objection one It would seem that the Father and the Son are not one principle of the Holy Ghost For the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Father and the Son as they are one not as they are one in nature for the Holy Ghost would in that way proceed from Himself as He is one in nature with Them nor again inasmuch as they are united in any one property for it is clear that one property cannot belong to two subjects Therefore the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son as distinct from one another Therefore the Father and the Son are not one principle of the Holy Ghost Obj two Further in this proposition the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost we do not designate personal unity because in that case the Father and the Son would be one person nor again do we designate the unity of property because if one property were the reason of the Father and the Son being one principle of the Holy Ghost similarly on account of His two properties the Father would be two principles of the Son and of the Holy Ghost which cannot be admitted Therefore the Father and the Son are not one principle of the Holy Ghost Obj three Further the Son is not one with the Father more than is the Holy Ghost But the Holy Ghost and the Father are not one principle as regards any other divine person Therefore neither are the Father and the Son Obj four Further if the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost this one is either the Father or it is not the Father But we cannot assert either of these positions because if the one is the Father it follows that the Son is the Father and if the one is not the Father it follows that the Father is not the Father Therefore we cannot say that the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost Obj five Further if the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost it seems necessary to say conversely that the one principle of the Holy Ghost is the Father and the Son But this seems to be false for this word principle stands either for the person of the Father or for the person of the Son and in either sense it is false Therefore this proposition also is false that the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost Obj six Further unity in substance makes identity So if the Father and the Son are the one principle of the Holy Ghost it follows that they are the same principle which is denied by many Therefore we cannot grant that the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost Obj seven Further the Father Son and Holy Ghost are called one Creator because they are the one principle of the creature But the Father and the Son are not one but two Spirators as many assert and this agrees also with what Hilary says De Trin ii that the Holy Ghost is to be confessed as proceeding from Father and Son as authors Therefore the Father and the Son are not one principle of the Holy Ghost On the contrary Augustine says De Trin v fourteen that the Father and the Son are not two principles but one principle of the Holy Ghost I answer that The Father and the Son are in everything one wherever there is no distinction between them of opposite relation Hence since there is no relative opposition between them as the principle of the Holy Ghost it follows that the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost Some however assert that this proposition is incorrect The Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost because they declare since the word principle in the singular number does not signify person but property it must be taken as an adjective and forasmuch as an adjective cannot be modified by another adjective it cannot properly be said that the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost unless one be taken as an adverb so that the meaning should be They are one principle that is in one and the same way But then it might be equally right to say that the Father is two principles of the Son and of the Holy Ghost namely in two ways Therefore we must say that although this word principle signifies a property it does so after the manner of a substantive as do the words father and son even in things created Hence it takes its number from the form it signifies like other substantives Therefore as the Father and the Son are one God by reason of the unity of the form that is signified by this word God so they are one principle of the Holy Ghost by reason of the unity of the property that is signified in this word principle Reply Obj one If we consider the spirative power the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son as they are one in the spirative power which in a certain way signifies the nature with the property as we shall see later ad seven Nor is there any reason against one property being in two supposita that possess one common nature But if we consider the supposita of the spiration then we may say that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son as distinct for He proceeds from them as the unitive love of both Reply Obj two In the proposition the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost one property is designated which is the form signified by the term It does not thence follow that by reason of the several properties the Father can be called several principles for this would imply in Him a plurality of subjects Reply Obj three It is not by reason of relative properties that we speak of similitude or dissimilitude in God but by reason of the essence Hence as the Father is not more like to Himself than He is to the Son so likewise neither is the Son more like to the Father than is the Holy Ghost Reply Obj four These two propositions The Father and the Son are one principle which is the Father or one principle which is not the Father are not mutually contradictory and hence it is not necessary to assert one or other of them For when we say the Father and the Son are one principle this word principle has not determinate supposition but rather it stands indeterminately for two persons together Hence there is a fallacy of figure of speech as the argument concludes from the indeterminate to the determinate Reply Obj five This proposition is also true The one principle of the Holy Ghost is the Father and the Son because the word principle does not stand for one person only but indistinctly for the two persons as above explained Reply Obj six There is no reason against saying that the Father and the Son are the same principle because the word principle stands confusedly and indistinctly for the two Persons together Reply Obj seven Some say that although the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost there are two spirators by reason of the distinction of supposita as also there are two spirating because acts refer to subjects Yet this does not hold good as to the name Creator because the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son as from two distinct persons as above explained whereas the creature proceeds from the three persons not as distinct persons but as united in essence It seems however better to say that because spirating is an adjective and spirator a substantive we can say that the Father and the Son are two spirating by reason of the plurality of the supposita but not two spirators by reason of the one spiration For adjectival words derive their number from the supposita but substantives from themselves according to the form signified As to what Hilary says that the Holy Ghost is from the Father and the Son as His authors this is to be explained in the sense that the substantive here stands for the adjective QUESTION thirty seven OF THE NAME OF THE HOLY GHOST LOVE In Two Articles We now inquire concerning the name Love on which arise two points of inquiry one Whether it is the proper name of the Holy Ghost two Whether the Father and the Son love each other by the Holy Ghost FIRST ARTICLE I Q thirty seven Art two Whether Love Is the Proper Name of the Holy Ghost Objection one It would seem that Love is not the proper name of the Holy Ghost For Augustine says De Trin xv seventeen As the Father Son and Holy Ghost are called Wisdom and are not three Wisdoms but one I know not why the Father Son and Holy Ghost should not be called Charity and all together one Charity But no name which is predicated in the singular of each person and of all together is a proper name of a person Therefore this name Love is not the proper name of the Holy Ghost Obj two Further the Holy Ghost is a subsisting person but love is not used to signify a subsisting person but rather an action passing from the lover to the beloved Therefore Love is not the proper name of the Holy Ghost Obj three Further Love is the bond between lovers for as Dionysius says Div Nom iv Love is a unitive force But a bond is a medium between what it joins together not something proceeding from them Therefore since the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son as was shown above Q thirty six A two it seems that He is not the Love or bond of the Father and the Son Obj four Further Love belongs to every lover But the Holy Ghost is a lover therefore He has love So if the Holy Ghost is Love He must be love of love and spirit from spirit which is not admissible On the contrary Gregory says Hom xxx in Pentecost The Holy Ghost Himself is Love I answer that The name Love in God can be taken essentially and personally If taken personally it is the proper name of the Holy Ghost as Word is the proper name of the Son To see this we must know that since as shown above Q twenty seven AA two three four five there are two processions in God one by way of the intellect which is the procession of the Word and another by way of the will which is the procession of Love forasmuch as the former is the more known to us we have been able to apply more suitable names to express our various considerations as regards that procession but not as regards the procession of the will Hence we are obliged to employ circumlocution as regards the person Who proceeds and the relations following from this procession which are called procession and spiration as stated above Q twenty seven A four ad three and yet express the origin rather than the relation in the strict sense of the term Nevertheless we must consider them in respect of each procession simply For as when a thing is understood by anyone there results in the one who understands a conception of the object understood which conception we call word so when anyone loves an object a certain impression results so to speak of the thing loved in the affection of the lover by reason of which the object loved is said to be in the lover as also the thing understood is in the one who understands so that when anyone understands and loves himself he is in himself not only by real identity but also as the object understood is in the one who understands and the thing loved is in the lover As regards the intellect however words have been found to describe the mutual relation of the one who understands the object understood as appears in the word to understand and other words are used to express the procession of the intellectual conception namely to speak and word Hence in God to understand is applied only to the essence because it does not import relation to the Word that proceeds whereas Word is said personally because it signifies what proceeds and the term to speak is a notional term as importing the relation of the principle of the Word to the Word Himself On the other hand on the part of the will with the exception of the words dilection and love which express the relation of the lover to the object loved there are no other terms in use which express the relation of the impression or affection of the object loved produced in the lover by fact that he loves to the principle of that impression or vice versa And therefore on account of the poverty of our vocabulary we express these relations by the words love and dilection just as if we were to call the Word intelligence conceived or wisdom begotten It follows that so far as love means only the relation of the lover to the object loved love and to love are said of the essence as understanding and to understand but on the other hand so far as these words are used to express the relation to its principle of what proceeds by way of love and vice versa so that by love is understood the love proceeding and by to love is understood the spiration of the love proceeding in that sense love is the name of the person and to love is a notional term as to speak and to beget Reply Obj one Augustine is there speaking of charity as it means the divine essence as was said above here and Q twenty four A two ad four Reply Obj two Although to understand and to will and to love signify actions passing on to their objects nevertheless they are actions that remain in the agents as stated above Q fourteen A four yet in such a way that in the agent itself they import a certain relation to their object Hence love also in ourselves is something that abides in the lover and the word of the heart is something abiding in the speaker yet with a relation to the thing expressed by word or loved But in God in whom there is nothing accidental there is more than this because both Word and Love are subsistent Therefore when we say that the Holy Ghost is the Love of the Father for the Son or for something else we do not mean anything that passes into another but only the relation of love to the beloved as also in the Word is imported the relation of the Word to the thing expressed by the Word Reply Obj three The Holy Ghost is said to be the bond of the Father and Son inasmuch as He is Love because since the Father loves Himself and the Son with one Love and conversely there is expressed in the Holy Ghost as Love the relation of the Father to the Son and conversely as that of the lover to the beloved But from the fact that the Father and the Son mutually love one another it necessarily follows that this mutual Love the Holy Ghost proceeds from both As regards origin therefore the Holy Ghost is not the medium but the third person in the Trinity whereas as regards the aforesaid relation He is the bond between the two persons as proceeding from both Reply Obj four As it does not belong to the Son though He understands to produce a word for it belongs to Him to understand as the word proceeding so in like manner although the Holy Ghost loves taking Love as an essential term still it does not belong to Him to spirate love which is to take love as a notional term because He loves essentially as love proceeding but not as the one whence love proceeds SECOND ARTICLE I Q thirty seven Art two Whether the Father and the Son Love Each Other by the Holy Ghost Objection one It would seem that the Father and the Son do not love each other by the Holy Ghost For Augustine De Trin vii one proves that the Father is not wise by the Wisdom begotten But as the Son is Wisdom begotten so the Holy Ghost is the Love proceeding as explained above Q twenty seven A three Therefore the Father and the Son do not love Themselves by the Love proceeding which is the Holy Ghost Obj two Further in the proposition The Father and the Son love each other by the Holy Ghost this word love is to be taken either essentially or notionally But it cannot be true if taken essentially because in the same way we might say that the Father understands by the Son nor again if it is taken notionally for then in like manner it might be said that the Father and the Son spirate by the Holy Ghost or that the Father generates by the Son Therefore in no way is this proposition true The Father and the Son love each other by the Holy Ghost Obj three Further by the same love the Father loves the Son and Himself and us But the Father does not love Himself by the Holy Ghost for no notional act is reflected back on the principle of the act since it cannot be said that the Father begets Himself or that He spirates Himself Therefore neither can it be said that He loves Himself by the Holy Ghost if to love is taken in a notional sense Again the love wherewith He loves us is not the Holy Ghost because it imports a relation to creatures and this belongs to the essence Therefore this also is false The Father loves the Son by the Holy Ghost On the contrary Augustine says De Trin vi five The Holy Ghost is He whereby the Begotten is loved by the one begetting and loves His Begetter I answer that A difficulty about this question is objected to the effect that when we say the Father loves the Son by the Holy Ghost since the ablative is construed as denoting a cause it seems to mean that the Holy Ghost is the principle of love to the Father and the Son which cannot be admitted In view of this difficulty some have held that it is false that the Father and the Son love each other by the Holy Ghost and they add that it was retracted by Augustine when he retracted its equivalent to the effect that the Father is wise by the Wisdom begotten Others say that the proposition is inaccurate and ought to be expounded as that the Father loves the Son by the Holy Ghost that is by His essential Love which is appropriated to the Holy Ghost Others further say that this ablative should be construed as importing a sign so that it means the Holy Ghost is the sign that the Father loves the Son inasmuch as the Holy Ghost proceeds from them both as Love Others again say that this ablative must be construed as importing the relation of formal cause because the Holy Ghost is the love whereby the Father and the Son formally love each other Others again say that it should be construed as importing the relation of a formal effect and these approach nearer to the truth To make the matter clear we must consider that since a thing is commonly denominated from its forms as white from whiteness and man from humanity everything whence anything is denominated in this particular respect stands to that thing in the relation of form So when I say this man is clothed with a garment the ablative is to be construed as having relation to the formal cause although the garment is not the form Now it may happen that a thing may be denominated from that which proceeds from it not only as an agent is from its action but also as from the term itself of the action that is the effect when the effect itself is included in the idea of the action For we say that fire warms by heating although heating is not the heat which is the form of the fire but is an action proceeding from the fire and we say that a tree flowers with the flower although the flower is not the tree s form but is the effect proceeding from the form In this way therefore we must say that since in God to love is taken in two ways essentially and notionally when it is taken essentially it means that the Father and the Son love each other not by the Holy Ghost but by their essence Hence Augustine says De Trin xv seven Who dares to say that the Father loves neither Himself nor the Son nor the Holy Ghost except by the Holy Ghost The opinions first quoted are to be taken in this sense But when the term Love is taken in a notional sense it means nothing else than to spirate love just as to speak is to produce a word and to flower is to produce flowers As therefore we say that a tree flowers by its flower so do we say that the Father by the Word or the Son speaks Himself and His creatures and that the Father and the Son love each other and us by the Holy Ghost or by Love proceeding Reply Obj one To be wise or intelligent is taken only essentially in God therefore we cannot say that the Father is wise or intelligent by the Son But to love is taken not only essentially but also in a notional sense and in this way we can say that the Father and the Son love each other by the Holy Ghost as was above explained Reply Obj two When the idea of an action includes a determined effect the principle of the action may be denominated both from the action and from the effect so we can say for instance that a tree flowers by its flowering and by its flower When however the idea of an action does not include a determined effect then in that case the principle of the action cannot be denominated from the effect but only from the action For we do not say that the tree produces the flower by the flower but by the production of the flower So when we say spirates or begets this imports only a notional act Hence we cannot say that the Father spirates by the Holy Ghost or begets by the Son But we can say that the Father speaks by the Word as by the Person proceeding and speaks by the speaking as by a notional act forasmuch as to speak imports a determinate person proceeding since to speak means to produce a word Likewise to love taken in a notional sense means to produce love and so it can be said that the Father loves the Son by the Holy Ghost as by the person proceeding and by Love itself as a notional act Reply Obj three The Father loves not only the Son but also Himself and us by the Holy Ghost because as above explained to love taken in a notional sense not only imports the production of a divine person but also the person produced by way of love which has relation to the object loved Hence as the Father speaks Himself and every creature by His begotten Word inasmuch as the Word begotten adequately represents the Father and every creature so He loves Himself and every creature by the Holy Ghost inasmuch as the Holy Ghost proceeds as the love of the primal goodness whereby the Father loves Himself and every creature Thus it is evident that relation to the creature is implied both in the Word and in the proceeding Love as it were in a secondary way inasmuch as the divine truth and goodness are a principle of understanding and loving all creatures QUESTION thirty eight OF THE NAME OF THE HOLY GHOST AS GIFT In Two Articles There now follows the consideration of the Gift concerning which there are two points of inquiry one Whether Gift can be a personal name two Whether it is the proper name of the Holy Ghost FIRST ARTICLE I Q thirty eight Art one Whether Gift Is a Personal Name Objection one It would seem that Gift is not a personal name For every personal name imports a distinction in God But the name of Gift does not import a distinction in God for Augustine says De Trin xv nineteen that the Holy Ghost is so given as God s Gift that He also gives Himself as God Therefore Gift is not a personal name Obj two Further no personal name belongs to the divine essence But the divine essence is the Gift which the Father gives to the Son as Hilary says De Trin ix Therefore Gift is not a personal name Obj three Further according to Damascene De Fide Orth iv nineteen there is no subjection nor service in the divine persons But gift implies a subjection both as regards him to whom it is given and as regards him by whom it is given Therefore Gift is not a personal name Obj four Further Gift imports relation to the creature and it thus seems to be said of God in time But personal names are said of God from eternity as Father and Son Therefore Gift is not a personal name On the contrary Augustine says De Trin xv nineteen As the body of flesh is nothing but flesh so the gift of the Holy Ghost is nothing but the Holy Ghost But the Holy Ghost is a personal name so also therefore is Gift I answer that The word gift imports an aptitude for being given And what is given has an aptitude or relation both to the giver and to that to which it is given For it would not be given by anyone unless it was his to give and it is given to someone to be his Now a divine person is said to belong to another either by origin as the Son belongs to the Father or as possessed by another But we are said to possess what we can freely use or enjoy as we please and in this way a divine person cannot be possessed except by a rational creature united to God Other creatures can be moved by a divine person not however in such a way as to be able to enjoy the divine person and to use the effect thereof The rational creature does sometimes attain thereto as when it is made partaker of the divine Word and of the Love proceeding so as freely to know God truly and to love God rightly Hence the rational creature alone can possess the divine person Nevertheless in order that it may possess Him in this manner its own power avails nothing hence this must be given it from above for that is said to be given to us which we have from another source Thus a divine person can be given and can be a gift Reply Obj one The name Gift imports a personal distinction in so far as gift imports something belonging to another through its origin Nevertheless the Holy Ghost gives Himself inasmuch as He is His own and can use or rather enjoy Himself as also a free man belongs to himself And as Augustine says In Joan Tract xxix What is more yours than yourself Or we might say and more fittingly that a gift must belong in a way to the giver But the phrase this is this one s can be understood in several senses In one way it means identity as Augustine says In Joan Tract xxix and in that sense gift is the same as the giver but not the same as the one to whom it is given The Holy Ghost gives Himself in that sense In another sense a thing is another s as a possession or as a slave and in that sense gift is essentially distinct from the giver and the gift of God so taken is a created thing In a third sense this is this one s through its origin only and in this sense the Son is the Father s and the Holy Ghost belongs to both Therefore so far as gift in this way signifies the possession of the giver it is personally distinguished from the giver and is a personal name Reply Obj two The divine essence is the Father s gift in the first sense as being the Father s by way of identity Reply Obj three Gift as a personal name in God does not imply subjection but only origin as regards the giver but as regards the one to whom it is given it implies a free use or enjoyment as above explained Reply Obj four Gift is not so called from being actually given but from its aptitude to be given Hence the divine person is called Gift from eternity although He is given in time Nor does it follow that it is an essential name because it imports relation to the creature but that it includes something essential in its meaning as the essence is included in the idea of person as stated above Q thirty four A three SECOND ARTICLE I Q thirty eight Art two Whether Gift Is the Proper Name of the Holy Ghost Objection one It would seem that Gift is not the proper name of the Holy Ghost For the name Gift comes from being given But as Isaiah says nine sixteen A Son is given to us Therefore to be Gift belongs to the Son as well as to the Holy Ghost Obj two Further every proper name of a person signifies a property But this word Gift does not signify a property of the Holy Ghost Therefore Gift is not a proper name of the Holy Ghost Obj three Further the Holy Ghost can be called the spirit of a man whereas He cannot be called the gift of any man but God s Gift only Therefore Gift is not the proper name of the Holy Ghost On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iv twenty As to be born is for the Son to be from the Father so for the Holy Ghost to be the Gift of God is to proceed from Father and Son But the Holy Ghost receives His proper name from the fact that He proceeds from Father and Son Therefore Gift is the proper name of the Holy Ghost I answer that Gift taken personally in God is the proper name of the Holy Ghost In proof of this we must know that a gift is properly an unreturnable giving as Aristotle says Topic iv four i e a thing which is not given with the intention of a return and it thus contains the idea of a gratuitous donation Now the reason of donation being gratuitous is love since therefore do we give something to anyone gratuitously forasmuch as we wish him well So what we first give him is the love whereby we wish him well Hence it is manifest that love has the nature of a first gift through which all free gifts are given So since the Holy Ghost proceeds as love as stated above Q twenty seven A four Q thirty seven A one He proceeds as the first gift Hence Augustine says De Trin xv twenty four By the gift which is the Holy Ghost many particular gifts are portioned out to the members of Christ Reply Obj one As the Son is properly called the Image because He proceeds by way of a word whose nature it is to be the similitude of its principle although the Holy Ghost also is like to the Father so also because the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father as love He is properly called Gift although the Son too is given For that the Son is given is from the Father s love according to the words God so loved the world as to give His only begotten Son John three sixteen Reply Obj two The name Gift involves the idea of belonging to the Giver through its origin and thus it imports the property of the origin of the Holy Ghost that is His procession Reply Obj three Before a gift is given it belongs only to the giver but when it is given it is his to whom it is given Therefore because Gift does not import the actual giving it cannot be called a gift of man but the Gift of God giving When however it has been given then it is the spirit of man or a gift bestowed on man QUESTION thirty nine OF THE PERSONS IN RELATION TO THE ESSENCE In Eight Articles Those things considered which belong to the divine persons absolutely we next treat of what concerns the person in reference to the essence to the properties and to the notional acts and of the comparison of these with each other As regards the first of these there are eight points of inquiry one Whether the essence in God is the same as the person two Whether we should say that the three persons are of one essence three Whether essential names should be predicated of the persons in the plural or in the singular four Whether notional adjectives or verbs or participles can be predicated of the essential names taken in a concrete sense five Whether the same can be predicated of essential names taken in the abstract six Whether the names of the persons can be predicated of concrete essential names seven Whether essential attributes can be appropriated to the persons eight Which attributes should be appropriated to each person FIRST ARTICLE I Q thirty nine Art one Whether in God the Essence Is the Same As the Person Objection one It would seem that in God the essence is not the same as person For whenever essence is the same as person or suppositum there can be only one suppositum of one nature as is clear in the case of all separate substances For in those things which are really one and the same one cannot be multiplied apart from the other But in God there is one essence and three persons as is clear from what is above expounded Q twenty eight A three Q thirty A two Therefore essence is not the same as person Obj two Further simultaneous affirmation and negation of the same things in the same respect cannot be true But affirmation and negation are true of essence and of person For person is distinct whereas essence is not Therefore person and essence are not the same Obj three Further nothing can be subject to itself But person is subject to essence whence it is called suppositum or hypostasis Therefore person is not the same as essence On the contrary Augustine says De Trin vi seven When we say the person of the Father we mean nothing else but the substance of the Father I answer that The truth of this question is quite clear if we consider the divine simplicity For it was shown above Q three A three that the divine simplicity requires that in God essence is the same as suppositum which in intellectual substances is nothing else than person But a difficulty seems to arise from the fact that while the divine persons are multiplied the essence nevertheless retains its unity And because as Boethius says De Trin i relation multiplies the Trinity of persons some have thought that in God essence and person differ forasmuch as they held the relations to be adjacent considering only in the relations the idea of reference to another and not the relations as realities But as it was shown above Q twenty eight A two in creatures relations are accidental whereas in God they are the divine essence itself Thence it follows that in God essence is not really distinct from person and yet that the persons are really distinguished from each other For person as above stated Q twenty nine A four signifies relation as subsisting in the divine nature But relation as referred to the essence does not differ therefrom really but only in our way of thinking while as referred to an opposite relation it has a real distinction by virtue of that opposition Thus there are one essence and three persons Reply Obj one There cannot be a distinction of suppositum in creatures by means of relations but only by essential principles because in creatures relations are not subsistent But in God relations are subsistent and so by reason of the opposition between them they distinguish the supposita and yet the essence is not distinguished because the relations themselves are not distinguished from each other so far as they are identified with the essence Reply Obj two As essence and person in God differ in our way of thinking it follows that something can be denied of the one and affirmed of the other and therefore when we suppose the one we need not suppose the other Reply Obj three Divine things are named by us after the way of created things as above explained Q thirteen AA one three And since created natures are individualized by matter which is the subject of the specific nature it follows that individuals are called subjects supposita or hypostases So the divine persons are named supposita or hypostases but not as if there really existed any real supposition or subjection SECOND ARTICLE I Q thirty nine Art two Whether It Must Be Said That the Three Persons Are of One Essence Objection one It would seem not right to say that the three persons are of one essence For Hilary says De Synod that the Father Son and Holy Ghost are indeed three by substance but one in harmony But the substance of God is His essence Therefore the three persons are not of one essence Obj two Further nothing is to be affirmed of God except what can be confirmed by the authority of Holy Writ as appears from Dionysius Div Nom i Now Holy Writ never says that the Father Son and Holy Ghost are of one essence Therefore this should not be asserted Obj three Further the divine nature is the same as the divine essence It suffices therefore to say that the three persons are of one nature Obj four Further it is not usual to say that the person is of the essence but rather that the essence is of the person Therefore it does not seem fitting to say that the three persons are of one essence Obj five Further Augustine says De Trin vii six that we do not say that the three persons are from one essence ex una essentia lest we should seem to indicate a distinction between the essence and the persons in God But prepositions which imply transition denote the oblique case Therefore it is equally wrong to say that the three persons are of one essence unius essentiae Obj six Further nothing should be said of God which can be occasion of error Now to say that the three persons are of one essence or substance furnishes occasion of error For as Hilary says De Synod One substance predicated of the Father and the Son signifies either one subsistent with two denominations or one substance divided into two imperfect substances or a third prior substance taken and assumed by the other two Therefore it must not be said that the three persons are of one substance On the contrary Augustine says Contra Maxim iii that the word homoousion which the Council of Nicaea adopted against the Arians means that the three persons are of one essence I answer that As above explained Q thirteen AA one two divine things are named by our intellect not as they really are in themselves for in that way it knows them not but in a way that belongs to things created And as in the objects of the senses whence the intellect derives its knowledge the nature of the species is made individual by the matter and thus the nature is as the form and the individual is the suppositum of the form so also in God the essence is taken as the form of the three persons according to our mode of signification Now in creatures we say that every form belongs to that whereof it is the form as the health and beauty of a man belongs to the man But we do not say of that which has a form that it belongs to the form unless some adjective qualifies the form as when we say That woman is of a handsome figure or This man is of perfect virtue In like manner as in God the persons are multiplied and the essence is not multiplied we speak of one essence of the three persons and three persons of the one essence provided that these genitives be understood as designating the form Reply Obj one Substance is here taken for the hypostasis and not for the essence Reply Obj two Although we may not find it declared in Holy Writ in so many words that the three persons are of one essence nevertheless we find it so stated as regards the meaning for instance I and the Father are one John ten thirty and I am in the Father and the Father in Me John ten thirty eight and there are many other texts of the same import Reply Obj three Because nature designates the principle of action while essence comes from being essendo things may be said to be of one nature which agree in some action as all things which give heat but only those things can be said to be of one essence which have one being So the divine unity is better described by saying that the three persons are of one essence than by saying they are of one nature Reply Obj four Form in the absolute sense is wont to be designated as belonging to that of which it is the form as we say the virtue of Peter On the other hand the thing having form is not wont to be designated as belonging to the form except when we wish to qualify or designate the form In which case two genitives are required one signifying the form and the other signifying the determination of the form as for instance when we say Peter is of great virtue magnae virtutis or else one genitive must have the force of two as for instance he is a man of blood that is he is a man who sheds much blood multi sanguinis So because the divine essence signifies a form as regards the person it may properly be said that the essence is of the person but we cannot say the converse unless we add some term to designate the essence as for instance the Father is a person of the divine essence or the three persons are of one essence Reply Obj five The preposition from or out of does not designate the habitude of a formal cause but rather the habitude of an efficient or material cause which causes are in all cases distinguished from those things of which they are the causes For nothing can be its own matter nor its own active principle Yet a thing may be its own form as appears in all immaterial things So when we say three persons of one essence taking essence as having the habitude of form we do not mean that essence is different from person which we should mean if we said three persons from the same essence Reply Obj six As Hilary says De Synod It would be prejudicial to holy things if we had to do away with them just because some do not think them holy So if some misunderstand homoousion what is that to me if I understand it rightly The oneness of nature does not result from division or from union or from community of possession but from one nature being proper to both Father and Son THIRD ARTICLE I Q thirty nine Art three Whether Essential Names Should Be Predicated in the Singular of the Three Persons Objection one It would seem that essential names as the name God should not be predicated in the singular of the three persons but in the plural For as man signifies one that has humanity so God signifies one that has Godhead But the three persons are three who have Godhead Therefore the three persons are three Gods Obj two Further general one one where it is said In the beginning God created heaven and earth the Hebrew original has Elohim which may be rendered Gods or Judges and this word is used on account of the plurality of persons Therefore the three persons are several Gods and not one God Obj three Further this word thing when it is said absolutely seems to belong to substance But it is predicated of the three persons in the plural For Augustine says De Doctr Christ i five The things that are the objects of our future glory are the Father Son and Holy Ghost Therefore other essential names can be predicated in the plural of the three persons Obj four Further as this word God signifies a being who has Deity so also this word person signifies a being subsisting in an intellectual nature But we say there are three persons So for the same reason we can say there are three Gods On the contrary It is said Deut six four Hear O Israel the Lord thy God is one God I answer that Some essential names signify the essence after the manner of substantives while others signify it after the manner of adjectives Those which signify it as substantives are predicated of the three persons in the singular only and not in the plural Those which signify the essence as adjectives are predicated of the three persons in the plural The reason of this is that substantives signify something by way of substance while adjectives signify something by way of accident which adheres to a subject Now just as substance has existence of itself so also it has of itself unity or multitude wherefore the singularity or plurality of a substantive name depends upon the form signified by the name But as accidents have their existence in a subject so they have unity or plurality from their subject and therefore the singularity and plurality of adjectives depends upon their supposita In creatures one form does not exist in several supposita except by unity of order as the form of an ordered multitude So if the names signifying such a form are substantives they are predicated of many in the singular but otherwise if they adjectives For we say that many men are a college or an army or a people but we say that many men are collegians Now in God the divine essence is signified by way of a form as above explained A two which indeed is simple and supremely one as shown above Q three A seven Q eleven A four So names which signify the divine essence in a substantive manner are predicated of the three persons in the singular and not in the plural This then is the reason why we say that Socrates Plato and Cicero are three men whereas we do not say the Father Son and Holy Ghost are three Gods but one God forasmuch as in the three supposita of human nature there are three humanities whereas in the three divine Persons there is but one divine essence On the other hand the names which signify essence in an adjectival manner are predicated of the three persons plurally by reason of the plurality of supposita For we say there are three existent or three wise beings or three eternal uncreated and immense beings if these terms are understood in an adjectival sense But if taken in a substantive sense we say one uncreated immense eternal being as Athanasius declares Reply Obj one Though the name God signifies a being having Godhead nevertheless the mode of signification is different For the name God is used substantively whereas having Godhead is used adjectively Consequently although there are three having Godhead it does not follow that there are three Gods Reply Obj two Various languages have diverse modes of expression So as by reason of the plurality of supposita the Greeks said three hypostases so also in Hebrew Elohim is in the plural We however do not apply the plural either to God or to substance lest plurality be referred to the substance Reply Obj three This word thing is one of the transcendentals Whence so far as it is referred to relation it is predicated of God in the plural whereas so far as it is referred to the substance it is predicated in the singular So Augustine says in the passage quoted that the same Trinity is a thing supreme Reply Obj four The form signified by the word person is not essence or nature but personality So as there are three personalities that is three personal properties in the Father Son and Holy Ghost it is predicated of the three not in the singular but in the plural FOURTH ARTICLE I Q thirty nine Art four Whether the Concrete Essential Names Can Stand for the Person Objection one It would seem that the concrete essential names cannot stand for the person so that we can truly say God begot God For as the logicians say a singular term signifies what it stands for But this name God seems to be a singular term for it cannot be predicated in the plural as above explained A three Therefore since it signifies the essence it stands for essence and not for person Obj two Further a term in the subject is not modified by a term in the predicate as to its signification but only as to the sense signified in the predicate But when I say God creates this name God stands for the essence So when we say God begot this term God cannot by reason of the notional predicate stand for person Obj three Further if this be true God begot because the Father generates for the same reason this is true God does not beget because the Son does not beget Therefore there is God who begets and there is God who does not beget and thus it follows that there are two Gods Obj four Further if God begot God He begot either God that is Himself or another God But He did not beget God that is Himself for as Augustine says De Trin i one nothing begets itself Neither did He beget another God as there is only one God Therefore it is false to say God begot God Obj five Further if God begot God He begot either God who is the Father or God who is not the Father If God who is the Father then God the Father was begotten If God who is not the Father then there is a God who is not God the Father which is false Therefore it cannot be said that God begot God On the contrary In the Creed it is said God of God I answer that Some have said that this name God and the like properly according to their nature stand for the essence but by reason of some notional adjunct are made to stand for the Person This opinion apparently arose from considering the divine simplicity which requires that in God He who possesses and what is possessed be the same So He who possesses Godhead which is signified by the name God is the same as Godhead But when we consider the proper way of expressing ourselves the mode of signification must be considered no less than the thing signified Hence as this word God signifies the divine essence as in Him Who possesses it just as the name man signifies humanity in a subject others more truly have said that this word God from its mode of signification can in its proper sense stand for person as does the word man So this word God sometimes stands for the essence as when we say God creates because this predicate is attributed to the subject by reason of the form signified that is Godhead But sometimes it stands for the person either for only one as when we say God begets or for two as when we say God spirates or for three as when it is said To the King of ages immortal invisible the only God et cetera one Tim one seventeen Reply Obj one Although this name God agrees with singular terms as regards the form signified not being multiplied nevertheless it agrees also with general terms so far as the form signified is to be found in several supposita So it need not always stand for the essence it signifies Reply Obj two This holds good against those who say that the word God does not naturally stand for person Reply Obj three The word God stands for the person in a different way from that in which this word man does for since the form signified by this word man that is humanity is really divided among its different subjects it stands of itself for the person even if there is no adjunct determining it to the person that is to a distinct subject The unity or community of the human nature however is not a reality but is only in the consideration of the mind Hence this term man does not stand for the common nature unless this is required by some adjunct as when we say man is a species whereas the form signified by the name God that is the divine essence is really one and common So of itself it stands for the common nature but by some adjunct it may be restricted so as to stand for the person So when we say God generates by reason of the notional act this name God stands for the person of the Father But when we say God does not generate there is no adjunct to determine this name to the person of the Son and hence the phrase means that generation is repugnant to the divine nature If however something be added belonging to the person of the Son this proposition for instance God begotten does not beget is true Consequently it does not follow that there exists a God generator and a God not generator unless there be an adjunct pertaining to the persons as for instance if we were to say the Father is God the generator and the Son is God the non generator and so it does not follow that there are many Gods for the Father and the Son are one God as was said above A three Reply Obj four This is false the Father begot God that is Himself because the word Himself as a reciprocal term refers to the same suppositum Nor is this contrary to what Augustine says Ep lxvi ad Maxim that God the Father begot another self alterum se forasmuch as the word se is either in the ablative case and then it means He begot another from Himself or it indicates a single relation and thus points to identity of nature This is however either a figurative or an emphatic way of speaking so that it would really mean He begot another most like to Himself Likewise also it is false to say He begot another God because although the Son is another than the Father as above explained Q thirty one A two nevertheless it cannot be said that He is another God forasmuch as this adjective another would be understood to apply to the substantive God and thus the meaning would be that there is a distinction of Godhead Yet this proposition He begot another God is tolerated by some provided that another be taken as a substantive and the word God be construed in apposition with it This however is an inexact way of speaking and to be avoided for fear of giving occasion to error Reply Obj five To say God begot God Who is God the Father is wrong because since the word Father is construed in apposition to God the word God is restricted to the person of the Father so that it would mean He begot God Who is Himself the Father and then the Father would be spoken of as begotten which is false Wherefore the negative of the proposition is true He begot God Who is not God the Father If however we understand these words not to be in apposition and require something to be added then on the contrary the affirmative proposition is true and the negative is false so that the meaning would be He begot God Who is God Who is the Father Such a rendering however appears to be forced so that it is better to say simply that the affirmative proposition is false and the negative is true Yet Prepositivus said that both the negative and affirmative are false because this relative Who in the affirmative proposition can be referred to the suppositum whereas in the negative it denotes both the thing signified and the suppositum Whence in the affirmative the sense is that to be God the Father is befitting to the person of the Son and in the negative sense is that to be God the Father is to be removed from the Son s divinity as well as from His personality This however appears to be irrational since according to the Philosopher Peri Herm ii what is open to affirmation is open also to negation FIFTH ARTICLE I Q thirty nine Art five Whether Abstract Essential Names Can Stand for the Person Objection one It would seem that abstract essential names can stand for the person so that this proposition is true Essence begets essence For Augustine says De Trin vii i two The Father and the Son are one Wisdom because they are one essence and taken singly Wisdom is from Wisdom as essence from essence Obj two Further generation or corruption in ourselves implies generation or corruption of what is within us But the Son is generated Therefore since the divine essence is in the Son it seems that the divine essence is generated Obj three Further God and the divine essence are the same as is clear from what is above explained Q three A three But as was shown it is true to say that God begets God Therefore this is also true Essence begets essence Obj four Further a predicate can stand for that of which it is predicated But the Father is the divine essence therefore essence can stand for the person of the Father Thus the essence begets Obj five Further the essence is a thing begetting because the essence is the Father who is begetting Therefore if the essence is not begetting the essence will be a thing begetting and not begetting which cannot be Obj six Further Augustine says De Trin iv twenty The Father is the principle of the whole Godhead But He is principle only by begetting or spirating Therefore the Father begets or spirates the Godhead On the contrary Augustine says De Trin i one Nothing begets itself But if the essence begets the essence it begets itself only since nothing exists in God as distinguished from the divine essence Therefore the essence does not beget essence I answer that Concerning this the abbot Joachim erred in asserting that as we can say God begot God so we can say Essence begot essence considering that by reason of the divine simplicity God is nothing else but the divine essence In this he was wrong because if we wish to express ourselves correctly we must take into account not only the thing which is signified but also the mode of its signification as above stated A four Now although God is really the same as Godhead nevertheless the mode of signification is not in each case the same For since this word God signifies the divine essence in Him that possesses it from its mode of signification it can of its own nature stand for person Thus the things which properly belong to the persons can be predicated of this word God as for instance we can say God is begotten or is Begetter as above explained A four The word essence however in its mode of signification cannot stand for Person because it signifies the essence as an abstract form Consequently what properly belongs to the persons whereby they are distinguished from each other cannot be attributed to the essence For that would imply distinction in the divine essence in the same way as there exists distinction in the supposita Reply Obj one To express unity of essence and of person the holy Doctors have sometimes expressed themselves with greater emphasis than the strict propriety of terms allows Whence instead of enlarging upon such expressions we should rather explain them thus for instance abstract names should be explained by concrete names or even by personal names as when we find essence from essence or wisdom from wisdom we should take the sense to be the Son who is essence and wisdom is from the Father who is essence and wisdom Nevertheless as regards these abstract names a certain order should be observed forasmuch as what belongs to action is more nearly allied to the persons because actions belong to supposita So nature from nature and wisdom from wisdom are less inexact than essence from essence Reply Obj two In creatures the one generated has not the same nature numerically as the generator but another nature numerically distinct which commences to exist in it anew by generation and ceases to exist by corruption and so it is generated and corrupted accidentally whereas God begotten has the same nature numerically as the begetter So the divine nature in the Son is not begotten either directly or accidentally Reply Obj three Although God and the divine essence are really the same nevertheless on account of their different mode of signification we must speak in a different way about each of them Reply Obj four The divine essence is predicated of the Father by mode of identity by reason of the divine simplicity yet it does not follow that it can stand for the Father its mode of signification being different This objection would hold good as regards things which are predicated of another as the universal of a particular Reply Obj five The difference between substantive and adjectival names consist in this that the former carry their subject with them whereas the latter do not but add the thing signified to the substantive Whence logicians are wont to say that the substantive is considered in the light of suppositum whereas the adjective indicates something added to the suppositum Therefore substantive personal terms can be predicated of the essence because they are really the same nor does it follow that a personal property makes a distinct essence but it belongs to the suppositum implied in the substantive But notional and personal adjectives cannot be predicated of the essence unless we add some substantive We cannot say that the essence is begetting yet we can say that the essence is a thing begetting or that it is God begetting if thing and God stand for person but not if they stand for essence Consequently there exists no contradiction in saying that essence is a thing begetting and a thing not begetting because in the first case thing stands for person and in the second it stands for the essence Reply Obj six So far as Godhead is one in several supposita it agrees in a certain degree with the form of a collective term So when we say the Father is the principle of the whole Godhead the term Godhead can be taken for all the persons together inasmuch as it is the principle in all the divine persons Nor does it follow that He is His own principle as one of the people may be called the ruler of the people without being ruler of himself We may also say that He is the principle of the whole Godhead not as generating or spirating it but as communicating it by generation and spiration SIXTH ARTICLE I Q thirty nine Art six Whether the Persons Can Be Predicated of the Essential Terms Objection one It would seem that the persons cannot be predicated of the concrete essential names so that we can say for instance God is three persons or God is the Trinity For it is false to say man is every man because it cannot be verified as regards any particular subject For neither Socrates nor Plato nor anyone else is every man In the same way this proposition God is the Trinity cannot be verified of any one of the supposita of the divine nature For the Father is not the Trinity nor is the Son nor is the Holy Ghost So to say God is the Trinity is false Obj two Further the lower is not predicated of the higher except by accidental predication as when I say animal is man for it is accidental to animal to be man But this name God as regards the three persons is as a general term to inferior terms as Damascene says De Fide Orth iii four Therefore it seems that the names of the persons cannot be predicated of this name God except in an accidental sense On the contrary Augustine says in his sermon on Faith Serm ii in coena Domini We believe that one God is one divinely named Trinity I answer that As above explained A five although adjectival terms whether personal or notional cannot be predicated of the essence nevertheless substantive terms can be so predicated owing to the real identity of essence and person The divine essence is not only really the same as one person but it is really the same as the three persons Whence one person and two and three can be predicated of the essence as if we were to say The essence is the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost And because this word God can of itself stand for the essence as above explained A four ad three hence as it is true to say The essence is the three persons so likewise it is true to say God is the three persons Reply Obj one As above explained this term man can of itself stand for person whereas an adjunct is required for it to stand for the universal human nature So it is false to say Man is every man because it cannot be verified of any particular human subject On the contrary this word God can of itself be taken for the divine essence So although to say of any of the supposita of the divine nature God is the Trinity is untrue nevertheless it is true of the divine essence This was denied by Porretanus because he did not take note of this distinction Reply Obj two When we say God or the divine essence is the Father the predication is one of identity and not of the lower in regard to a higher species because in God there is no universal and singular Hence as this proposition The Father is God is of itself true so this proposition God is the Father is true of itself and by no means accidentally SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q thirty nine Art seven Whether the Essential Names Should Be Appropriated to the Persons Objection one It would seem that the essential names should not be appropriated to the persons For whatever might verge on error in faith should be avoided in the treatment of divine things for as Jerome says careless words involve risk of heresy In substance Ep lvii But to appropriate to any one person the names which are common to the three persons may verge on error in faith for it may be supposed either that such belong only to the person to whom they are appropriated or that they belong to Him in a fuller degree than to the others Therefore the essential attributes should not be appropriated to the persons Obj two Further the essential attributes expressed in the abstract signify by mode of form But one person is not as a form to another since a form is not distinguished in subject from that of which it is the form Therefore the essential attributes especially when expressed in the abstract are not to be appropriated to the persons Obj three Further property is prior to the appropriated for property is included in the idea of the appropriated But the essential attributes in our way of understanding are prior to the persons as what is common is prior to what is proper Therefore the essential attributes are not to be appropriated to the persons On the contrary the Apostle says Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God one Cor one twenty four I answer that For the manifestation of our faith it is fitting that the essential attributes should be appropriated to the persons For although the trinity of persons cannot be proved by demonstration as was above expounded Q thirty two A one nevertheless it is fitting that it be declared by things which are more known to us Now the essential attributes of God are more clear to us from the standpoint of reason than the personal properties because we can derive certain knowledge of the essential attributes from creatures which are sources of knowledge to us such as we cannot obtain regarding the personal properties as was above explained Q thirty two A one As therefore we make use of the likeness of the trace or image found in creatures for the manifestation of the divine persons so also in the same manner do we make use of the essential attributes And such a manifestation of the divine persons by the use of the essential attributes is called appropriation The divine person can be manifested in a twofold manner by the essential attributes in one way by similitude and thus the things which belong to the intellect are appropriated to the Son Who proceeds by way of intellect as Word In another way by dissimilitude as power is appropriated to the Father as Augustine says because fathers by reason of old age are sometimes feeble lest anything of the kind be imagined of God Reply Obj one The essential attributes are not appropriated to the persons as if they exclusively belonged to them but in order to make the persons manifest by way of similitude or dissimilitude as above explained So no error in faith can arise but rather manifestation of the truth Reply Obj two If the essential attributes were appropriated to the persons as exclusively belonging to each of them then it would follow that one person would be as a form as regards another which Augustine altogether repudiates De Trin vi two showing that the Father is wise not by Wisdom begotten by Him as though only the Son were Wisdom so that the Father and the Son together only can be called wise but not the Father without the Son But the Son is called the Wisdom of the Father because He is Wisdom from the Father Who is Wisdom For each of them is of Himself Wisdom and both together are one Wisdom Whence the Father is not wise by the wisdom begotten by Him but by the wisdom which is His own essence Reply Obj three Although the essential attribute is in its proper concept prior to person according to our way of understanding nevertheless so far as it is appropriated there is nothing to prevent the personal property from being prior to that which is appropriated Thus color is posterior to body considered as body but is naturally prior to white body considered as white EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q thirty nine Art eight Whether the Essential Attributes Are Appropriated to the Persons in a Fitting Manner by the Holy Doctors Objection one It would seem that the essential attributes are appropriated to the persons unfittingly by the holy doctors For Hilary says De Trin ii Eternity is in the Father the species in the Image and use is in the Gift In which words he designates three names proper to the persons the name of the Father the name Image proper to the Son Q thirty five A two and the name Bounty or Gift which is proper to the Holy Ghost Q thirty eight A two He also designates three appropriated terms For he appropriates eternity to the Father species to the Son and use to the Holy Ghost This he does apparently without reason For eternity imports duration of existence species the principle of existence and use belongs to the operation But essence and operation are not found to be appropriated to any person Therefore the above terms are not fittingly appropriated to the persons Obj two Further Augustine says De Doctr Christ i five Unity is in the Father equality in the Son and in the Holy Ghost is the concord of equality and unity This does not however seem fitting because one person does not receive formal denomination from what is appropriated to another For the Father is not wise by the wisdom begotten as above explained Q thirty seven A two ad one But as he subjoins All these three are one by the Father all are equal by the Son and all united by the Holy Ghost The above therefore are not fittingly appropriated to the Persons Obj three Further according to Augustine to the Father is attributed power to the Son wisdom to the Holy Ghost goodness Nor does this seem fitting for strength is part of power whereas strength is found to be appropriated to the Son according to the text Christ the strength Douay power of God one Cor one twenty four So it is likewise appropriated to the Holy Ghost according to the words strength Douay virtue came out from Him and healed all Luke six nineteen Therefore power should not be appropriated to the Father Obj four Likewise Augustine says De Trin vi ten What the Apostle says From Him and by Him and in Him is not to be taken in a confused sense And Contra Maxim ii from Him refers to the Father by Him to the Son in Him to the Holy Ghost This however seems to be incorrectly said for the words in Him seem to imply the relation of final cause which is first among the causes Therefore this relation of cause should be appropriated to the Father Who is the principle from no principle Obj five Likewise Truth is appropriated to the Son according to John fourteen six I am the Way the Truth and the Life and likewise the book of life according to Ps thirty nine nine In the beginning of the book it is written of Me where a gloss observes that is with the Father Who is My head also this word Who is because on the text of Isaias Behold I go to the Gentiles sixty five one a gloss adds The Son speaks Who said to Moses I am Who am These appear to belong to the Son and are not appropriated For truth according to Augustine De Vera Relig thirty six is the supreme similitude of the principle without any dissimilitude So it seems that it properly belongs to the Son Who has a principle Also the book of life seems proper to the Son as signifying a thing from another for every book is written by someone This also Who is appears to be proper to the Son because if when it was said to Moses I am Who am the Trinity spoke then Moses could have said He Who is Father Son and Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost sent me to you so also he could have said further He Who is the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost sent me to you pointing out a certain person This however is false because no person is Father Son and Holy Ghost Therefore it cannot be common to the Trinity but is proper to the Son I answer that Our intellect which is led to the knowledge of God from creatures must consider God according to the mode derived from creatures In considering any creature four points present themselves to us in due order Firstly the thing itself taken absolutely is considered as a being Secondly it is considered as one Thirdly its intrinsic power of operation and causality is considered The fourth point of consideration embraces its relation to its effects Hence this fourfold consideration comes to our mind in reference to God According to the first point of consideration whereby we consider God absolutely in His being the appropriation mentioned by Hilary applies according to which eternity is appropriated to the Father species to the Son use to the Holy Ghost For eternity as meaning a being without a principle has a likeness to the property of the Father Who is a principle without a principle Species or beauty has a likeness to the property of the Son For beauty includes three conditions integrity or perfection since those things which are impaired are by the very fact ugly due proportion or harmony and lastly brightness or clarity whence things are called beautiful which have a bright color The first of these has a likeness to the property of the Son inasmuch as He as Son has in Himself truly and perfectly the nature of the Father To insinuate this Augustine says in his explanation De Trin vi ten Where that is in the Son there is supreme and primal life et cetera The second agrees with the Son s property inasmuch as He is the express Image of the Father Hence we see that an image is said to be beautiful if it perfectly represents even an ugly thing This is indicated by Augustine when he says De Trin vi ten Where there exists wondrous proportion and primal equality et cetera The third agrees with the property of the Son as the Word which is the light and splendor of the intellect as Damascene says De Fide Orth iii three Augustine alludes to the same when he says De Trin vi ten As the perfect Word not wanting in anything and so to speak the art of the omnipotent God et cetera Use has a likeness to the property of the Holy Ghost provided the use be taken in a wide sense as including also the sense of to enjoy according as to use is to employ something at the beck of the will and to enjoy means to use joyfully as Augustine says De Trin x eleven So use whereby the Father and the Son enjoy each other agrees with the property of the Holy Ghost as Love This is what Augustine says De Trin vi ten That love that delectation that felicity or beatitude is called use by him Hilary But the use by which we enjoy God is likened to the property of the Holy Ghost as the Gift and Augustine points to this when he says De Trin vi ten In the Trinity the Holy Ghost the sweetness of the Begettor and the Begotten pours out upon us mere creatures His immense bounty and wealth Thus it is clear how eternity species and use are attributed or appropriated to the persons but not essence or operation because being common there is nothing in their concept to liken them to the properties of the Persons The second consideration of God regards Him as one In that view Augustine De Doctr Christ i five appropriates unity to the Father equality to the Son concord or union to the Holy Ghost It is manifest that these three imply unity but in different ways For unity is said absolutely as it does not presuppose anything else and for this reason it is appropriated to the Father to Whom any other person is not presupposed since He is the principle without principle Equality implies unity as regards another for that is equal which has the same quantity as another So equality is appropriated to the Son Who is the principle from a principle Union implies the unity of two and is therefore appropriated to the Holy Ghost inasmuch as He proceeds from two And from this we can understand what Augustine means when he says De Doctr Christ i five that The Three are one by reason of the Father They are equal by reason of the Son and are united by reason of the Holy Ghost For it is clear that we trace a thing back to that in which we find it first just as in this lower world we attribute life to the vegetative soul because therein we find the first trace of life Now unity is perceived at once in the person of the Father even if by an impossible hypothesis the other persons were removed So the other persons derive their unity from the Father But if the other persons be removed we do not find equality in the Father but we find it as soon as we suppose the Son So all are equal by reason of the Son not as if the Son were the principle of equality in the Father but that without the Son equal to the Father the Father could not be called equal because His equality is considered firstly in regard to the Son for that the Holy Ghost is equal to the Father is also from the Son Likewise if the Holy Ghost Who is the union of the two be excluded we cannot understand the oneness of the union between the Father and the Son So all are connected by reason of the Holy Ghost because given the Holy Ghost we find whence the Father and the Son are said to be united According to the third consideration which brings before us the adequate power of God in the sphere of causality there is said to be a third kind of appropriation of power wisdom and goodness This kind of appropriation is made both by reason of similitude as regards what exists in the divine persons and by reason of dissimilitude if we consider what is in creatures For power has the nature of a principle and so it has a likeness to the heavenly Father Who is the principle of the whole Godhead But in an earthly father it is wanting sometimes by reason of old age Wisdom has likeness to the heavenly Son as the Word for a word is nothing but the concept of wisdom In an earthly son this is sometimes absent by reason of lack of years Goodness as the nature and object of love has likeness to the Holy Ghost but seems repugnant to the earthly spirit which often implies a certain violent impulse according to Isa twenty five four The spirit of the strong is as a blast beating on the wall Strength is appropriated to the Son and to the Holy Ghost not as denoting the power itself of a thing but as sometimes used to express that which proceeds from power for instance we say that the strong work done by an agent is its strength According to the fourth consideration i e God s relation to His effects there arise s appropriation of the expression from Whom by Whom and in Whom For this preposition from ex sometimes implies a certain relation of the material cause which has no place in God and sometimes it expresses the relation of the efficient cause which can be applied to God by reason of His active power hence it is appropriated to the Father in the same way as power The preposition by per sometimes designates an intermediate cause thus we may say that a smith works by a hammer Hence the word by is not always appropriated to the Son but belongs to the Son properly and strictly according to the text All things were made by Him John one three not that the Son is an instrument but as the principle from a principle Sometimes it designates the habitude of a form by which an agent works thus we say that an artificer works by his art Hence as wisdom and art are appropriated to the Son so also is the expression by Whom The preposition in strictly denotes the habitude of one containing Now God contains things in two ways in one way by their similitudes thus things are said to be in God as existing in His knowledge In this sense the expression in Him should be appropriated to the Son In another sense things are contained in God forasmuch as He in His goodness preserves and governs them by guiding them to a fitting end and in this sense the expression in Him is appropriated to the Holy Ghost as likewise is goodness Nor need the habitude of the final cause though the first of causes be appropriated to the Father Who is the principle without a principle because the divine persons of Whom the Father is the principle do not proceed from Him as towards an end since each of Them is the last end but They proceed by a natural procession which seems more to belong to the nature of a natural power Regarding the other points of inquiry we can say that since truth belongs to the intellect as stated above Q sixteen A one it is appropriated to the Son without however being a property of His For truth can be considered as existing in the thought or in the thing itself Hence as intellect and thing in their essential meaning are referred to the essence and not to the persons so the same is to be said of truth The definition quoted from Augustine belongs to truth as appropriated to the Son The book of life directly means knowledge but indirectly it means life For as above explained Q twenty four A one it is God s knowledge regarding those who are to possess eternal life Consequently it is appropriated to the Son although life is appropriated to the Holy Ghost as implying a certain kind of interior movement agreeing in that sense with the property of the Holy Ghost as Love To be written by another is not of the essence of a book considered as such but this belongs to it only as a work produced So this does not imply origin nor is it personal but an appropriation to a person The expression Who is is appropriated to the person of the Son not by reason of itself but by reason of an adjunct inasmuch as in God s word to Moses was prefigured the delivery of the human race accomplished by the Son Yet forasmuch as the word Who is taken in a relative sense it may sometimes relate to the person of the Son and in that sense it would be taken personally as for instance were we to say The Son is the begotten Who is inasmuch as God begotten is personal But taken indefinitely it is an essential term And although the pronoun this iste seems grammatically to point to a particular person nevertheless everything that we can point to can be grammatically treated as a person although in its own nature it is not a person as we may say this stone and this ass So speaking in a grammatical sense so far as the word God signifies and stands for the divine essence the latter may be designated by the pronoun this according to Ex fifteen two This is my God and I will glorify Him QUESTION forty OF THE PERSONS AS COMPARED TO THE RELATIONS OR PROPERTIES In Four Articles We now consider the persons in connection with the relations or properties and there are four points of inquiry one Whether relation is the same as person two Whether the relations distinguish and constitute the persons three Whether mental abstraction of the relations from the persons leaves the hypostases distinct four Whether the relations according to our mode of understanding presuppose the acts of the persons or contrariwise FIRST ARTICLE I Q forty Art one Whether Relation Is the Same As Person Objection one It would seem that in God relation is not the same as person For when things are identical if one is multiplied the others are multiplied But in one person there are several relations as in the person of the Father there is paternity and common spiration Again one relation exists in two person as common spiration in the Father and in the Son Therefore relation is not the same as person Obj two Further according to the Philosopher Phys iv text twenty four nothing is contained by itself But relation is in the person nor can it be said that this occurs because they are identical for otherwise relation would be also in the essence Therefore relation or property is not the same as person in God Obj three Further when several things are identical what is predicated of one is predicated of the others But all that is predicated of a Person is not predicated of His property For we say that the Father begets but not that the paternity is begetting Therefore property is not the same as person in God On the contrary in God what is and whereby it is are the same according to Boethius De Hebdom But the Father is Father by paternity In the same way the other properties are the same as the persons I answer that Different opinions have been held on this point Some have said that the properties are not the persons nor in the persons and these have thought thus owing to the mode of signification of the relations which do not indeed signify existence in something but rather existence towards something Whence they styled the relations assistant as above explained Q twenty eight A two But since relation considered as really existing in God is the divine essence Itself and the essence is the same as person as appears from what was said above Q thirty nine A one relation must necessarily be the same as person Others therefore considering this identity said that the properties were indeed the persons but not in the persons for they said there are no properties in God except in our way of speaking as stated above Q thirty two A two We must however say that there are properties in God as we have shown Q thirty two A two These are designated by abstract terms being forms as it were of the persons So since the nature of a form requires it to be in that of which it is the form we must say that the properties are in the persons and yet that they are the persons as we say that the essence is in God and yet is God Reply Obj one Person and property are really the same but differ in concept Consequently it does not follow that if one is multiplied the other must also be multiplied We must however consider that in God by reason of the divine simplicity a twofold real identity exists as regards what in creatures are distinct For since the divine simplicity excludes the composition of matter and form it follows that in God the abstract is the same as the concrete as Godhead and God And as the divine simplicity excludes the composition of subject and accident it follows that whatever is attributed to God is His essence Itself and so wisdom and power are the same in God because they are both in the divine essence According to this twofold identity property in God is the same as person For personal properties are the same as the persons because the abstract and the concrete are the same in God since they are the subsisting persons themselves as paternity is the Father Himself and filiation is the Son and procession is the Holy Ghost But the non personal properties are the same as the persons according to the other reason of identity whereby whatever is attributed to God is His own essence Thus common spiration is the same as the person of the Father and the person of the Son not that it is one self subsisting person but that as there is one essence in the two persons so also there is one property in the two persons as above explained Q thirty A two Reply Obj two The properties are said to be in the essence only by mode of identity but in the persons they exist by mode of identity not merely in reality but also in the mode of signification as the form exists in its subject Thus the properties determine and distinguish the persons but not the essence Reply Obj three Notional participles and verbs signify the notional acts and acts belong to a suppositum Now properties are not designated as supposita but as forms of supposita And so their mode of signification is against notional participles and verbs being predicated of the properties SECOND ARTICLE I Q forty Art two Whether the Persons Are Distinguished by the Relations Objection one It would seem that the persons are not distinguished by the relations For simple things are distinct by themselves But the persons are supremely simple Therefore they are distinguished by themselves and not by the relation Obj two Further a form is distinguished only in relation to its genus For white is distinguished from black only by quality But hypostasis signifies an individual in the genus of substance Therefore the hypostases cannot be distinguished by relations Obj three Further what is absolute comes before what is relative But the distinction of the divine persons is the primary distinction Therefore the divine persons are not distinguished by the relations Obj four Further whatever presupposes distinction cannot be the first principle of distinction But relation presupposes distinction which comes into its definition for a relation is essentially what is towards another Therefore the first distinctive principle in God cannot be relation On the contrary Boethius says De Trin Relation alone multiplies the Trinity of the divine persons I answer that In whatever multitude of things is to be found something common to all it is necessary to seek out the principle of distinction So as the three persons agree in the unity of essence we must seek to know the principle of distinction whereby they are several Now there are two principles of difference between the divine persons and these are origin and relation Although these do not really differ yet they differ in the mode of signification for origin is signified by way of act as generation and relation by way of the form as paternity Some then considering that relation follows upon act have said that the divine hypostases are distinguished by origin so that we may say that the Father is distinguished from the Son inasmuch as the former begets and the latter is begotten Further that the relations or the properties make known the distinctions of the hypostases or persons as resulting therefrom as also in creatures the properties manifest the distinctions of individuals which distinctions are caused by the material principles This opinion however cannot stand for two reasons Firstly because in order that two things be understood as distinct their distinction must be understood as resulting from something intrinsic to both thus in things created it results from their matter or their form Now origin of a thing does not designate anything intrinsic but means the way from something or to something as generation signifies the way to a thing generated and as proceeding from the generator Hence it is not possible that what is generated and the generator should be distinguished by generation alone but in the generator and in the thing generated we must presuppose whatever makes them to be distinguished from each other In a divine person there is nothing to presuppose but essence and relation or property Whence since the persons agree in essence it only remains to be said that the persons are distinguished from each other by the relations Secondly because the distinction of the divine persons is not to be so understood as if what is common to them all is divided because the common essence remains undivided but the distinguishing principles themselves must constitute the things which are distinct Now the relations or the properties distinguish or constitute the hypostases or persons inasmuch as they are themselves the subsisting persons as paternity is the Father and filiation is the Son because in God the abstract and the concrete do not differ But it is against the nature of origin that it should constitute hypostasis or person For origin taken in an active sense signifies proceeding from a subsisting person so that it presupposes the latter while in a passive sense origin as nativity signifies the way to a subsisting person and as not yet constituting the person It is therefore better to say that the persons or hypostases are distinguished rather by relations than by origin For although in both ways they are distinguished nevertheless in our mode of understanding they are distinguished chiefly and firstly by relations whence this name Father signifies not only a property but also the hypostasis whereas this term Begetter or Begetting signifies property only forasmuch as this name Father signifies the relation which is distinctive and constitutive of the hypostasis and this term Begetter or Begotten signifies the origin which is not distinctive and constitutive of the hypostasis Reply Obj one The persons are the subsisting relations themselves Hence it is not against the simplicity of the divine persons for them to be distinguished by the relations Reply Obj two The divine persons are not distinguished as regards being in which they subsist nor in anything absolute but only as regards something relative Hence relation suffices for their distinction Reply Obj three The more prior a distinction is the nearer it approaches to unity and so it must be the least possible distinction So the distinction of the persons must be by that which distinguishes the least possible and this is by relation Reply Obj four Relation presupposes the distinction of the subjects when it is an accident but when the relation is subsistent it does not presuppose but brings about distinction For when it is said that relation is by nature to be towards another the word another signifies the correlative which is not prior but simultaneous in the order of nature THIRD ARTICLE I Q forty Art three Whether the Hypostases Remain If the Relations Are Mentally Abstracted from the Persons Objection one It would seem that the hypostases remain if the properties or relations are mentally abstracted from the persons For that to which something is added may be understood when the addition is taken away as man is something added to animal which can be understood if rational be taken away But person is something added to hypostasis for person is a hypostasis distinguished by a property of dignity Therefore if a personal property be taken away from a person the hypostasis remains Obj two Further that the Father is Father and that He is someone are not due to the same reason For as He is the Father by paternity supposing He is some one by paternity it would follow that the Son in Whom there is not paternity would not be someone So when paternity is mentally abstracted from the Father He still remains someone that is a hypostasis Therefore if property be removed from person the hypostasis remains Obj three Further Augustine says De Trin v six Unbegotten is not the same as Father for if the Father had not begotten the Son nothing would prevent Him being called unbegotten But if He had not begotten the Son there would be no paternity in Him Therefore if paternity be removed there still remains the hypostasis of the Father as unbegotten On the contrary Hilary says De Trin iv The Son has nothing else than birth But He is Son by birth Therefore if filiation be removed the Son s hypostasis no more remains and the same holds as regards the other persons I answer that Abstraction by the intellect is twofold when the universal is abstracted from the particular as animal abstracted from man and when the form is abstracted from the matter as the form of a circle is abstracted by the intellect from any sensible matter The difference between these two abstractions consists in the fact that in the abstraction of the universal from the particular that from which the abstraction is made does not remain for when the difference of rationality is removed from man the man no longer remains in the intellect but animal alone remains But in the abstraction of the form from the matter both the form and the matter remain in the intellect as for instance if we abstract the form of a circle from brass there remains in our intellect separately the understanding both of a circle and of brass Now although there is no universal nor particular in God nor form and matter in reality nevertheless as regards the mode of signification there is a certain likeness of these things in God and thus Damascene says De Fide Orth iii six that substance is common and hypostasis is particular So if we speak of the abstraction of the universal from the particular the common universal essence remains in the intellect if the properties are removed but not the hypostasis of the Father which is as it were a particular But as regards the abstraction of the form from the matter if the non personal properties are removed then the idea of the hypostases and persons remains as for instance if the fact of the Father s being unbegotten or spirating be mentally abstracted from the Father the Father s hypostasis or person remains If however the personal property be mentally abstracted the idea of the hypostasis no longer remains For the personal properties are not to be understood as added to the divine hypostases as a form is added to a pre existing subject but they carry with them their own supposita inasmuch as they are themselves subsisting persons thus paternity is the Father Himself For hypostasis signifies something distinct in God since hypostasis means an individual substance So as relation distinguishes and constitutes the hypostases as above explained A two it follows that if the personal relations are mentally abstracted the hypostases no longer remain Some however think as above noted that the divine hypostases are not distinguished by the relations but only by origin so that the Father is a hypostasis as not from another and the Son is a hypostasis as from another by generation And that the consequent relations which are to be regarded as properties of dignity constitute the notion of a person and are thus called personal properties Hence if these relations are mentally abstracted the hypostasis but not the persons remain But this is impossible for two reasons first because the relations distinguish and constitute the hypostases as shown above A two secondly because every hypostasis of a rational nature is a person as appears from the definition of Boethius De Duab Nat that person is the individual substance of a rational nature Hence to have hypostasis and not person it would be necessary to abstract the rationality from the nature but not the property from the person Reply Obj one Person does not add to hypostasis a distinguishing property absolutely but a distinguishing property of dignity all of which must be taken as the difference Now this distinguishing property is one of dignity precisely because it is understood as subsisting in a rational nature Hence if the distinguishing property be removed from the person the hypostasis no longer remains whereas it would remain were the rationality of the nature removed for both person and hypostasis are individual substances Consequently in God the distinguishing relation belongs essentially to both Reply Obj two By paternity the Father is not only Father but is a person and is someone or a hypostasis It does not follow however that the Son is not someone or a hypostasis just as it does not follow that He is not a person Reply Obj three Augustine does not mean to say that the hypostasis of the Father would remain as unbegotten if His paternity were removed as if innascibility constituted and distinguished the hypostasis of the Father for this would be impossible since being unbegotten says nothing positive and is only a negation as he himself says But he speaks in a general sense forasmuch as not every unbegotten being is the Father So if paternity be removed the hypostasis of the Father does not remain in God as distinguished from the other persons but only as distinguished from creatures as the Jews understand it FOURTH ARTICLE I Q forty Art four Whether the properties presuppose the notional acts Objection one It would seem that the notional acts are understood before the properties For the Master of the Sentences says Sent i D xxvii that the Father always is because He is ever begetting the Son So it seems that generation precedes paternity in the order of intelligence Obj two Further in the order of intelligence every relation presupposes that on which it is founded as equality presupposes quantity But paternity is a relation founded on the action of generation Therefore paternity presupposes generation Obj three Further active generation is to paternity as nativity is to filiation But filiation presupposes nativity for the Son is so called because He is born Therefore paternity also presupposes generation On the contrary Generation is the operation of the person of the Father But paternity constitutes the person of the Father Therefore in the order of intelligence paternity is prior to generation I answer that According to the opinion that the properties do not distinguish and constitute the hypostases in God but only manifest them as already distinct and constituted we must absolutely say that the relations in our mode of understanding follow upon the notional acts so that we can say without qualifying the phrase that because He begets He is the Father A distinction however is needed if we suppose that the relations distinguish and constitute the divine hypostases For origin has in God an active and passive signification active as generation is attributed to the Father and spiration taken for the notional act is attributed to the Father and the Son passive as nativity is attributed to the Son and procession to the Holy Ghost For in the order of intelligence origin in the passive sense simply precedes the personal properties of the person proceeding because origin as passively understood signifies the way to a person constituted by the property Likewise origin signified actively is prior in the order of intelligence to the non personal relation of the person originating as the notional act of spiration precedes in the order of intelligence the unnamed relative property common to the Father and the Son The personal property of the Father can be considered in a twofold sense firstly as a relation and thus again in the order of intelligence it presupposes the notional act for relation as such is founded upon an act secondly according as it constitutes the person and thus the notional act presupposes the relation as an action presupposes a person acting Reply Obj one When the Master says that because He begets He is Father the term Father is taken as meaning relation only but not as signifying the subsisting person for then it would be necessary to say conversely that because He is Father He begets Reply Obj two This objection avails of paternity as a relation but not as constituting a person Reply Obj three Nativity is the way to the person of the Son and so in the order of intelligence it precedes filiation even as constituting the person of the Son But active generation signifies a proceeding from the person of the Father wherefore it presupposes the personal property of the Father QUESTION forty one OF THE PERSONS IN REFERENCE TO THE NOTIONAL ACTS In Six Articles We now consider the persons in reference to the notional acts concerning which six points of inquiry arise one Whether the notional acts are to be attributed to the persons two Whether these acts are necessary or voluntary three Whether as regards these acts a person proceeds from nothing or from something four Whether in God there exists a power as regards the notional acts five What this power means six Whether several persons can be the term of one notional act FIRST ARTICLE I Q forty one Art one Whether the Notional Acts Are to Be Attributed to the Persons Objection one It would seem that the notional acts are not to be attributed to the persons For Boethius says De Trin Whatever is predicated of God of whatever genus it be becomes the divine substance except what pertains to the relation But action is one of the ten genera Therefore any action attributed to God belongs to His essence and not to a notion Obj two Further Augustine says De Trin v forty five that everything which is said of God is said of Him as regards either His substance or relation But whatever belongs to the substance is signified by the essential attributes and whatever belongs to the relations by the names of the persons or by the names of the properties Therefore in addition to these notional acts are not to be attributed to the persons Obj three Further the nature of action is of itself to cause passion But we do not place passions in God Therefore neither are notional acts to be placed in God On the contrary Augustine Fulgentius De Fide ad Petrum ii says It is a property of the Father to beget the Son Therefore notional acts are to be placed in God I answer that In the divine persons distinction is founded on origin But origin can be properly designated only by certain acts Wherefore to signify the order of origin in the divine persons we must attribute notional acts to the persons Reply Obj one Every origin is designated by an act In God there is a twofold order of origin one inasmuch as the creature proceeds from Him and this is common to the three persons and so those actions which are attributed to God to designate the proceeding of creatures from Him belong to His essence Another order of origin in God regards the procession of person from person wherefore the acts which designate the order of this origin are called notional because the notions of the persons are the mutual relations of the persons as is clear from what was above explained Q thirty two A two Reply Obj two The notional acts differ from the relations of the persons only in their mode of signification and in reality are altogether the same Whence the Master says that generation and nativity in other words are paternity and filiation Sent i D xxvi To see this we must consider that the origin of one thing from another is firstly inferred from movement for that anything be changed from its disposition by movement evidently arises from some cause Hence action in its primary sense means origin of movement for as movement derived from another into a mobile object is called passion so the origin of movement itself as beginning from another and terminating in what is moved is called action Hence if we take away movement action implies nothing more than order of origin in so far as action proceeds from some cause or principle to what is from that principle Consequently since in God no movement exists the personal action of the one producing a person is only the habitude of the principle to the person who is from the principle which habitudes are the relations or the notions Nevertheless we cannot speak of divine and intelligible things except after the manner of sensible things whence we derive our knowledge and wherein actions and passions so far as these imply movement differ from the relations which result from action and passion and therefore it was necessary to signify the habitudes of the persons separately after the manner of act and separately after the manner of relations Thus it is evident that they are really the same differing only in their mode of signification Reply Obj three Action so far as it means origin of movement naturally involves passion but action in that sense is not attributed to God Whence passions are attributed to Him only from a grammatical standpoint and in accordance with our manner of speaking as we attribute to beget with the Father and to the Son to be begotten SECOND ARTICLE I Q forty one Art two Whether the Notional Acts Are Voluntary Objection one It would seem that the notional acts are voluntary For Hilary says De Synod Not by natural necessity was the Father led to beget the Son Obj two Further the Apostle says He transferred us to the kingdom of the Son of His love colonel one thirteen But love belongs to the will Therefore the Son was begotten of the Father by will Obj three Further nothing is more voluntary than love But the Holy Ghost proceeds as Love from the Father and the Son Therefore He proceeds voluntarily Obj four Further the Son proceeds by mode of the intellect as the Word But every word proceeds by the will from a speaker Therefore the Son proceeds from the Father by will and not by nature Obj five Further what is not voluntary is necessary Therefore if the Father begot the Son not by the will it seems to follow that He begot Him by necessity and this is against what Augustine says Ad Orosium qu vii On the contrary Augustine says in the same book that the Father begot the Son neither by will nor by necessity I answer that When anything is said to be or to be made by the will this can be understood in two senses In one sense the ablative designates only concomitance as I can say that I am a man by my will that is I will to be a man and in this way it can be said that the Father begot the Son by will as also He is God by will because He wills to be God and wills to beget the Son In the other sense the ablative imports the habitude of a principle as it is said that the workman works by his will as the will is the principle of his work and thus in that sense it must be said the God the Father begot the Son not by His will but that He produced the creature by His will Whence in the book De Synod it is said If anyone say that the Son was made by the Will of God as a creature is said to be made let him be anathema The reason of this is that will and nature differ in their manner of causation in such a way that nature is determined to one while the will is not determined to one and this because the effect is assimilated to the form of the agent whereby the latter acts Now it is manifest that of one thing there is only one natural form whereby it exists and hence such as it is itself such also is its work But the form whereby the will acts is not only one but many according to the number of ideas understood Hence the quality of the will s action does not depend on the quality of the agent but on the agent s will and understanding So the will is the principle of those things which may be this way or that way whereas of those things which can be only in one way the principle is nature What however can exist in different ways is far from the divine nature whereas it belongs to the nature of a created being because God is of Himself necessary being whereas a creature is made from nothing Thus the Arians wishing to prove the Son to be a creature said that the Father begot the Son by will taking will in the sense of principle But we on the contrary must assert that the Father begot the Son not by will but by nature Wherefore Hilary says De Synod The will of God gave to all creatures their substance but perfect birth gave the Son a nature derived from a substance impassible and unborn All things created are such as God willed them to be but the Son born of God subsists in the perfect likeness of God Reply Obj one This saying is directed against those who did not admit even the concomitance of the Father s will in the generation of the Son for they said that the Father begot the Son in such a manner by nature that the will to beget was wanting just as we ourselves suffer many things against our will from natural necessity as for instance death old age and like ills This appears from what precedes and from what follows as regards the words quoted for thus we read Not against His will nor as it were forced nor as if He were led by natural necessity did the Father beget the Son Reply Obj two The Apostle calls Christ the Son of the love of God inasmuch as He is superabundantly loved by God not however as if love were the principle of the Son s generation Reply Obj three The will as a natural faculty wills something naturally as man s will naturally tends to happiness and likewise God naturally wills and loves Himself whereas in regard to things other than Himself the will of God is in a way undetermined in itself as above explained Q nineteen A three Now the Holy Ghost proceeds as Love inasmuch as God loves Himself and hence He proceeds naturally although He proceeds by mode of will Reply Obj four Even as regards the intellectual conceptions of the mind a return is made to those first principles which are naturally understood But God naturally understands Himself and thus the conception of the divine Word is natural Reply Obj five A thing is said to be necessary of itself and by reason of another Taken in the latter sense it has a twofold meaning firstly as an efficient and compelling cause and thus necessary means what is violent secondly it means a final cause when a thing is said to be necessary as the means to an end so far as without it the end could not be attained or at least so well attained In neither of these ways is the divine generation necessary because God is not the means to an end nor is He subject to compulsion But a thing is said to be necessary of itself which cannot but be in this sense it is necessary for God to be and in the same sense it is necessary that the Father beget the Son THIRD ARTICLE I Q forty one Art three Whether the Notional Acts Proceed from Something Objection one It would seem that the notional acts do not proceed from anything For if the Father begets the Son from something this will be either from Himself or from something else If from something else since that whence a thing is generated exists in what is generated it follows that something different from the Father exists in the Son and this contradicts what is laid down by Hilary De Trin vii that In them nothing diverse or different exists If the Father begets the Son from Himself since again that whence a thing is generated if it be something permanent receives as predicate the thing generated therefrom just as we say The man is white since the man remains when not from white he is made white it follows that either the Father does not remain after the Son is begotten or that the Father is the Son which is false Therefore the Father does not beget the Son from something but from nothing Obj two Further that whence anything is generated is the principle regarding what is generated So if the Father generate the Son from His own essence or nature it follows that the essence or nature of the Father is the principle of the Son But it is not a material principle because in God nothing material exists and therefore it is as it were an active principle as the begetter is the principle of the one begotten Thus it follows that the essence generates which was disproved above Q thirty nine A five Obj three Further Augustine says De Trin vii six that the three persons are not from the same essence because the essence is not another thing from person But the person of the Son is not another thing from the Father s essence Therefore the Son is not from the Father s essence Obj four Further every creature is from nothing But in Scripture the Son is called a creature for it is said Ecclus twenty four five in the person of the Wisdom begotten I came out of the mouth of the Most High the first born before all creatures and further on Ecclus twenty four fourteen it is said as uttered by the same Wisdom From the beginning and before the world was I created Therefore the Son was not begotten from something but from nothing Likewise we can object concerning the Holy Ghost by reason of what is said Zech twelve one Thus saith the Lord Who stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundations of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him and Amos four thirteen according to another version The Septuagint I Who form the earth and create the spirit On the contrary Augustine Fulgentius De Fide ad Petrum i one says God the Father of His nature without beginning begot the Son equal to Himself I answer that The Son was not begotten from nothing but from the Father s substance For it was explained above Q twenty seven A two Q thirty three AA two three that paternity filiation and nativity really and truly exist in God Now this is the difference between true generation whereby one proceeds from another as a son and making that the maker makes something out of external matter as a carpenter makes a bench out of wood whereas a man begets a son from himself Now as a created workman makes a thing out of matter so God makes things out of nothing as will be shown later on Q forty five A one not as if this nothing were a part of the substance of the thing made but because the whole substance of a thing is produced by Him without anything else whatever presupposed So were the Son to proceed from the Father as out of nothing then the Son would be to the Father what the thing made is to the maker whereto as is evident the name of filiation would not apply except by a kind of similitude Thus if the Son of God proceeds from the Father out of nothing He could not be properly and truly called the Son whereas the contrary is stated one John five twenty That we may be in His true Son Jesus Christ Therefore the true Son of God is not from nothing nor is He made but begotten That certain creatures made by God out of nothing are called sons of God is to be taken in a metaphorical sense according to a certain likeness of assimilation to Him Who is the true Son Whence as He is the only true and natural Son of God He is called the only begotten according to John one eighteen The only begotten Son Who is in the bosom of the Father He hath declared Him and so as others are entitled sons of adoption by their similitude to Him He is called the first begotten according to Rom eight twenty nine Whom He foreknew He also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of His Son that He might be the first born of many brethren Therefore the Son of God is begotten of the substance of the Father but not in the same way as man is born of man for a part of the human substance in generation passes into the substance of the one begotten whereas the divine nature cannot be parted whence it necessarily follows that the Father in begetting the Son does not transmit any part of His nature but communicates His whole nature to Him the distinction only of origin remaining as explained above Q forty A two Reply Obj one When we say that the Son was born of the Father the preposition of designates a consubstantial generating principle but not a material principle For that which is produced from matter is made by a change of form in that whence it is produced But the divine essence is unchangeable and is not susceptive of another form Reply Obj two When we say the Son is begotten of the essence of the Father as the Master of the Sentences explains Sent i D v this denotes the habitude of a kind of active principle and as he expounds the Son is begotten of the essence of the Father that is of the Father Who is essence and so Augustine says De Trin xv thirteen When I say of the Father Who is essence it is the same as if I said more explicitly of the essence of the Father This however is not enough to explain the real meaning of the words For we can say that the creature is from God Who is essence but not that it is from the essence of God So we may explain them otherwise by observing that the preposition of de always denotes consubstantiality We do not say that a house is of de the builder since he is not the consubstantial cause We can say however that something is of another if this is its consubstantial principle no matter in what way it is so whether it be an active principle as the son is said to be of the father or a material principle as a knife is of iron or a formal principle but in those things only in which the forms are subsisting and not accidental to another for we can say that an angel is of an intellectual nature In this way then we say that the Son is begotten of the essence of the Father inasmuch as the essence of the Father communicated by generation subsists in the Son Reply Obj three When we say that the Son is begotten of the essence of the Father a term is added which saves the distinction But when we say that the three persons are of the divine essence there is nothing expressed to warrant the distinction signified by the preposition so there is no parity of argument Reply Obj four When we say Wisdom was created this may be understood not of Wisdom which is the Son of God but of created wisdom given by God to creatures for it is said He created her namely Wisdom in the Holy Ghost and He poured her out over all His works Ecclus one nine ten Nor is it inconsistent for Scripture in one text to speak of the Wisdom begotten and wisdom created for wisdom created is a kind of participation of the uncreated Wisdom The saying may also be referred to the created nature assumed by the Son so that the sense be From the beginning and before the world was I made that is I was foreseen as united to the creature Or the mention of wisdom as both created and begotten insinuates into our minds the mode of the divine generation for in generation what is generated receives the nature of the generator and this pertains to perfection whereas in creation the Creator is not changed but the creature does not receive the Creator s nature Thus the Son is called both created and begotten in order that from the idea of creation the immutability of the Father may be understood and from generation the unity of nature in the Father and the Son In this way Hilary expounds the sense of this text of Scripture De Synod The other passages quoted do not refer to the Holy Ghost but to the created spirit sometimes called wind sometimes air sometimes the breath of man sometimes also the soul or any other invisible substance FOURTH ARTICLE I Q forty one Art four Whether in God There Is a Power in Respect of the Notional Acts Objection one It would seem that in God there is no power in respect of the notional acts For every kind of power is either active or passive neither of which can be here applied there being in God nothing which we call passive power as above explained Q twenty five A one nor can active power belong to one person as regards another since the divine persons were not made as stated above A three Therefore in God there is no power in respect of the notional acts Obj two Further the object of power is what is possible But the divine persons are not regarded as possible but necessary Therefore as regards the notional acts whereby the divine persons proceed there cannot be power in God Obj three Further the Son proceeds as the word which is the concept of the intellect and the Holy Ghost proceeds as love which belongs to the will But in God power exists as regards effects and not as regards intellect and will as stated above Q twenty five A one Therefore in God power does not exist in reference to the notional acts On the contrary Augustine says Contra Maxim iii one If God the Father could not beget a company equal Son where is the omnipotence of God the Father Power therefore exists in God regarding the notional acts I answer that As the notional acts exist in God so must there be also a power in God regarding these acts since power only means the principle of act So as we understand the Father to be principle of generation and the Father and the Son to be the principle of spiration we must attribute the power of generating to the Father and the power of spiration to the Father and the Son for the power of generation means that whereby the generator generates Now every generator generates by something Therefore in every generator we must suppose the power of generating and in the spirator the power of spirating Reply Obj one As a person according to notional acts does not proceed as if made so the power in God as regards the notional acts has no reference to a person as if made but only as regards the person as proceeding Reply Obj two Possible as opposed to what is necessary is a consequence of a passive power which does not exist in God Hence in God there is no such thing as possibility in this sense but only in the sense of possible as contained in what is necessary and in this latter sense it can be said that as it is possible for God to be so also is it possible that the Son should be generated Reply Obj three Power signifies a principle and a principle implies distinction from that of which it is the principle Now we must observe a double distinction in things said of God one is a real distinction the other is a distinction of reason only By a real distinction God by His essence is distinct from those things of which He is the principle by creation just as one person is distinct from the other of which He is principle by a notional act But in God the distinction of action and agent is one of reason only otherwise action would be an accident in God And therefore with regard to those actions in respect of which certain things proceed which are distinct from God either personally or essentially we may ascribe power to God in its proper sense of principle And as we ascribe to God the power of creating so we may ascribe the power of begetting and of spirating But to understand and to will are not such actions as to designate the procession of something distinct from God either essentially or personally Wherefore with regard to these actions we cannot ascribe power to God in its proper sense but only after our way of understanding and speaking inasmuch as we designate by different terms the intellect and the act of understanding in God whereas in God the act of understanding is His very essence which has no principle FIFTH ARTICLE I Q forty one Art five Whether the Power of Begetting Signifies a Relation and Not the Essence Objection one It would seem that the power of begetting or of spirating signifies the relation and not the essence For power signifies a principle as appears from its definition for active power is the principle of action as we find in Metaph v text seventeen But in God principle in regard to Person is said notionally Therefore in God power does not signify essence but relation Obj two Further in God the power to act posse and to act are not distinct But in God begetting signifies relation Therefore the same applies to the power of begetting Obj three Further terms signifying the essence in God are common to the three persons But the power of begetting is not common to the three persons but proper to the Father Therefore it does not signify the essence On the contrary As God has the power to beget the Son so also He wills to beget Him But the will to beget signifies the essence Therefore also the power to beget I answer that Some have said that the power to beget signifies relation in God But this is not possible For in every agent that is properly called power by which the agent acts Now everything that produces something by its action produces something like itself as to the form by which it acts just as man begotten is like his begetter in his human nature in virtue of which the father has the power to beget a man In every begetter therefore that is the power of begetting in which the begotten is like the begetter Now the Son of God is like the Father who begets Him in the divine nature Wherefore the divine nature in the Father is in Him the power of begetting And so Hilary says De Trin v The birth of God cannot but contain that nature from which it proceeded for He cannot subsist other than God Who subsists from no other source than God We must therefore conclude that the power of begetting signifies principally the divine essence as the Master says Sent i D vii and not the relation only Nor does it signify the essence as identified with the relation so as to signify both equally For although paternity is signified as the form of the Father nevertheless it is a personal property being in respect to the person of the Father what the individual form is to the individual creature Now the individual form in things created constitutes the person begetting but is not that by which the begetter begets otherwise Socrates would beget Socrates So neither can paternity be understood as that by which the Father begets but as constituting the person of the Father otherwise the Father would beget the Father But that by which the Father begets is the divine nature in which the Son is like to Him And in this sense Damascene says De Fide Orth i eighteen that generation is the work of nature not of nature generating but of nature as being that by which the generator generates And therefore the power of begetting signifies the divine nature directly but the relation indirectly Reply Obj one Power does not signify the relation itself of a principle for thus it would be in the genus of relation but it signifies that which is a principle not indeed in the sense in which we call the agent a principle but in the sense of being that by which the agent acts Now the agent is distinct from that which it makes and the generator from that which it generates but that by which the generator generates is common to generated and generator and so much more perfectly as the generation is more perfect Since therefore the divine generation is most perfect that by which the Begetter begets is common to Begotten and Begetter by a community of identity and not only of species as in things created Therefore from the fact that we say that the divine essence is the principle by which the Begetter begets it does not follow that the divine essence is distinct from the Begotten which would follow if we were to say that the divine essence begets Reply Obj two As in God the power of begetting is the same as the act of begetting so the divine essence is the same in reality as the act of begetting or paternity although there is a distinction of reason Reply Obj three When I speak of the power of begetting power is signified directly generation indirectly just as if I were to say the essence of the Father Wherefore in respect of the essence which is signified the power of begetting is common to the three persons but in respect of the notion that is connoted it is proper to the person of the Father SIXTH ARTICLE I Q forty one Art six Whether Several Persons Can Be the Term of One Notional Act Objection one It would seem that a notional act can be directed to several Persons so that there may be several Persons begotten or spirated in God For whoever has the power of begetting can beget But the Son has the power of begetting Therefore He can beget But He cannot beget Himself therefore He can beget another son Therefore there can be several Sons in God Obj two Further Augustine says Contra Maxim iii twelve The Son did not beget a Creator not that He could not but that it behoved Him not Obj three Further God the Father has greater power to beget than has a created father But a man can beget several sons Therefore God can also the more so that the power of the Father is not diminished after begetting the Son On the contrary In God that which is possible and that which is do not differ If therefore in God it were possible for there to be several Sons there would be several Sons And thus there would be more than three Persons in God which is heretical I answer that As Athanasius says in God there is only one Father one Son one Holy Ghost For this four reasons may be given The first reason is in regard to the relations by which alone are the Persons distinct For since the divine Persons are the relations themselves as subsistent there would not be several Fathers or several Sons in God unless there were more than one paternity or more than one filiation And this indeed would not be possible except owing to a material distinction since forms of one species are not multiplied except in respect of matter which is not in God Wherefore there can be but one subsistent filiation in God just as there could be but one subsistent whiteness The second reason is taken from the manner of the processions For God understands and wills all things by one simple act Wherefore there can be but one person proceeding after the manner of word which person is the Son and but one person proceeding after the manner of love which person is the Holy Ghost The third reason is taken from the manner in which the persons proceed For the persons proceed naturally as we have said A two and nature is determined to one The fourth reason is taken from the perfection of the divine persons For this reason is the Son perfect that the entire divine filiation is contained in Him and that there is but one Son The argument is similar in regard to the other persons Reply Obj one We can grant without distinction that the Son has the same power as the Father but we cannot grant that the Son has the power generandi of begetting thus taking generandi as the gerund of the active verb so that the sense would be that the Son has the power to beget Just as although Father and Son have the same being it does not follow that the Son is the Father by reason of the notional term added But if the word generandi of being begotten is taken as the gerundive of the passive verb the power generandi is in the Son that is the power of being begotten The same is to be said if it be taken as the gerundive of an impersonal verb so that the sense be the power of generation that is a power by which it is generated by some person Reply Obj two Augustine does not mean to say by those words that the Son could beget a Son but that if He did not it was not because He could not as we shall see later on Q forty two A six ad three Reply Obj three Divine perfection and the total absence of matter in God require that there cannot be several Sons in God as we have explained Wherefore that there are not several Sons is not due to any lack of begetting power in the Father \ QUESTION forty two OF EQUALITY AND LIKENESS AMONG THE DIVINE PERSONS In Six Articles We now have to consider the persons as compared to one another firstly with regard to equality and likeness secondly with regard to mission Concerning the first there are six points of inquiry one Whether there is equality among the divine persons two Whether the person who proceeds is equal to the one from Whom He proceeds in eternity three Whether there is any order among the divine persons four Whether the divine persons are equal in greatness five Whether the one divine person is in another six Whether they are equal in power FIRST ARTICLE I Q forty two Art one Whether There Is Equality in God Objection one It would seem that equality is not becoming to the divine persons For equality is in relation to things which are one in quantity as the Philosopher says Metaph v text twenty But in the divine persons there is no quantity neither continuous intrinsic quantity which we call size nor continuous extrinsic quantity which we call place and time Nor can there be equality by reason of discrete quantity because two persons are more than one Therefore equality is not becoming to the divine persons Obj two Further the divine persons are of one essence as we have said Q thirty nine A two Now essence is signified by way of form But agreement in form makes things to be alike not to be equal Therefore we may speak of likeness in the divine persons but not of equality Obj three Further things wherein there is to be found equality are equal to one another for equality is reciprocal But the divine persons cannot be said to be equal to one another For as Augustine says De Trin vi ten If an image answers perfectly to that whereof it is the image it may be said to be equal to it but that which it represents cannot be said to be equal to the image But the Son is the image of the Father and so the Father is not equal to the Son Therefore equality is not to be found among the divine persons Obj four Further equality is a relation But no relation is common to the three persons for the persons are distinct by reason of the relations Therefore equality is not becoming to the divine persons On the contrary Athanasius says that the three persons are company eternal and company equal to one another I answer that We must needs admit equality among the divine persons For according to the Philosopher Metaph x text fifteen sixteen seventeen equality signifies the negation of greater or less Now we cannot admit anything greater or less in the divine persons for as Boethius says De Trin i They must needs admit a difference namely of Godhead who speak of either increase or decrease as the Arians do who sunder the Trinity by distinguishing degrees as of numbers thus involving a plurality Now the reason of this is that unequal things cannot have the same quantity But quantity in God is nothing else than His essence Wherefore it follows that if there were any inequality in the divine persons they would not have the same essence and thus the three persons would not be one God which is impossible We must therefore admit equality among the divine persons Reply Obj one Quantity is twofold There is quantity of bulk or dimensive quantity which is to be found only in corporeal things and has therefore no place in God There is also quantity of virtue which is measured according to the perfection of some nature or form to this sort of quantity we allude when we speak of something as being more or less hot forasmuch as it is more or less perfect in heat Now this virtual quantity is measured firstly by its source that is by the perfection of that form or nature such is the greatness of spiritual things just as we speak of great heat on account of its intensity and perfection And so Augustine says De Trin vi eighteen that in things which are great but not in bulk to be greater is to be better for the more perfect a thing is the better it is Secondly virtual quantity is measured by the effects of the form Now the first effect of form is being for everything has being by reason of its form The second effect is operation for every agent acts through its form Consequently virtual quantity is measured both in regard to being and in regard to action in regard to being forasmuch as things of a more perfect nature are of longer duration and in regard to action forasmuch as things of a more perfect nature are more powerful to act And so as Augustine Fulgentius De Fide ad Petrum i says We understand equality to be in the Father Son and Holy Ghost inasmuch as no one of them either precedes in eternity or excels in greatness or surpasses in power Reply Obj two Where we have equality in respect of virtual quantity equality includes likeness and something besides because it excludes excess For whatever things have a common form may be said to be alike even if they do not participate in that form equally just as the air may be said to be like fire in heat but they cannot be said to be equal if one participates in the form more perfectly than another And because not only is the same nature in both Father and Son but also is it in both in perfect equality therefore we say not only that the Son is like to the Father in order to exclude the error of Eunomius but also that He is equal to the Father to exclude the error of Arius Reply Obj three Equality and likeness in God may be designated in two ways namely by nouns and by verbs When designated by nouns equality in the divine persons is mutual and so is likeness for the Son is equal and like to the Father and conversely This is because the divine essence is not more the Father s than the Son s Wherefore just as the Son has the greatness of the Father and is therefore equal to the Father so the Father has the greatness of the Son and is therefore equal to the Son But in reference to creatures Dionysius says Div Nom ix Equality and likeness are not mutual For effects are said to be like their causes inasmuch as they have the form of their causes but not conversely for the form is principally in the cause and secondarily in the effect But verbs signify equality with movement And although movement is not in God there is something that receives Since therefore the Son receives from the Father this namely that He is equal to the Father and not conversely for this reason we say that the Son is equalled to the Father but not conversely Reply Obj four In the divine persons there is nothing for us to consider but the essence which they have in common and the relations in which they are distinct Now equality implies both namely distinction of persons for nothing can be said to be equal to itself and unity of essence since for this reason are the persons equal to one another that they are of the same greatness and essence Now it is clear that the relation of a thing to itself is not a real relation Nor again is one relation referred to another by a further relation for when we say that paternity is opposed to filiation opposition is not a relation mediating between paternity and filiation For in both these cases relation would be multiplied indefinitely Therefore equality and likeness in the divine persons is not a real relation distinct from the personal relations but in its concept it includes both the relations which distinguish the persons and the unity of essence For this reason the Master says Sent i D xxxi that in these it is only the terms that are relative SECOND ARTICLE I Q forty two Art two Whether the Person Proceeding Is company eternal with His Principle As the Son with the Father Objection one It would seem that the person proceeding is not company eternal with His principle as the Son with the Father For Arius gives twelve modes of generation The first mode is like the issue of a line from a point wherein is wanting equality of simplicity The second is like the emission of rays from the sun wherein is absent equality of nature The third is like the mark or impression made by a seal wherein is wanting consubstantiality and executive power The fourth is the infusion of a good will from God wherein also consubstantiality is wanting The fifth is the emanation of an accident from its subject but the accident has no subsistence The sixth is the abstraction of a species from matter as sense receives the species from the sensible object wherein is wanting equality of spiritual simplicity The seventh is the exciting of the will by knowledge which excitation is merely temporal The eighth is transformation as an image is made of brass which transformation is material The ninth is motion from a mover and here again we have effect and cause The tenth is the taking of species from genera but this mode has no place in God for the Father is not predicated of the Son as the genus of a species The eleventh is the realization of an idea ideatio as an external coffer arises from the one in the mind The twelfth is birth as a man is begotten of his father which implies priority and posteriority of time Thus it is clear that equality of nature or of time is absent in every mode whereby one thing is from another So if the Son is from the Father we must say that He is less than the Father or later than the Father or both Obj two Further everything that comes from another has a principle But nothing eternal has a principle Therefore the Son is not eternal nor is the Holy Ghost Obj three Further everything which is corrupted ceases to be Hence everything generated begins to be for the end of generation is existence But the Son is generated by the Father Therefore He begins to exist and is not company eternal with the Father Obj four Further if the Son be begotten by the Father either He is always being begotten or there is some moment in which He is begotten If He is always being begotten since during the process of generation a thing must be imperfect as appears in successive things which are always in process of becoming as time and motion it follows that the Son must be always imperfect which cannot be admitted Thus there is a moment to be assigned for the begetting of the Son and before that moment the Son did not exist On the contrary Athanasius declares that all the three persons are company eternal with each other I answer that We must say that the Son is company eternal with the Father In proof of which we must consider that for a thing which proceeds from a principle to be posterior to its principle may be due to two reasons one on the part of the agent and the other on the part of the action On the part of the agent this happens differently as regards free agents and natural agents In free agents on account of the choice of time for as a free agent can choose the form it gives to the effect as stated above Q forty one A two so it can choose the time in which to produce its effect In natural agents however the same happens from the agent not having its perfection of natural power from the very first but obtaining it after a certain time as for instance a man is not able to generate from the very first Considered on the part of action anything derived from a principle cannot exist simultaneously with its principle when the action is successive So given that an agent as soon as it exists begins to act thus the effect would not exist in the same instant but in the instant of the action s termination Now it is manifest according to what has been said Q forty one A two that the Father does not beget the Son by will but by nature and also that the Father s nature was perfect from eternity and again that the action whereby the Father produces the Son is not successive because thus the Son would be successively generated and this generation would be material and accompanied with movement which is quite impossible Therefore we conclude that the Son existed whensoever the Father existed and thus the Son is company eternal with the Father and likewise the Holy Ghost is company eternal with both Reply Obj one As Augustine says De Verbis Domini Serm thirty eight no mode of the procession of any creature perfectly represents the divine generation Hence we need to gather a likeness of it from many of these modes so that what is wanting in one may be somewhat supplied from another and thus it is declared in the council of Ephesus Let Splendor tell thee that the company eternal Son existed always with the Father let the Word announce the impassibility of His birth let the name Son insinuate His consubstantiality Yet above them all the procession of the word from the intellect represents it more exactly the intellectual word not being posterior to its source except in an intellect passing from potentiality to act and this cannot be said of God Reply Obj two Eternity excludes the principle of duration but not the principle of origin Reply Obj three Every corruption is a change and so all that corrupts begins not to exist and ceases to be The divine generation however is not changed as stated above Q twenty seven A two Hence the Son is ever being begotten and the Father is always begetting Reply Obj four In time there is something indivisible namely the instant and there is something else which endures namely time But in eternity the indivisible now stands ever still as we have said above Q ten A two ad one A four ad two But the generation of the Son is not in the now of time or in time but in eternity And so to express the presentiality and permanence of eternity we can say that He is ever being born as Origen said Hom in Joan i But as Gregory Moral xxix twenty one and Augustine Super Ps two seven said it is better to say ever born so that ever may denote the permanence of eternity and born the perfection of the only Begotten Thus therefore neither is the Son imperfect nor was there a time when He was not as Arius said THIRD ARTICLE I Q forty two Art three Whether in the Divine Persons There Exists an Order of Nature Objection one It would seem that among the divine persons there does not exist an order of nature For whatever exists in God is the essence or a person or a notion But the order of nature does not signify the essence nor any of the persons or notions Therefore there is no order of nature in God Obj two Further wherever order of nature exists there one comes before another at least according to nature and intellect But in the divine persons there exists neither priority nor posteriority as declared by Athanasius Therefore in the divine persons there is no order of nature Obj three Further wherever order exists distinction also exists But there is no distinction in the divine nature Therefore it is not subject to order and order of nature does not exist in it Obj four Further the divine nature is the divine essence But there is no order of essence in God Therefore neither is there of nature On the contrary Where plurality exists without order confusion exists But in the divine persons there is no confusion as Athanasius says Therefore in God order exists I answer that Order always has reference to some principle Wherefore since there are many kinds of principle namely according to site as a point according to intellect as the principle of demonstration and according to each individual cause so are there many kinds of order Now principle according to origin without priority exists in God as we have stated Q thirty three A one so there must likewise be order according to origin without priority and this is called the order of nature in the words of Augustine Contra Maxim iv Not whereby one is prior to another but whereby one is from another Reply Obj one The order of nature signifies the notion of origin in general not a special kind of origin Reply Obj two In things created even when what is derived from a principle is company equal in duration with its principle the principle still comes first in the order of nature and reason if formally considered as principle If however we consider the relations of cause and effect or of the principle and the thing proceeding therefrom it is clear that the things so related are simultaneous in the order of nature and reason inasmuch as the one enters the definition of the other But in God the relations themselves are the persons subsisting in one nature So neither on the part of the nature nor on the part the relations can one person be prior to another not even in the order of nature and reason Reply Obj three The order of nature means not the ordering of nature itself but the existence of order in the divine Persons according to natural origin Reply Obj four Nature in a certain way implies the idea of a principle but essence does not and so the order of origin is more correctly called the order of nature than the order of essence FOURTH ARTICLE I Q four Art four Whether the Son Is Equal to the Father in Greatness Objection one It would seem that the Son is not equal to the Father in greatness For He Himself said John fourteen twenty eight The Father is greater than I and the Apostle says one Cor fifteen twenty eight The Son Himself shall be subject to Him that put all things under Him Obj two Further paternity is part of the Father s dignity But paternity does not belong to the Son Therefore the Son does not possess all the Father s dignity and so He is not equal in greatness to the Father Obj three Further wherever there exist a whole and a part many parts are more than one only or than fewer parts as three men are more than two or than one But in God a universal whole exists and a part for under relation or notion several notions are included Therefore since in the Father there are three notions while in the Son there are only two the Son is evidently not equal to the Father On the contrary It is said Phil two six He thought it not robbery to be equal with God I answer that The Son is necessarily equal to the Father in greatness For the greatness of God is nothing but the perfection of His nature Now it belongs to the very nature of paternity and filiation that the Son by generation should attain to the possession of the perfection of the nature which is in the Father in the same way as it is in the Father Himself But since in men generation is a certain kind of transmutation of one proceeding from potentiality to act it follows that a man is not equal at first to the father who begets him but attains to equality by due growth unless owing to a defect in the principle of generation it should happen otherwise From what precedes Q twenty seven A two Q thirty three AA two three it is evident that in God there exist real true paternity and filiation Nor can we say that the power of generation in the Father was defective nor that the Son of God arrived at perfection in a successive manner and by change Therefore we must say that the Son was eternally equal to the Father in greatness Hence Hilary says De Synod Can twenty seven Remove bodily weakness remove the beginning of conception remove pain and all human shortcomings then every son by reason of his natural nativity is the father s equal because he has a like nature Reply Obj one These words are to be understood of Christ s human nature wherein He is less than the Father and subject to Him but in His divine nature He is equal to the Father This is expressed by Athanasius Equal to the Father in His Godhead less than the Father in humanity and by Hilary De Trin ix By the fact of giving the Father is greater but He is not less to Whom the same being is given and De Synod The Son subjects Himself by His inborn piety that is by His recognition of paternal authority whereas creatures are subject by their created weakness Reply Obj two Equality is measured by greatness In God greatness signifies the perfection of nature as above explained A one ad one and belongs to the essence Thus equality and likeness in God have reference to the essence nor can there be inequality or dissimilitude arising from the distinction of the relations Wherefore Augustine says Contra Maxim iii thirteen The question of origin is Who is from whom but the question of equality is Of what kind or how great is he Therefore paternity is the Father s dignity as also the Father s essence since dignity is something absolute and pertains to the essence As therefore the same essence which in the Father is paternity in the Son is filiation so the same dignity which in the Father is paternity in the Son is filiation It is thus true to say that the Son possesses whatever dignity the Father has but we cannot argue the Father has paternity therefore the Son has paternity for there is a transition from substance to relation For the Father and the Son have the same essence and dignity which exist in the Father by the relation of giver and in the Son by relation of receiver Reply Obj three In God relation is not a universal whole although it is predicated of each of the relations because all the relations are one in essence and being which is irreconcilable with the idea of universal the parts of which are distinguished in being Person likewise is not a universal term in God as we have seen above Q thirty A four Wherefore all the relations together are not greater than only one nor are all the persons something greater than only one because the whole perfection of the divine nature exists in each person FIFTH ARTICLE I Q forty two Art five Whether the Son Is in the Father and Conversely Objection one It would seem that the Son and the Father are not in each other For the Philosopher Phys iv text twenty three gives eight modes of one thing existing in another according to none of which is the Son in the Father or conversely as is patent to anyone who examines each mode Therefore the Son and the Father are not in each other Obj two Further nothing that has come out from another is within But the Son from eternity came out from the Father according to Mic five two His going forth is from the beginning from the days of eternity Therefore the Son is not in the Father Obj three Further one of two opposites cannot be in the other But the Son and the Father are relatively opposed Therefore one cannot be in the other On the contrary It is said John fourteen ten I am in the Father and the Father is in Me I answer that There are three points of consideration as regards the Father and the Son the essence the relation and the origin and according to each the Son and the Father are in each other The Father is in the Son by His essence forasmuch as the Father is His own essence and communicates His essence to the Son not by any change on His part Hence it follows that as the Father s essence is in the Son the Father Himself is in the Son likewise since the Son is His own essence it follows that He Himself is in the Father in Whom is His essence This is expressed by Hilary De Trin v The unchangeable God so to speak follows His own nature in begetting an unchangeable subsisting God So we understand the nature of God to subsist in Him for He is God in God It is also manifest that as regards the relations each of two relative opposites is in the concept of the other Regarding origin also it is clear that the procession of the intelligible word is not outside the intellect inasmuch as it remains in the utterer of the word What also is uttered by the word is therein contained And the same applies to the Holy Ghost Reply Obj one What is contained in creatures does not sufficiently represent what exists in God so according to none of the modes enumerated by the Philosopher are the Son and the Father in each other The mode the most nearly approaching to the reality is to be found in that whereby something exists in its originating principle except that the unity of essence between the principle and that which proceeds therefrom is wanting in things created Reply Obj two The Son s going forth from the Father is by mode of the interior procession whereby the word emerges from the heart and remains therein Hence this going forth in God is only by the distinction of the relations not by any kind of essential separation Reply Obj three The Father and the Son are relatively opposed but not essentially while as above explained one relative opposite is in the other SIXTH ARTICLE I Q forty two Art six Whether the Son Is Equal to the Father in Power Objection one It would seem that the Son is not equal to the Father in power For it is said John five nineteen The Son cannot do anything of Himself but what He seeth the Father doing But the Father can act of Himself Therefore the Father s power is greater than the Son s Obj two Further greater is the power of him who commands and teaches than of him who obeys and hears But the Father commands the Son according to John fourteen thirty one As the Father gave Me commandment so do I The Father also teaches the Son The Father loveth the Son and showeth Him all things that Himself doth John five twenty Also the Son hears As I hear so I judge John five thirty Therefore the Father has greater power than the Son Obj three Further it belongs to the Father s omnipotence to be able to beget a Son equal to Himself For Augustine says Contra Maxim iii seven Were He unable to beget one equal to Himself where would be the omnipotence of God the Father But the Son cannot beget a Son as proved above Q forty one A six Therefore the Son cannot do all that belongs to the Father s omnipotence and hence He is not equal to Him power On the contrary It is said John five nineteen Whatsoever things the Father doth these the Son also doth in like manner I answer that The Son is necessarily equal to the Father in power Power of action is a consequence of perfection in nature In creatures for instance we see that the more perfect the nature the greater power is there for action Now it was shown above A four that the very notion of the divine paternity and filiation requires that the Son should be the Father s equal in greatness that is in perfection of nature Hence it follows that the Son is equal to the Father in power and the same applies to the Holy Ghost in relation to both Reply Obj one The words the Son cannot of Himself do anything do not withdraw from the Son any power possessed by the Father since it is immediately added Whatsoever things the Father doth the Son doth in like manner but their meaning is to show that the Son derives His power from the Father of Whom He receives His nature Hence Hilary says De Trin ix The unity of the divine nature implies that the Son so acts of Himself per se that He does not act by Himself a se Reply Obj two The Father s showing and the Son s hearing are to be taken in the sense that the Father communicates knowledge to the Son as He communicates His essence The command of the Father can be explained in the same sense as giving Him from eternity knowledge and will to act by begetting Him Or better still this may be referred to Christ in His human nature Reply Obj three As the same essence is paternity in the Father and filiation in the Son so by the same power the Father begets and the Son is begotten Hence it is clear that the Son can do whatever the Father can do yet it does not follow that the Son can beget for to argue thus would imply transition from substance to relation for generation signifies a divine relation So the Son has the same omnipotence as the Father but with another relation the Father possessing power as giving signified when we say that He is able to beget while the Son possesses the power of receiving signified by saying that He can be begotten QUESTION forty three THE MISSION OF THE DIVINE PERSONS In Eight Articles We next consider the mission of the divine persons concerning which there are eight points of inquiry one Whether it is suitable for a divine person to be sent two Whether mission is eternal or only temporal three In what sense a divine person is invisibly sent four Whether it is fitting that each person be sent five Whether both the Son and the Holy Ghost are invisibly sent six To whom the invisible mission is directed seven Of the visible mission eight Whether any person sends Himself visibly or invisibly FIRST ARTICLE I Q forty three Art one Whether a Divine Person Can Be Properly Sent Objection one It would seem that a divine person cannot be properly sent For one who is sent is less than the sender But one divine person is not less than another Therefore one person is not sent by another Obj two Further what is sent is separated from the sender hence Jerome says commenting on Ezech sixteen fifty three What is joined and tied in one body cannot be sent But in the divine persons there is nothing that is separable as Hilary says De Trin vii Therefore one person is not sent by another Obj three Further whoever is sent departs from one place and comes anew into another But this does not apply to a divine person Who is everywhere Therefore it is not suitable for a divine person to be sent On the contrary It is said John eight sixteen I am not alone but I and the Father that sent Me I answer that the notion of mission includes two things the habitude of the one sent to the sender and that of the one sent to the end whereto he is sent Anyone being sent implies a certain kind of procession of the one sent from the sender either according to command as the master sends the servant or according to counsel as an adviser may be said to send the king to battle or according to origin as a tree sends forth its flowers The habitude to the term to which he is sent is also shown so that in some way he begins to be present there either because in no way was he present before in the place whereto he is sent or because he begins to be there in some way in which he was not there hitherto Thus the mission of a divine person is a fitting thing as meaning in one way the procession of origin from the sender and as meaning a new way of existing in another thus the Son is said to be sent by the Father into the world inasmuch as He began to exist visibly in the world by taking our nature whereas He was previously in the world John one one Reply Obj one Mission implies inferiority in the one sent when it means procession from the sender as principle by command or counsel forasmuch as the one commanding is the greater and the counsellor is the wiser In God however it means only procession of origin which is according to equality as explained above Q forty two AA four six Reply Obj two What is so sent as to begin to exist where previously it did not exist is locally moved by being sent hence it is necessarily separated locally from the sender This however has no place in the mission of a divine person for the divine person sent neither begins to exist where he did not previously exist nor ceases to exist where He was Hence such a mission takes place without a separation having only distinction of origin Reply Obj three This objection rests on the idea of mission according to local motion which is not in God SECOND ARTICLE I Q forty three Art two Whether Mission Is Eternal or Only Temporal Objection one It would seem that mission can be eternal For Gregory says Hom xxvi in Ev The Son is sent as He is begotten But the Son s generation is eternal Therefore mission is eternal Obj two Further a thing is changed if it becomes something temporally But a divine person is not changed Therefore the mission of a divine person is not temporal but eternal Obj three Further mission implies procession But the procession of the divine persons is eternal Therefore mission is also eternal On the contrary It is said Gal four four When the fullness of the time was come God sent His Son I answer that A certain difference is to be observed in all the words that express the origin of the divine persons For some express only relation to the principle as procession and going forth Others express the term of procession together with the relation to the principle Of these some express the eternal term as generation and spiration for generation is the procession of the divine person into the divine nature and passive spiration is the procession of the subsisting love Others express the temporal term with the relation to the principle as mission and giving For a thing is sent that it may be in something else and is given that it may be possessed but that a divine person be possessed by any creature or exist in it in a new mode is temporal Hence mission and giving have only a temporal significance in God but generation and spiration are exclusively eternal whereas procession and giving in God have both an eternal and a temporal signification for the Son may proceed eternally as God but temporally by becoming man according to His visible mission or likewise by dwelling in man according to His invisible mission Reply Obj one Gregory speaks of the temporal generation of the Son not from the Father but from His mother or it may be taken to mean that He could be sent because eternally begotten Reply Obj two That a divine person may newly exist in anyone or be possessed by anyone in time does not come from change of the divine person but from change in the creature as God Himself is called Lord temporally by change of the creature Reply Obj three Mission signifies not only procession from the principle but also determines the temporal term of the procession Hence mission is only temporal Or we may say that it includes the eternal procession with the addition of a temporal effect For the relation of a divine person to His principle must be eternal Hence the procession may be called a twin procession eternal and temporal not that there is a double relation to the principle but a double term temporal and eternal THIRD ARTICLE I Q forty three Art three Whether the Invisible Mission of the Divine Person Is Only According to the Gift of Sanctifying Grace Objection one It would seem that the invisible mission of the divine person is not only according to the gift of sanctifying grace For the sending of a divine person means that He is given Hence if the divine person is sent only according to the gift of sanctifying grace the divine person Himself will not be given but only His gifts and this is the error of those who say that the Holy Ghost is not given but that His gifts are given Obj two Further this preposition according to denotes the habitude of some cause But the divine person is the cause why the gift of sanctifying grace is possessed and not conversely according to Rom five five the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost Who is given to us Therefore it is improperly said that the divine person is sent according to the gift of sanctifying grace Obj three Further Augustine says De Trin iv twenty that the Son when temporally perceived by the mind is sent But the Son is known not only by sanctifying grace but also by gratuitous grace as by faith and knowledge Therefore the divine person is not sent only according to the gift of sanctifying grace Obj four Further Rabanus says that the Holy Ghost was given to the apostles for the working of miracles This however is not a gift of sanctifying grace but a gratuitous grace Therefore the divine person is not given only according to the gift of sanctifying grace On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iii four that the Holy Ghost proceeds temporally for the creature s sanctification But mission is a temporal procession Since then the creature s sanctification is by sanctifying grace it follows that the mission of the divine person is only by sanctifying grace I answer that The divine person is fittingly sent in the sense that He exists newly in any one and He is given as possessed by anyone and neither of these is otherwise than by sanctifying grace For God is in all things by His essence power and presence according to His one common mode as the cause existing in the effects which participate in His goodness Above and beyond this common mode however there is one special mode belonging to the rational nature wherein God is said to be present as the object known is in the knower and the beloved in the lover And since the rational creature by its operation of knowledge and love attains to God Himself according to this special mode God is said not only to exist in the rational creature but also to dwell therein as in His own temple So no other effect can be put down as the reason why the divine person is in the rational creature in a new mode except sanctifying grace Hence the divine person is sent and proceeds temporally only according to sanctifying grace Again we are said to possess only what we can freely use or enjoy and to have the power of enjoying the divine person can only be according to sanctifying grace And yet the Holy Ghost is possessed by man and dwells within him in the very gift itself of sanctifying grace Hence the Holy Ghost Himself is given and sent Reply Obj one By the gift of sanctifying grace the rational creature is perfected so that it can freely use not only the created gift itself but enjoy also the divine person Himself and so the invisible mission takes place according to the gift of sanctifying grace and yet the divine person Himself is given Reply Obj two Sanctifying grace disposes the soul to possess the divine person and this is signified when it is said that the Holy Ghost is given according to the gift of grace Nevertheless the gift itself of grace is from the Holy Ghost which is meant by the words the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost Reply Obj three Although the Son can be known by us according to other effects yet neither does He dwell in us nor is He possessed by us according to those effects Reply Obj four The working of miracles manifests sanctifying grace as also does the gift of prophecy and any other gratuitous graces Hence gratuitous grace is called the manifestation of the Spirit one Cor twelve seven So the Holy Ghost is said to be given to the apostles for the working of miracles because sanctifying grace was given to them with the outward sign Were the sign only of sanctifying grace given to them without the grace itself it would not be simply said that the Holy Ghost was given except with some qualifying term just as we read of certain ones receiving the gift of the spirit of prophecy or of miracles as having from the Holy Ghost the power of prophesying or of working miracles FOURTH ARTICLE I Q forty three Art four Whether the Father Can Be Fittingly Sent Objection one It would seem that it is fitting also that the Father should be sent For being sent means that the divine person is given But the Father gives Himself since He can only be possessed by His giving Himself Therefore it can be said that the Father sends Himself Obj two Further the divine person is sent according to the indwelling of grace But by grace the whole Trinity dwells in us according to John fourteen twenty three We will come to him and make Our abode with him Therefore each one of the divine persons is sent Obj three Further whatever belongs to one person belongs to them all except the notions and persons But mission does not signify any person nor even a notion since there are only five notions as stated above Q thirty two A three Therefore every divine person can be sent On the contrary Augustine says De Trin ii three The Father alone is never described as being sent I answer that The very idea of mission means procession from another and in God it means procession according to origin as above expounded Hence as the Father is not from another in no way is it fitting for Him to be sent but this can only belong to the Son and to the Holy Ghost to Whom it belongs to be from another Reply Obj one In the sense of giving as a free bestowal of something the Father gives Himself as freely bestowing Himself to be enjoyed by the creature But as implying the authority of the giver as regards what is given to be given only applies in God to the Person Who is from another and the same as regards being sent Reply Obj two Although the effect of grace is also from the Father Who dwells in us by grace just as the Son and the Holy Ghost still He is not described as being sent for He is not from another Thus Augustine says De Trin iv twenty that The Father when known by anyone in time is not said to be sent for there is no one whence He is or from whom He proceeds Reply Obj three Mission meaning procession from the sender includes the signification of a notion not of a special notion but in general thus to be from another is common to two of the notions FIFTH ARTICLE I Q forty three Art five Whether It Is Fitting for the Son to Be Sent Invisibly Objection one It would seem that it is not fitting for the Son to be sent invisibly For invisible mission of the divine person is according to the gift of grace But all gifts of grace belong to the Holy Ghost according to one Cor twelve eleven One and the same Spirit worketh all things Therefore only the Holy Ghost is sent invisibly Obj two Further the mission of the divine person is according to sanctifying grace But the gifts belonging to the perfection of the intellect are not gifts of sanctifying grace since they can be held without the gift of charity according to one Cor thirteen two If I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and all knowledge and if I should have all faith so that I could move mountains and have not charity I am nothing Therefore since the Son proceeds as the word of the intellect it seems unfitting for Him to be sent invisibly Obj three Further the mission of the divine person is a procession as expounded above AA one four But the procession of the Son and of the Holy Ghost differ from each other Therefore they are distinct missions if both are sent and then one of them would be superfluous since one would suffice for the creature s sanctification On the contrary It is said of divine Wisdom Wis nine ten Send her from heaven to Thy Saints and from the seat of Thy greatness I answer that The whole Trinity dwells in the mind by sanctifying grace according to John fourteen twenty three We will come to him and will make Our abode with him But that a divine person be sent to anyone by invisible grace signifies both that this person dwells in a new way within him and that He has His origin from another Hence since both to the Son and to the Holy Ghost it belongs to dwell in the soul by grace and to be from another it therefore belongs to both of them to be invisibly sent As to the Father though He dwells in us by grace still it does not belong to Him to be from another and consequently He is not sent Reply Obj one Although all the gifts considered as such are attributed to the Holy Ghost forasmuch as He is by His nature the first Gift since He is Love as stated above Q thirty eight A one some gifts nevertheless by reason of their own particular nature are appropriated in a certain way to the Son those namely which belong to the intellect and in respect of which we speak of the mission of the Son Hence Augustine says De Trin iv twenty that The Son is sent to anyone invisibly whenever He is known and perceived by anyone Reply Obj two The soul is made like to God by grace Hence for a divine person to be sent to anyone by grace there must needs be a likening of the soul to the divine person Who is sent by some gift of grace Because the Holy Ghost is Love the soul is assimilated to the Holy Ghost by the gift of charity hence the mission of the Holy Ghost is according to the mode of charity Whereas the Son is the Word not any sort of word but one Who breathes forth Love Hence Augustine says De Trin ix ten The Word we speak of is knowledge with love Thus the Son is sent not in accordance with every and any kind of intellectual perfection but according to the intellectual illumination which breaks forth into the affection of love as is said John six forty five Everyone that hath heard from the Father and hath learned cometh to Me and Ps thirty eight four In my meditation a fire shall flame forth Thus Augustine plainly says De Trin iv twenty The Son is sent whenever He is known and perceived by anyone Now perception implies a certain experimental knowledge and this is properly called wisdom sapientia as it were a sweet knowledge sapida scientia according to Ecclus six twenty three The wisdom of doctrine is according to her name Reply Obj three Since mission implies the origin of the person Who is sent and His indwelling by grace as above explained A one if we speak of mission according to origin in this sense the Son s mission is distinguished from the mission of the Holy Ghost as generation is distinguished from procession If we consider mission as regards the effect of grace in this sense the two missions are united in the root which is grace but are distinguished in the effects of grace which consist in the illumination of the intellect and the kindling of the affection Thus it is manifest that one mission cannot be without the other because neither takes place without sanctifying grace nor is one person separated from the other SIXTH ARTICLE I Q forty three Art six Whether the Invisible Mission Is to All Who Participate Grace Objection one It would seem that the invisible mission is not to all who participate grace For the Fathers of the Old Testament had their share of grace Yet to them was made no invisible mission for it is said John seven thirty nine The Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified Therefore the invisible mission is not to all partakers in grace Obj two Further progress in virtue is only by grace But the invisible mission is not according to progress in virtue because progress in virtue is continuous since charity ever increases or decreases and thus the mission would be continuous Therefore the invisible mission is not to all who share in grace Obj three Further Christ and the blessed have fullness of grace But mission is not to them for mission implies distance whereas Christ as man and all the blessed are perfectly united to God Therefore the invisible mission is not to all sharers in grace Obj four Further the Sacraments of the New Law contain grace and it is not said that the invisible mission is sent to them Therefore the invisible mission is not to all that have grace On the contrary According to Augustine De Trin iii four xv twenty seven the invisible mission is for the creature s sanctification Now every creature that has grace is sanctified Therefore the invisible mission is to every such creature I answer that As above stated AA three four five mission in its very meaning implies that he who is sent either begins to exist where he was not before as occurs to creatures or begins to exist where he was before but in a new way in which sense mission is ascribed to the divine persons Thus mission as regards the one to whom it is sent implies two things the indwelling of grace and a certain renewal by grace Thus the invisible mission is sent to all in whom are to be found these two conditions Reply Obj one The invisible mission was directed to the Old Testament Fathers as appears from what Augustine says De Trin iv twenty that the invisible mission of the Son is in man and with men This was done in former times with the Fathers and the Prophets Thus the words the Spirit was not yet given are to be applied to that giving accompanied with a visible sign which took place on the day of Pentecost Reply Obj two The invisible mission takes place also as regards progress in virtue or increase of grace Hence Augustine says De Trin iv twenty that the Son is sent to each one when He is known and perceived by anyone so far as He can be known and perceived according to the capacity of the soul whether journeying towards God or united perfectly to Him Such invisible mission however chiefly occurs as regards anyone s proficiency in the performance of a new act or in the acquisition of a new state of grace as for example the proficiency in reference to the gift of miracles or of prophecy or in the fervor of charity leading a man to expose himself to the danger of martyrdom or to renounce his possessions or to undertake any arduous work Reply Obj three The invisible mission is directed to the blessed at the very beginning of their beatitude The invisible mission is made to them subsequently not by intensity of grace but by the further revelation of mysteries which goes on till the day of judgment Such an increase is by the extension of grace because it extends to a greater number of objects To Christ the invisible mission was sent at the first moment of His conception but not afterwards since from the beginning of His conception He was filled with all wisdom and grace Reply Obj four Grace resides instrumentally in the sacraments of the New Law as the form of a thing designed resides in the instruments of the art designing according to a process flowing from the agent to the passive object But mission is only spoken of as directed to its term Hence the mission of the divine person is not sent to the sacraments but to those who receive grace through the sacraments SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q forty three Art seven Whether It Is Fitting for the Holy Ghost to Be Sent Visibly Objection one It would seem that the Holy Ghost is not fittingly sent in a visible manner For the Son as visibly sent to the world is said to be less than the Father But the Holy Ghost is never said to be less than the Father Therefore the Holy Ghost is not fittingly sent in a visible manner Obj two Further the visible mission takes place by way of union to a visible creature as the Son s mission according to the flesh But the Holy Ghost did not assume any visible creature and hence it cannot be said that He exists otherwise in some creatures than in others unless perhaps as in a sign as He is also present in the sacraments and in all the figures of the law Thus the Holy Ghost is either not sent visibly at all or His visible mission takes place in all these things Obj three Further every visible creature is an effect showing forth the whole Trinity Therefore the Holy Ghost is not sent by reason of those visible creatures more than any other person Obj four Further the Son was visibly sent by reason of the noblest kind of creature namely the human nature Therefore if the Holy Ghost is sent visibly He ought to be sent by reason of rational creatures Obj five Further whatever is done visibly by God is dispensed by the ministry of the angels as Augustine says De Trin iii four hundred fifty nine So visible appearances if there have been any came by means of the angels Thus the angels are sent and not the Holy Ghost Obj six Further the Holy Ghost being sent in a visible manner is only for the purpose of manifesting the invisible mission as invisible things are made known by the visible So those to whom the invisible mission was not sent ought not to receive the visible mission and to all who received the invisible mission whether in the New or in the Old Testament the visible mission ought likewise to be sent and this is clearly false Therefore the Holy Ghost is not sent visibly On the contrary It is said Matt three sixteen that when our Lord was baptized the Holy Ghost descended upon Him in the shape of a dove I answer that God provides for all things according to the nature of each thing Now the nature of man requires that he be led to the invisible by visible things as explained above Q twelve A twelve Wherefore the invisible things of God must be made manifest to man by the things that are visible As God therefore in a certain way has demonstrated Himself and His eternal processions to men by visible creatures according to certain signs so was it fitting that the invisible missions also of the divine persons should be made manifest by some visible creatures This mode of manifestation applies in different ways to the Son and to the Holy Ghost For it belongs to the Holy Ghost Who proceeds as Love to be the gift of sanctification to the Son as the principle of the Holy Ghost it belongs to the author of this sanctification Thus the Son has been sent visibly as the author of sanctification the Holy Ghost as the sign of sanctification Reply Obj one The Son assumed the visible creature wherein He appeared into the unity of His person so that whatever can be said of that creature can be said of the Son of God and so by reason of the nature assumed the Son is called less than the Father But the Holy Ghost did not assume the visible creature in which He appeared into the unity of His person so that what is said of it cannot be predicated of Him Hence He cannot be called less than the Father by reason of any visible creature Reply Obj two The visible mission of the Holy Ghost does not apply to the imaginary vision which is that of prophecy because as Augustine says De Trin ii six The prophetic vision is not displayed to corporeal eyes by corporeal shapes but is shown in the spirit by the spiritual images of bodies But whoever saw the dove and the fire saw them by their eyes Nor again has the Holy Ghost the same relation to these images that the Son has to the rock because it is said The rock was Christ one Cor ten four For that rock was already created and after the manner of an action was named Christ Whom it typified whereas the dove and the fire suddenly appeared to signify only what was happening They seem however to be like to the flame of the burning bush seen by Moses and to the column which the people followed in the desert and to the lightning and thunder issuing forth when the law was given on the mountain For the purpose of the bodily appearances of those things was that they might signify and then pass away Thus the visible mission is neither displayed by prophetic vision which belongs to the imagination and not to the body nor by the sacramental signs of the Old and New Testament wherein certain pre existing things are employed to signify something But the Holy Ghost is said to be sent visibly inasmuch as He showed Himself in certain creatures as in signs especially made for that purpose Reply Obj three Although the whole Trinity makes those creatures still they are made in order to show forth in some special way this or that person For as the Father Son and Holy Ghost are signified by diverse names so also can They each one be signified by different things although neither separation nor diversity exists amongst Them Reply Obj four It was necessary for the Son to be declared as the author of sanctification as explained above Thus the visible mission of the Son was necessarily made according to the rational nature to which it belongs to act and which is capable of sanctification whereas any other creature could be the sign of sanctification Nor was such a visible creature formed for such a purpose necessarily assumed by the Holy Ghost into the unity of His person since it was not assumed or used for the purpose of action but only for the purpose of a sign and so likewise it was not required to last beyond what its use required Reply Obj five Those visible creatures were formed by the ministry of the angels not to signify the person of an angel but to signify the Person of the Holy Ghost Thus as the Holy Ghost resided in those visible creatures as the one signified in the sign on that account the Holy Ghost is said to be sent visibly and not as an angel Reply Obj six It is not necessary that the invisible mission should always be made manifest by some visible external sign but as is said one Cor twelve seven the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit that is of the Church This utility consists in the confirmation and propagation of the faith by such visible signs This has been done chiefly by Christ and by the apostles according to Heb two three which having begun to be declared by the Lord was confirmed unto us by them that heard Thus in a special sense a mission of the Holy Ghost was directed to Christ to the apostles and to some of the early saints on whom the Church was in a way founded in such a manner however that the visible mission made to Christ should show forth the invisible mission made to Him not at that particular time but at the first moment of His conception The visible mission was directed to Christ at the time of His baptism by the figure of a dove a fruitful animal to show forth in Christ the authority of the giver of grace by spiritual regeneration hence the Father s voice spoke This is My beloved Son Matt three seventeen that others might be regenerated to the likeness of the only Begotten The Transfiguration showed it forth in the appearance of a bright cloud to show the exuberance of doctrine and hence it was said Hear ye Him Matt seventeen five To the apostles the mission was directed in the form of breathing to show forth the power of their ministry in the dispensation of the sacraments and hence it was said Whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven John twenty twenty three and again under the sign of fiery tongues to show forth the office of teaching whence it is said that they began to speak with divers tongues Acts two four The visible mission of the Holy Ghost was fittingly not sent to the fathers of the Old Testament because the visible mission of the Son was to be accomplished before that of the Holy Ghost since the Holy Ghost manifests the Son as the Son manifests the Father Visible apparitions of the divine persons were however given to the Fathers of the Old Testament which indeed cannot be called visible missions because according to Augustine De Trin ii seventeen they were not sent to designate the indwelling of the divine person by grace but for the manifestation of something else EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q forty three Art eight Whether a Divine Person Is Sent Only by the Person Whence He Proceeds Eternally Objection one It would seem that a divine person is sent only by the one whence He proceeds eternally For as Augustine says De Trin iv The Father is sent by no one because He is from no one Therefore if a divine person is sent by another He must be from that other Obj two Further the sender has authority over the one sent But there can be no authority as regards a divine person except from origin Therefore the divine person sent must proceed from the one sending Obj three Further if a divine person can be sent by one whence He does not proceed then the Holy Ghost may be given by a man although He proceeds not from him which is contrary to what Augustine says De Trin xv Therefore the divine person is sent only by the one whence He proceeds On the contrary The Son is sent by the Holy Ghost according to Isa forty eight sixteen Now the Lord God hath sent Me and His Spirit But the Son is not from the Holy Ghost Therefore a divine person is sent by one from Whom He does not proceed I answer that There are different opinions on this point Some say that the divine person is sent only by the one whence He proceeds eternally and so when it is said that the Son of God is sent by the Holy Ghost this is to be explained as regards His human nature by reason of which He was sent to preach by the Holy Ghost Augustine however says De Trin ii five that the Son is sent by Himself and by the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is sent by Himself and by the Son so that to be sent in God does not apply to each person but only to the person proceeding from another whereas to send belongs to each person There is some truth in both of these opinions because when a person is described as being sent the person Himself existing from another is designated with the visible or invisible effect applicable to the mission of the divine person Thus if the sender be designated as the principle of the person sent in this sense not each person sends but that person only Who is the principle of that person who is sent and thus the Son is sent only by the Father and the Holy Ghost by the Father and the Son If however the person sending is understood as the principle of the effect implied in the mission in that sense the whole Trinity sends the person sent This reason does not prove that a man can send the Holy Ghost forasmuch as man cannot cause the effect of grace The answers to the objections appear from the above TREATISE ON THE CREATION QQ forty four forty nine QUESTION forty four THE PROCESSION OF CREATURES FROM GOD AND OF THE FIRST CAUSE OF ALL THINGS In Four Articles After treating of the procession of the divine persons we must consider the procession of creatures from God This consideration will be threefold one of the production of creatures two of the distinction between them three of their preservation and government Concerning the first point there are three things to be considered one the first cause of beings two the mode of procession of creatures from the first cause three the principle of the duration of things 
6727_10344_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Under the first head there are four points of inquiry 
none	none	one Whether God is the efficient cause of all beings two Whether primary matter is created by God or is an independent coordinate principle with Him three Whether God is the exemplar cause of beings or whether there are other exemplar causes four Whether He is the final cause of things FIRST ARTICLE I Q forty four Art one Whether It Is Necessary That Every Being Be Created by God Objection one It would seem that it is not necessary that every being be created by God For there is nothing to prevent a thing from being without that which does not belong to its essence as a man can be found without whiteness But the relation of the thing caused to its cause does not appear to be essential to beings for some beings can be understood without it therefore they can exist without it and therefore it is possible that some beings should not be created by God Obj two Further a thing requires an efficient cause in order to exist Therefore whatever cannot but exist does not require an efficient cause But no necessary thing can not exist because whatever necessarily exists cannot but exist Therefore as there are many necessary things in existence it appears that not all beings are from God Obj three Further whatever things have a cause can be demonstrated by that cause But in mathematics demonstration is not made by the efficient cause as appears from the Philosopher Metaph iii text three therefore not all beings are from God as from their efficient cause On the contrary It is said Rom eleven thirty six Of Him and by Him and in Him are all things I answer that It must be said that every being in any way existing is from God For whatever is found in anything by participation must be caused in it by that to which it belongs essentially as iron becomes ignited by fire Now it has been shown above Q three A four when treating of the divine simplicity that God is the essentially self subsisting Being and also it was shown Q eleven AA three four that subsisting being must be one as if whiteness were self subsisting it would be one since whiteness is multiplied by its recipients Therefore all beings apart from God are not their own being but are beings by participation Therefore it must be that all things which are diversified by the diverse participation of being so as to be more or less perfect are caused by one First Being Who possesses being most perfectly Hence Plato said Parmen xxvi that unity must come before multitude and Aristotle said Metaph ii text four that whatever is greatest in being and greatest in truth is the cause of every being and of every truth just as whatever is the greatest in heat is the cause of all heat Reply Obj one Though the relation to its cause is not part of the definition of a thing caused still it follows as a consequence on what belongs to its essence because from the fact that a thing has being by participation it follows that it is caused Hence such a being cannot be without being caused just as man cannot be without having the faculty of laughing But since to be caused does not enter into the essence of being as such therefore is it possible for us to find a being uncaused Reply Obj two This objection has led some to say that what is necessary has no cause Phys viii text forty six But this is manifestly false in the demonstrative sciences where necessary principles are the causes of necessary conclusions And therefore Aristotle says Metaph v text six that there are some necessary things which have a cause of their necessity But the reason why an efficient cause is required is not merely because the effect is not necessary but because the effect might not be if the cause were not For this conditional proposition is true whether the antecedent and consequent be possible or impossible Reply Obj three The science of mathematics treats its object as though it were something abstracted mentally whereas it is not abstract in reality Now it is becoming that everything should have an efficient cause in proportion to its being And so although the object of mathematics has an efficient cause still its relation to that cause is not the reason why it is brought under the consideration of the mathematician who therefore does not demonstrate that object from its efficient cause SECOND ARTICLE I Q forty four Art two Whether Primary Matter Is Created by God Objection one It would seem that primary matter is not created by God For whatever is made is composed of a subject and of something else Phys i text sixty two But primary matter has no subject Therefore primary matter cannot have been made by God Obj two Further action and passion are opposite members of a division But as the first active principle is God so the first passive principle is matter Therefore God and primary matter are two principles divided against each other neither of which is from the other Obj three Further every agent produces its like and thus since every agent acts in proportion to its actuality it follows that everything made is in some degree actual But primary matter is only in potentiality formally considered in itself Therefore it is against the nature of primary matter to be a thing made On the contrary Augustine says Confess xii seven Two things hast Thou made O Lord one nigh unto Thyself viz angels the other nigh unto nothing viz primary matter I answer that The ancient philosophers gradually and as it were step by step advanced to the knowledge of truth At first being of grosser mind they failed to realize that any beings existed except sensible bodies And those among them who admitted movement did not consider it except as regards certain accidents for instance in relation to rarefaction and condensation by union and separation And supposing as they did that corporeal substance itself was uncreated they assigned certain causes for these accidental changes as for instance affinity discord intellect or something of that kind An advance was made when they understood that there was a distinction between the substantial form and matter which latter they imagined to be uncreated and when they perceived transmutation to take place in bodies in regard to essential forms Such transmutations they attributed to certain universal causes such as the oblique circle The zodiac according to Aristotle De Gener ii or ideas according to Plato But we must take into consideration that matter is contracted by its form to a determinate species as a substance belonging to a certain species is contracted by a supervening accident to a determinate mode of being for instance man by whiteness Each of these opinions therefore considered being under some particular aspect either as this or as such and so they assigned particular efficient causes to things Then others there were who arose to the consideration of being as being and who assigned a cause to things not as these or as such but as beings Therefore whatever is the cause of things considered as beings must be the cause of things not only according as they are such by accidental forms nor according as they are these by substantial forms but also according to all that belongs to their being at all in any way And thus it is necessary to say that also primary matter is created by the universal cause of things Reply Obj one The Philosopher Phys i text sixty two is speaking of becoming in particular that is from form to form either accidental or substantial But here we are speaking of things according to their emanation from the universal principle of being from which emanation matter itself is not excluded although it is excluded from the former mode of being made Reply Obj two Passion is an effect of action Hence it is reasonable that the first passive principle should be the effect of the first active principle since every imperfect thing is caused by one perfect For the first principle must be most perfect as Aristotle says Metaph xii text forty Reply Obj three The reason adduced does not show that matter is not created but that it is not created without form for though everything created is actual still it is not pure act Hence it is necessary that even what is potential in it should be created if all that belongs to its being is created THIRD ARTICLE I Q forty four Art three Whether the Exemplar Cause Is Anything Besides God Objection one It would seem that the exemplar cause is something besides God For the effect is like its exemplar cause But creatures are far from being like God Therefore God is not their exemplar cause Obj two Further whatever is by participation is reduced to something self existing as a thing ignited is reduced to fire as stated above A one But whatever exists in sensible things exists only by participation of some species This appears from the fact that in all sensible species is found not only what belongs to the species but also individuating principles added to the principles of the species Therefore it is necessary to admit self existing species as for instance a per se man and a per se horse and the like which are called the exemplars Therefore exemplar causes exist besides God Obj three Further sciences and definitions are concerned with species themselves but not as these are in particular things because there is no science or definition of particular things Therefore there are some beings which are beings or species not existing in singular things and these are called exemplars Therefore the same conclusion follows as above Obj four Further this likewise appears from Dionysius who says Div Nom v that self subsisting being is before self subsisting life and before self subsisting wisdom On the contrary The exemplar is the same as the idea But ideas according to Augustine QQ eighty three qu forty six are the master forms which are contained in the divine intelligence Therefore the exemplars of things are not outside God I answer that God is the first exemplar cause of all things In proof whereof we must consider that if for the production of anything an exemplar is necessary it is in order that the effect may receive a determinate form For an artificer produces a determinate form in matter by reason of the exemplar before him whether it is the exemplar beheld externally or the exemplar interiorily conceived in the mind Now it is manifest that things made by nature receive determinate forms This determination of forms must be reduced to the divine wisdom as its first principle for divine wisdom devised the order of the universe which order consists in the variety of things And therefore we must say that in the divine wisdom are the types of all things which types we have called ideas i e exemplar forms existing in the divine mind Q fifteen A one And these ideas though multiplied by their relations to things in reality are not apart from the divine essence according as the likeness to that essence can be shared diversely by different things In this manner therefore God Himself is the first exemplar of all things Moreover in things created one may be called the exemplar of another by the reason of its likeness thereto either in species or by the analogy of some kind of imitation Reply Obj one Although creatures do not attain to a natural likeness to God according to similitude of species as a man begotten is like to the man begetting still they do attain to likeness to Him forasmuch as they represent the divine idea as a material house is like to the house in the architect s mind Reply Obj two It is of a man s nature to be in matter and so a man without matter is impossible Therefore although this particular man is a man by participation of the species he cannot be reduced to anything self existing in the same species but to a superior species such as separate substances The same applies to other sensible things Reply Obj three Although every science and definition is concerned only with beings still it is not necessary that a thing should have the same mode in reality as the thought of it has in our understanding For we abstract universal ideas by force of the active intellect from the particular conditions but it is not necessary that the universals should exist outside the particulars in order to be their exemplars Reply Obj four As Dionysius says Div Nom iv by self existing life and self existing wisdom he sometimes denotes God Himself sometimes the powers given to things themselves but not any self subsisting things as the ancients asserted FOURTH ARTICLE I Q forty four Art four Whether God Is the Final Cause of All Things Objection one It would seem that God is not the final cause of all things For to act for an end seems to imply need of the end But God needs nothing Therefore it does not become Him to act for an end Obj two Further the end of generation and the form of the thing generated and the agent cannot be identical Phys ii text seventy because the end of generation is the form of the thing generated But God is the first agent producing all things Therefore He is not the final cause of all things Obj three Further all things desire their end But all things do not desire God for all do not even know Him Therefore God is not the end of all things Obj four Further the final cause is the first of causes If therefore God is the efficient cause and the final cause it follows that before and after exist in Him which is impossible On the contrary It is said Prov sixteen four The Lord has made all things for Himself I answer that Every agent acts for an end otherwise one thing would not follow more than another from the action of the agent unless it were by chance Now the end of the agent and of the patient considered as such is the same but in a different way respectively For the impression which the agent intends to produce and which the patient intends to receive are one and the same Some things however are both agent and patient at the same time these are imperfect agents and to these it belongs to intend even while acting the acquisition of something But it does not belong to the First Agent Who is agent only to act for the acquisition of some end He intends only to communicate His perfection which is His goodness while every creature intends to acquire its own perfection which is the likeness of the divine perfection and goodness Therefore the divine goodness is the end of all things Reply Obj one To act from need belongs only to an imperfect agent which by its nature is both agent and patient But this does not belong to God and therefore He alone is the most perfectly liberal giver because He does not act for His own profit but only for His own goodness Reply Obj two The form of the thing generated is not the end of generation except inasmuch as it is the likeness of the form of the generator which intends to communicate its own likeness otherwise the form of the thing generated would be more noble than the generator since the end is more noble than the means to the end Reply Obj three All things desire God as their end when they desire some good thing whether this desire be intellectual or sensible or natural i e without knowledge because nothing is good and desirable except forasmuch as it participates in the likeness to God Reply Obj four Since God is the efficient the exemplar and the final cause of all things and since primary matter is from Him it follows that the first principle of all things is one in reality But this does not prevent us from mentally considering many things in Him some of which come into our mind before others QUESTION forty five THE MODE OF EMANATION OF THINGS FROM THE FIRST PRINCIPLE In Eight Articles The next question concerns the mode of the emanation of things from the First Principle and this is called creation and includes eight points of inquiry one What is creation two Whether God can create anything three Whether creation is anything in the very nature of things four To what things it belongs to be created five Whether it belongs to God alone to create six Whether creation is common to the whole Trinity or proper to any one Person seven Whether any trace of the Trinity is to be found in created things eight Whether the work of creation is mingled with the works of nature and of the will FIRST ARTICLE I Q forty five Art one Whether to Create Is to Make Something from Nothing Objection one It would seem that to create is not to make anything from nothing For Augustine says Contra Adv Leg et Proph i To make concerns what did not exist at all but to create is to make something by bringing forth something from what was already Obj two Further the nobility of action and of motion is considered from their terms Action is therefore nobler from good to good and from being to being than from nothing to something But creation appears to be the most noble action and first among all actions Therefore it is not from nothing to something but rather from being to being Obj three Further the preposition from ex imports relation of some cause and especially of the material cause as when we say that a statue is made from brass But nothing cannot be the matter of being nor in any way its cause Therefore to create is not to make something from nothing On the contrary On the text of general one In the beginning God created et cetera the gloss has To create is to make something from nothing I answer that As said above Q forty four A two we must consider not only the emanation of a particular being from a particular agent but also the emanation of all being from the universal cause which is God and this emanation we designate by the name of creation Now what proceeds by particular emanation is not presupposed to that emanation as when a man is generated he was not before but man is made from not man and white from not white Hence if the emanation of the whole universal being from the first principle be considered it is impossible that any being should be presupposed before this emanation For nothing is the same as no being Therefore as the generation of a man is from the not being which is not man so creation which is the emanation of all being is from the not being which is nothing Reply Obj one Augustine uses the word creation in an equivocal sense according as to be created signifies improvement in things as when we say that a bishop is created We do not however speak of creation in that way here but as it is described above Reply Obj two Changes receive species and dignity not from the term wherefrom but from the term whereto Therefore a change is more perfect and excellent when the term whereto of the change is more noble and excellent although the term wherefrom corresponding to the term whereto may be more imperfect thus generation is simply nobler and more excellent than alteration because the substantial form is nobler than the accidental form and yet the privation of the substantial form which is the term wherefrom in generation is more imperfect than the contrary which is the term wherefrom in alteration Similarly creation is more perfect and excellent than generation and alteration because the term whereto is the whole substance of the thing whereas what is understood as the term wherefrom is simply not being Reply Obj three When anything is said to be made from nothing this preposition from ex does not signify the material cause but only order as when we say from morning comes midday i e after morning is midday But we must understand that this preposition from ex can comprise the negation implied when I say the word nothing or can be included in it If taken in the first sense then we affirm the order by stating the relation between what is now and its previous non existence But if the negation includes the preposition then the order is denied and the sense is It is made from nothing i e it is not made from anything as if we were to say He speaks of nothing because he does not speak of anything And this is verified in both ways when it is said that anything is made from nothing But in the first way this preposition from ex implies order as has been said in this reply In the second sense it imports the material cause which is denied SECOND ARTICLE I Q forty five Art two Whether God Can Create Anything Objection one It would seem that God cannot create anything because according to the Philosopher Phys i text thirty four the ancient philosophers considered it as a commonly received axiom that nothing is made from nothing But the power of God does not extend to the contraries of first principles as for instance that God could make the whole to be less than its part or that affirmation and negation are both true at the same time Therefore God cannot make anything from nothing or create Obj two Further if to create is to make something from nothing to be created is to be made But to be made is to be changed Therefore creation is change But every change occurs in some subject as appears by the definition of movement for movement is the act of what is in potentiality Therefore it is impossible for anything to be made out of nothing by God Obj three Further what has been made must have at some time been becoming But it cannot be said that what is created at the same time is becoming and has been made because in permanent things what is becoming is not and what has been made already is and so it would follow that something would be and not be at the same time Therefore when anything is made its becoming precedes its having been made But this is impossible unless there is a subject in which the becoming is sustained Therefore it is impossible that anything should be made from nothing Obj four Further infinite distance cannot be crossed But infinite distance exists between being and nothing Therefore it does not happen that something is made from nothing On the contrary It is said general one one In the beginning God created heaven and earth I answer that Not only is it not impossible that anything should be created by God but it is necessary to say that all things were created by God as appears from what has been said Q forty four A one For when anyone makes one thing from another this latter thing from which he makes is presupposed to his action and is not produced by his action thus the craftsman works from natural things as wood or brass which are caused not by the action of art but by the action of nature So also nature itself causes natural things as regards their form but presupposes matter If therefore God did only act from something presupposed it would follow that the thing presupposed would not be caused by Him Now it has been shown above Q forty four AA one two that nothing can be unless it is from God Who is the universal cause of all being Hence it is necessary to say that God brings things into being from nothing Reply Obj one Ancient philosophers as is said above Q forty four A two considered only the emanation of particular effects from particular causes which necessarily presuppose something in their action whence came their common opinion that nothing is made from nothing But this has no place in the first emanation from the universal principle of things Reply Obj two Creation is not change except according to a mode of understanding For change means that the same something should be different now from what it was previously Sometimes indeed the same actual thing is different now from what it was before as in motion according to quantity quality and place but sometimes it is the same being only in potentiality as in substantial change the subject of which is matter But in creation by which the whole substance of a thing is produced the same thing can be taken as different now and before only according to our way of understanding so that a thing is understood as first not existing at all and afterwards as existing But as action and passion coincide as to the substance of motion and differ only according to diverse relations Phys iii text twenty twenty one it must follow that when motion is withdrawn only diverse relations remain in the Creator and in the creature But because the mode of signification follows the mode of understanding as was said above Q thirteen A one creation is signified by mode of change and on this account it is said that to create is to make something from nothing And yet to make and to be made are more suitable expressions here than to change and to be changed because to make and to be made import a relation of cause to the effect and of effect to the cause and imply change only as a consequence Reply Obj three In things which are made without movement to become and to be already made are simultaneous whether such making is the term of movement as illumination for a thing is being illuminated and is illuminated at the same time or whether it is not the term of movement as the word is being made in the mind and is made at the same time In these things what is being made is but when we speak of its being made we mean that it is from another and was not previously Hence since creation is without movement a thing is being created and is already created at the same time Reply Obj four This objection proceeds from a false imagination as if there were an infinite medium between nothing and being which is plainly false This false imagination comes from creation being taken to signify a change existing between two forms THIRD ARTICLE I Q forty five Art three Whether Creation Is Anything in the Creature Objection one It would seem that creation is not anything in the creature For as creation taken in a passive sense is attributed to the creature so creation taken in an active sense is attributed to the Creator But creation taken actively is not anything in the Creator because otherwise it would follow that in God there would be something temporal Therefore creation taken passively is not anything in the creature Obj two Further there is no medium between the Creator and the creature But creation is signified as the medium between them both since it is not the Creator as it is not eternal nor is it the creature because in that case it would be necessary for the same reason to suppose another creation to create it and so on to infinity Therefore creation is not anything in the creature Obj three Further if creation is anything besides the created substance it must be an accident belonging to it But every accident is in a subject Therefore a thing created would be the subject of creation and so the same thing would be the subject and also the term of creation This is impossible because the subject is before the accident and preserves the accident while the term is after the action and passion whose term it is and as soon as it exists action and passion cease Therefore creation itself is not any thing On the contrary It is greater for a thing to be made according to its entire substance than to be made according to its substantial or accidental form But generation taken simply or relatively whereby anything is made according to the substantial or the accidental form is something in the thing generated Therefore much more is creation whereby a thing is made according to its whole substance something in the thing created I answer that Creation places something in the thing created according to relation only because what is created is not made by movement or by change For what is made by movement or by change is made from something pre existing And this happens indeed in the particular productions of some beings but cannot happen in the production of all being by the universal cause of all beings which is God Hence God by creation produces things without movement Now when movement is removed from action and passion only relation remains as was said above A two ad two Hence creation in the creature is only a certain relation to the Creator as to the principle of its being even as in passion which implies movement is implied a relation to the principle of motion Reply Obj one Creation signified actively means the divine action which is God s essence with a relation to the creature But in God relation to the creature is not a real relation but only a relation of reason whereas the relation of the creature to God is a real relation as was said above Q thirteen A seven in treating of the divine names Reply Obj two Because creation is signified as a change as was said above A two ad two and change is a kind of medium between the mover and the moved therefore also creation is signified as a medium between the Creator and the creature Nevertheless passive creation is in the creature and is a creature Nor is there need of a further creation in its creation because relations or their entire nature being referred to something are not referred by any other relations but by themselves as was also shown above Q forty two A one ad four in treating of the equality of the Persons Reply Obj three The creature is the term of creation as signifying a change but is the subject of creation taken as a real relation and is prior to it in being as the subject is to the accident Nevertheless creation has a certain aspect of priority on the part of the object to which it is directed which is the beginning of the creature Nor is it necessary that as long as the creature is it should be created because creation imports a relation of the creature to the Creator with a certain newness or beginning FOURTH ARTICLE I Q forty five Art four Whether to Be Created Belongs to Composite and Subsisting Things Objection one It would seem that to be created does not belong to composite and subsisting things For in the book De Causis prop iv it is said The first of creatures is being But the being of a thing created is not subsisting Therefore creation properly speaking does not belong to subsisting and composite things Obj two Further whatever is created is from nothing But composite things are not from nothing but are the result of their own component parts Therefore composite things are not created Obj three Further what is presupposed in the second emanation is properly produced by the first as natural generation produces the natural thing which is presupposed in the operation of art But the thing supposed in natural generation is matter Therefore matter and not the composite is properly speaking that which is created On the contrary It is said general one one In the beginning God created heaven and earth But heaven and earth are subsisting composite things Therefore creation belongs to them I answer that To be created is in a manner to be made as was shown above Q forty four A two ad two three Now to be made is directed to the being of a thing Hence to be made and to be created properly belong to whatever being belongs which indeed belongs properly to subsisting things whether they are simple things as in the case of separate substances or composite as in the case of material substances For being belongs to that which has being that is to what subsists in its own being But forms and accidents and the like are called beings not as if they themselves were but because something is by them as whiteness is called a being inasmuch as its subject is white by it Hence according to the Philosopher Metaph vii text two accident is more properly said to be of a being than a being Therefore as accidents and forms and the like non subsisting things are to be said to company exist rather than to exist so they ought to be called rather concreated than created things whereas properly speaking created things are subsisting beings Reply Obj one In the proposition the first of created things is being the word being does not refer to the subject of creation but to the proper concept of the object of creation For a created thing is called created because it is a being not because it is this being since creation is the emanation of all being from the Universal Being as was said above A one We use a similar way of speaking when we say that the first visible thing is color although strictly speaking the thing colored is what is seen Reply Obj two Creation does not mean the building up of a composite thing from pre existing principles but it means that the composite is created so that it is brought into being at the same time with all its principles Reply Obj three This reason does not prove that matter alone is created but that matter does not exist except by creation for creation is the production of the whole being and not only matter FIFTH ARTICLE I Q forty five Art five Whether It Belongs to God Alone to Create Objection one It would seem that it does not belong to God alone to create because according to the Philosopher De Anima ii text thirty four what is perfect can make its own likeness But immaterial creatures are more perfect than material creatures which nevertheless can make their own likeness for fire generates fire and man begets man Therefore an immaterial substance can make a substance like to itself But immaterial substance can be made only by creation since it has no matter from which to be made Therefore a creature can create Obj two Further the greater the resistance is on the part of the thing made so much the greater power is required in the maker But a contrary resists more than nothing Therefore it requires more power to make something from its contrary which nevertheless a creature can do than to make a thing from nothing Much more therefore can a creature do this Obj three Further the power of the maker is considered according to the measure of what is made But created being is finite as we proved above when treating of the infinity of God Q seven AA two three four Therefore only a finite power is needed to produce a creature by creation But to have a finite power is not contrary to the nature of a creature Therefore it is not impossible for a creature to create On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iii eight that neither good nor bad angels can create anything Much less therefore can any other creatures I answer that It sufficiently appears at the first glance according to what precedes A one that to create can be the action of God alone For the more universal effects must be reduced to the more universal and prior causes Now among all effects the most universal is being itself and hence it must be the proper effect of the first and most universal cause and that is God Hence also it is said De Causis prop iii that neither intelligence nor the soul gives us being except inasmuch as it works by divine operation Now to produce being absolutely not as this or that being belongs to creation Hence it is manifest that creation is the proper act of God alone It happens however that something participates the proper action of another not by its own power but instrumentally inasmuch as it acts by the power of another as air can heat and ignite by the power of fire And so some have supposed that although creation is the proper act of the universal cause still some inferior cause acting by the power of the first cause can create And thus Avicenna asserted that the first separate substance created by God created another after itself and the substance of the world and its soul and that the substance of the world creates the matter of inferior bodies And in the same manner the Master says Sent iv D five that God can communicate to a creature the power of creating so that the latter can create ministerially not by its own power But such a thing cannot be because the secondary instrumental cause does not participate the action of the superior cause except inasmuch as by something proper to itself it acts dispositively to the effect of the principal agent If therefore it effects nothing according to what is proper to itself it is used to no purpose nor would there be any need of certain instruments for certain actions Thus we see that a saw in cutting wood which it does by the property of its own form produces the form of a bench which is the proper effect of the principal agent Now the proper effect of God creating is what is presupposed to all other effects and that is absolute being Hence nothing else can act dispositively and instrumentally to this effect since creation is not from anything presupposed which can be disposed by the action of the instrumental agent So therefore it is impossible for any creature to create either by its own power or instrumentally that is ministerially And above all it is absurd to suppose that a body can create for no body acts except by touching or moving and thus it requires in its action some pre existing thing which can be touched or moved which is contrary to the very idea of creation Reply Obj one A perfect thing participating any nature makes a likeness to itself not by absolutely producing that nature but by applying it to something else For an individual man cannot be the cause of human nature absolutely because he would then be the cause of himself but he is the cause of human nature being in the man begotten and thus he presupposes in his action a determinate matter whereby he is an individual man But as an individual man participates human nature so every created being participates so to speak the nature of being for God alone is His own being as we have said above Q seven AA one two Therefore no created being can produce a being absolutely except forasmuch as it causes being in this and so it is necessary to presuppose that whereby a thing is this thing before the action whereby it makes its own likeness But in an immaterial substance it is not possible to presuppose anything whereby it is this thing because it is what it is by its form whereby it has being since it is a subsisting form Therefore an immaterial substance cannot produce another immaterial substance like to itself as regards its being but only as regards some added perfection as we may say that a superior angel illuminates an inferior as Dionysius says Coel Hier iv x In this way even in heaven there is paternity as the Apostle says Eph three fifteen From whom all paternity in heaven and on earth is named From which evidently appears that no created being can cause anything unless something is presupposed which is against the very idea of creation Reply Obj two A thing is made from its contrary indirectly Phys i text forty three but directly from the subject which is in potentiality And so the contrary resists the agent inasmuch as it impedes the potentiality from the act which the agent intends to induce as fire intends to reduce the matter of water to an act like to itself but is impeded by the form and contrary dispositions whereby the potentiality of the water is restrained from being reduced to act and the more the potentiality is restrained the more power is required in the agent to reduce the matter to act Hence a much greater power is required in the agent when no potentiality pre exists Thus therefore it appears that it is an act of much greater power to make a thing from nothing than from its contrary Reply Obj three The power of the maker is reckoned not only from the substance of the thing made but also from the mode of its being made for a greater heat heats not only more but quicker Therefore although to create a finite effect does not show an infinite power yet to create it from nothing does show an infinite power which appears from what has been said ad two For if a greater power is required in the agent in proportion to the distance of the potentiality from the act it follows that the power of that which produces something from no presupposed potentiality is infinite because there is no proportion between no potentiality and the potentiality presupposed by the power of a natural agent as there is no proportion between not being and being And because no creature has simply an infinite power any more than it has an infinite being as was proved above Q seven A two it follows that no creature can create SIXTH ARTICLE I Q forty five Art six Whether to Create Is Proper to Any Person Objection one It would seem that to create is proper to some Person For what comes first is the cause of what is after and what is perfect is the cause of what is imperfect But the procession of the divine Person is prior to the procession of the creature and is more perfect because the divine Person proceeds in perfect similitude of its principle whereas the creature proceeds in imperfect similitude Therefore the processions of the divine Persons are the cause of the processions of things and so to create belongs to a Person Obj two Further the divine Persons are distinguished from each other only by their processions and relations Therefore whatever difference is attributed to the divine Persons belongs to them according to the processions and relations of the Persons But the causation of creatures is diversely attributed to the divine Persons for in the Creed to the Father is attributed that He is the Creator of all things visible and invisible to the Son is attributed that by Him all things were made and to the Holy Ghost is attributed that He is Lord and Life giver Therefore the causation of creatures belongs to the Persons according to processions and relations Obj three Further if it be said that the causation of the creature flows from some essential attribute appropriated to some one Person this does not appear to be sufficient because every divine effect is caused by every essential attribute viz by power goodness and wisdom and thus does not belong to one more than to another Therefore any determinate mode of causation ought not to be attributed to one Person more than to another unless they are distinguished in creating according to relations and processions On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom ii that all things caused are the common work of the whole Godhead I answer that To create is properly speaking to cause or produce the being of things And as every agent produces its like the principle of action can be considered from the effect of the action for it must be fire that generates fire And therefore to create belongs to God according to His being that is His essence which is common to the three Persons Hence to create is not proper to any one Person but is common to the whole Trinity Nevertheless the divine Persons according to the nature of their procession have a causality respecting the creation of things For as was said above Q fourteen A eight Q nineteen A four when treating of the knowledge and will of God God is the cause of things by His intellect and will just as the craftsman is cause of the things made by his craft Now the craftsman works through the word conceived in his mind and through the love of his will regarding some object Hence also God the Father made the creature through His Word which is His Son and through His Love which is the Holy Ghost And so the processions of the Persons are the type of the productions of creatures inasmuch as they include the essential attributes knowledge and will Reply Obj one The processions of the divine Persons are the cause of creation as above explained Reply Obj two As the divine nature although common to the three Persons still belongs to them in a kind of order inasmuch as the Son receives the divine nature from the Father and the Holy Ghost from both so also likewise the power of creation whilst common to the three Persons belongs to them in a kind of order For the Son receives it from the Father and the Holy Ghost from both Hence to be the Creator is attributed to the Father as to Him Who does not receive the power of creation from another And of the Son it is said John one three Through Him all things were made inasmuch as He has the same power but from another for this preposition through usually denotes a mediate cause or a principle from a principle But to the Holy Ghost Who has the same power from both is attributed that by His sway He governs and quickens what is created by the Father through the Son Again the reason for this particular appropriation may be taken from the common notion of the appropriation of the essential attributes For as above stated Q thirty nine A eight ad three to the Father is appropriated power which is chiefly shown in creation and therefore it is attributed to Him to be the Creator To the Son is appropriated wisdom through which the intellectual agent acts and therefore it is said Through Whom all things were made And to the Holy Ghost is appropriated goodness to which belong both government which brings things to their proper end and the giving of life for life consists in a certain interior movement and the first mover is the end and goodness Reply Obj three Although every effect of God proceeds from each attribute each effect is reduced to that attribute with which it is naturally connected thus the order of things is reduced to wisdom and the justification of the sinner to mercy and goodness poured out super abundantly But creation which is the production of the very substance of a thing is reduced to power SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q forty five Art seven Whether in Creatures Is Necessarily Found a Trace of the Trinity Objection one It would seem that in creatures there is not necessarily found a trace of the Trinity For anything can be traced through its traces But the trinity of persons cannot be traced from the creatures as was above stated Q thirty two A one Therefore there is no trace of the Trinity in creatures Obj two Further whatever is in creatures is created Therefore if the trace of the Trinity is found in creatures according to some of their properties and if everything created has a trace of the Trinity it follows that we can find a trace of the Trinity in each of these properties and so on to infinitude Obj three Further the effect represents only its own cause But the causality of creatures belongs to the common nature and not to the relations whereby the Persons are distinguished and numbered Therefore in the creature is to be found a trace not of the Trinity but of the unity of essence On the contrary Augustine says De Trin vi ten that the trace of the Trinity appears in creatures I answer that Every effect in some degree represents its cause but diversely For some effects represent only the causality of the cause but not its form as smoke represents fire Such a representation is called a trace for a trace shows that someone has passed by but not who it is Other effects represent the cause as regards the similitude of its form as fire generated represents fire generating and a statue of Mercury represents Mercury and this is called the representation of image Now the processions of the divine Persons are referred to the acts of intellect and will as was said above Q twenty seven For the Son proceeds as the word of the intellect and the Holy Ghost proceeds as love of the will Therefore in rational creatures possessing intellect and will there is found the representation of the Trinity by way of image inasmuch as there is found in them the word conceived and the love proceeding But in all creatures there is found the trace of the Trinity inasmuch as in every creature are found some things which are necessarily reduced to the divine Persons as to their cause For every creature subsists in its own being and has a form whereby it is determined to a species and has relation to something else Therefore as it is a created substance it represents the cause and principle and so in that manner it shows the Person of the Father Who is the principle from no principle According as it has a form and species it represents the Word as the form of the thing made by art is from the conception of the craftsman According as it has relation of order it represents the Holy Ghost inasmuch as He is love because the order of the effect to something else is from the will of the Creator And therefore Augustine says De Trin vi ten that the trace of the Trinity is found in every creature according as it is one individual and according as it is formed by a species and according as it has a certain relation of order And to these also are reduced those three number weight and measure mentioned in the Book of Wisdom nine twenty one For measure refers to the substance of the thing limited by its principles number refers to the species weight refers to the order And to these three are reduced the other three mentioned by Augustine De Nat Boni iii mode species and order and also those he mentions QQ eighty three qu eighteen that which exists whereby it is distinguished whereby it agrees For a thing exists by its substance is distinct by its form and agrees by its order Other similar expressions may be easily reduced to the above Reply Obj one The representation of the trace is to be referred to the appropriations in which manner we are able to arrive at a knowledge of the trinity of the divine persons from creatures as we have said Q thirty two A one Reply Obj two A creature properly speaking is a thing self subsisting and in such are the three above mentioned things to be found Nor is it necessary that these three things should be found in all that exists in the creature but only to a subsisting being is the trace ascribed in regard to those three things Reply Obj three The processions of the persons are also in some way the cause and type of creation as appears from the above A six EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q forty five Art eight Whether Creation Is Mingled with Works of Nature and Art Objection one It would seem that creation is mingled in works of nature and art For in every operation of nature and art some form is produced But it is not produced from anything since matter has no part in it Therefore it is produced from nothing and thus in every operation of nature and art there is creation Obj two Further the effect is not more powerful than its cause But in natural things the only agent is the accidental form which is an active or a passive form Therefore the substantial form is not produced by the operation of nature and therefore it must be produced by creation Obj three Further in nature like begets like But some things are found generated in nature by a thing unlike to them as is evident in animals generated through putrefaction Therefore the form of these is not from nature but by creation and the same reason applies to other things Obj four Further what is not created is not a creature If therefore in nature s productions there were not creation it would follow that nature s productions are not creatures which is heretical On the contrary Augustine Super general v sixty one thousand four hundred fifteen distinguishes the work of propagation which is a work of nature from the work of creation I answer that The doubt on this subject arises from the forms which some said do not come into existence by the action of nature but previously exist in matter for they asserted that forms are latent This arose from ignorance concerning matter and from not knowing how to distinguish between potentiality and act For because forms pre exist in matter in potentiality they asserted that they pre exist simply Others however said that the forms were given or caused by a separate agent by way of creation and accordingly that to each operation of nature is joined creation But this opinion arose from ignorance concerning form For they failed to consider that the form of the natural body is not subsisting but is that by which a thing is And therefore since to be made and to be created belong properly to a subsisting thing alone as shown above A four it does not belong to forms to be made or to be created but to be concreated What indeed is properly made by the natural agent is the composite which is made from matter Hence in the works of nature creation does not enter but is presupposed to the work of nature Reply Obj one Forms begin to be actual when the composite things are made not as though they were made directly but only indirectly Reply Obj two The active qualities in nature act by virtue of substantial forms and therefore the natural agent not only produces its like according to quality but according to species Reply Obj three For the generation of imperfect animals a universal agent suffices and this is to be found in the celestial power to which they are assimilated not in species but according to a kind of analogy Nor is it necessary to say that their forms are created by a separate agent However for the generation of perfect animals the universal agent does not suffice but a proper agent is required in the shape of a univocal generator Reply Obj four The operation of nature takes place only on the presupposition of created principles and thus the products of nature are called creatures QUESTION forty six OF THE BEGINNING OF THE DURATION OF CREATURES In Three Articles Next must be considered the beginning of the duration of creatures about which there are three points for treatment one Whether creatures always existed two Whether that they began to exist is an article of Faith three How God is said to have created heaven and earth in the beginning FIRST ARTICLE I Q forty six Art one Whether the Universe of Creatures Always Existed Objection one It would seem that the universe of creatures called the world had no beginning but existed from eternity For everything which begins to exist is a possible being before it exists otherwise it would be impossible for it to exist If therefore the world began to exist it was a possible being before it began to exist But possible being is matter which is in potentiality to existence which results from a form and to non existence which results from privation of form If therefore the world began to exist matter must have existed before the world But matter cannot exist without form while the matter of the world with its form is the world Therefore the world existed before it began to exist which is impossible Obj two Further nothing which has power to be always sometimes is and sometimes is not because so far as the power of a thing extends so long it exists But every incorruptible thing has power to be always for its power does not extend to any determinate time Therefore no incorruptible thing sometimes is and sometimes is not but everything which has a beginning at some time is and at some time is not therefore no incorruptible thing begins to exist But there are many incorruptible things in the world as the celestial bodies and all intellectual substances Therefore the world did not begin to exist Obj three Further what is unbegotten has no beginning But the Philosopher Phys i text eighty two proves that matter is unbegotten and also De Coelo et Mundo i text twenty that the heaven is unbegotten Therefore the universe did not begin to exist Obj four Further a vacuum is where there is not a body but there might be But if the world began to exist there was first no body where the body of the world now is and yet it could be there otherwise it would not be there now Therefore before the world there was a vacuum which is impossible Obj five Further nothing begins anew to be moved except through either the mover or the thing moved being otherwise than it was before But what is otherwise now than it was before is moved Therefore before every new movement there was a previous movement Therefore movement always was and therefore also the thing moved always was because movement is only in a movable thing Obj six Further every mover is either natural or voluntary But neither begins to move except by some pre existing movement For nature always moves in the same manner hence unless some change precede either in the nature of the mover or in the movable thing there cannot arise from the natural mover a movement which was not there before And the will without itself being changed puts off doing what it proposes to do but this can be only by some imagined change at least on the part of time Thus he who wills to make a house tomorrow and not today awaits something which will be tomorrow but is not today and at least awaits for today to pass and for tomorrow to come and this cannot be without change because time is the measure of movement Therefore it remains that before every new movement there was a previous movement and so the same conclusion follows as before Obj seven Further whatever is always in its beginning and always in its end cannot cease and cannot begin because what begins is not in its end and what ceases is not in its beginning But time always is in its beginning and end because there is no time except now which is the end of the past and the beginning of the future Therefore time cannot begin or end and consequently neither can movement the measure of what is time Obj eight Further God is before the world either in the order of nature only or also by duration If in the order of nature only therefore since God is eternal the world also is eternal But if God is prior by duration since what is prior and posterior in duration constitutes time it follows that time existed before the world which is impossible Obj nine Further if there is a sufficient cause there is an effect for a cause to which there is no effect is an imperfect cause requiring something else to make the effect follow But God is the sufficient cause of the world being the final cause by reason of His goodness the exemplar cause by reason of His wisdom and the efficient cause by reason of His power as appears from the above Q forty four AA two three four Since therefore God is eternal the world is also eternal Obj ten Further eternal action postulates an eternal effect But the action of God is His substance which is eternal Therefore the world is eternal On the contrary It is said John seventeen five Glorify Me O Father with Thyself with the glory which I had before the world was and Prov eight twenty two The Lord possessed Me in the beginning of His ways before He made anything from the beginning I answer that Nothing except God can be eternal And this statement is far from impossible to uphold for it has been shown above Q nineteen A four that the will of God is the cause of things Therefore things are necessary according as it is necessary for God to will them since the necessity of the effect depends on the necessity of the cause Metaph v text six Now it was shown above Q nineteen A three that absolutely speaking it is not necessary that God should will anything except Himself It is not therefore necessary for God to will that the world should always exist but the world exists forasmuch as God wills it to exist since the being of the world depends on the will of God as on its cause It is not therefore necessary for the world to be always and hence it cannot be proved by demonstration Nor are Aristotle s reasons Phys viii simply but relatively demonstrative viz in order to contradict the reasons of some of the ancients who asserted that the world began to exist in some quite impossible manner This appears in three ways Firstly because both in Phys viii and in De Coelo i text one hundred one he premises some opinions as those of Anaxagoras Empedocles and Plato and brings forward reasons to refute them Secondly because wherever he speaks of this subject he quotes the testimony of the ancients which is not the way of a demonstrator but of one persuading of what is probable Thirdly because he expressly says Topic i nine that there are dialectical problems about which we have nothing to say from reason as whether the world is eternal Reply Obj one Before the world existed it was possible for the world to be not indeed according to a passive power which is matter but according to the active power of God and also according as a thing is called absolutely possible not in relation to any power but from the sole habitude of the terms which are not repugnant to each other in which sense possible is opposed to impossible as appears from the Philosopher Metaph v text seventeen Reply Obj two Whatever has power always to be from the fact of having that power cannot sometimes be and sometimes not be but before it received that power it did not exist Hence this reason which is given by Aristotle De Coelo i text one hundred twenty does not prove simply that incorruptible things never began to exist but that they did not begin by the natural mode whereby things generated and corruptible begin Reply Obj three Aristotle Phys i text eighty two proves that matter is unbegotten from the fact that it has not a subject from which to derive its existence and De Coelo et Mundo i text twenty he proves that heaven is ungenerated forasmuch as it has no contrary from which to be generated Hence it appears that no conclusion follows either way except that matter and heaven did not begin by generation as some said especially about heaven But we say that matter and heaven were produced into being by creation as appears above Q forty four A one ad two Reply Obj four The notion of a vacuum is not only in which is nothing but also implies a space capable of holding a body and in which there is not a body as appears from Aristotle Phys iv text sixty Whereas we hold that there was no place or space before the world was Reply Obj five The first mover was always in the same state but the first movable thing was not always so because it began to be whereas hitherto it was not This however was not through change but by creation which is not change as said above Q forty five A two ad two Hence it is evident that this reason which Aristotle gives Phys viii is valid against those who admitted the existence of eternal movable things but not eternal movement as appears from the opinions of Anaxagoras and Empedocles But we hold that from the moment that movable things began to exist movement also existed Reply Obj six The first agent is a voluntary agent And although He had the eternal will to produce some effect yet He did not produce an eternal effect Nor is it necessary for some change to be presupposed not even on account of imaginary time For we must take into consideration the difference between a particular agent that presupposes something and produces something else and the universal agent who produces the whole The particular agent produces the form and presupposes the matter and hence it is necessary that it introduce the form in due proportion into a suitable matter Hence it is correct to say that it introduces the form into such matter and not into another on account of the different kinds of matter But it is not correct to say so of God Who produces form and matter together whereas it is correct to say of Him that He produces matter fitting to the form and to the end Now a particular agent presupposes time just as it presupposes matter Hence it is correctly described as acting in time after and not in time before according to an imaginary succession of time after time But the universal agent who produces the thing and time also is not correctly described as acting now and not before according to an imaginary succession of time succeeding time as if time were presupposed to His action but He must be considered as giving time to His effect as much as and when He willed and according to what was fitting to demonstrate His power For the world leads more evidently to the knowledge of the divine creating power if it was not always than if it had always been since everything which was not always manifestly has a cause whereas this is not so manifest of what always was Reply Obj seven As is stated Phys iv text ninety nine before and after belong to time according as they are in movement Hence beginning and end in time must be taken in the same way as in movement Now granted the eternity of movement it is necessary that any given moment in movement be a beginning and an end of movement which need not be if movement be a beginning The same applies to the now of time Thus it appears that the idea of the instant now as being always the beginning and end of time presupposes the eternity of time and movement Hence Aristotle brings forward this reason Phys viii text ten against those who asserted the eternity of time but denied the eternity of movement Reply Obj eight God is prior to the world by priority of duration But the word prior signifies priority not of time but of eternity Or we may say that it signifies the eternity of imaginary time and not of time really existing thus when we say that above heaven there is nothing the word above signifies only an imaginary place according as it is possible to imagine other dimensions beyond those of the heavenly body Reply Obj nine As the effect follows from the cause that acts by nature according to the mode of its form so likewise it follows from the voluntary agent according to the form preconceived and determined by the agent as appears from what was said above Q nineteen A four Q forty one A two Therefore although God was from eternity the sufficient cause of the world we should not say that the world was produced by Him except as preordained by His will that is that it should have being after not being in order more manifestly to declare its author Reply Obj ten Given the action the effect follows according to the requirement of the form which is the principle of action But in agents acting by will what is conceived and preordained is to be taken as the form which is the principle of action Therefore from the eternal action of God an eternal effect did not follow but such an effect as God willed an effect to wit which has being after not being SECOND ARTICLE I Q forty six Art two Whether It Is an Article of Faith That the World Began Objection one It would seem that it is not an article of faith but a demonstrable conclusion that the world began For everything that is made has a beginning of its duration But it can be proved demonstratively that God is the effective cause of the world indeed this is asserted by the more approved philosophers Therefore it can be demonstratively proved that the world began Obj two Further if it is necessary to say that the world was made by God it must therefore have been made from nothing or from something But it was not made from something otherwise the matter of the world would have preceded the world against which are the arguments of Aristotle De Coelo i who held that heaven was ungenerated Therefore it must be said that the world was made from nothing and thus it has being after not being Therefore it must have begun Obj three Further everything which works by intellect works from some principle as appears in all kinds of craftsmen But God acts by intellect therefore His work has a principle The world therefore which is His effect did not always exist Obj four Further it appears manifestly that certain arts have developed and certain countries have begun to be inhabited at some fixed time But this would not be the case if the world had been always Therefore it is manifest that the world did not always exist Obj five Further it is certain that nothing can be equal to God But if the world had always been it would be equal to God in duration Therefore it is certain that the world did not always exist Obj six Further if the world always was the consequence is that infinite days preceded this present day But it is impossible to pass through an infinite medium Therefore we should never have arrived at this present day which is manifestly false Obj seven Further if the world was eternal generation also was eternal Therefore one man was begotten of another in an infinite series But the father is the efficient cause of the son Phys ii text five Therefore in efficient causes there could be an infinite series which is disproved Metaph ii text five Obj eight Further if the world and generation always were there have been an infinite number of men But man s soul is immortal therefore an infinite number of human souls would actually now exist which is impossible Therefore it can be known with certainty that the world began and not only is it known by faith On the contrary The articles of faith cannot be proved demonstratively because faith is of things that appear not Heb eleven one But that God is the Creator of the world hence that the world began is an article of faith for we say I believe in one God et cetera And again Gregory says Hom i in Ezech that Moses prophesied of the past saying In the beginning God created heaven and earth in which words the newness of the world is stated Therefore the newness of the world is known only by revelation and therefore it cannot be proved demonstratively I answer that By faith alone do we hold and by no demonstration can it be proved that the world did not always exist as was said above of the mystery of the Trinity Q thirty two A one The reason of this is that the newness of the world cannot be demonstrated on the part of the world itself For the principle of demonstration is the essence of a thing Now everything according to its species is abstracted from here and now whence it is said that universals are everywhere and always Hence it cannot be demonstrated that man or heaven or a stone were not always Likewise neither can it be demonstrated on the part of the efficient cause which acts by will For the will of God cannot be investigated by reason except as regards those things which God must will of necessity and what He wills about creatures is not among these as was said above Q nineteen A three But the divine will can be manifested by revelation on which faith rests Hence that the world began to exist is an object of faith but not of demonstration or science And it is useful to consider this lest anyone presuming to demonstrate what is of faith should bring forward reasons that are not cogent so as to give occasion to unbelievers to laugh thinking that on such grounds we believe things that are of faith Reply Obj one As Augustine says De Civ Dei xi four the opinion of philosophers who asserted the eternity of the world was twofold For some said that the substance of the world was not from God which is an intolerable error and therefore it is refuted by proofs that are cogent Some however said that the world was eternal although made by God For they hold that the world has a beginning not of time but of creation so that in a certain hardly intelligible way it was always made And they try to explain their meaning thus De Civ Dei x thirty one for as if the foot were always in the dust from eternity there would always be a footprint which without doubt was caused by him who trod on it so also the world always was because its Maker always existed To understand this we must consider that the efficient cause which acts by motion of necessity precedes its effect in time because the effect is only in the end of the action and every agent must be the principle of action But if the action is instantaneous and not successive it is not necessary for the maker to be prior to the thing made in duration as appears in the case of illumination Hence they say that it does not follow necessarily if God is the active cause of the world that He should be prior to the world in duration because creation by which He produced the world is not a successive change as was said above Q forty five A two Reply Obj two Those who would say that the world was eternal would say that the world was made by God from nothing not that it was made after nothing according to what we understand by the word creation but that it was not made from anything and so also some of them do not reject the word creation as appears from Avicenna Metaph ix text four Reply Obj three This is the argument of Anaxagoras as quoted in Phys viii text fifteen But it does not lead to a necessary conclusion except as to that intellect which deliberates in order to find out what should be done which is like movement Such is the human intellect but not the divine intellect Q fourteen AA seven twelve Reply Obj four Those who hold the eternity of the world hold that some region was changed an infinite number of times from being uninhabitable to being inhabitable and vice versa and likewise they hold that the arts by reason of various corruptions and accidents were subject to an infinite variety of advance and decay Hence Aristotle says Meteor i that it is absurd from such particular changes to hold the opinion of the newness of the whole world Reply Obj five Even supposing that the world always was it would not be equal to God in eternity as Boethius says De Consol v six because the divine Being is all being simultaneously without succession but with the world it is otherwise Reply Obj six Passage is always understood as being from term to term Whatever bygone day we choose from it to the present day there is a finite number of days which can be passed through The objection is founded on the idea that given two extremes there is an infinite number of mean terms Reply Obj seven In efficient causes it is impossible to proceed to infinity per se thus there cannot be an infinite number of causes that are per se required for a certain effect for instance that a stone be moved by a stick the stick by the hand and so on to infinity But it is not impossible to proceed to infinity accidentally as regards efficient causes for instance if all the causes thus infinitely multiplied should have the order of only one cause their multiplication being accidental as an artificer acts by means of many hammers accidentally because one after the other may be broken It is accidental therefore that one particular hammer acts after the action of another and likewise it is accidental to this particular man as generator to be generated by another man for he generates as a man and not as the son of another man For all men generating hold one grade in efficient causes viz the grade of a particular generator Hence it is not impossible for a man to be generated by man to infinity but such a thing would be impossible if the generation of this man depended upon this man and on an elementary body and on the sun and so on to infinity Reply Obj eight Those who hold the eternity of the world evade this reason in many ways For some do not think it impossible for there to be an actual infinity of souls as appears from the Metaphysics of Algazel who says that such a thing is an accidental infinity But this was disproved above Q seven A four Some say that the soul is corrupted with the body And some say that of all souls only one will remain But others as Augustine says Serm xiv De Temp four five De Haeres haeres forty six De Civ Dei xii thirteen asserted on this account a circuit of souls viz that souls separated from their bodies return again thither after a course of time a fuller consideration of which matters will be given later Q seventy five A two Q one hundred eighteen A six But be it noted that this argument considers only a particular case Hence one might say that the world was eternal or at least some creature as an angel but not man But we are considering the question in general as to whether any creature can exist from eternity THIRD ARTICLE I Q forty six Art three Whether the Creation of Things Was in the Beginning of Time Objection one It would seem that the creation of things was not in the beginning of time For whatever is not in time is not of any part of time But the creation of things was not in time for by the creation the substance of things was brought into being and time does not measure the substance of things and especially of incorporeal things Therefore creation was not in the beginning of time Obj two Further the Philosopher proves Phys vi text forty that everything which is made was being made and so to be made implies a before and after But in the beginning of time since it is indivisible there is no before and after Therefore since to be created is a kind of being made it appears that things were not created in the beginning of time Obj three Further even time itself is created But time cannot be created in the beginning of time since time is divisible and the beginning of time is indivisible Therefore the creation of things was not in the beginning of time On the contrary It is said general one one In the beginning God created heaven and earth I answer that The words of Genesis In the beginning God created heaven and earth are expounded in a threefold sense in order to exclude three errors For some said that the world always was and that time had no beginning and to exclude this the words In the beginning are expounded viz of time And some said that there are two principles of creation one of good things and the other of evil things against which In the beginning is expounded in the Son For as the efficient principle is appropriated to the Father by reason of power so the exemplar principle is appropriated to the Son by reason of wisdom in order that as it is said Ps one hundred three twenty four Thou hast made all things in wisdom it may be understood that God made all things in the beginning that is in the Son according to the word of the Apostle colonel one sixteen In Him viz the Son were created all things But others said that corporeal things were created by God through the medium of spiritual creation and to exclude this it is expounded thus In the beginning i e before all things God created heaven and earth For four things are stated to be created together viz the empyrean heaven corporeal matter by which is meant the earth time and the angelic nature Reply Obj one Things are said to be created in the beginning of time not as if the beginning of time were a measure of creation but because together with time heaven and earth were created Reply Obj two This saying of the Philosopher is understood of being made by means of movement or as the term of movement Because since in every movement there is before and after before any one point in a given movement that is whilst anything is in the process of being moved and made there is a before and also an after because what is in the beginning of movement or in its term is not in being moved But creation is neither movement nor the term of movement as was said above Q forty five AA two three Hence a thing is created in such a way that it was not being created before Reply Obj three Nothing is made except as it exists But nothing exists of time except now Hence time cannot be made except according to some now not because in the first now is time but because from it time begins QUESTION forty seven OF THE DISTINCTION OF THINGS IN GENERAL In Three Articles After considering the production of creatures we come to the consideration of the distinction of things This consideration will be threefold first of the distinction of things in general secondly of the distinction of good and evil thirdly of the distinction of the spiritual and corporeal creature 
5876_10347_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Under the first head there are three points of inquiry 
none	none	one The multitude or distinction of things two Their inequality three The unity of the world FIRST ARTICLE I Q forty seven Art one Whether the Multitude and Distinction of Things Come from God Objection one It would seem that the multitude and distinction of things does not come from God For one naturally always makes one But God is supremely one as appears from what precedes Q eleven A four Therefore He produces but one effect Obj two Further the representation is assimilated to its exemplar But God is the exemplar cause of His effect as was said above Q forty four A three Therefore as God is one His effect is one only and not diverse Obj three Further the means are proportional to the end But the end of the creation is one viz the divine goodness as was shown above Q forty four A four Therefore the effect of God is but one On the contrary It is said general one four seven that God divided the light from the darkness and divided waters from waters Therefore the distinction and multitude of things is from God I answer that The distinction of things has been ascribed to many causes For some attributed the distinction to matter either by itself or with the agent Democritus for instance and all the ancient natural philosophers who admitted no cause but matter attributed it to matter alone and in their opinion the distinction of things comes from chance according to the movement of matter Anaxagoras however attributed the distinction and multitude of things to matter and to the agent together and he said that the intellect distinguishes things by extracting what is mixed up in matter But this cannot stand for two reasons First because as was shown above Q forty four A two even matter itself was created by God Hence we must reduce whatever distinction comes from matter to a higher cause Secondly because matter is for the sake of the form and not the form for the matter and the distinction of things comes from their proper forms Therefore the distinction of things is not on account of the matter but rather on the contrary created matter is formless in order that it may be accommodated to different forms Others have attributed the distinction of things to secondary agents as did Avicenna who said that God by understanding Himself produced the first intelligence in which forasmuch as it was not its own being there is necessarily composition of potentiality and act as will appear later Q fifty A three And so the first intelligence inasmuch as it understood the first cause produced the second intelligence and in so far as it understood itself as in potentiality it produced the heavenly body which causes movement and inasmuch as it understood itself as having actuality it produced the soul of the heavens But this opinion cannot stand for two reasons First because it was shown above Q forty five A five that to create belongs to God alone and hence what can be caused only by creation is produced by God alone viz all those things which are not subject to generation and corruption Secondly because according to this opinion the universality of things would not proceed from the intention of the first agent but from the concurrence of many active causes and such an effect we can describe only as being produced by chance Therefore the perfection of the universe which consists of the diversity of things would thus be a thing of chance which is impossible Hence we must say that the distinction and multitude of things come from the intention of the first agent who is God For He brought things into being in order that His goodness might be communicated to creatures and be represented by them and because His goodness could not be adequately represented by one creature alone He produced many and diverse creatures that what was wanting to one in the representation of the divine goodness might be supplied by another For goodness which in God is simple and uniform in creatures is manifold and divided and hence the whole universe together participates the divine goodness more perfectly and represents it better than any single creature whatever And because the divine wisdom is the cause of the distinction of things therefore Moses said that things are made distinct by the word of God which is the concept of His wisdom and this is what we read in general one three four God said Be light made And He divided the light from the darkness Reply Obj one The natural agent acts by the form which makes it what it is and which is only one in one thing and therefore its effect is one only But the voluntary agent such as God is as was shown above Q nineteen A four acts by an intellectual form Since therefore it is not against God s unity and simplicity to understand many things as was shown above Q fifteen A two it follows that although He is one He can make many things Reply Obj two This reason would apply to the representation which reflects the exemplar perfectly and which is multiplied by reason of matter only hence the uncreated image which is perfect is only one But no creature represents the first exemplar perfectly which is the divine essence and therefore it can be represented by many things Still according as ideas are called exemplars the plurality of ideas corresponds in the divine mind to the plurality of things Reply Obj three In speculative things the medium of demonstration which demonstrates the conclusion perfectly is one only whereas probable means of proof are many Likewise when operation is concerned if the means be equal so to speak to the end one only is sufficient But the creature is not such a means to its end which is God and hence the multiplication of creatures is necessary SECOND ARTICLE I Q forty seven Art two Whether the Inequality of Things Is from God Objection one It would seem that the inequality of things is not from God For it belongs to the best to produce the best But among things that are best one is not greater than another Therefore it belongs to God Who is the Best to make all things equal Obj two Further equality is the effect of unity Metaph v text twenty But God is one Therefore He has made all things equal Obj three Further it is the part of justice to give unequal to unequal things But God is just in all His works Since therefore no inequality of things is presupposed to the operation whereby He gives being to things it seems that He has made all things equal On the contrary It is said Ecclus thirty three seven Why does one day excel another and one light another and one year another year one sun another sun Vulg when all come of the sun By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished I answer that When Origen wished to refute those who said that the distinction of things arose from the contrary principles of good and evil he said that in the beginning all things were created equal by God For he asserted that God first created only the rational creatures and all equal and that inequality arose in them from free will some being turned to God more and some less and others turned more and others less away from God And so those rational creatures which were turned to God by free will were promoted to the order of angels according to the diversity of merits And those who were turned away from God were bound down to bodies according to the diversity of their sin and he said this was the cause of the creation and diversity of bodies But according to this opinion it would follow that the universality of bodily creatures would not be the effect of the goodness of God as communicated to creatures but it would be for the sake of the punishment of sin which is contrary to what is said God saw all the things that He had made and they were very good general one thirty one And as Augustine says De Civ Dei ii three What can be more foolish than to say that the divine Architect provided this one sun for the one world not to be an ornament to its beauty nor for the benefit of corporeal things but that it happened through the sin of one soul so that if a hundred souls had sinned there would be a hundred suns in the world Therefore it must be said that as the wisdom of God is the cause of the distinction of things so the same wisdom is the cause of their inequality This may be explained as follows A twofold distinction is found in things one is a formal distinction as regards things differing specifically the other is a material distinction as regards things differing numerically only And as the matter is on account of the form material distinction exists for the sake of the formal distinction Hence we see that in incorruptible things there is only one individual of each species forasmuch as the species is sufficiently preserved in the one whereas in things generated and corruptible there are many individuals of one species for the preservation of the species Whence it appears that formal distinction is of greater consequence than material Now formal distinction always requires inequality because as the Philosopher says Metaph viii ten the forms of things are like numbers in which species vary by addition or subtraction of unity Hence in natural things species seem to be arranged in degrees as the mixed things are more perfect than the elements and plants than minerals and animals than plants and men than other animals and in each of these one species is more perfect than others Therefore as the divine wisdom is the cause of the distinction of things for the sake of the perfection of the universe so it is the cause of inequality For the universe would not be perfect if only one grade of goodness were found in things Reply Obj one It is part of the best agent to produce an effect which is best in its entirety but this does not mean that He makes every part of the whole the best absolutely but in proportion to the whole in the case of an animal for instance its goodness would be taken away if every part of it had the dignity of an eye Thus therefore God also made the universe to be best as a whole according to the mode of a creature whereas He did not make each single creature best but one better than another And therefore we find it said of each creature God saw the light that it was good general one four and in like manner of each one of the rest But of all together it is said God saw all the things that He had made and they were very good general one thirty one Reply Obj two The first effect of unity is equality and then comes multiplicity and therefore from the Father to Whom according to Augustine De Doctr Christ i five is appropriated unity the Son proceeds to Whom is appropriated equality and then from Him the creature proceeds to which belongs inequality but nevertheless even creatures share in a certain equality namely of proportion Reply Obj three This is the argument that persuaded Origen but it holds only as regards the distribution of rewards the inequality of which is due to unequal merits But in the constitution of things there is no inequality of parts through any preceding inequality either of merits or of the disposition of the matter but inequality comes from the perfection of the whole This appears also in works done by art for the roof of a house differs from the foundation not because it is made of other material but in order that the house may be made perfect of different parts the artificer seeks different material indeed he would make such material if he could THIRD ARTICLE I Q forty seven Art three Whether There Is Only One World Objection one It would seem that there is not only one world but many Because as Augustine says QQ eighty three qu forty six it is unfitting to say that God has created things without a reason But for the same reason He created one He could create many since His power is not limited to the creation of one world but rather it is infinite as was shown above Q twenty five A two Therefore God has produced many worlds Obj two Further nature does what is best and much more does God But it is better for there to be many worlds than one because many good things are better than a few Therefore many worlds have been made by God Obj three Further everything which has a form in matter can be multiplied in number the species remaining the same because multiplication in number comes from matter But the world has a form in matter Thus as when I say man I mean the form and when I say this man I mean the form in matter so when we say world the form is signified and when we say this world the form in the matter is signified Therefore there is nothing to prevent the existence of many worlds On the contrary It is said John one ten The world was made by Him where the world is named as one as if only one existed I answer that The very order of things created by God shows the unity of the world For this world is called one by the unity of order whereby some things are ordered to others But whatever things come from God have relation of order to each other and to God Himself as shown above Q eleven A three Q twenty one A one Hence it must be that all things should belong to one world Therefore those only can assert that many worlds exist who do not acknowledge any ordaining wisdom but rather believe in chance as Democritus who said that this world besides an infinite number of other worlds was made from a casual concourse of atoms Reply Obj one This reason proves that the world is one because all things must be arranged in one order and to one end Therefore from the unity of order in things Aristotle infers Metaph xii text fifty two the unity of God governing all and Plato Tim from the unity of the exemplar proves the unity of the world as the thing designed Reply Obj two No agent intends material plurality as the end forasmuch as material multitude has no certain limit but of itself tends to infinity and the infinite is opposed to the notion of end Now when it is said that many worlds are better than one this has reference to material order But the best in this sense is not the intention of the divine agent forasmuch as for the same reason it might be said that if He had made two worlds it would be better if He had made three and so on to infinite Reply Obj three The world is composed of the whole of its matter For it is not possible for there to be another earth than this one since every earth would naturally be carried to this central one wherever it was The same applies to the other bodies which are part of the world QUESTION forty eight THE DISTINCTION OF THINGS IN PARTICULAR In Six Articles We must now consider the distinction of things in particular and firstly the distinction of good and evil and then the distinction of the spiritual and corporeal creatures Concerning the first we inquire into evil and its cause Concerning evil six points are to be considered one Whether evil is a nature two Whether evil is found in things three Whether good is the subject of evil four Whether evil totally corrupts good five The division of evil into pain and fault six Whether pain or fault has more the nature of evil FIRST ARTICLE I Q forty eight Art one Whether Evil Is a Nature Objection one It would seem that evil is a nature For every genus is a nature But evil is a genus for the Philosopher says Praedic x that good and evil are not in a genus but are genera of other things Therefore evil is a nature Obj two Further every difference which constitutes a species is a nature But evil is a difference constituting a species of morality for a bad habit differs in species from a good habit as liberality from illiberality Therefore evil signifies a nature Obj three Further each extreme of two contraries is a nature But evil and good are not opposed as privation and habit but as contraries as the Philosopher shows Praedic x by the fact that between good and evil there is a medium and from evil there can be a return to good Therefore evil signifies a nature Obj four Further what is not acts not But evil acts for it corrupts good Therefore evil is a being and a nature Obj five Further nothing belongs to the perfection of the universe except what is a being and a nature But evil belongs to the perfection of the universe of things for Augustine says Enchir ten eleven that the admirable beauty of the universe is made up of all things In which even what is called evil well ordered and in its place is the eminent commendation of what is good Therefore evil is a nature On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom iv Evil is neither a being nor a good I answer that One opposite is known through the other as darkness is known through light Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good Now we have said above that good is everything appetible and thus since every nature desires its own being and its own perfection it must be said also that the being and the perfection of any nature is good Hence it cannot be that evil signifies being or any form or nature Therefore it must be that by the name of evil is signified the absence of good And this is what is meant by saying that evil is neither a being nor a good For since being as such is good the absence of one implies the absence of the other Reply Obj one Aristotle speaks there according to the opinion of Pythagoreans who thought that evil was a kind of nature and therefore they asserted the existence of the genus of good and evil For Aristotle especially in his logical works brings forward examples that in his time were probable in the opinion of some philosophers Or it may be said that as the Philosopher says Metaph iv text six the first kind of contrariety is habit and privation as being verified in all contraries since one contrary is always imperfect in relation to another as black in relation to white and bitter in relation to sweet And in this way good and evil are said to be genera not simply but in regard to contraries because as every form has the nature of good so every privation as such has the nature of evil Reply Obj two Good and evil are not constitutive differences except in morals which receive their species from the end which is the object of the will the source of all morality And because good has the nature of an end therefore good and evil are specific differences in moral things good in itself but evil as the absence of the due end Yet neither does the absence of the due end by itself constitute a moral species except as it is joined to the undue end just as we do not find the privation of the substantial form in natural things unless it is joined to another form Thus therefore the evil which is a constitutive difference in morals is a certain good joined to the privation of another good as the end proposed by the intemperate man is not the privation of the good of reason but the delight of sense without the order of reason Hence evil is not a constitutive difference as such but by reason of the good that is annexed Reply Obj three This appears from the above For the Philosopher speaks there of good and evil in morality Because in that respect between good and evil there is a medium as good is considered as something rightly ordered and evil as a thing not only out of right order but also as injurious to another Hence the Philosopher says Ethic iv i that a prodigal man is foolish but not evil And from this evil in morality there may be a return to good but not from any sort of evil for from blindness there is no return to sight although blindness is an evil Reply Obj four A thing is said to act in a threefold sense In one way formally as when we say that whiteness makes white and in that sense evil considered even as a privation is said to corrupt good forasmuch as it is itself a corruption or privation of good In another sense a thing is said to act effectively as when a painter makes a wall white Thirdly it is said in the sense of the final cause as the end is said to effect by moving the efficient cause But in these two ways evil does not effect anything of itself that is as a privation but by virtue of the good annexed to it For every action comes from some form and everything which is desired as an end is a perfection And therefore as Dionysius says Div Nom iv Evil does not act nor is it desired except by virtue of some good joined to it while of itself it is nothing definite and beside the scope of our will and intention Reply Obj five As was said above the parts of the universe are ordered to each other according as one acts on the other and according as one is the end and exemplar of the other But as was said above this can only happen to evil as joined to some good Hence evil neither belongs to the perfection of the universe nor does it come under the order of the same except accidentally that is by reason of some good joined to it SECOND ARTICLE I Q forty eight Art two Whether Evil Is Found in Things Objection one It would seem that evil is not found in things For whatever is found in things is either something or a privation of something that is a not being But Dionysius says Div Nom iv that evil is distant from existence and even more distant from non existence Therefore evil is not at all found in things Obj two Further being and thing are convertible If therefore evil is a being in things it follows that evil is a thing which is contrary to what has been said A one Obj three Further the white unmixed with black is the most white as the Philosopher says Topic iii four Therefore also the good unmixed with evil is the greater good But God makes always what is best much more than nature does Therefore in things made by God there is no evil On the contrary On the above assumptions all prohibitions and penalties would cease for they exist only for evils I answer that As was said above Q forty seven AA one two the perfection of the universe requires that there should be inequality in things so that every grade of goodness may be realized Now one grade of goodness is that of the good which cannot fail Another grade of goodness is that of the good which can fail in goodness and this grade is to be found in existence itself for some things there are which cannot lose their existence as incorruptible things while some there are which can lose it as things corruptible As therefore the perfection of the universe requires that there should be not only beings incorruptible but also corruptible beings so the perfection of the universe requires that there should be some which can fail in goodness and thence it follows that sometimes they do fail Now it is in this that evil consists namely in the fact that a thing fails in goodness Hence it is clear that evil is found in things as corruption also is found for corruption is itself an evil Reply Obj one Evil is distant both from simple being and from simple not being because it is neither a habit nor a pure negation but a privation Reply Obj two As the Philosopher says Metaph v text fourteen being is twofold In one way it is considered as signifying the entity of a thing as divisible by the ten predicaments and in that sense it is convertible with thing and thus no privation is a being and neither therefore is evil a being In another sense being conveys the truth of a proposition which unites together subject and attribute by a copula notified by this word is and in this sense being is what answers to the question Does it exist and thus we speak of blindness as being in the eye or of any other privation In this way even evil can be called a being Through ignorance of this distinction some considering that things may be evil or that evil is said to be in things believed that evil was a positive thing in itself Reply Obj three God and nature and any other agent make what is best in the whole but not what is best in every single part except in order to the whole as was said above Q forty seven A two And the whole itself which is the universe of creatures is all the better and more perfect if some things in it can fail in goodness and do sometimes fail God not preventing this This happens firstly because it belongs to Providence not to destroy but to save nature as Dionysius says Div Nom iv but it belongs to nature that what may fail should sometimes fail secondly because as Augustine says Enchir eleven God is so powerful that He can even make good out of evil Hence many good things would be taken away if God permitted no evil to exist for fire would not be generated if air was not corrupted nor would the life of a lion be preserved unless the ass were killed Neither would avenging justice nor the patience of a sufferer be praised if there were no injustice THIRD ARTICLE I Q forty eight Art three Whether Evil Is in Good As in Its Subject Objection one It would seem that evil is not in good as its subject For good is something that exists But Dionysius says Div Nom iv four that evil does not exist nor is it in that which exists Therefore evil is not in good as its subject Obj two Further evil is not a being whereas good is a being But non being does not require being as its subject Therefore neither does evil require good as its subject Obj three Further one contrary is not the subject of another But good and evil are contraries Therefore evil is not in good as in its subject Obj four Further the subject of whiteness is called white Therefore also the subject of evil is evil If therefore evil is in good as in its subject it follows that good is evil against what is said Isa five twenty Woe to you who call evil good and good evil On the contrary Augustine says Enchiridion fourteen that evil exists only in good I answer that As was said above A one evil imports the absence of good But not every absence of good is evil For absence of good can be taken in a privative and in a negative sense Absence of good taken negatively is not evil otherwise it would follow that what does not exist is evil and also that everything would be evil through not having the good belonging to something else for instance a man would be evil who had not the swiftness of the roe or the strength of a lion But the absence of good taken in a privative sense is an evil as for instance the privation of sight is called blindness Now the subject of privation and of form is one and the same viz being in potentiality whether it be being in absolute potentiality as primary matter which is the subject of the substantial form and of privation of the opposite form or whether it be being in relative potentiality and absolute actuality as in the case of a transparent body which is the subject both of darkness and light It is however manifest that the form which makes a thing actual is a perfection and a good and thus every actual being is a good and likewise every potential being as such is a good as having a relation to good For as it has being in potentiality so has it goodness in potentiality Therefore the subject of evil is good Reply Obj one Dionysius means that evil is not in existing things as a part or as a natural property of any existing thing Reply Obj two Not being understood negatively does not require a subject but privation is negation in a subject as the Philosopher says Metaph iv text four and such not being is an evil Reply Obj three Evil is not in the good opposed to it as in its subject but in some other good for the subject of blindness is not sight but animal Yet it appears as Augustine says Enchiridion thirteen that the rule of dialectics here fails where it is laid down that contraries cannot exist together But this is to be taken as referring to good and evil in general but not in reference to any particular good and evil For white and black sweet and bitter and the like contraries are only considered as contraries in a special sense because they exist in some determinate genus whereas good enters into every genus Hence one good can coexist with the privation of another good Reply Obj four The prophet invokes woe to those who say that good as such is evil But this does not follow from what is said above as is clear from the explanation given FOURTH ARTICLE I Q forty eight Art four Whether Evil Corrupts the Whole Good Objection one It would seem that evil corrupts the whole good For one contrary is wholly corrupted by another But good and evil are contraries Therefore evil corrupts the whole good Obj two Further Augustine says Enchiridion twelve that evil hurts inasmuch as it takes away good But good is all of a piece and uniform Therefore it is wholly taken away by evil Obj three Further evil as long as it lasts hurts and takes away good But that from which something is always being removed is at some time consumed unless it is infinite which cannot be said of any created good Therefore evil wholly consumes good On the contrary Augustine says Enchiridion twelve that evil cannot wholly consume good I answer that Evil cannot wholly consume good To prove this we must consider that good is threefold One kind of good is wholly destroyed by evil and this is the good opposed to evil as light is wholly destroyed by darkness and sight by blindness Another kind of good is neither wholly destroyed nor diminished by evil and that is the good which is the subject of evil for by darkness the substance of the air is not injured And there is also a kind of good which is diminished by evil but is not wholly taken away and this good is the aptitude of a subject to some actuality The diminution however of this kind of good is not to be considered by way of subtraction as diminution in quantity but rather by way of remission as diminution in qualities and forms The remission likewise of this habitude is to be taken as contrary to its intensity For this kind of aptitude receives its intensity by the dispositions whereby the matter is prepared for actuality which the more they are multiplied in the subject the more is it fitted to receive its perfection and form and on the contrary it receives its remission by contrary dispositions which the more they are multiplied in the matter and the more they are intensified the more is the potentiality remitted as regards the actuality Therefore if contrary dispositions cannot be multiplied and intensified to infinity but only to a certain limit neither is the aforesaid aptitude diminished or remitted infinitely as appears in the active and passive qualities of the elements for coldness and humidity whereby the aptitude of matter to the form of fire is diminished or remitted cannot be infinitely multiplied But if the contrary dispositions can be infinitely multiplied the aforesaid aptitude is also infinitely diminished or remitted yet nevertheless it is not wholly taken away because its root always remains which is the substance of the subject Thus if opaque bodies were interposed to infinity between the sun and the air the aptitude of the air to light would be infinitely diminished but still it would never be wholly removed while the air remained which in its very nature is transparent Likewise addition in sin can be made to infinitude whereby the aptitude of the soul to grace is more and more lessened and these sins indeed are like obstacles interposed between us and God according to Isa fifty nine two Our sins have divided between us and God Yet the aforesaid aptitude of the soul is not wholly taken away for it belongs to its very nature Reply Obj one The good which is opposed to evil is wholly taken away but other goods are not wholly removed as said above Reply Obj two The aforesaid aptitude is a medium between subject and act Hence where it touches act it is diminished by evil but where it touches the subject it remains as it was Therefore although good is like to itself yet on account of its relation to different things it is not wholly but only partially taken away Reply Obj three Some imagining that the diminution of this kind of good is like the diminution of quantity said that just as the continuous is infinitely divisible if the division be made in an ever same proportion for instance half of half or a third of a third so is it in the present case But this explanation does not avail here For when in a division we keep the same proportion we continue to subtract less and less for half of half is less than half of the whole But a second sin does not necessarily diminish the above mentioned aptitude less than a preceding sin but perchance either equally or more Therefore it must be said that although this aptitude is a finite thing still it may be so diminished infinitely not per se but accidentally according as the contrary dispositions are also increased infinitely as explained above FIFTH ARTICLE I Q forty eight Art five Whether Evil Is Adequately Divided into Pain and Fault Pain here means penalty such was its original signification being derived from poena In this sense we say Pain of death Pain of loss Pain of sense Ed Objection one It would seem that evil is not adequately divided into pain and fault For every defect is a kind of evil But in all creatures there is the defect of not being able to preserve their own existence which nevertheless is neither a pain nor a fault Therefore evil is inadequately divided into pain and fault Obj two Further in irrational creatures there is neither fault nor pain but nevertheless they have corruption and defect which are evils Therefore not every evil is a pain or a fault Obj three Further temptation is an evil but it is not a fault for temptation which involves no consent is not a sin but an occasion for the exercise of virtue as is said in a gloss on two Cor twelve not is it a pain because temptation precedes the fault and the pain follows afterwards Therefore evil is not sufficiently divided into pain and fault Obj four On the contrary It would seem that this division is superfluous for as Augustine says Enchiridion twelve a thing is evil because it hurts But whatever hurts is penal Therefore every evil comes under pain I answer that Evil as was said above A three is the privation of good which chiefly and of itself consists in perfection and act Act however is twofold first and second The first act is the form and integrity of a thing the second act is its operation Therefore evil also is twofold In one way it occurs by the subtraction of the form or of any part required for the integrity of the thing as blindness is an evil as also it is an evil to be wanting in any member of the body In another way evil exists by the withdrawal of the due operation either because it does not exist or because it has not its due mode and order But because good in itself is the object of the will evil which is the privation of good is found in a special way in rational creatures which have a will Therefore the evil which comes from the withdrawal of the form and integrity of the thing has the nature of a pain and especially so on the supposition that all things are subject to divine providence and justice as was shown above Q twenty two A two for it is of the very nature of a pain to be against the will But the evil which consists in the subtraction of the due operation in voluntary things has the nature of a fault for this is imputed to anyone as a fault to fail as regards perfect action of which he is master by the will Therefore every evil in voluntary things is to be looked upon as a pain or a fault Reply Obj one Because evil is the privation of good and not a mere negation as was said above A three therefore not every defect of good is an evil but the defect of the good which is naturally due For the want of sight is not an evil in a stone but it is an evil in an animal since it is against the nature of a stone to see So likewise it is against the nature of a creature to be preserved in existence by itself because existence and conservation come from one and the same source Hence this kind of defect is not an evil as regards a creature Reply Obj two Pain and fault do not divide evil absolutely considered but evil that is found in voluntary things Reply Obj three Temptation as importing provocation to evil is always an evil of fault in the tempter but in the one tempted it is not properly speaking a fault unless through the temptation some change is wrought in the one who is tempted for thus is the action of the agent in the patient And if the tempted is changed to evil by the tempter he falls into fault Reply Obj four In answer to the opposite argument it must be said that the very nature of pain includes the idea of injury to the agent in himself whereas the idea of fault includes the idea of injury to the agent in his operation and thus both are contained in evil as including the idea of injury SIXTH ARTICLE I Q forty eight Art six Whether Pain Has the Nature of Evil More Than Fault Has Objection one It would seem that pain has more of evil than fault For fault is to pain what merit is to reward But reward has more good than merit as its end Therefore pain has more evil in it than fault has Obj two Further that is the greater evil which is opposed to the greater good But pain as was said above A five is opposed to the good of the agent while fault is opposed to the good of the action Therefore since the agent is better than the action it seems that pain is worse than fault Obj three Further the privation of the end is a pain consisting in forfeiting the vision of God whereas the evil of fault is privation of the order to the end Therefore pain is a greater evil than fault On the contrary A wise workman chooses a less evil in order to prevent a greater as the surgeon cuts off a limb to save the whole body But divine wisdom inflicts pain to prevent fault Therefore fault is a greater evil than pain I answer that Fault has the nature of evil more than pain has not only more than pain of sense consisting in the privation of corporeal goods which kind of pain appeals to most men but also more than any kind of pain thus taking pain in its most general meaning so as to include privation of grace or glory There is a twofold reason for this The first is that one becomes evil by the evil of fault but not by the evil of pain as Dionysius says Div Nom iv To be punished is not an evil but it is an evil to be made worthy of punishment And this because since good absolutely considered consists in act and not in potentiality and the ultimate act is operation or the use of something possessed it follows that the absolute good of man consists in good operation or the good use of something possessed Now we use all things by the act of the will Hence from a good will which makes a man use well what he has man is called good and from a bad will he is called bad For a man who has a bad will can use ill even the good he has as when a grammarian of his own will speaks incorrectly Therefore because the fault itself consists in the disordered act of the will and the pain consists in the privation of something used by the will fault has more of evil in it than pain has The second reason can be taken from the fact that God is the author of the evil of pain but not of the evil of fault And this is because the evil of pain takes away the creature s good which may be either something created as sight destroyed by blindness or something uncreated as by being deprived of the vision of God the creature forfeits its uncreated good But the evil of fault is properly opposed to uncreated good for it is opposed to the fulfilment of the divine will and to divine love whereby the divine good is loved for itself and not only as shared by the creature Therefore it is plain that fault has more evil in it than pain has Reply Obj one Although fault results in pain as merit in reward yet fault is not intended on account of the pain as merit is for the reward but rather on the contrary pain is brought about so that the fault may be avoided and thus fault is worse than pain Reply Obj two The order of action which is destroyed by fault is the more perfect good of the agent since it is the second perfection than the good taken away by pain which is the first perfection Reply Obj three Pain and fault are not to be compared as end and order to the end because one may be deprived of both of these in some way both by fault and by pain by pain accordingly as a man is removed from the end and from the order to the end by fault inasmuch as this privation belongs to the action which is not ordered to its due end QUESTION forty nine THE CAUSE OF EVIL In Three Articles We next inquire into the cause of evil Concerning this there are three points of inquiry one Whether good can be the cause of evil two Whether the supreme good God is the cause of evil three Whether there be any supreme evil which is the first cause of all evils FIRST ARTICLE I Q forty nine Art one Whether Good Can Be the Cause of Evil Objection one It would seem that good cannot be the cause of evil For it is said Matt seven eighteen A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit Obj two Further one contrary cannot be the cause of another But evil is the contrary to good Therefore good cannot be the cause of evil Obj three Further a deficient effect can proceed only from a deficient cause But evil is a deficient effect Therefore its cause if it has one is deficient But everything deficient is an evil Therefore the cause of evil can only be evil Obj four Further Dionysius says Div Nom iv that evil has no cause Therefore good is not the cause of evil On the contrary Augustine says Contra Julian i nine There is no possible source of evil except good I answer that It must be said that every evil in some way has a cause For evil is the absence of the good which is natural and due to a thing But that anything fail from its natural and due disposition can come only from some cause drawing it out of its proper disposition For a heavy thing is not moved upwards except by some impelling force nor does an agent fail in its action except from some impediment But only good can be a cause because nothing can be a cause except inasmuch as it is a being and every being as such is good And if we consider the special kinds of causes we see that the agent the form and the end import some kind of perfection which belongs to the notion of good Even matter as a potentiality to good has the nature of good Now that good is the cause of evil by way of the material cause was shown above Q forty eight A three For it was shown that good is the subject of evil But evil has no formal cause rather is it a privation of form likewise neither has it a final cause but rather is it a privation of order to the proper end since not only the end has the nature of good but also the useful which is ordered to the end Evil however has a cause by way of an agent not directly but accidentally In proof of this we must know that evil is caused in the action otherwise than in the effect In the action evil is caused by reason of the defect of some principle of action either of the principal or the instrumental agent thus the defect in the movement of an animal may happen by reason of the weakness of the motive power as in the case of children or by reason only of the ineptitude of the instrument as in the lame On the other hand evil is caused in a thing but not in the proper effect of the agent sometimes by the power of the agent sometimes by reason of a defect either of the agent or of the matter It is caused by reason of the power or perfection of the agent when there necessarily follows on the form intended by the agent the privation of another form as for instance when on the form of fire there follows the privation of the form of air or of water Therefore as the more perfect the fire is in strength so much the more perfectly does it impress its own form so also the more perfectly does it corrupt the contrary Hence that evil and corruption befall air and water comes from the perfection of the fire but this is accidental because fire does not aim at the privation of the form of water but at the bringing in of its own form though by doing this it also accidentally causes the other But if there is a defect in the proper effect of the fire as for instance that it fails to heat this comes either by defect of the action which implies the defect of some principle as was said above or by the indisposition of the matter which does not receive the action of the fire the agent But this very fact that it is a deficient being is accidental to good to which of itself it belongs to act Hence it is true that evil in no way has any but an accidental cause and thus is good the cause of evil Reply Obj one As Augustine says Contra Julian i The Lord calls an evil will the evil tree and a good will a good tree Now a good will does not produce a morally bad act since it is from the good will itself that a moral act is judged to be good Nevertheless the movement itself of an evil will is caused by the rational creature which is good and thus good is the cause of evil Reply Obj two Good does not cause that evil which is contrary to itself but some other evil thus the goodness of the fire causes evil to the water and man good as to his nature causes an act morally evil And as explained above Q nineteen A nine this is by accident Moreover it does happen sometimes that one contrary causes another by accident for instance the exterior surrounding cold heats the body through the concentration of the inward heat Reply Obj three Evil has a deficient cause in voluntary things otherwise than in natural things For the natural agent produces the same kind of effect as it is itself unless it is impeded by some exterior thing and this amounts to some defect belonging to it Hence evil never follows in the effect unless some other evil pre exists in the agent or in the matter as was said above But in voluntary things the defect of the action comes from the will actually deficient inasmuch as it does not actually subject itself to its proper rule This defect however is not a fault but fault follows upon it from the fact that the will acts with this defect Reply Obj four Evil has no direct cause but only an accidental cause as was said above SECOND ARTICLE I Q forty nine Art two Whether the Supreme Good God Is the Cause of Evil Objection one It would seem that the supreme good God is the cause of evil For it is said Isa forty five fifty seven I am the Lord and there is no other God forming the light and creating darkness making peace and creating evil And Amos three six Shall there be evil in a city which the Lord hath not done Obj two Further the effect of the secondary cause is reduced to the first cause But good is the cause of evil as was said above A one Therefore since God is the cause of every good as was shown above Q two A three Q six AA one four it follows that also every evil is from God Obj three Further as is said by the Philosopher Phys ii text thirty the cause of both safety and danger of the ship is the same But God is the cause of the safety of all things Therefore He is the cause of all perdition and of all evil On the contrary Augustine says QQ eighty three qu twenty one that God is not the author of evil because He is not the cause of tending to not being I answer that As appears from what was said A one the evil which consists in the defect of action is always caused by the defect of the agent But in God there is no defect but the highest perfection as was shown above Q four A one Hence the evil which consists in defect of action or which is caused by defect of the agent is not reduced to God as to its cause But the evil which consists in the corruption of some things is reduced to God as the cause And this appears as regards both natural things and voluntary things For it was said A one that some agent inasmuch as it produces by its power a form to which follows corruption and defect causes by its power that corruption and defect But it is manifest that the form which God chiefly intends in things created is the good of the order of the universe Now the order of the universe requires as was said above Q twenty two A two ad two Q forty eight A two that there should be some things that can and do sometimes fail And thus God by causing in things the good of the order of the universe consequently and as it were by accident causes the corruptions of things according to one Kings two six The Lord killeth and maketh alive But when we read that God hath not made death Wis one thirteen the sense is that God does not will death for its own sake Nevertheless the order of justice belongs to the order of the universe and this requires that penalty should be dealt out to sinners And so God is the author of the evil which is penalty but not of the evil which is fault by reason of what is said above Reply Obj one These passages refer to the evil of penalty and not to the evil of fault Reply Obj two The effect of the deficient secondary cause is reduced to the first non deficient cause as regards what it has of being and perfection but not as regards what it has of defect just as whatever there is of motion in the act of limping is caused by the motive power whereas what there is of obliqueness in it does not come from the motive power but from the curvature of the leg And likewise whatever there is of being and action in a bad action is reduced to God as the cause whereas whatever defect is in it is not caused by God but by the deficient secondary cause Reply Obj three The sinking of a ship is attributed to the sailor as the cause from the fact that he does not fulfil what the safety of the ship requires but God does not fail in doing what is necessary for the safety of all Hence there is no parity THIRD ARTICLE I Q forty nine Art three Whether There Be One Supreme Evil Which Is the Cause of Every Evil Objection one It would seem that there is one supreme evil which is the cause of every evil For contrary effects have contrary causes But contrariety is found in things according to Ecclus thirty three fifteen Good is set against evil and life against death so also is the sinner against a just man Therefore there are many contrary principles one of good the other of evil Obj two Further if one contrary is in nature so is the other But the supreme good is in nature and is the cause of every good as was shown above Q two A three Q six AA two four Therefore also there is a supreme evil opposed to it as the cause of every evil Obj three Further as we find good and better things so we find evil and worse But good and better are so considered in relation to what is best Therefore evil and worse are so considered in relation to some supreme evil Obj four Further everything participated is reduced to what is essential But things which are evil among us are evil not essentially but by participation Therefore we must seek for some supreme essential evil which is the cause of every evil Obj five Further whatever is accidental is reduced to that which is per se But good is the accidental cause of evil Therefore we must suppose some supreme evil which is the per se cause of evils Nor can it be said that evil has no per se cause but only an accidental cause for it would then follow that evil would not exist in the many but only in the few Obj six Further the evil of the effect is reduced to the evil of the cause because the deficient effect comes from the deficient cause as was said above AA one two But we cannot proceed to infinity in this matter Therefore we must suppose one first evil as the cause of every evil On the contrary The supreme good is the cause of every being as was shown above Q two A three Q six A four Therefore there cannot be any principle opposed to it as the cause of evils I answer that It appears from what precedes that there is no one first principle of evil as there is one first principle of good First indeed because the first principle of good is essentially good as was shown above Q six AA three four But nothing can be essentially bad For it was shown above that every being as such is good Q five A three and that evil can exist only in good as in its subject Q forty eight A three Secondly because the first principle of good is the highest and perfect good which pre contains in itself all goodness as shown above Q six A two But there cannot be a supreme evil because as was shown above Q forty eight A four although evil always lessens good yet it never wholly consumes it and thus while good ever remains nothing can be wholly and perfectly bad Therefore the Philosopher says Ethic iv five that if the wholly evil could be it would destroy itself because all good being destroyed which it need be for something to be wholly evil evil itself would be taken away since its subject is good Thirdly because the very nature of evil is against the idea of a first principle both because every evil is caused by good as was shown above A one and because evil can be only an accidental cause and thus it cannot be the first cause for the accidental cause is subsequent to the direct cause Those however who upheld two first principles one good and the other evil fell into this error from the same cause whence also arose other strange notions of the ancients namely because they failed to consider the universal cause of all being and considered only the particular causes of particular effects For on that account if they found a thing hurtful to something by the power of its own nature they thought that the very nature of that thing was evil as for instance if one should say that the nature of fire was evil because it burnt the house of a poor man The judgment however of the goodness of anything does not depend upon its order to any particular thing but rather upon what it is in itself and on its order to the whole universe wherein every part has its own perfectly ordered place as was said above Q forty seven A two ad one Likewise because they found two contrary particular causes of two contrary particular effects they did not know how to reduce these contrary particular causes to the universal common cause and therefore they extended the contrariety of causes even to the first principles But since all contraries agree in something common it is necessary to search for one common cause for them above their own contrary proper causes as above the contrary qualities of the elements exists the power of a heavenly body and above all things that exist no matter how there exists one first principle of being as was shown above Q two A three Reply Obj one Contraries agree in one genus and they also agree in the nature of being and therefore although they have contrary particular causes nevertheless we must come at last to one first common cause Reply Obj two Privation and habit belong naturally to the same subject Now the subject of privation is a being in potentiality as was said above Q forty eight A three Hence since evil is privation of good as appears from what was said above Q forty eight AA one two three it is opposed to that good which has some potentiality but not to the supreme good who is pure act Reply Obj three Increase in intensity is in proportion to the nature of a thing And as the form is a perfection so privation removes a perfection Hence every form perfection and good is intensified by approach to the perfect term but privation and evil by receding from that term Hence a thing is not said to be evil and worse by reason of access to the supreme evil in the same way as it is said to be good and better by reason of access to the supreme good Reply Obj four No being is called evil by participation but by privation of participation Hence it is not necessary to reduce it to any essential evil Reply Obj five Evil can only have an accidental cause as was shown above A one Hence reduction to any per se cause of evil is impossible And to say that evil is in the greater number is simply false For things which are generated and corrupted in which alone can there be natural evil are the smaller part of the whole universe And again in every species the defect of nature is in the smaller number In man alone does evil appear as in the greater number because the good of man as regards the senses is not the good of man as man that is in regard to reason and more men seek good in regard to the senses than good according to reason Reply Obj six In the causes of evil we do not proceed to infinity but reduce all evils to some good cause whence evil follows accidentally TREATISE ON THE ANGELS QQ fifty sixty four QUESTION fifty OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ANGELS ABSOLUTELY CONSIDERED In Five Articles Now we consider the distinction of corporeal and spiritual creatures firstly the purely spiritual creature which in Holy Scripture is called angel secondly the creature wholly corporeal thirdly the composite creature corporeal and spiritual which is man Concerning the angels we consider first what belongs to their substance secondly what belongs to their intellect thirdly what belongs to their will fourthly what belongs to their creation 
3009_10327_000000_000000	train-clean-360	Their substance we consider absolutely and in relation to corporeal things 
3009_10327_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Concerning their substance absolutely considered there are five points of inquiry 
none	none	one Whether there is any entirely spiritual creature altogether incorporeal two Supposing that an angel is such we ask whether it is composed of matter and form three We ask concerning their number four Of their difference from each other five Of their immortality or incorruptibility FIRST ARTICLE I Q fifty Art one Whether an Angel Is Altogether Incorporeal 
3009_10327_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that an angel is not entirely incorporeal For what is incorporeal only as regards ourselves and not in relation to God is not absolutely incorporeal 
none	none	But Damascene says De Fide Orth ii that an angel is said to be incorporeal and immaterial as regards us but compared to God it is corporeal and material Therefore he is not simply incorporeal Obj two Further nothing is moved except a body as the Philosopher says Phys vi text thirty two But Damascene says De Fide Orth ii that an angel is an ever movable intellectual substance Therefore an angel is a corporeal substance Obj three Further Ambrose says De Spir Sanct i seven Every creature is limited within its own nature But to be limited belongs to bodies 
3009_10327_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore every creature is corporeal 
none	none	Now angels are God s creatures as appears from Ps one hundred forty eight two Praise ye the Lord all His angels and farther on verse four For He spoke and they were made He commanded and they were created Therefore angels are corporeal On the contrary It is said Ps one hundred three four Who makes His angels spirits I answer that There must be some incorporeal creatures 
3009_10327_000013_000001	train-clean-360	For what is principally intended by God in creatures is good and this consists in assimilation to God Himself 
3009_10327_000013_000002	train-clean-360	And the perfect assimilation of an effect to a cause is accomplished when the effect imitates the cause according to that whereby the cause produces the effect as heat makes heat 
none	none	Now God produces the creature by His intellect and will Q fourteen A eight Q nineteen A four 
3009_10327_000013_000004	train-clean-360	Hence the perfection of the universe requires that there should be intellectual creatures 
3009_10327_000013_000005	train-clean-360	Now intelligence cannot be the action of a body nor of any corporeal faculty for every body is limited to here and now Hence the perfection of the universe requires the existence of an incorporeal creature 
3009_10327_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The ancients however not properly realizing the force of intelligence and failing to make a proper distinction between sense and intellect thought that nothing existed in the world but what could be apprehended by sense and imagination 
none	none	And because bodies alone fall under imagination they supposed that no being existed except bodies as the Philosopher observes Phys iv text five thousand two hundred fifty seven Thence came the error of the Sadducees who said there was no spirit Acts twenty three eight 
3009_10327_000015_000000	train-clean-360	But the very fact that intellect is above sense is a reasonable proof that there are some incorporeal things comprehensible by the intellect alone 
none	none	Reply Obj one Incorporeal substances rank between God and corporeal creatures 
3009_10327_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Now the medium compared to one extreme appears to be the other extreme as what is tepid compared to heat seems to be cold and thus it is said that angels compared to God are material and corporeal not however as if anything corporeal existed in them 
none	none	Reply Obj two Movement is there taken in the sense in which it is applied to intelligence and will 
3009_10327_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore an angel is called an ever mobile substance because he is ever actually intelligent and not as if he were sometimes actually and sometimes potentially as we are 
none	none	Hence it is clear that the objection rests on an equivocation Reply Obj three To be circumscribed by local limits belongs to bodies only whereas to be circumscribed by essential limits belongs to all creatures both corporeal and spiritual Hence Ambrose says De Spir Sanct i seven that although some things are not contained in corporeal place still they are none the less circumscribed by their substance SECOND ARTICLE I Q fifty Art two 
3009_10327_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Whether an Angel Is Composed of Matter and Form 
3009_10327_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that an angel is composed of matter and form 
3009_10327_000021_000001	train-clean-360	For everything which is contained under any genus is composed of the genus and of the difference which added to the genus makes the species 
none	none	But the genus comes from the matter and the difference from the form Metaph xiii text six 
3009_10327_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore everything which is in a genus is composed of matter and form 
none	none	But an angel is in the genus of substance Therefore he is composed of matter and form Obj two Further wherever the properties of matter exist there is matter Now the properties of matter are to receive and to substand whence Boethius says De Trin that a simple form cannot be a subject and the above properties are found in the angel 
3009_10327_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore an angel is composed of matter and form 
none	none	Obj three Further form is act 
3009_10327_000023_000001	train-clean-360	So what is form only is pure act 
3009_10327_000023_000002	train-clean-360	But an angel is not pure act for this belongs to God alone 
none	none	Therefore an angel is not form only but has a form in matter Obj four Further form is properly limited and perfected by matter 
3009_10327_000024_000001	train-clean-360	So the form which is not in matter is an infinite form 
3009_10327_000024_000002	train-clean-360	But the form of an angel is not infinite for every creature is finite 
3009_10327_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore the form of an angel is in matter 
none	none	On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom iv The first creatures are understood to be as immaterial as they are incorporeal I answer that Some assert that the angels are composed of matter and form which opinion Avicebron endeavored to establish in his book of the Fount of Life For he supposes that whatever things are distinguished by the intellect are really distinct 
3009_10327_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Now as regards incorporeal substance the intellect apprehends that which distinguishes it from corporeal substance and that which it has in common with it 
3009_10327_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Hence he concludes that what distinguishes incorporeal from corporeal substance is a kind of form to it and whatever is subject to this distinguishing form as it were something common is its matter 
3009_10327_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore he asserts the universal matter of spiritual and corporeal things is the same so that it must be understood that the form of incorporeal substance is impressed in the matter of spiritual things in the same way as the form of quantity is impressed in the matter of corporeal things 
3009_10327_000027_000000	train-clean-360	But one glance is enough to show that there cannot be one matter of spiritual and of corporeal things 
3009_10327_000027_000001	train-clean-360	For it is not possible that a spiritual and a corporeal form should be received into the same part of matter otherwise one and the same thing would be corporeal and spiritual 
3009_10327_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Hence it would follow that one part of matter receives the corporeal form and another receives the spiritual form 
none	none	Matter however is not divisible into parts except as regarded under quantity and without quantity substance is indivisible as Aristotle says Phys i text fifteen 
3009_10327_000027_000004	train-clean-360	Therefore it would follow that the matter of spiritual things is subject to quantity which cannot be 
3009_10327_000027_000005	train-clean-360	Therefore it is impossible that corporeal and spiritual things should have the same matter 
3009_10327_000028_000000	train-clean-360	It is further impossible for an intellectual substance to have any kind of matter 
3009_10327_000028_000001	train-clean-360	For the operation belonging to anything is according to the mode of its substance 
3009_10327_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Now to understand is an altogether immaterial operation as appears from its object whence any act receives its species and nature 
3009_10327_000028_000003	train-clean-360	For a thing is understood according to its degree of immateriality because forms that exist in matter are individual forms which the intellect cannot apprehend as such 
3009_10327_000028_000004	train-clean-360	Hence it must be that every individual substance is altogether immaterial 
3009_10327_000029_000000	train-clean-360	But things distinguished by the intellect are not necessarily distinguished in reality because the intellect does not apprehend things according to their mode but according to its own mode 
3009_10327_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Hence material things which are below our intellect exist in our intellect in a simpler mode than they exist in themselves 
none	none	Angelic substances on the other hand are above our intellect and hence our intellect cannot attain to apprehend them as they are in themselves but by its own mode according as it apprehends composite things and in this way also it apprehends God Q three Reply Obj one It is difference which constitutes the species Now everything is constituted in a species according as it is determined to some special grade of being because the species of things are like numbers which differ by addition and subtraction of unity as the Philosopher says Metaph viii text ten But in material things there is one thing which determines to a special grade and that is the form and another thing which is determined and this is the matter and hence from the latter the genus is derived and from the former the difference Whereas in immaterial things there is no separate determinator and thing determined each thing by its own self holds a determinate grade in being and therefore in them genus and difference are not derived from different things but from one and the same 
3009_10327_000030_000003	train-clean-360	Nevertheless this differs in our mode of conception for inasmuch as our intellect considers it as indeterminate it derives the idea of their genus and inasmuch as it considers it determinately it derives the idea of their difference 
none	none	Reply Obj two This reason is given in the book on the Fount of Life and it would be cogent supposing that the receptive mode of the intellect and of matter were the same 
3009_10327_000031_000001	train-clean-360	But this is clearly false For matter receives the form that thereby it may be constituted in some species either of air or of fire or of something else 
none	none	But the intellect does not receive the form in the same way otherwise the opinion of Empedocles De Anima i five text twenty six would be true to the effect that we know earth by earth and fire by fire But the intelligible form is in the intellect according to the very nature of a form for as such is it so known by the intellect Hence such a way of receiving is not that of matter but of an immaterial substance Reply Obj three Although there is no composition of matter and form in an angel yet there is act and potentiality 
3009_10327_000032_000001	train-clean-360	And this can be made evident if we consider the nature of material things which contain a twofold composition 
3009_10327_000032_000002	train-clean-360	The first is that of form and matter whereby the nature is constituted 
3009_10327_000032_000003	train-clean-360	Such a composite nature is not its own existence but existence is its act 
3009_10327_000032_000004	train-clean-360	Hence the nature itself is related to its own existence as potentiality to act 
none	none	Therefore if there be no matter and supposing that the form itself subsists without matter there nevertheless still remains the relation of the form to its very existence as of potentiality to act 
3009_10327_000032_000006	train-clean-360	And such a kind of composition is understood to be in the angels and this is what some say that an angel is composed of whereby he is and what is or existence and what is as Boethius says 
none	none	For what is is the form itself subsisting and the existence itself is whereby the substance is as the running is whereby the runner runs But in God existence and what is are not different as was explained above Q three A four Hence God alone is pure act Reply Obj four Every creature is simply finite inasmuch as its existence is not absolutely subsisting but is limited to some nature to which it belongs 
3009_10327_000033_000001	train-clean-360	But there is nothing against a creature being considered relatively infinite 
3009_10327_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Material creatures are infinite on the part of matter but finite in their form which is limited by the matter which receives it 
3009_10327_000033_000003	train-clean-360	But immaterial created substances are finite in their being whereas they are infinite in the sense that their forms are not received in anything else as if we were to say for example that whiteness existing separate is infinite as regards the nature of whiteness forasmuch as it is not contracted to any one subject while its being is finite as determined to some one special nature 
none	none	Whence it is said De Causis prop sixteen that intelligence is finite from above as receiving its being from above itself and is infinite from below as not received in any matter THIRD ARTICLE I Q fifty Art three 
3009_10327_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Whether the Angels Exist in Any Great Number 
3009_10327_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the angels are not in great numbers For number is a species of quantity and follows the division of a continuous body 
none	none	But this cannot be in the angels since they are incorporeal as was shown above A one 
3009_10327_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the angels cannot exist in any great number 
none	none	Obj two Further the more a thing approaches to unity so much the less is it multiplied as is evident in numbers 
3009_10327_000038_000001	train-clean-360	But among other created natures the angelic nature approaches nearest to God Therefore since God is supremely one it seems that there is the least possible number in the angelic nature 
none	none	Obj three Further the proper effect of the separate substances seems to be the movements of the heavenly bodies 
3009_10327_000039_000001	train-clean-360	But the movements of the heavenly bodies fall within some small determined number which we can apprehend 
3009_10327_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the angels are not in greater number than the movements of the heavenly bodies 
none	none	Obj four Dionysius says Div Nom iv that all intelligible and intellectual substances subsist because of the rays of the divine goodness But a ray is only multiplied according to the different things that receive it Now it cannot be said that their matter is receptive of an intelligible ray since intellectual substances are immaterial as was shown above A two 
3009_10327_000040_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore it seems that the multiplication of intellectual substances can only be according to the requirements of the first bodies that is of the heavenly ones so that in some way the shedding form of the aforesaid rays may be terminated in them and hence the same conclusion is to be drawn as before 
none	none	On the contrary It is said Dan seven ten Thousands of thousands ministered to Him and ten thousands times a hundred thousand stood before Him I answer that There have been various opinions with regard to the number of the separate substances 
3009_10327_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Plato contended that the separate substances are the species of sensible things as if we were to maintain that human nature is a separate substance of itself and according to this view it would have to be maintained that the number of the separate substances is the number of the species of sensible things 
none	none	Aristotle however rejects this view Metaph i text thirty one because matter is of the very nature of the species of sensible things 
3009_10327_000042_000003	train-clean-360	Consequently the separate substances cannot be the exemplar species of these sensible things but have their own fixed natures which are higher than the natures of sensible things 
none	none	Nevertheless Aristotle held Metaph xi text forty three that those more perfect natures bear relation to these sensible things as that of mover and end and therefore he strove to find out the number of the separate substances according to the number of the first movements But since this appears to militate against the teachings of Sacred Scripture Rabbi Moses the Jew wishing to bring both into harmony held that the angels in so far as they are styled immaterial substances are multiplied according to the number of heavenly movements or bodies as Aristotle held Metaph xi text forty three while he contended that in the Scriptures even men bearing a divine message are styled angels and again even the powers of natural things which manifest God s almighty power 
3009_10327_000043_000001	train-clean-360	It is however quite foreign to the custom of the Scriptures for the powers of irrational things to be designated as angels 
3009_10327_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Hence it must be said that the angels even inasmuch as they are immaterial substances exist in exceeding great number far beyond all material multitude 
none	none	This is what Dionysius says Coel Hier xiv There are many blessed armies of the heavenly intelligences surpassing the weak and limited reckoning of our material numbers The reason whereof is this because since it is the perfection of the universe that God chiefly intends in the creation of things the more perfect some things are in so much greater an excess are they created by God Now as in bodies such excess is observed in regard to their magnitude so in things incorporeal is it observed in regard to their multitude 
3009_10327_000044_000004	train-clean-360	We see in fact that incorruptible bodies exceed corruptible bodies almost incomparably in magnitude for the entire sphere of things active and passive is something very small in comparison with the heavenly bodies 
3009_10327_000044_000005	train-clean-360	Hence it is reasonable to conclude that the immaterial substances as it were incomparably exceed material substances as to multitude 
none	none	Reply Obj one In the angels number is not that of discrete quantity brought about by division of what is continuous but that which is caused by distinction of forms according as multitude is reckoned among the transcendentals as was said above Q thirty A three Q eleven Reply Obj two From the angelic nature being the nighest unto God it must needs have least of multitude in its composition but not so as to be found in few subjects Reply Obj three This is Aristotle s argument Metaph xii text forty four and it would conclude necessarily if the separate substances were made for corporeal substances 
3009_10327_000047_000002	train-clean-360	For thus the immaterial substances would exist to no purpose unless some movement from them were to appear in corporeal things 
3009_10327_000047_000003	train-clean-360	But it is not true that the immaterial substances exist on account of the corporeal because the end is nobler than the means to the end 
none	none	Hence Aristotle says Metaph xii text forty four that this is not a necessary argument but a probable one 
3009_10327_000047_000006	train-clean-360	He was forced to make use of this argument since only through sensible things can we come to know intelligible ones 
none	none	Reply Obj four This argument comes from the opinion of such as hold that matter is the cause of the distinction of things but this was refuted above Q forty seven A one Accordingly the multiplication of the angels is not to be taken according to matter nor according to bodies but according to the divine wisdom devising the various orders of immaterial substances FOURTH ARTICLE I Q fifty Art four Whether the Angels Differ in Species 
3009_10327_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the angels do not differ in species For since the difference is nobler than the genus all things which agree in what is noblest in them agree likewise in their ultimate constitutive difference and so they are the same according to species 
3009_10327_000051_000001	train-clean-360	But all angels agree in what is noblest in them that is to say in intellectuality 
none	none	Therefore all the angels are of one species Obj two Further more and less do not change a species 
3009_10327_000052_000001	train-clean-360	But the angels seem to differ only from one another according to more and less namely as one is simpler than another and of keener intellect 
3009_10327_000052_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the angels do not differ specifically 
none	none	Obj three Further soul and angel are contra distinguished mutually from each other But all souls are of the one species So therefore are the angels Obj four Further the more perfect a thing is in nature the more ought it to be multiplied 
3009_10327_000054_000001	train-clean-360	But this would not be so if there were but one individual under one species 
none	none	Therefore there are many angels of one species On the contrary In things of one species there is no such thing as first and second prius et posterius as the Philosopher says Metaph iii text two But in the angels even of the one order there are first middle and last as Dionysius says Hier Ang x Therefore the angels are not of the same species I answer that Some have said that all spiritual substances even souls are of the one species Others again that all the angels are of the one species but not souls while others allege that all the angels of one hierarchy or even of one order are of the one species But this is impossible 
3009_10327_000057_000001	train-clean-360	For such things as agree in species but differ in number agree in form but are distinguished materially 
none	none	If therefore the angels be not composed of matter and form as was said above A two it follows that it is impossible for two angels to be of one species just as it would be impossible for there to be several whitenesses apart or several humanities since whitenesses are not several except in so far as they are in several substances And if the angels had matter not even then could there be several angels of one species 
3009_10327_000057_000003	train-clean-360	For it would be necessary for matter to be the principle of distinction of one from the other not indeed according to the division of quantity since they are incorporeal but according to the diversity of their powers and such diversity of matter causes diversity not merely of species but of genus 
none	none	Reply Obj one Difference is nobler than genus as the determined is more noble than the undetermined and the proper than the common but not as one nature is nobler than another otherwise it would be necessary that all irrational animals be of the same species or that there should be in them some form which is higher than the sensible soul Therefore irrational animals differ in species according to the various determined degrees of sensitive nature and in like manner all the angels differ in species according to the diverse degrees of intellectual nature Reply Obj two More and less change the species not according as they are caused by the intensity or remissness of one form but according as they are caused by forms of diverse degrees for instance if we say that fire is more perfect than air and in this way the angels are diversified according to more or less Reply Obj three The good of the species preponderates over the good of the individual 
3009_10327_000060_000001	train-clean-360	Hence it is much better for the species to be multiplied in the angels than for individuals to be multiplied in the one species 
none	none	Reply Obj four Numerical multiplication since it can be drawn out infinitely is not intended by the agent but only specific multiplication as was said above Q forty seven A three Hence the perfection of the angelic nature calls for the multiplying of species but not for the multiplying of individuals in one species FIFTH ARTICLE I Q fifty Art five 
3009_10327_000063_000000	train-clean-360	Whether the Angels Are Incorruptible 
none	none	Objection one It would seem that the angels are not incorruptible for Damascene speaking of the angel says De Fide Orth ii three that he is an intellectual substance partaking of immortality by favor and not by nature Obj two Further Plato says in the Timaeus O gods of gods whose maker and father am I You are indeed my works dissoluble by nature yet indissoluble because I so will it But gods such as these can only be understood to be the angels Therefore the angels are corruptible by their nature Obj three Further according to Gregory Moral xvi all things would tend towards nothing unless the hand of the Almighty preserved them But what can be brought to nothing is corruptible 
3009_10327_000066_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore since the angels were made by God it would appear that they are corruptible of their own nature 
none	none	On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom iv that the intellectual substances have unfailing life being free from all corruption death matter and generation I answer that It must necessarily be maintained that the angels are incorruptible of their own nature 
3009_10327_000068_000001	train-clean-360	The reason for this is that nothing is corrupted except by its form being separated from the matter 
none	none	Hence since an angel is a subsisting form as is clear from what was said above A two it is impossible for its substance to be corruptible 
3009_10327_000068_000003	train-clean-360	For what belongs to anything considered in itself can never be separated from it but what belongs to a thing considered in relation to something else can be separated when that something else is taken away in view of which it belonged to it 
3009_10327_000068_000004	train-clean-360	Roundness can never be taken from the circle because it belongs to it of itself but a bronze circle can lose roundness if the bronze be deprived of its circular shape 
3009_10327_000068_000005	train-clean-360	Now to be belongs to a form considered in itself for everything is an actual being according to its form whereas matter is an actual being by the form 
3009_10327_000068_000006	train-clean-360	Consequently a subject composed of matter and form ceases to be actually when the form is separated from the matter 
none	none	But if the form subsists in its own being as happens in the angels as was said above A two it cannot lose its being Therefore the angel s immateriality is the cause why it is incorruptible by its own nature A token of this incorruptibility can be gathered from its intellectual operation for since everything acts according as it is actual the operation of a thing indicates its mode of being 
3009_10327_000069_000001	train-clean-360	Now the species and nature of the operation is understood from the object 
3009_10327_000069_000002	train-clean-360	But an intelligible object being above time is everlasting 
none	none	Hence every intellectual substance is incorruptible of its own nature Reply Obj one Damascene is dealing with perfect immortality which includes complete immutability since every change is a kind of death as Augustine says Contra Maxim iii The angels obtain perfect immutability only by favor as will appear later Q sixty two Reply Obj two By the expression gods Plato understands the heavenly bodies which he supposed to be made up of elements and therefore dissoluble of their own nature yet they are for ever preserved in existence by the Divine will Reply Obj three As was observed above Q forty four A one there is a kind of necessary thing which has a cause of its necessity 
3009_10327_000072_000001	train-clean-360	Hence it is not repugnant to a necessary or incorruptible being to depend for its existence on another as its cause 
3009_10327_000072_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore when it is said that all things even the angels would lapse into nothing unless preserved by God it is not to be gathered therefrom that there is any principle of corruption in the angels but that the nature of the angels is dependent upon God as its cause 
none	none	For a thing is said to be corruptible not merely because God can reduce it to non existence by withdrawing His act of preservation but also because it has some principle of corruption within itself or some contrariety or at least the potentiality of matter

3009_10328_000002_000000	train-clean-360	We next inquire about the angels in comparison with corporeal things and in the first place about their comparison with bodies secondly of the angels in comparison with corporeal places and thirdly of their comparison with local movement 
none	none	Under the first heading there are three points of inquiry one Whether angels have bodies naturally united to them two Whether they assume bodies three Whether they exercise functions of life in the bodies assumed FIRST ARTICLE I Q fifty one Art one Whether the Angels Have Bodies Naturally United to Them 
3009_10328_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that angels have bodies naturally united to them 
none	none	For Origen says Peri Archon i It is God s attribute alone that is it belongs to the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost as a property of nature that He is understood to exist without any material substance and without any companionship of corporeal addition Bernard likewise says Hom vi super Cant Let us assign incorporeity to God alone even as we do immortality whose nature alone neither for its own sake nor on account of anything else needs the help of any corporeal organ But it is clear that every created spirit needs corporeal substance Augustine also says general ad lit iii The demons are called animals of the atmosphere because their nature is akin to that of aerial bodies But the nature of demons and angels is the same 
3009_10328_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Therefore angels have bodies naturally united to them 
none	none	Obj two Further Gregory Hom x in Ev calls an angel a rational animal But every animal is composed of body and soul Therefore angels have bodies naturally united to them Obj three Further life is more perfect in the angels than in souls But the soul not only lives but gives life to the body Therefore the angels animate bodies which are naturally united to them On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom iv that the angels are understood to be incorporeal I answer that The angels have not bodies naturally united to them 
3009_10328_000013_000001	train-clean-360	For whatever belongs to any nature as an accident is not found universally in that nature thus for instance to have wings because it is not of the essence of an animal does not belong to every animal 
none	none	Now since to understand is not the act of a body nor of any corporeal energy as will be shown later Q seventy five A two it follows that to have a body united to it is not of the nature of an intellectual substance as such but it is accidental to some intellectual substance on account of something else Even so it belongs to the human soul to be united to a body because it is imperfect and exists potentially in the genus of intellectual substances not having the fulness of knowledge in its own nature but acquiring it from sensible things through the bodily senses as will be explained later on Q eighty four A six Q eighty nine A one Now whenever we find something imperfect in any genus we must presuppose something perfect in that genus Therefore in the intellectual nature there are some perfectly intellectual substances which do not need to acquire knowledge from sensible things 
3009_10328_000013_000006	train-clean-360	Consequently not all intellectual substances are united to bodies but some are quite separated from bodies and these we call angels 
none	none	Reply Obj one As was said above Q fifty A one it was the opinion of some that every being is a body and consequently some seem to have thought that there were no incorporeal substances existing except as united to bodies so much so that some even held that God was the soul of the world as Augustine tells us De Civ Dei vii As this is contrary to Catholic Faith which asserts that God is exalted above all things according to Ps eight two Thy magnificence is exalted beyond the heavens Origen while refusing to say such a thing of God followed the above opinion of others regarding the other substances being deceived here as he was also in many other points by following the opinions of the ancient philosophers Bernard s expression can be explained that the created spirit needs some bodily instrument which is not naturally united to it but assumed for some purpose as will be explained A two Augustine speaks not as asserting the fact but merely using the opinion of the Platonists who maintained that there are some aerial animals which they termed demons Reply Obj two Gregory calls the angel a rational animal metaphorically on account of the likeness to the rational nature Reply Obj three To give life effectively is a perfection simply speaking hence it belongs to God as is said one Kings two six The Lord killeth and maketh alive But to give life formally belongs to a substance which is part of some nature and which has not within itself the full nature of the species Hence an intellectual substance which is not united to a body is more perfect than one which is united to a body SECOND ARTICLE I Q fifty one Art two 
3009_10328_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Whether Angels Assume Bodies 
3009_10328_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that angels do not assume bodies 
3009_10328_000019_000001	train-clean-360	For there is nothing superfluous in the work of an angel as there is nothing of the kind in the work of nature 
none	none	But it would be superfluous for the angels to assume bodies because an angel has no need for a body since his own power exceeds all bodily power 
3009_10328_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore an angel does not assume a body 
none	none	Obj two Further every assumption is terminated in some union because to assume implies a taking to oneself ad se sumere But a body is not united to an angel as to a form as stated A one while in so far as it is united to the angel as to a mover it is not said to be assumed otherwise it would follow that all bodies moved by the angels are assumed by them Therefore the angels do not assume bodies Obj three Further angels do not assume bodies from the earth or water or they could not suddenly disappear nor again from fire otherwise they would burn whatever things they touched nor again from air because air is without shape or color Therefore the angels do not assume bodies On the contrary Augustine says De Civ Dei xvi that angels appeared to Abraham under assumed bodies I answer that Some have maintained that the angels never assume bodies but that all that we read in Scripture of apparitions of angels happened in prophetic vision that is according to imagination But this is contrary to the intent of Scripture for whatever is beheld in imaginary vision is only in the beholder s imagination and consequently is not seen by everybody 
3009_10328_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Yet Divine Scripture from time to time introduces angels so apparent as to be seen commonly by all just as the angels who appeared to Abraham were seen by him and by his whole family by Lot and by the citizens of Sodom in like manner the angel who appeared to Tobias was seen by all present 
none	none	From all this it is clearly shown that such apparitions were beheld by bodily vision whereby the object seen exists outside the person beholding it and can accordingly be seen by all 
3009_10328_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Now by such a vision only a body can be beheld 
none	none	Consequently since the angels are not bodies nor have they bodies naturally united with them as is clear from what has been said A one Q fifty A one it follows that they sometimes assume bodies Reply Obj one Angels need an assumed body not for themselves but on our account that by conversing familiarly with men they may give evidence of that intellectual companionship which men expect to have with them in the life to come 
3009_10328_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Moreover that angels assumed bodies under the Old Law was a figurative indication that the Word of God would take a human body because all the apparitions in the Old Testament were ordained to that one whereby the Son of God appeared in the flesh 
none	none	Reply Obj two The body assumed is united to the angel not as its form nor merely as its mover but as its mover represented by the assumed movable body For as in the Sacred Scripture the properties of intelligible things are set forth by the likenesses of things sensible in the same way by Divine power sensible bodies are so fashioned by angels as fittingly to represent the intelligible properties of an angel And this is what we mean by an angel assuming a body Reply Obj three Although air as long as it is in a state of rarefaction has neither shape nor color yet when condensed it can both be shaped and colored as appears in the clouds Even so the angels assume bodies of air condensing it by the Divine power in so far as is needful for forming the assumed body THIRD ARTICLE I Q fifty one Art three Whether the Angels Exercise Functions of Life in the Bodies Assumed 
3009_10328_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the angels exercise functions of life in assumed bodies 
3009_10328_000029_000001	train-clean-360	For pretence is unbecoming in angels of truth 
none	none	But it would be pretence if the body assumed by them which seems to live and to exercise vital functions did not possess these functions Therefore the angels exercise functions of life in the assumed body Obj two Further in the works of the angels there is nothing without a purpose But eyes nostrils and the other instruments of the senses would be fashioned without a purpose in the body assumed by the angel if he perceived nothing by their means 
3009_10328_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Consequently the angel perceives by the assumed body and this is the most special function of life 
none	none	Obj three Further to move hither and thither is one of the functions of life as the Philosopher says De Anima ii But the angels are manifestly seen to move in their assumed bodies For it was said general eighteen sixteen that Abraham walked with the angels who had appeared to him bringing them on the way and when Tobias said to the angel Tob five seven eight Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the city of Medes he answered I know it and I have often walked through all the ways thereof Therefore the angels often exercise functions of life in assumed bodies Obj four Further speech is the function of a living subject for it is produced by the voice while the voice itself is a sound conveyed from the mouth 
3009_10328_000032_000001	train-clean-360	But it is evident from many passages of Sacred Scripture that angels spoke in assumed bodies 
3009_10328_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore in their assumed bodies they exercise functions of life 
none	none	Obj five Further eating is a purely animal function Hence the Lord after His Resurrection ate with His disciples in proof of having resumed life Luke twenty four Now when angels appeared in their assumed bodies they ate and Abraham offered them food after having previously adored them as God general eighteen Therefore the angels exercise functions of life in assumed bodies Obj six Further to beget offspring is a vital act But this has befallen the angels in their assumed bodies for it is related After the sons of God went in to the daughters of men and they brought forth children these are the mighty men of old men of renown general six four Consequently the angels exercised vital functions in their assumed bodies On the contrary The bodies assumed by angels have no life as was stated in the previous article ad three 
3009_10328_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore they cannot exercise functions of life through assumed bodies 
none	none	I answer that Some functions of living subjects have something in common with other operations just as speech which is the function of a living creature agrees with other sounds of inanimate things in so far as it is sound and walking agrees with other movements in so far as it is movement Consequently vital functions can be performed in assumed bodies by the angels as to that which is common in such operations but not as to that which is special to living subjects because according to the Philosopher De Somn et Vig i that which has the faculty has the action Hence nothing can have a function of life except what has life which is the potential principle of such action Reply Obj one As it is in no wise contrary to truth for intelligible things to be set forth in Scripture under sensible figures since it is not said for the purpose of maintaining that intelligible things are sensible but in order that properties of intelligible things may be understood according to similitude through sensible figures so it is not contrary to the truth of the holy angels that through their assumed bodies they appear to be living men although they are really not 
3009_10328_000037_000001	train-clean-360	For the bodies are assumed merely for this purpose that the spiritual properties and works of the angels may be manifested by the properties of man and of his works 
3009_10328_000037_000002	train-clean-360	This could not so fittingly be done if they were to assume true men because the properties of such men would lead us to men and not to angels 
none	none	Reply Obj two Sensation is entirely a vital function 
3009_10328_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Consequently it can in no way be said that the angels perceive through the organs of their assumed bodies 
none	none	Yet such bodies are not fashioned in vain for they are not fashioned for the purpose of sensation through them but to this end that by such bodily organs the spiritual powers of the angels may be made manifest just as by the eye the power of the angel s knowledge is pointed out and other powers by the other members as Dionysius teaches Coel Hier Reply Obj three Movement coming from a united mover is a proper function of life but the bodies assumed by the angels are not thus moved since the angels are not their forms 
3009_10328_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Yet the angels are moved accidentally when such bodies are moved since they are in them as movers are in the moved and they are here in such a way as not to be elsewhere which cannot be said of God 
3009_10328_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Accordingly although God is not moved when the things are moved in which He exists since He is everywhere yet the angels are moved accidentally according to the movement of the bodies assumed 
none	none	But they are not moved according to the movement of the heavenly bodies even though they be in them as the movers in the thing moved because the heavenly bodies do not change place in their entirety nor for the spirit which moves the world is there any fixed locality according to any restricted part of the world s substance which now is in the east and now in the west but according to a fixed quarter because the moving energy is always in the east as stated in Phys viii text eighty four Reply Obj four Properly speaking the angels do not talk through their assumed bodies yet there is a semblance of speech in so far as they fashion sounds in the air like to human voices Reply Obj five Properly speaking the angels cannot be said to eat because eating involves the taking of food convertible into the substance of the eater Although after the Resurrection food was not converted into the substance of Christ s body but resolved into pre existing matter nevertheless Christ had a body of such a true nature that food could be changed into it hence it was a true eating 
3009_10328_000042_000001	train-clean-360	But the food taken by angels was neither changed into the assumed body nor was the body of such a nature that food could be changed into it consequently it was not a true eating but figurative of spiritual eating 
none	none	This is what the angel said to Tobias When I was with you I seemed indeed to eat and to drink but I use an invisible meat and drink Tob twelve nineteen Abraham offered them food deeming them to be men in whom nevertheless he worshipped God as God is wont to be in the prophets as Augustine says De Civ Dei xvi Reply Obj six As Augustine says De Civ Dei xv Many persons affirm that they have had the experience or have heard from such as have experienced it that the Satyrs and Fauns whom the common folk call incubi have often presented themselves before women and have sought and procured intercourse with them 
3009_10328_000044_000002	train-clean-360	Hence it is folly to deny it 
none	none	But God s holy angels could not fall in such fashion before the deluge 
3009_10328_000044_000004	train-clean-360	Hence by the sons of God are to be understood the sons of Seth who were good while by the daughters of men the Scripture designates those who sprang from the race of Cain 
none	none	Nor is it to be wondered at that giants should be born of them for they were not all giants albeit there were many more before than after the deluge Still if some are occasionally begotten from demons it is not from the seed of such demons nor from their assumed bodies but from the seed of men taken for the purpose as when the demon assumes first the form of a woman and afterwards of a man just as they take the seed of other things for other generating purposes as Augustine says De Trin iii so that the person born is not the child of a demon but of a man QUESTION fifty two OF THE ANGELS IN RELATION TO PLACE In Three Articles We now inquire into the place of the angels Touching this there are three subjects of inquiry one Is the angel in a place two Can he be in several places at once three Can several angels be in the same place FIRST ARTICLE I Q fifty two Art one Whether an Angel Is in a Place Objection one It would seem that an angel is not in a place For Boethius says De Hebdom The common opinion of the learned is that things incorporeal are not in a place And again Aristotle observes Phys iv text four thousand eight hundred fifty seven that it is not everything existing which is in a place but only a movable body But an angel is not a body as was shown above Q fifty Therefore an angel is not in a place Obj two Further place is a quantity having position But everything which is in a place has some position Now to have a position cannot befit an angel since his substance is devoid of quantity the proper difference of which is to have a position Therefore an angel is not in a place Obj three Further to be in a place is to be measured and to be contained by such place as is evident from the Philosopher Phys iv text fourteen thousand one hundred nineteen But an angel can neither be measured nor contained by a place because the container is more formal than the contained as air with regard to water Phys iv text three thousand five hundred forty nine Therefore an angel is not in a place On the contrary It is said in the Collect Prayer at Compline Dominican Breviary Let Thy holy angels who dwell herein keep us in peace I answer that It is befitting an angel to be in a place yet an angel and a body are said to be in a place in quite a different sense A body is said to be in a place in such a way that it is applied to such place according to the contact of dimensive quantity but there is no such quantity in the angels for theirs is a virtual one Consequently an angel is said to be in a corporeal place by application of the angelic power in any manner whatever to any place Accordingly there is no need for saying that an angel can be deemed commensurate with a place or that he occupies a space in the continuous for this is proper to a located body which is endowed with dimensive quantity In similar fashion it is not necessary on this account for the angel to be contained by a place because an incorporeal substance virtually contains the thing with which it comes into contact and is not contained by it for the soul is in the body as containing it not as contained by it In the same way an angel is said to be in a place which is corporeal not as the thing contained but as somehow containing it And hereby we have the answers to the objections SECOND ARTICLE I Q fifty two Art two Whether an Angel Can Be in Several Places at Once Objection one It would seem that an angel can be in several places at once For an angel is not less endowed with power than the soul But the soul is in several places at once for it is entirely in every part of the body as Augustine says De Trin vi Therefore an angel can be in several places at once Obj two Further an angel is in the body which he assumes and since the body which he assumes is continuous it would appear that he is in every part thereof But according to the various parts there are various places Therefore the angel is at one time in various places Obj three Further Damascene says De Fide Orth ii that where the angel operates there he is But occasionally he operates in several places at one time as is evident from the angel destroying Sodom general nineteen twenty five Therefore an angel can be in several places at the one time On the contrary Damascene says De Fide Orth ii that while the angels are in heaven they are not on earth I answer that An angel s power and nature are finite whereas the Divine power and essence which is the universal cause of all things is infinite consequently God through His power touches all things and is not merely present in some places but is everywhere Now since the angel s power is finite it does not extend to all things but to one determined thing For whatever is compared with one power must be compared therewith as one determined thing Consequently since all being is compared as one thing to God s universal power so is one particular being compared as one with the angelic power Hence since the angel is in a place by the application of his power to the place it follows that he is not everywhere nor in several places but in only one place Some however have been deceived in this matter For some who were unable to go beyond the reach of their imaginations supposed the indivisibility of the angel to be like that of a point consequently they thought that an angel could be only in a place which is a point But they were manifestly deceived because a point is something indivisible yet having its situation whereas the angel is indivisible and beyond the genus of quantity and situation Consequently there is no occasion for determining in his regard one indivisible place as to situation any place which is either divisible or indivisible great or small suffices according as to his own free will he applies his power to a great or to a small body So the entire body to which he is applied by his power corresponds as one place to him Neither if any angel moves the heavens is it necessary for him to be everywhere First of all because his power is applied only to what is first moved by him Now there is one part of the heavens in which there is movement first of all namely the part to the east hence the Philosopher Phys vii text eighty four attributes the power of the heavenly mover to the part which is in the east Secondly because philosophers do not hold that one separate substance moves all the spheres immediately Hence it need not be everywhere So then it is evident that to be in a place appertains quite differently to a body to an angel and to God For a body is in a place in a circumscribed fashion since it is measured by the place An angel however is not there in a circumscribed fashion since he is not measured by the place but definitively because he is in a place in such a manner that he is not in another But God is neither circumscriptively nor definitively there because He is everywhere From this we can easily gather an answer to the objections because the entire subject to which the angelic power is immediately applied is reputed as one place even though it be continuous THIRD ARTICLE I Q fifty two Art three Whether Several Angels Can Be at the Same Time in the Same Place Objection one It would seem that several angels can be at the same time in the same place For several bodies cannot be at the same time in the same place because they fill the place But the angels do not fill a place because only a body fills a place so that it be not empty as appears from the Philosopher Phys iv text five thousand two hundred fifty eight Therefore several angels can be in the one place Obj two Further there is a greater difference between an angel and a body than there is between two angels But an angel and a body are at the one time in the one place because there is no place which is not filled with a sensible body as we find proved in Phys iv text fifty eight Much more then can two angels be in the same place Obj three Further the soul is in every part of the body according to Augustine De Trin vi But demons although they do not obsess souls do obsess bodies occasionally and thus the soul and the demon are at the one time in the same place and consequently for the same reason all other spiritual substances On the contrary There are not two souls in the same body Therefore for a like reason there are not two angels in the same place I answer that There are not two angels in the same place The reason of this is because it is impossible for two complete causes to be the causes immediately of one and the same thing This is evident in every class of causes for there is one proximate form of one thing and there is one proximate mover although there may be several remote movers Nor can it be objected that several individuals may row a boat since no one of them is a perfect mover because no one man s strength is sufficient for moving the boat while all together are as one mover in so far as their united strengths all combine in producing the one movement Hence since the angel is said to be in one place by the fact that his power touches the place immediately by way of a perfect container as was said A one there can be but one angel in one place Reply Obj one Several angels are not hindered from being in the same place because of their filling the place but for another reason as has been said Reply Obj two An angel and a body are not in a place in the same way hence the conclusion does not follow Reply Obj three Not even a demon and a soul are compared to a body according to the same relation of causality since the soul is its form while the demon is not Hence the inference does not follow QUESTION fifty three OF THE LOCAL MOVEMENT OF THE ANGELS In Three Articles We must next consider the local movement of the angels under which heading there are three points of inquiry one Whether an angel can be moved locally two Whether in passing from place to place he passes through intervening space three Whether the angel s movement is in time or instantaneous FIRST ARTICLE I Q fifty three Art one Whether an Angel Can Be Moved Locally Objection one It seems that an angel cannot be moved locally For as the Philosopher proves Phys vi text thirty two eighty six nothing which is devoid of parts is moved because while it is in the term wherefrom it is not moved nor while it is in the term whereto for it is then already moved consequently it remains that everything which is moved while it is being moved is partly in the term wherefrom and partly in the term whereto But an angel is without parts Therefore an angel cannot be moved locally Obj two Further movement is the act of an imperfect being as the Philosopher says Phys iii text fourteen But a beatified angel is not imperfect Consequently a beatified angel is not moved locally Obj three Further movement is simply because of want But the holy angels have no want Therefore the holy angels are not moved locally On the contrary It is the same thing for a beatified angel to be moved as for a beatified soul to be moved But it must necessarily be said that a blessed soul is moved locally because it is an article of faith that Christ s soul descended into Hell Therefore a beatified angel is moved locally I answer that A beatified angel can be moved locally As however to be in a place belongs equivocally to a body and to an angel so likewise does local movement For a body is in a place in so far as it is contained under the place and is commensurate with the place Hence it is necessary for local movement of a body to be commensurate with the place and according to its exigency Hence it is that the continuity of movement is according to the continuity of magnitude and according to priority and posteriority of local movement as the Philosopher says Phys iv text ninety nine But an angel is not in a place as commensurate and contained but rather as containing it Hence it is not necessary for the local movement of an angel to be commensurate with the place nor for it to be according to the exigency of the place so as to have continuity therefrom but it is a non continuous movement For since the angel is in a place only by virtual contact as was said above Q fifty two A one it follows necessarily that the movement of an angel in a place is nothing else than the various contacts of various places successively and not at once because an angel cannot be in several places at one time as was said above Q fifty two A two Nor is it necessary for these contacts to be continuous Nevertheless a certain kind of continuity can be found in such contacts Because as was said above Q fifty two A one there is nothing to hinder us from assigning a divisible place to an angel according to virtual contact just as a divisible place is assigned to a body by contact of magnitude Hence as a body successively and not all at once quits the place in which it was before and thence arises continuity in its local movement so likewise an angel can successively quit the divisible place in which he was before and so his movement will be continuous And he can all at once quit the whole place and in the same instant apply himself to the whole of another place and thus his movement will not be continuous Reply Obj one This argument fails of its purpose for a twofold reason First of all because Aristotle s demonstration deals with what is indivisible according to quantity to which responds a place necessarily indivisible And this cannot be said of an angel Secondly because Aristotle s demonstration deals with movement which is continuous For if the movement were not continuous it might be said that a thing is moved where it is in the term wherefrom and while it is in the term whereto because the very succession of wheres regarding the same thing would be called movement hence in whichever of those wheres the thing might be it could be said to be moved But the continuity of movement prevents this because nothing which is continuous is in its term as is clear because the line is not in the point Therefore it is necessary for the thing moved to be not totally in either of the terms while it is being moved but partly in the one and partly in the other Therefore according as the angel s movement is not continuous Aristotle s demonstration does not hold good But according as the angel s movement is held to be continuous it can be so granted that while an angel is in movement he is partly in the term wherefrom and partly in the term whereto yet so that such partiality be not referred to the angel s substance but to the place because at the outset of his continuous movement the angel is in the whole divisible place from which he begins to be moved but while he is actually in movement he is in part of the first place which he quits and in part of the second place which he occupies This very fact that he can occupy the parts of two places appertains to the angel from this that he can occupy a divisible place by applying his power as a body does by application of magnitude Hence it follows regarding a body which is movable according to place that it is divisible according to magnitude but regarding an angel that his power can be applied to something which is divisible Reply Obj two The movement of that which is in potentiality is the act of an imperfect agent But the movement which is by application of energy is the act of one in act because energy implies actuality Reply Obj three The movement of that which is in potentiality is the act of an imperfect but the movement of what is in act is not for any need of its own but for another s need In this way because of our need the angel is moved locally according to Heb one fourteen They are all Vulg Are they not all ministering spirits sent to minister for them who receive the inheritance of salvation SECOND ARTICLE I Q fifty three Art two Whether an Angel Passes Through Intermediate Space Objection one It would seem that an angel does not pass through intermediate space For everything that passes through a middle space first travels along a place of its own dimensions before passing through a greater But the place responding to an angel who is indivisible is confined to a point Therefore if the angel passes through middle space he must reckon infinite points in his movement which is not possible Obj two Further an angel is of simpler substance than the soul But our soul by taking thought can pass from one extreme to another without going through the middle for I can think of France and afterwards of Syria without ever thinking of Italy which stands between them Therefore much more can an angel pass from one extreme to another without going through the middle On the contrary If the angel be moved from one place to another then when he is in the term whither he is no longer in motion but is changed But a process of changing precedes every actual change consequently he was being moved while existing in some place But he was not moved so long as he was in the term whence Therefore he was moved while he was in mid space and so it was necessary for him to pass through intervening space I answer that As was observed above in the preceding article the local motion of an angel can be continuous and non continuous If it be continuous the angel cannot pass from one extreme to another without passing through the mid space because as is said by the Philosopher Phys v text twenty two vi text seventy seven The middle is that into which a thing which is continually moved comes before arriving at the last into which it is moved because the order of first and last in continuous movement is according to the order of the first and last in magnitude as he says Phys iv text ninety nine But if an angel s movement be not continuous it is possible for him to pass from one extreme to another without going through the middle which is evident thus Between the two extreme limits there are infinite intermediate places whether the places be taken as divisible or as indivisible This is clearly evident with regard to places which are indivisible because between every two points that are infinite intermediate points since no two points follow one another without a middle as is proved in Phys vi text one And the same must of necessity be said of divisible places and this is shown from the continuous movement of a body For a body is not moved from place to place except in time But in the whole time which measures the movement of a body there are not two nows in which the body moved is not in one place and in another for if it were in one and the same place in two nows it would follow that it would be at rest there since to be at rest is nothing else than to be in the same place now and previously Therefore since there are infinite nows between the first and the last now of the time which measures the movement there must be infinite places between the first from which the movement begins and the last where the movement ceases This again is made evident from sensible experience Let there be a body of a palm s length and let there be a plane measuring two palms along which it travels it is evident that the first place from which the movement starts is that of the one palm and the place wherein the movement ends is that of the other palm Now it is clear that when it begins to move it gradually quits the first palm and enters the second According then as the magnitude of the palm is divided even so are the intermediate places multiplied because every distinct point in the magnitude of the first palm is the beginning of a place and a distinct point in the magnitude of the other palm is the limit of the same Accordingly since magnitude is infinitely divisible and the points in every magnitude are likewise infinite in potentiality it follows that between every two places there are infinite intermediate places Now a movable body only exhausts the infinity of the intermediate places by the continuity of its movement because as the intermediate places are infinite in potentiality so likewise must there be reckoned some infinitudes in movement which is continuous Consequently if the movement be not continuous then all the parts of the movement will be actually numbered If therefore any movable body be moved but not by continuous movement it follows either that it does not pass through all the intermediate places or else that it actually numbers infinite places which is not possible Accordingly then as the angel s movement is not continuous he does not pass through all intermediate places Now the actual passing from one extreme to the other without going through the mid space is quite in keeping with an angel s nature but not with that of a body because a body is measured by and contained under a place hence it is bound to follow the laws of place in its movement But an angel s substance is not subject to place as contained thereby but is above it as containing it hence it is under his control to apply himself to a place just as he wills either through or without the intervening place Reply Obj one The place of an angel is not taken as equal to him according to magnitude but according to contact of power and so the angel s place can be divisible and is not always a mere point Yet even the intermediate divisible places are infinite as was said above but they are consumed by the continuity of the movement as is evident from the foregoing Reply Obj two While an angel is moved locally his essence is applied to various places but the soul s essence is not applied to the things thought of but rather the things thought of are in it So there is no comparison Reply Obj three In continuous movement the actual change is not a part of the movement but its conclusion hence movement must precede change Accordingly such movement is through the mid space But in movement which is not continuous the change is a part as a unit is a part of number hence the succession of the various places even without the mid space constitutes such movement THIRD ARTICLE I Q fifty three Art three Whether the Movement of an Angel Is Instantaneous Objection one It would seem that an angel s movement is instantaneous For the greater the power of the mover and the less the moved resist the mover the more rapid is the movement But the power of an angel moving himself exceeds beyond all proportion the power which moves a body Now the proportion of velocities is reckoned according to the lessening of the time But between one length of time and any other length of time there is proportion If therefore a body is moved in time an angel is moved in an instant Obj two Further the angel s movement is simpler than any bodily change But some bodily change is effected in an instant such as illumination both because the subject is not illuminated successively as it gets hot successively and because a ray does not reach sooner what is near than what is remote Much more therefore is the angel s movement instantaneous Obj three Further if an angel be moved from place to place in time it is manifest that in the last instant of such time he is in the term whereto but in the whole of the preceding time he is either in the place immediately preceding which is taken as the term wherefrom or else he is partly in the one and partly in the other it follows that he is divisible which is impossible Therefore during the whole of the preceding time he is in the term wherefrom Therefore he rests there since to be at rest is to be in the same place now and previously as was said A two Therefore it follows that he is not moved except in the last instant of time On the contrary In every change there is a before and after Now the before and after of movement is reckoned by time Consequently every movement even of an angel is in time since there is a before and after in it I answer that Some have maintained that the local movement of an angel is instantaneous They said that when an angel is moved from place to place during the whole of the preceding time he is in the term wherefrom but in the last instant of such time he is in the term whereto Nor is there any need for a medium between the terms just as there is no medium between time and the limit of time But there is a mid time between two nows of time hence they say that a last now cannot be assigned in which it was in the term wherefrom just as in illumination and in the substantial generation of fire there is no last instant to be assigned in which the air was dark or in which the matter was under the privation of the form of fire but a last time can be assigned so that in the last instant of such time there is light in the air or the form of fire in the matter And so illumination and substantial generation are called instantaneous movements But this does not hold good in the present case and it is shown thus It is of the nature of rest that the subject in repose be not otherwise disposed now than it was before and therefore in every now of time which measures rest the subject reposing is in the same where in the first in the middle and in the last now On the other hand it is of the very nature of movement for the subject moved to be otherwise now than it was before and therefore in every now of time which measures movement the movable subject is in various dispositions hence in the last now it must have a different form from what it had before So it is evident that to rest during the whole time in some disposition for instance in whiteness is to be in it in every instant of such time Hence it is not possible for anything to rest in one term during the whole of the preceding time and afterwards in the last instant of that time to be in the other term But this is possible in movement because to be moved in any whole time is not to be in the same disposition in every instant of that time Therefore all instantaneous changes of the kind are terms of a continuous movement just as generation is the term of the alteration of matter and illumination is the term of the local movement of the illuminating body Now the local movement of an angel is not the term of any other continuous movement but is of itself depending upon no other movement Consequently it is impossible to say that he is in any place during the whole time and that in the last now he is in another place but some now must be assigned in which he was last in the preceding place But where there are many nows succeeding one another there is necessarily time since time is nothing else than the reckoning of before and after in movement It remains then that the movement of an angel is in time It is in continuous time if his movement be continuous and in non continuous time if his movement is non continuous for as was said A one his movement can be of either kind since the continuity of time comes of the continuity of movement as the Philosopher says Phys iv text ninety nine But that time whether it be continuous or not is not the same as the time which measures the movement of the heavens and whereby all corporeal things are measured which have their changeableness from the movement of the heavens because the angel s movement does not depend upon the movement of the heavens Reply Obj one If the time of the angel s movement be not continuous but a kind of succession of nows it will have no proportion to the time which measures the movement of corporeal things which is continuous since it is not of the same nature If however it be continuous it is indeed proportionable not indeed because of the proportion of the mover and the movable but on account of the proportion of the magnitudes in which the movement exists Besides the swiftness of the angel s movement is not measured by the quantity of his power but according to the determination of his will Reply Obj two Illumination is the term of a movement and is an alteration not a local movement as though the light were understood to be moved to what is near before being moved to what is remote But the angel s movement is local and besides it is not the term of movement hence there is no comparison Reply Obj three This objection is based on continuous time But the same time of an angel s movement can be non continuous So an angel can be in one place in one instant and in another place in the next instant without any time intervening If the time of the angel s movement be continuous he is changed through infinite places throughout the whole time which precedes the last now as was already shown A two Nevertheless he is partly in one of the continuous places and partly in another not because his substance is susceptible of parts but because his power is applied to a part of the first place and to a part of the second as was said above A two QUESTION fifty four OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANGELS In Five Articles After considering what belongs to the angel s substance we now proceed to his knowledge This investigation will be fourfold In the first place inquiry must be made into his power of knowledge secondly into his medium of knowledge thirdly into the objects known and fourthly into the manner whereby he knows them Under the first heading there are five points of inquiry one Is the angel s understanding his substance two Is his being his understanding three Is his substance his power of intelligence four Is there in the angels an active and a passive intellect five Is there in them any other power of knowledge besides the intellect FIRST ARTICLE I Q fifty four Art one Whether an Angel s Act of Understanding Is His Substance Objection one It would seem that the angel s act of understanding is his substance For the angel is both higher and simpler than the active intellect of a soul But the substance of the active intellect is its own action as is evident from Aristotle De Anima iii and from his Commentator Averroes A D eleven twenty six eleven ninety eight Therefore much more is the angel s substance his action that is his act of understanding Obj two Further the Philosopher says Metaph xii text thirty nine that the action of the intellect is life But since in living things to live is to be as he says De Anima ii text thirty seven it seems that life is essence Therefore the action of the intellect is the essence of an angel who understands Obj three Further if the extremes be one then the middle does not differ from them because extreme is farther from extreme than the middle is But in an angel the intellect and the object understood are the same at least in so far as he understands his own essence Therefore the act of understanding which is between the intellect and the thing understood is one with the substance of the angel who understands On the contrary The action of anything differs more from its substance than does its existence But no creature s existence is its substance for this belongs to God only as is evident from what was said above Q three A four Therefore neither the action of an angel nor of any other creature is its substance I answer that It is impossible for the action of an angel or of any creature to be its own substance For an action is properly the actuality of a power just as existence is the actuality of a substance or of an essence Now it is impossible for anything which is not a pure act but which has some admixture of potentiality to be its own actuality because actuality is opposed to potentiality But God alone is pure act Hence only in God is His substance the same as His existence and His action Besides if an angel s act of understanding were his substance it would be necessary for it to be subsisting Now a subsisting act of intelligence can be but one just as an abstract thing that subsists Consequently an angel s substance would neither be distinguished from God s substance which is His very act of understanding subsisting in itself nor from the substance of another angel Also if the angel were his own act of understanding there could then be no degrees of understanding more or less perfectly for this comes about through the diverse participation of the act of understanding Reply Obj one When the active intellect is said to be its own action such predication is not essential but concomitant because since its very nature consists in act instantly so far as lies in itself action accompanies it which cannot be said of the passive intellect for this has no actions until after it has been reduced to act Reply Obj two The relation between life and to live is not the same as that between essence and to be but rather as that between a race and to run one of which signifies the act in the abstract and the other in the concrete Hence it does not follow if to live is to be that life is essence Although life is sometimes put for the essence as Augustine says De Trin x Memory and understanding and will are one essence one life yet it is not taken in this sense by the Philosopher when he says that the act of the intellect is life Reply Obj three The action which is transient passing to some extrinsic object is really a medium between the agent and the subject receiving the action The action which remains within the agent is not really a medium between the agent and the object but only according to the manner of expression for it really follows the union of the object with the agent For the act of understanding is brought about by the union of the object understood with the one who understands it as an effect which differs from both SECOND ARTICLE I Q fifty four Art two Whether in the Angel to Understand Is to Exist Objection one It would seem that in the angel to understand is to exist For in living things to live is to be as the Philosopher says De Anima ii text thirty seven But to understand is in a sense to live De Anima ii text thirty seven Therefore in the angel to understand is to exist Obj two Further cause bears the same relation to cause as effect to effect But the form whereby the angel exists is the same as the form by which he understands at least himself Therefore in the angel to understand is to exist On the contrary The angel s act of understanding is his movement as is clear from Dionysius Div Nom iv But to exist is not movement Therefore in the angel to be is not to understand I answer that The action of the angel as also the action of any creature is not his existence For as it is said Metaph ix text sixteen there is a twofold class of action one which passes out to something beyond and causes passion in it as burning and cutting and another which does not pass outwards but which remains within the agent as to feel to understand to will by such actions nothing outside is changed but the whole action takes place within the agent It is quite clear regarding the first kind of action that it cannot be the agent s very existence because the agent s existence is signified as within him while such an action denotes something as issuing from the agent into the thing done But the second action of its own nature has infinity either simple or relative As an example of simple infinity we have the act to understand of which the object is the true and the act to will of which the object is the good each of which is convertible with being and so to understand and to will of themselves bear relation to all things and each receives its species from its object But the act of sensation is relatively infinite for it bears relation to all sensible things as sight does to all things visible Now the being of every creature is restricted to one in genus and species God s being alone is simply infinite comprehending all things in itself as Dionysius says Div Nom v Hence the Divine nature alone is its own act of understanding and its own act of will Reply Obj one Life is sometimes taken for the existence of the living subject sometimes also for a vital operation that is for one whereby something is shown to be living In this way the Philosopher says that to understand is in a sense to live for there he distinguishes the various grades of living things according to the various functions of life Reply Obj two The essence of an angel is the reason of his entire existence but not the reason of his whole act of understanding since he cannot understand everything by his essence Consequently in its own specific nature as such an essence it is compared to the existence of the angel whereas to his act of understanding it is compared as included in the idea of a more universal object namely truth and being Thus it is evident that although the form is the same yet it is not the principle of existence and of understanding according to the same formality On this account it does not follow that in the angel to be is the same as to understand THIRD ARTICLE I Q fifty four Art three Whether an Angel s Power of Intelligence Is His Essence Objection one It would seem that in an angel the power or faculty of understanding is not different from his essence For mind and intellect express the power of understanding But in many passages of his writings Dionysius styles angels intellects and minds Therefore the angel is his own power of intelligence Obj two Further if the angel s power of intelligence be anything besides his essence then it must needs be an accident for that which is besides the essence of anything we call it accident But a simple form cannot be a subject as Boethius states De Trin one Thus an angel would not be a simple form which is contrary to what has been previously said Q fifty A two Obj three Further Augustine Confess xii says that God made the angelic nature nigh unto Himself while He made primary matter nigh unto nothing from this it would seem that the angel is of a simpler nature than primary matter as being closer to God But primary matter is its own power Therefore much more is an angel his own power of intelligence On the contrary Dionysius says Coel Hier xi that the angels are divided into substance power and operation Therefore substance power and operation are all distinct in them I answer that Neither in an angel nor in any creature is the power or operative faculty the same as its essence which is made evident thus Since every power is ordained to an act then according to the diversity of acts must be the diversity of powers and on this account it is said that each proper act responds to its proper power But in every creature the essence differs from the existence and is compared to it as potentiality is to act as is evident from what has been already said Q forty four A one Now the act to which the operative power is compared is operation But in the angel to understand is not the same as to exist nor is any operation in him nor in any other created thing the same as his existence Hence the angel s essence is not his power of intelligence nor is the essence of any creature its power of operation Reply Obj one An angel is called intellect and mind because all his knowledge is intellectual whereas the knowledge of a soul is partly intellectual and partly sensitive Reply Obj two A simple form which is pure act cannot be the subject of accident because subject is compared to accident as potentiality is to act God alone is such a form and of such is Boethius speaking there But a simple form which is not its own existence but is compared to it as potentiality is to act can be the subject of accident and especially of such accident as follows the species for such accident belongs to the form whereas an accident which belongs to the individual and which does not belong to the whole species results from the matter which is the principle of individuation And such a simple form is an angel Reply Obj three The power of matter is a potentiality in regard to substantial being itself whereas the power of operation regards accidental being Hence there is no comparison FOURTH ARTICLE I Q fifty four Art four Whether There Is an Active and a Passive Intellect in an Angel Objection one It would seem that there is both an active and a passive intellect in an angel The Philosopher says De Anima iii text seventeen that in the soul just as in every nature there is something whereby it can become all things and there is something whereby it can make all things But an angel is a kind of nature Therefore there is an active and a passive intellect in an angel Obj two Further the proper function of the passive intellect is to receive whereas to enlighten is the proper function of the active intellect as is made clear in De Anima iii text two three eighteen But an angel receives enlightenment from a higher angel and enlightens a lower one Therefore there is in him an active and a passive intellect On the contrary The distinction of active and passive intellect in us is in relation to the phantasms which are compared to the passive intellect as colors to the sight but to the active intellect as colors to the light as is clear from De Anima iii text eighteen But this is not so in the angel Therefore there is no active and passive intellect in the angel I answer that The necessity for admitting a passive intellect in us is derived from the fact that we understand sometimes only in potentiality and not actually Hence there must exist some power which previous to the act of understanding is in potentiality to intelligible things but which becomes actuated in their regard when it apprehends them and still more when it reflects upon them This is the power which is denominated the passive intellect The necessity for admitting an active intellect is due to this that the natures of the material things which we understand do not exist outside the soul as immaterial and actually intelligible but are only intelligible in potentiality so long as they are outside the soul Consequently it is necessary that there should be some power capable of rendering such natures actually intelligible and this power in us is called the active intellect But each of these necessities is absent from the angels They are neither sometimes understanding only in potentiality with regard to such things as they naturally apprehend nor again are their intelligible objects intelligible in potentiality but they are actually such for they first and principally understand immaterial things as will appear later Q eighty four A seven Q eighty five A one Therefore there cannot be an active and a passive intellect in them except equivocally Reply Obj one As the words themselves show the Philosopher understands those two things to be in every nature in which there chances to be generation or making Knowledge however is not generated in the angels but is present naturally Hence there is no need for admitting an active and a passive intellect in them Reply Obj two It is the function of the active intellect to enlighten not another intellect but things which are intelligible in potentiality in so far as by abstraction it makes them to be actually intelligible It belongs to the passive intellect to be in potentiality with regard to things which are naturally capable of being known and sometimes to apprehend them actually Hence for one angel to enlighten another does not belong to the notion of an active intellect neither does it belong to the passive intellect for the angel to be enlightened with regard to supernatural mysteries to the knowledge of which he is sometimes in potentiality But if anyone wishes to call these by the names of active and passive intellect he will then be speaking equivocally and it is not about names that we need trouble FIFTH ARTICLE I Q fifty four Art five Whether There Is Only Intellectual Knowledge in the Angels Objection one It would seem that the knowledge of the angels is not exclusively intellectual For Augustine says De Civ Dei viii that in the angels there is life which understands and feels Therefore there is a sensitive faculty in them as well Obj two Further Isidore says De Summo Bono that the angels have learnt many things by experience But experience comes of many remembrances as stated in Metaph i one Consequently they have likewise a power of memory Obj three Further Dionysius says Div Nom iv that there is a sort of perverted phantasy in the demons But phantasy belongs to the imaginative faculty Therefore the power of the imagination is in the demons and for the same reason it is in the angels since they are of the same nature On the contrary Gregory says Hom twenty nine in Ev that man senses in common with the brutes and understands with the angels I answer that In our soul there are certain powers whose operations are exercised by corporeal organs such powers are acts of sundry parts of the body as sight of the eye and hearing of the ear There are some other powers of the soul whose operations are not performed through bodily organs as intellect and will these are not acts of any parts of the body Now the angels have no bodies naturally joined to them as is manifest from what has been said already Q fifty one A one Hence of the soul s powers only intellect and will can belong to them The Commentator Metaph xii says the same thing namely that the separated substances are divided into intellect and will And it is in keeping with the order of the universe for the highest intellectual creature to be entirely intelligent and not in part as is our soul For this reason the angels are called intellects and minds as was said above A three ad one A twofold answer can be returned to the contrary objections First it may be replied that those authorities are speaking according to the opinion of such men as contended that angels and demons have bodies naturally united to them Augustine often makes use of this opinion in his books although he does not mean to assert it hence he says De Civ Dei xxi that such an inquiry does not call for much labor Secondly it may be said that such authorities and the like are to be understood by way of similitude Because since sense has a sure apprehension of its proper sensible object it is a common usage of speech when we understand something for certain to say that we sense it And hence it is that we use the word sentence Experience can be attributed to the angels according to the likeness of the things known although not by likeness of the faculty knowing them We have experience when we know single objects through the senses the angels likewise know single objects as we shall show Q fifty seven A two yet not through the senses But memory can be allowed in the angels according as Augustine De Trin x puts it in the mind although it cannot belong to them in so far as it is a part of the sensitive soul In like fashion a perverted phantasy is attributed to demons since they have a false practical estimate of what is the true good while deception in us comes properly from the phantasy whereby we sometimes hold fast to images of things as to the things themselves as is manifest in sleepers and lunatics QUESTION fifty five OF THE MEDIUM OF THE ANGELIC KNOWLEDGE In Three Articles Next in order the question arises as to the medium of the angelic knowledge Under this heading there are three points of inquiry one Do the angels know everything by their substance or by some species two If by species is it by connatural species or is it by such as they have derived from things three Do the higher angels know by more universal species than the lower angels FIRST ARTICLE I Q fifty five Art one Whether the Angels Know All Things by Their Substance Objection one It would seem that the angels know all things by their substance For Dionysius says Div Nom vii that the angels according to the proper nature of a mind know the things which are happening upon earth But the angel s nature is his essence Therefore the angel knows things by his essence Obj two Further according to the Philosopher Metaph xii text fifty one De Anima iii text fifteen in things which are without matter the intellect is the same as the object understood But the object understood is the same as the one who understands it as regards that whereby it is understood Therefore in things without matter such as the angels the medium whereby the object is understood is the very substance of the one understanding it Obj three Further everything which is contained in another is there according to the mode of the container But an angel has an intellectual nature Therefore whatever is in him is there in an intelligible mode But all things are in him because the lower orders of beings are essentially in the higher while the higher are in the lower participatively and therefore Dionysius says Div Nom iv that God enfolds the whole in the whole i e all in all Therefore the angel knows all things in his substance On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom iv that the angels are enlightened by the forms of things Therefore they know by the forms of things and not by their own substance I answer that The medium through which the intellect understands is compared to the intellect understanding it as its form because it is by the form that the agent acts Now in order that the faculty may be perfectly completed by the form it is necessary for all things to which the faculty extends to be contained under the form Hence it is that in things which are corruptible the form does not perfectly complete the potentiality of the matter because the potentiality of the matter extends to more things than are contained under this or that form But the intellective power of the angel extends to understanding all things because the object of the intellect is universal being or universal truth The angel s essence however does not comprise all things in itself since it is an essence restricted to a genus and species This is proper to the Divine essence which is infinite simply and perfectly to comprise all things in Itself Therefore God alone knows all things by His essence But an angel cannot know all things by his essence and his intellect must be perfected by some species in order to know things Reply Obj one When it is said that the angel knows things according to his own nature the words according to do not determine the medium of such knowledge since the medium is the similitude of the thing known but they denote the knowing power which belongs to the angel of his own nature Reply Obj two As the sense in act is the sensible in act as stated in De Anima ii text fifty three not so that the sensitive power is the sensible object s likeness contained in the sense but because one thing is made from both as from act and potentiality so likewise the intellect in act is said to be the thing understood in act not that the substance of the intellect is itself the similitude by which it understands but because that similitude is its form Now it is precisely the same thing to say in things which are without matter the intellect is the same thing as the object understood as to say that the intellect in act is the thing understood in act for a thing is actually understood precisely because it is immaterial Reply Obj three The things which are beneath the angel and those which are above him are in a measure in his substance not indeed perfectly nor according to their own proper formality because the angel s essence as being finite is distinguished by its own formality from other things but according to some common formality Yet all things are perfectly and according to their own formality in God s essence as in the first and universal operative power from which proceeds whatever is proper or common to anything Therefore God has a proper knowledge of all things by His own essence and this the angel has not but only a common knowledge SECOND ARTICLE I Q fifty five Art two Whether the Angels Understand by Species Drawn from Things Objection one It would seem that the angels understand by species drawn from things For everything understood is apprehended by some likeness within him who understands it But the likeness of the thing existing in another is there either by way of an exemplar so that the likeness is the cause of the thing or else by way of an image so that it is caused by such thing All knowledge then of the person understanding must either be the cause of the object understood or else caused by it Now the angel s knowledge is not the cause of existing things that belongs to the Divine knowledge alone Therefore it is necessary for the species by which the angelic mind understands to be derived from things Obj two Further the angelic light is stronger than the light of the active intellect of the soul But the light of the active intellect abstracts intelligible species from phantasms Therefore the light of the angelic mind can also abstract species from sensible things So there is nothing to hinder us from saying that the angel understands through species drawn from things Obj three Further the species in the intellect are indifferent to what is present or distant except in so far as they are taken from sensible objects Therefore if the angel does not understand by species drawn from things his knowledge would be indifferent as to things present and distant and so he would be moved locally to no purpose On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom vii that the angels do not gather their Divine knowledge from things divisible or sensible I answer that The species whereby the angels understand are not drawn from things but are connatural to them For we must observe that there is a similarity between the distinction and order of spiritual substances and the distinction and order of corporeal substances The highest bodies have in their nature a potentiality which is fully perfected by the form whereas in the lower bodies the potentiality of matter is not entirely perfected by the form but receives from some agent now one form now another In like fashion also the lower intellectual substances that is to say human souls have a power of understanding which is not naturally complete but is successively completed in them by their drawing intelligible species from things But in the higher spiritual substances that is the angels the power of understanding is naturally complete by intelligible species in so far as they have such species connatural to them so as to understand all things which they can know naturally The same is evident from the manner of existence of such substances The lower spiritual substances that is souls have a nature akin to a body in so far as they are the forms of bodies and consequently from their very mode of existence it behooves them to seek their intelligible perfection from bodies and through bodies otherwise they would be united with bodies to no purpose On the other hand the higher substances that is the angels are utterly free from bodies and subsist immaterially and in their own intelligible nature consequently they attain their intelligible perfection through an intelligible outpouring whereby they received from God the species of things known together with their intellectual nature Hence Augustine says general ad lit ii eight The other things which are lower than the angels are so created that they first receive existence in the knowledge of the rational creature and then in their own nature Reply Obj one There are images of creatures in the angel s mind not indeed derived from creatures but from God Who is the cause of creatures and in Whom the likenesses of creatures first exist Hence Augustine says general ad lit ii eight that As the type according to which the creature is fashioned is in the Word of God before the creature which is fashioned so the knowledge of the same type exists first in the intellectual creature and is afterwards the very fashioning of the creature Reply Obj two To go from one extreme to the other it is necessary to pass through the middle Now the nature of a form in the imagination which form is without matter but not without material conditions stands midway between the nature of a form which is in matter and the nature of a form which is in the intellect by abstraction from matter and from material conditions Consequently however powerful the angelic mind might be it could not reduce material forms to an intelligible condition except it were first to reduce them to the nature of imagined forms which is impossible since the angel has no imagination as was said above Q fifty four A five Even granted that he could abstract intelligible species from material things yet he would not do so because he would not need them for he has connatural intelligible species Reply Obj three The angel s knowledge is quite indifferent as to what is near or distant Nevertheless his local movement is not purposeless on that account for he is not moved to a place for the purpose of acquiring knowledge but for the purpose of operation THIRD ARTICLE I Q fifty five Art three Whether the Higher Angels Understand by More Universal Species Than the Lower Angels Objection one It would seem that the higher angels do not understand by more universal species than the lower angels For the universal seemingly is what is abstracted from particulars But angels do not understand by species abstracted from things Therefore it cannot be said that the species of the angelic intellect are more or less universal Obj two Further whatever is known in detail is more perfectly known than what is known generically because to know anything generically is in a fashion midway between potentiality and act If therefore the higher angels know by more universal species than the lower it follows that the higher have a more imperfect knowledge than the lower which is not befitting Obj three Further the same cannot be the proper type of many But if the higher angel knows various things by one universal form which the lower angel knows by several special forms it follows that the higher angel uses one universal form for knowing various things Therefore he will not be able to have a proper knowledge of each which seems unbecoming On the contrary Dionysius says Coel Hier xii that the higher angels have a more universal knowledge than the lower And in De Causis it is said that the higher angels have more universal forms I answer that For this reason are some things of a more exalted nature because they are nearer to and more like unto the first which is God Now in God the whole plenitude of intellectual knowledge is contained in one thing that is to say in the Divine essence by which God knows all things This plenitude of knowledge is found in created intellects in a lower manner and less simply Consequently it is necessary for the lower intelligences to know by many forms what God knows by one and by so many forms the more according as the intellect is lower Thus the higher the angel is by so much the fewer species will he be able to apprehend the whole mass of intelligible objects Therefore his forms must be more universal each one of them as it were extending to more things An example of this can in some measure be observed in ourselves For some people there are who cannot grasp an intelligible truth unless it be explained to them in every part and detail this comes of their weakness of intellect while there are others of stronger intellect who can grasp many things from few Reply Obj one It is accidental to the universal to be abstracted from particulars in so far as the intellect knowing it derives its knowledge from things But if there be an intellect which does not derive its knowledge from things the universal which it knows will not be abstracted from things but in a measure will be pre existing to them either according to the order of causality as the universal ideas of things are in the Word of God or at least in the order of nature as the universal ideas of things are in the angelic mind Reply Obj two To know anything universally can be taken in two senses In one way on the part of the thing known namely that only the universal nature of the thing is known To know a thing thus is something less perfect for he would have but an imperfect knowledge of a man who only knew him to be an animal In another way on the part of the medium of such knowledge In this way it is more perfect to know a thing in the universal for the intellect which by one universal medium can know each of the things which are properly contained in it is more perfect than one which cannot Reply Obj three The same cannot be the proper and adequate type of several things But if it be eminent then it can be taken as the proper type and likeness of many Just as in man there is a universal prudence with respect to all the acts of the virtues which can be taken as the proper type and likeness of that prudence which in the lion leads to acts of magnanimity and in the fox to acts of wariness and so on of the rest The Divine essence on account of Its eminence is in like fashion taken as the proper type of each thing contained therein hence each one is likened to It according to its proper type The same applies to the universal form which is in the mind of the angel so that on account of its excellence many things can be known through it with a proper knowledge QUESTION fifty six OF THE ANGEL S KNOWLEDGE OF IMMATERIAL THINGS In Three Articles We now inquire into the knowledge of the angels with regard to the objects known by them We shall treat of their knowledge first of immaterial things secondly of things material Under the first heading there are three points of inquiry one Does an angel know himself two Does one angel know another three Does the angel know God by his own natural principles FIRST ARTICLE I Q fifty six Art one Whether an Angel Knows Himself Objection one It would seem that an angel does not know himself For Dionysius says that the angels do not know their own powers Coel Hier vi But when the substance is known the power is known Therefore an angel does not know his own essence Obj two Further an angel is a single substance otherwise he would not act since acts belong to single subsistences But nothing single is intelligible Therefore since the angel possesses only knowledge which is intellectual no angel can know himself Obj three Further the intellect is moved by the intelligible object because as stated in De Anima iii four understanding is a kind of passion But nothing is moved by or is passive to itself as appears in corporeal things Therefore the angel cannot understand himself On the contrary Augustine says general ad lit ii that the angel knew himself when he was established that is enlightened by truth I answer that As is evident from what has been previously said Q fourteen A two Q fifty four A two the object is on a different footing in an immanent and in a transient action In a transient action the object or matter into which the action passes is something separate from the agent as the thing heated is from what gave it heat and the building from the builder whereas in an immanent action for the action to proceed the object must be united with the agent just as the sensible object must be in contact with sense in order that sense may actually perceive And the object which is united to a faculty bears the same relation to actions of this kind as does the form which is the principle of action in other agents for as heat is the formal principle of heating in the fire so is the species of the thing seen the formal principle of sight to the eye It must however be borne in mind that this image of the object exists sometimes only potentially in the knowing faculty and then there is only knowledge in potentiality and in order that there may be actual knowledge it is required that the faculty of knowledge be actuated by the species But if it always actually possesses the species it can thereby have actual knowledge without any preceding change or reception From this it is evident that it is not of the nature of knower as knowing to be moved by the object but as knowing in potentiality Now for the form to be the principle of the action it makes no difference whether it be inherent in something else or self subsisting because heat would give forth heat none the less if it were self subsisting than it does by inhering in something else So therefore if in the order of intelligible beings there be any subsisting intelligible form it will understand itself And since an angel is immaterial he is a subsisting form and consequently he is actually intelligible Hence it follows that he understands himself by his form which is his substance Reply Obj one That is the text of the old translation which is amended in the new one and runs thus furthermore they that is to say the angels knew their own powers instead of which the old translation read and furthermore they do not know their own powers Although even the letter of the old translation might be kept in this respect that the angels do not know their own power perfectly according as it proceeds from the order of the Divine Wisdom Which to the angels is incomprehensible Reply Obj two We have no knowledge of single corporeal things not because of their particularity but on account of the matter which is their principle of individuation Accordingly if there be any single things subsisting without matter as the angels are there is nothing to prevent them from being actually intelligible Reply Obj three It belongs to the intellect in so far as it is in potentiality to be moved and to be passive Hence this does not happen in the angelic intellect especially as regards the fact that he understands himself Besides the action of the intellect is not of the same nature as the action found in corporeal things which passes into some other matter SECOND ARTICLE I Q fifty six Art two Whether One Angel Knows Another Objection one It would seem that one angel does not know another For the Philosopher says De Anima iii text four that if the human intellect were to have in itself any one of the sensible things then such a nature existing within it would prevent it from apprehending external things as likewise if the pupil of the eye were colored with some particular color it could not see every color But as the human intellect is disposed for understanding corporeal things so is the angelic mind for understanding immaterial things Therefore since the angelic intellect has within itself some one determinate nature from the number of such natures it would seem that it cannot understand other natures Obj two Further it is stated in De Causis that every intelligence knows what is above it in so far as it is caused by it and what is beneath it in so far as it is its cause But one angel is not the cause of another Therefore one angel does not know another Obj three Further one angel cannot be known to another angel by the essence of the one knowing because all knowledge is effected by way of a likeness But the essence of the angel knowing is not like the essence of the angel known except generically as is clear from what has been said before Q fifty A four Q fifty five A one ad three Hence it follows that one angel would not have a particular knowledge of another but only a general knowledge In like manner it cannot be said that one angel knows another by the essence of the angel known because that whereby the intellect understands is something within the intellect whereas the Trinity alone can penetrate the mind Again it cannot be said that one angel knows the other by a species because that species would not differ from the angel understood since each is immaterial Therefore in no way does it appear that one angel can understand another Obj four Further if one angel did understand another this would be either by an innate species and so it would follow that if God were now to create another angel such an angel could not be known by the existing angels or else he would have to be known by a species drawn from things and so it would follow that the higher angels could not know the lower from whom they receive nothing Therefore in no way does it seem that one angel knows another On the contrary We read in De Causis that every intelligence knows the things which are not corrupted I answer that As Augustine says general ad lit lit ii such things as pre existed from eternity in the Word of God came forth from Him in two ways first into the angelic mind and secondly so as to subsist in their own natures They proceeded into the angelic mind in such a way that God impressed upon the angelic mind the images of the things which He produced in their own natural being Now in the Word of God from eternity there existed not only the forms of corporeal things but likewise the forms of all spiritual creatures So in every one of these spiritual creatures the forms of all things both corporeal and spiritual were impressed by the Word of God yet so that in every angel there was impressed the form of his own species according to both its natural and its intelligible condition so that he should subsist in the nature of his species and understand himself by it while the forms of other spiritual and corporeal natures were impressed in him only according to their intelligible natures so that by such impressed species he might know corporeal and spiritual creatures Reply Obj one The spiritual natures of the angels are distinguished from one another in a certain order as was already observed Q fifty A four ad one two So the nature of an angel does not hinder him from knowing the other angelic natures since both the higher and lower bear affinity to his nature the only difference being according to their various degrees of perfection Reply Obj two The nature of cause and effect does not lead one angel to know another except on account of likeness so far as cause and effect are alike Therefore if likeness without causality be admitted in the angels this will suffice for one to know another Reply Obj three One angel knows another by the species of such angel existing in his intellect which differs from the angel whose image it is not according to material and immaterial nature but according to natural and intentional existence The angel is himself a subsisting form in his natural being but his species in the intellect of another angel is not so for there it possesses only an intelligible existence As the form of color on the wall has a natural existence but in the deferent medium it has only intentional existence Reply Obj four God made every creature proportionate to the universe which He determined to make Therefore had God resolved to make more angels or more natures of things He would have impressed more intelligible species in the angelic minds as a builder who if he had intended to build a larger house would have made larger foundations Hence for God to add a new creature to the universe means that He would add a new intelligible species to an angel THIRD ARTICLE I Q fifty six Art three Whether an Angel Knows God by His Own Natural Principles Objection one It would seem that the angels cannot know God by their natural principles For Dionysius says Div Nom i that God by His incomprehensible might is placed above all heavenly minds Afterwards he adds that since He is above all substances He is remote from all knowledge Obj two Further God is infinitely above the intellect of an angel But what is infinitely beyond cannot be reached Therefore it appears that an angel cannot know God by his natural principles Obj three Further it is written one Cor thirteen twelve We see now through a glass in a dark manner but then face to face From this it appears that there is a twofold knowledge of God the one whereby He is seen in His essence according to which He is said to be seen face to face the other whereby He is seen in the mirror of creatures As was already shown Q twelve A four an angel cannot have the former knowledge by his natural principles Nor does vision through a mirror belong to the angels since they do not derive their knowledge of God from sensible things as Dionysius observes Div Nom vii Therefore the angels cannot know God by their natural powers On the contrary The angels are mightier in knowledge than men Yet men can know God through their natural principles according to Rom one nineteen what is known of God is manifest in them Therefore much more so can the angels I answer that The angels can have some knowledge of God by their own principles In evidence whereof it must be borne in mind that a thing is known in three ways first by the presence of its essence in the knower as light can be seen in the eye and so we have said that an angel knows himself secondly by the presence of its similitude in the power which knows it as a stone is seen by the eye from its image being in the eye thirdly when the image of the object known is not drawn directly from the object itself but from something else in which it is made to appear as when we behold a man in a mirror To the first named class that knowledge of God is likened by which He is seen through His essence and knowledge such as this cannot accrue to any creature from its natural principles as was said above Q twelve A four The third class comprises the knowledge whereby we know God while we are on earth by His likeness reflected in creatures according to Rom one twenty The invisible things of God are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made Hence too we are said to see God in a mirror But the knowledge whereby according to his natural principles the angel knows God stands midway between these two and is likened to that knowledge whereby a thing is seen through the species abstracted from it For since God s image is impressed on the very nature of the angel in his essence the angel knows God in as much as he is the image of God Yet he does not behold God s essence because no created likeness is sufficient to represent the Divine essence Such knowledge then approaches rather to the specular kind because the angelic nature is itself a kind of mirror representing the Divine image Reply Obj one Dionysius is speaking of the knowledge of comprehension as his words expressly state In this way God is not known by any created intellect Reply Obj two Since an angel s intellect and essence are infinitely remote from God it follows that he cannot comprehend Him nor can he see God s essence through his own nature Yet it does not follow on that account that he can have no knowledge of Him at all because as God is infinitely remote from the angel so the knowledge which God has of Himself is infinitely above the knowledge which an angel has of Him Reply Obj three The knowledge which an angel has of God is midway between these two kinds of knowledge nevertheless it approaches more to one of them as was said above QUESTION fifty seven OF THE ANGEL S KNOWLEDGE OF MATERIAL THINGS In Five Articles We next investigate the material objects which are known by the angels Under this heading there are five points of inquiry one Whether the angels know the natures of material things two Whether they know single things three Whether they know the future four Whether they know secret thoughts five Whether they know all mysteries of grace FIRST ARTICLE I Q fifty seven Art one Whether the Angels Know Material Things Objection one It would seem that the angels do not know material things For the object understood is the perfection of him who understands it But material things cannot be the perfections of angels since they are beneath them Therefore the angels do not know material things Obj two Further intellectual vision is only of such things as exist within the soul by their essence as is said in the gloss On two Cor twelve two taken from Augustine general ad lit xii twenty eight But the material things cannot enter by their essence into man s soul nor into the angel s mind Therefore they cannot be known by intellectual vision but only by imaginary vision whereby the images of bodies are apprehended and by sensible vision which regards bodies in themselves Now there is neither imaginary nor sensible vision in the angels but only intellectual Therefore the angels cannot know material things Obj three Further material things are not actually intelligible but are knowable by apprehension of sense and of imagination which does not exist in angels Therefore angels do not know material things On the contrary Whatever the lower power can do the higher can do likewise But man s intellect which in the order of nature is inferior to the angel s can know material things Therefore much more can the mind of an angel I answer that The established order of things is for the higher beings to be more perfect than the lower and for whatever is contained deficiently partially and in manifold manner in the lower beings to be contained in the higher eminently and in a certain degree of fulness and simplicity Therefore in God as in the highest source of things all things pre exist supersubstantially in respect of His simple Being itself as Dionysius says Div Nom one But among other creatures the angels are nearest to God and resemble Him most hence they share more fully and more perfectly in the Divine goodness as Dionysius says Coel Hier iv Consequently all material things pre exist in the angels more simply and less materially even than in themselves yet in a more manifold manner and less perfectly than in God Now whatever exists in any subject is contained in it after the manner of such subject But the angels are intellectual beings of their own nature Therefore as God knows material things by His essence so do the angels know them forasmuch as they are in the angels by their intelligible species Reply Obj one The thing understood is the perfection of the one who understands by reason of the intelligible species which he has in his intellect And thus the intelligible species which are in the intellect of an angel are perfections and acts in regard to that intellect Reply Obj two Sense does not apprehend the essences of things but only their outward accidents In like manner neither does the imagination for it apprehends only the images of bodies The intellect alone apprehends the essences of things Hence it is said De Anima iii text twenty six that the object of the intellect is what a thing is regarding which it does not err as neither does sense regarding its proper sensible object So therefore the essences of material things are in the intellect of man and angels as the thing understood is in him who understands and not according to their real natures But some things are in an intellect or in the soul according to both natures and in either case there is intellectual vision Reply Obj three If an angel were to draw his knowledge of material things from the material things themselves he would require to make them actually intelligible by a process of abstraction But he does not derive his knowledge of them from the material things themselves he has knowledge of material things by actually intelligible species of things which species are connatural to him just as our intellect has by species which it makes intelligible by abstraction SECOND ARTICLE I Q fifty seven Art two Whether an Angel Knows Singulars Objection one It would seem that angels do not know singulars For the Philosopher says Poster i text twenty two The sense has for its object singulars but the intellect universals Now in the angels there is no power of understanding save the intellectual power as is evident from what was said above Q fifty four A five Consequently they do not know singulars Obj two Further all knowledge comes about by some assimilation of the knower to the object known But it is not possible for any assimilation to exist between an angel and a singular object in so far as it is singular because as was observed above Q fifty A two an angel is immaterial while matter is the principle of singularity Therefore the angel cannot know singulars Obj three Further if an angel does know singulars it is either by singular or by universal species It is not by singular species because in this way he would require to have an infinite number of species Nor is it by universal species since the universal is not the sufficient principle for knowing the singular as such because singular things are not known in the universal except potentially Therefore the angel does not know singulars On the contrary No one can guard what he does not know But angels guard individual men according to Ps ninety eleven He hath given His angels charge over Thee Consequently the angels know singulars I answer that Some have denied to the angels all knowledge of singulars In the first place this derogates from the Catholic faith which asserts that these lower things are administered by angels according to Heb one fourteen They are all ministering spirits Now if they had no knowledge of singulars they could exercise no provision over what is going on in this world since acts belong to individuals and this is against the text of Eccles five five Say not before the angel There is no providence Secondly it is also contrary to the teachings of philosophy according to which the angels are stated to be the movers of the heavenly spheres and to move them according to their knowledge and will Consequently others have said that the angel possesses knowledge of singulars but in their universal causes to which all particular effects are reduced as if the astronomer were to foretell a coming eclipse from the dispositions of the movements of the heavens This opinion does not escape the aforesaid implications because to know a singular merely in its universal causes is not to know it as singular that is as it exists here and now The astronomer knowing from computation of the heavenly movements that an eclipse is about to happen knows it in the universal yet he does not know it as taking place now except by the senses But administration providence and movement are of singulars as they are here and now existing Therefore it must be said differently that as man by his various powers of knowledge knows all classes of things apprehending universals and immaterial things by his intellect and things singular and corporeal by the senses so an angel knows both by his one mental power For the order of things runs in this way that the higher a thing is so much the more is its power united and far reaching thus in man himself it is manifest that the common sense which is higher than the proper sense although it is but one faculty knows everything apprehended by the five outward senses and some other things which no outer sense knows for example the difference between white and sweet The same is to be observed in other cases Accordingly since an angel is above man in the order of nature it is unreasonable to say that a man knows by any one of his powers something which an angel by his one faculty of knowledge namely the intellect does not know Hence Aristotle pronounces it ridiculous to say that a discord which is known to us should be unknown to God De Anima i text eighty Metaph text fifteen The manner in which an angel knows singular things can be considered from this that as things proceed from God in order that they may subsist in their own natures so likewise they proceed in order that they may exist in the angelic mind Now it is clear that there comes forth from God not only whatever belongs to their universal nature but likewise all that goes to make up their principles of individuation since He is the cause of the entire substance of the thing as to both its matter and its form And for as much as He causes does He know for His knowledge is the cause of a thing as was shown above Q fourteen A eight Therefore as by His essence by which He causes all things God is the likeness of all things and knows all things not only as to their universal natures but also as to their singularity so through the species imparted to them do the angels know things not only as to their universal nature but likewise in their individual conditions in so far as they are the manifold representations of that one simple essence Reply Obj one The Philosopher is speaking of our intellect which apprehends only by a process of abstraction and by such abstraction from material conditions the thing abstracted becomes a universal Such a manner of understanding is not in keeping with the nature of the angels as was said above Q fifty five A two A three ad one and consequently there is no comparison Reply Obj two It is not according to their nature that the angels are likened to material things as one thing resembles another by agreement in genus species or accident but as the higher bears resemblance to the lower as the sun does to fire Even in this way there is in God a resemblance of all things as to both matter and form in so far as there pre exists in Him as in its cause whatever is to be found in things For the same reason the species in the angel s intellect which are images drawn from the Divine essence are the images of things not only as to their form but also as to their matter Reply Obj three Angels know singulars by universal forms which nevertheless are the images of things both as to their universal and as to their individuating principles How many things can be known by the same species has been already stated above Q fifty five A three ad three THIRD ARTICLE I Q fifty seven Art three Whether Angels Know the Future Objection one It would seem that the angels know future events For angels are mightier in knowledge than men But some men know many future events Therefore much more do the angels Obj two Further the present and the future are differences of time But the angel s intellect is above time because as is said in De Causis an intelligence keeps pace with eternity that is aeviternity Therefore to the angel s mind past and future are not different but he knows each indifferently Obj three Further the angel does not understand by species derived from things but by innate universal species But universal species refer equally to present past and future Therefore it appears that the angels know indifferently things past present and future Obj four Further as a thing is spoken of as distant by reason of time so is it by reason of place But angels know things which are distant according to place Therefore they likewise know things distant according to future time On the contrary Whatever is the exclusive sign of the Divinity does not belong to the angels But to know future events is the exclusive sign of the Divinity according to Isa forty one twenty three Show the things that are to come hereafter and we shall know that ye are gods Therefore the angels do not know future events I answer that The future can be known in two ways First it can be known in its cause And thus future events which proceed necessarily from their causes are known with sure knowledge as that the sun will rise tomorrow But events which proceed from their causes in the majority of cases are not known for certain but conjecturally thus the doctor knows beforehand the health of the patient This manner of knowing future events exists in the angels and by so much the more than it does in us as they understand the causes of things both more universally and more perfectly thus doctors who penetrate more deeply into the causes of an ailment can pronounce a surer verdict on the future issue thereof But events which proceed from their causes in the minority of cases are quite unknown such as casual and chance events In another way future events are known in themselves To know the future in this way belongs to God alone and not merely to know those events which happen of necessity or in the majority of cases but even casual and chance events for God sees all things in His eternity which being simple is present to all time and embraces all time And therefore God s one glance is cast over all things which happen in all time as present before Him and He beholds all things as they are in themselves as was said before when dealing with God s knowledge Q fourteen A thirteen But the mind of an angel and every created intellect fall far short of God s eternity hence the future as it is in itself cannot be known by any created intellect Reply Obj one Men cannot know future things except in their causes or by God s revelation The angels know the future in the same way but much more distinctly Reply Obj two Although the angel s intellect is above that time according to which corporeal movements are reckoned yet there is a time in his mind according to the succession of intelligible concepts of which Augustine says general ad lit viii that God moves the spiritual creature according to time And thus since there is succession in the angel s intellect not all things that happen through all time are present to the angelic mind Reply Obj three Although the species in the intellect of an angel in so far as they are species refer equally to things present past and future nevertheless the present past and future nevertheless the present past and future do not bear the same relations to the species Present things have a nature according to which they resemble the species in the mind of an angel and so they can be known thereby Things which are yet to come have not yet a nature whereby they are likened to such species consequently they cannot be known by those species Reply Obj four Things distant according to place are already existing in nature and share in some species whose image is in the angel whereas this is not true of future things as has been stated Consequently there is no comparison FOURTH ARTICLE I Q fifty seven Art four Whether Angels Know Secret Thoughts Objection one It would seem that the angels know secret thoughts For Gregory Moral xviii explaining Job twenty eight seventeen Gold or crystal cannot equal it says that then namely in the bliss of those rising from the dead one shall be as evident to another as he is to himself and when once the mind of each is seen his conscience will at the same time be penetrated But those who rise shall be like the angels as is stated Matt twenty two thirty Therefore an angel can see what is in another s conscience Obj two Further intelligible species bear the same relation to the intellect as shapes do to bodies But when the body is seen its shape is seen Therefore when an intellectual substance is seen the intelligible species within it is also seen Consequently when one angel beholds another or even a soul it seems that he can see the thoughts of both Obj three Further the ideas of our intellect resemble the angel more than do the images in our imagination because the former are actually understood while the latter are understood only potentially But the images in our imagination can be known by an angel as corporeal things are known because the imagination is a corporeal faculty Therefore it seems that an angel can know the thoughts of the intellect On the contrary What is proper to God does not belong to the angels But it is proper to God to read the secrets of hearts according to Jer seventeen nine The heart is perverse above all things and unsearchable who can know it I am the Lord Who search the heart Therefore angels do not know the secrets of hearts I answer that A secret thought can be known in two ways first in its effect In this way it can be known not only by an angel but also by man and with so much the greater subtlety according as the effect is the more hidden For thought is sometimes discovered not merely by outward act but also by change of countenance and doctors can tell some passions of the soul by the mere pulse Much more then can angels or even demons the more deeply they penetrate those occult bodily modifications Hence Augustine says De divin daemon that demons sometimes with the greatest faculty learn man s dispositions not only when expressed by speech but even when conceived in thought when the soul expresses them by certain signs in the body although Retract ii thirty he says it cannot be asserted how this is done In another way thoughts can be known as they are in the mind and affections as they are in the will and thus God alone can know the thoughts of hearts and affections of wills The reason of this is because the rational creature is subject to God only and He alone can work in it Who is its principal object and last end this will be developed later Q sixty three A one Q one hundred five A five Consequently all that is in the will and all things that depend only on the will are known to God alone Now it is evident that it depends entirely on the will for anyone actually to consider anything because a man who has a habit of knowledge or any intelligible species uses them at will Hence the Apostle says one Cor two eleven For what man knoweth the things of a man but the spirit of a man that is in him Reply Obj one In the present life one man s thought is not known by another owing to a twofold hindrance namely on account of the grossness of the body and because the will shuts up its secrets The first obstacle will be removed at the Resurrection and does not exist at all in the angels while the second will remain and is in the angels now Nevertheless the brightness of the body will show forth the quality of the soul as to its amount of grace and of glory In this way one will be able to see the mind of another Reply Obj two Although one angel sees the intelligible species of another by the fact that the species are proportioned to the rank of these substances according to greater or lesser universality yet it does not follow that one knows how far another makes use of them by actual consideration Reply Obj three The appetite of the brute does not control its act but follows the impression of some other corporeal or spiritual cause Since therefore the angels know corporeal things and their dispositions they can thereby know what is passing in the appetite or in the imaginative apprehension of the brute beasts and even of man in so far as the sensitive appetite sometimes through following some bodily impression influences his conduct as always happens in brutes Yet the angels do not necessarily know the movement of the sensitive appetite and the imaginative apprehension of man in so far as these are moved by the will and reason because even the lower part of the soul has some share of reason as obeying its ruler as is said in Ethics iii twelve But it does not follow that if the angel knows what is passing through man s sensitive appetite or imagination he knows what is in the thought or will because the intellect or will is not subject to the sensitive appetite or the imagination but can make various uses of them FIFTH ARTICLE I Q fifty seven Art five Whether the Angels Know the Mysteries of Grace Objection one It would seem that the angels know mysteries of grace For the mystery of the Incarnation is the most excellent of all mysteries But the angels knew of it from the beginning for Augustine says general ad lit v nineteen This mystery was hidden in God through the ages yet so that it was known to the princes and powers in heavenly places And the Apostle says one Tim three sixteen That great mystery of godliness appeared unto angels Vulg Great is the mystery of godliness which appeared unto angels Therefore the angels know the mysteries of grace Obj two Further the reasons of all mysteries of grace are contained in the Divine wisdom But the angels behold God s wisdom which is His essence Therefore they know the mysteries of grace Obj three Further the prophets are enlightened by the angels as is clear from Dionysius Coel Hier iv But the prophets knew mysteries of grace for it is said Amos three seven For the Lord God doth nothing without revealing His secret to His servants the prophets Therefore angels know the mysteries of grace On the contrary No one learns what he knows already Yet even the highest angels seek out and learn mysteries of grace For it is stated Coel Hier vii that Sacred Scripture describes some heavenly essences as questioning Jesus and learning from Him the knowledge of His Divine work for us and Jesus as teaching them directly as is evident in Isa sixty three one where on the angels asking Who is he who cometh up from Edom Jesus answered It is I Who speak justice Therefore the angels do not know mysteries of grace I answer that There is a twofold knowledge in the angel The first is his natural knowledge according to which he knows things both by his essence and by innate species By such knowledge the angels cannot know mysteries of grace For these mysteries depend upon the pure will of God and if an angel cannot learn the thoughts of another angel which depend upon the will of such angel much less can he ascertain what depends entirely upon God s will The Apostle reasons in this fashion one Cor two eleven No one knoweth the things of a man Vulg What man knoweth the things of a man but but the spirit of a man that is in him So the things also that are of God no man knoweth but the Spirit of God There is another knowledge of the angels which renders them happy it is the knowledge whereby they see the Word and things in the Word By such vision they know mysteries of grace but not all mysteries nor do they all know them equally but just as God wills them to learn by revelation as the Apostle says one Cor two ten But to us God hath revealed them through His Spirit yet so that the higher angels beholding the Divine wisdom more clearly learn more and deeper mysteries in the vision of God which mysteries they communicate to the lower angels by enlightening them Some of these mysteries they knew from the very beginning of their creation others they are taught afterwards as befits their ministrations Reply Obj one One can speak in two ways of the mystery of the Incarnation First of all in general and in this way it was revealed to all from the commencement of their beatitude The reason of this is that this is a kind of general principle to which all their duties are ordered For all are Vulg Are they not all ministering spirits sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation Heb one fourteen and this is brought about by the mystery of the Incarnation Hence it was necessary for all of them to be instructed in this mystery from the very beginning We can speak of the mystery of the Incarnation in another way as to its special conditions Thus not all the angels were instructed on all points from the beginning even the higher angels learned these afterwards as appears from the passage of Dionysius already quoted Reply Obj two Although the angels in bliss behold the Divine wisdom yet they do not comprehend it So it is not necessary for them to know everything hidden in it Reply Obj three Whatever the prophets knew by revelation of the mysteries of grace was revealed in a more excellent way to the angels And although God revealed in general to the prophets what He was one day to do regarding the salvation of the human race still the apostles knew some particulars of the same which the prophets did not know Thus we read Eph three four five As you reading may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other generations was not known to the sons of men as it is now revealed to His holy apostles Among the prophets also the later ones knew what the former did not know according to Ps one hundred eighteen one hundred I have had understanding above ancients and Gregory says The knowledge of Divine things increased as time went on Hom xvi in Ezech QUESTION fifty eight OF THE MODE OF ANGELIC KNOWLEDGE In Seven Articles After the foregoing we have now to treat of the mode of the angelic knowledge concerning which there are seven points of inquiry one Whether the angel s intellect be sometimes in potentiality and sometimes in act two Whether the angel can understand many things at the same time three Whether the angel s knowledge is discursive four Whether he understands by composing and dividing five Whether there can be error in the angel s intellect six Whether his knowledge can be styled as morning and evening seven Whether the morning and evening knowledge are the same or do they differ FIRST ARTICLE I Q fifty eight Art one Whether the Angel s Intellect Is Sometimes in Potentiality Sometimes in Act Objection one It would seem that the angel s intellect is sometimes in potentiality and sometimes in act For movement is the act of what is in potentiality as stated in Phys iii six But the angels minds are moved by understanding as Dionysius says Div Nom iv Therefore the angelic minds are sometimes in potentiality Obj two Further since desire is of a thing not possessed but possible to have whoever desires to know anything is in potentiality thereto But it is said one Pet one twelve On Whom the angels desire to look Therefore the angel s intellect is sometimes in potentiality Obj three Further in the book De Causis it is stated that an intelligence understands according to the mode of its substance But the angel s intelligence has some admixture of potentiality Therefore it sometimes understands potentially On the contrary Augustine says general ad lit ii Since the angels were created in the eternity of the Word they enjoy holy and devout contemplation Now a contemplating intellect is not in potentiality but in act Therefore the intellect of an angel is not in potentiality I answer that As the Philosopher states De Anima iii text eight Phys viii thirty two the intellect is in potentiality in two ways first as before learning or discovering that is before it has the habit of knowledge secondly as when it possesses the habit of knowledge but does not actually consider In the first way an angel s intellect is never in potentiality with regard to the things to which his natural knowledge extends For as the higher namely the heavenly bodies have no potentiality to existence which is not fully actuated in the same way the heavenly intellects the angels have no intelligible potentiality which is not fully completed by connatural intelligible species But with regard to things divinely revealed to them there is nothing to hinder them from being in potentiality because even the heavenly bodies are at times in potentiality to being enlightened by the sun In the second way an angel s intellect can be in potentiality with regard to things learnt by natural knowledge for he is not always actually considering everything that he knows by natural knowledge But as to the knowledge of the Word and of the things he beholds in the Word he is never in this way in potentiality because he is always actually beholding the Word and the things he sees in the Word For the bliss of the angels consists in such vision and beatitude does not consist in habit but in act as the Philosopher says Ethic i eight Reply Obj one Movement is taken there not as the act of something imperfect that is of something existing in potentiality but as the act of something perfect that is of one actually existing In this way understanding and feeling are termed movements as stated in De Anima iii text twenty eight Reply Obj two Such desire on the part of the angels does not exclude the object desired but weariness thereof Or they are said to desire the vision of God with regard to fresh revelations which they receive from God to fit them for the tasks which they have to perform Reply Obj three In the angel s substance there is no potentiality divested of act In the same way the angel s intellect is never so in potentiality as to be without act SECOND ARTICLE I Q fifty eight Art two Whether an Angel Can Understand Many Things at the Same Time Objection one It would seem that an angel cannot understand many things at the same time For the Philosopher says Topic ii four that it may happen that we know many things but understand only one Obj two Further nothing is understood unless the intellect be informed by an intelligible species just at the body is formed by shape But one body cannot be formed into many shapes Therefore neither can one intellect simultaneously understand various intelligible things Obj three Further to understand is a kind of movement But no movement terminates in various terms Therefore many things cannot be understood altogether On the contrary Augustine says general ad lit iv thirty two The spiritual faculty of the angelic mind comprehends most easily at the same time all things that it wills I answer that As unity of term is requisite for unity of movement so is unity of object required for unity of operation Now it happens that several things may be taken as several or as one like the parts of a continuous whole For if each of the parts be considered severally they are many consequently neither by sense nor by intellect are they grasped by one operation nor all at once In another way they are taken as forming one in the whole and so they are grasped both by sense and intellect all at once and by one operation as long as the entire continuous whole is considered as is stated in De Anima iii text twenty three In this way our intellect understands together both the subject and the predicate as forming parts of one proposition and also two things compared together according as they agree in one point of comparison From this it is evident that many things in so far as they are distinct cannot be understood at once but in so far as they are comprised under one intelligible concept they can be understood together Now everything is actually intelligible according as its image is in the intellect All things then which can be known by one intelligible species are known as one intelligible object and therefore are understood simultaneously But things known by various intelligible species are apprehended as different intelligible objects Consequently by such knowledge as the angels have of things through the Word they know all things under one intelligible species which is the Divine essence Therefore as regards such knowledge they know all things at once just as in heaven our thoughts will not be fleeting going and returning from one thing to another but we shall survey all our knowledge at the same time by one glance as Augustine says De Trin xv sixteen But by that knowledge wherewith the angels know things by innate species they can at one time know all things which can be comprised under one species but not such as are under various species Reply Obj one To understand many things as one is so to speak to understand one thing Reply Obj two The intellect is informed by the intelligible species which it has within it So it can behold at the same time many intelligible objects under one species as one body can by one shape be likened to many bodies To the third objection the answer is the same as the first THIRD ARTICLE I Q fifty eight Art three Whether an Angel s Knowledge Is Discursive Objection one It would seem that the knowledge of an angel is discursive For the discursive movement of the mind comes from one thing being known through another But the angels know one thing through another for they know creatures through the Word Therefore the intellect of an angel knows by discursive method Obj two Further whatever a lower power can do the higher can do But the human intellect can syllogize and know causes in effects all of which is the discursive method Therefore the intellect of the angel which is higher in the order of nature can with greater reason do this Obj three Further Isidore De sum bono i ten says that demons learn more things by experience But experimental knowledge is discursive for one experience comes of many remembrances and one universal from many experiences as Aristotle observes Poster ii Metaph vii Therefore an angel s knowledge is discursive On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom vii that the angels do not acquire Divine knowledge from separate discourses nor are they led to something particular from something common I answer that As has often been stated A one Q fifty five A one the angels hold that grade among spiritual substances which the heavenly bodies hold among corporeal substances for Dionysius calls them heavenly minds loc cit Now the difference between heavenly and earthly bodies is this that earthly bodies obtain their last perfection by chance and movement while the heavenly bodies have their last perfection at once from their very nature So likewise the lower namely the human intellects obtain their perfection in the knowledge of truth by a kind of movement and discursive intellectual operation that is to say as they advance from one known thing to another But if from the knowledge of a known principle they were straightway to perceive as known all its consequent conclusions then there would be no discursive process at all Such is the condition of the angels because in the truths which they know naturally they at once behold all things whatsoever that can be known in them Therefore they are called intellectual beings because even with ourselves the things which are instantly grasped by the mind are said to be understood intelligi hence intellect is defined as the habit of first principles But human souls which acquire knowledge of truth by the discursive method are called rational and this comes of the feebleness of their intellectual light For if they possessed the fulness of intellectual light like the angels then in the first aspect of principles they would at once comprehend their whole range by perceiving whatever could be reasoned out from them Reply Obj one Discursion expresses movement of a kind Now all movement is from something before to something after Hence discursive knowledge comes about according as from something previously known one attains to the knowledge of what is afterwards known and which was previously unknown But if in the thing perceived something else be seen at the same time as an object and its image are seen simultaneously in a mirror it is not discursive knowledge And in this way the angels know things in the Word Reply Obj two The angels can syllogize in the sense of knowing a syllogism and they see effects in causes and causes in effects yet they do not acquire knowledge of an unknown truth in this way by syllogizing from causes to effect or from effect to cause Reply Obj three Experience is affirmed of angels and demons simply by way of similitude forasmuch as they know sensible things which are present yet without any discursion withal FOURTH ARTICLE I Q fifty eight Art four Whether the Angels Understand by Composing and Dividing Objection one It would seem that the angels understand by composing and dividing For where there is multiplicity of things understood there is composition of the same as is said in De Anima iii text twenty one But there is a multitude of things understood in the angelic mind because angels apprehend different things by various species and not all at one time Therefore there is composition and division in the angel s mind Obj two Further negation is far more remote from affirmation than any two opposite natures are because the first of distinctions is that of affirmation and negation But the angel knows certain distant natures not by one but by diverse species as is evident from what was said A two Therefore he must know affirmation and negation by diverse species And so it seems that he understands by composing and dividing Obj three Further speech is a sign of the intellect But in speaking to men angels use affirmative and negative expressions which are signs of composition and of division in the intellect as is manifest from many passages of Sacred Scripture Therefore it seems that the angel understands by composing and dividing On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom vii that the intellectual power of the angel shines forth with the clear simplicity of divine concepts But a simple intelligence is without composition and division Therefore the angel understands without composition or division I answer that As in the intellect when reasoning the conclusion is compared with the principle so in the intellect composing and dividing the predicate is compared with the subject For if our intellect were to see at once the truth of the conclusion in the principle it would never understand by discursion and reasoning In like manner if the intellect in apprehending the quiddity of the subject were at once to have knowledge of all that can be attributed to or removed from the subject it would never understand by composing and dividing but only by understanding the essence Thus it is evident that for the self same reason our intellect understands by discursion and by composing and dividing namely that in the first apprehension of anything newly apprehended it does not at once grasp all that is virtually contained in it And this comes from the weakness of the intellectual light within us as has been said A three Hence since the intellectual light is perfect in the angel for he is a pure and most clear mirror as Dionysius says Div Nom iv it follows that as the angel does not understand by reasoning so neither does he by composing and dividing Nevertheless he understands the composition and the division of enunciations just as he apprehends the reasoning of syllogisms for he understands simply such things as are composite things movable immovably and material things immaterially Reply Obj one Not every multitude of things understood causes composition but a multitude of such things understood that one of them is attributed to or denied of another When an angel apprehends the nature of anything he at the same time understands whatever can be either attributed to it or denied of it Hence in apprehending a nature he by one simple perception grasps all that we can learn by composing and dividing Reply Obj two The various natures of things differ less as to their mode of existing than do affirmation and negation Yet as to the way in which they are known affirmation and negation have something more in common because directly the truth of an affirmation is known the falsehood of the opposite negation is known also Reply Obj three The fact that angels use affirmative and negative forms of speech shows that they know both composition and division yet not that they know by composing and dividing but by knowing simply the nature of a thing FIFTH ARTICLE I Q fifty eight Art five Whether There Can Be Falsehood in the Intellect of an Angel Objection one It would seem that there can be falsehood in the angel s intellect For perversity appertains to falsehood But as Dionysius says Div Nom iv there is a perverted fancy in the demons Therefore it seems that there can be falsehood in the intellect of the angels Obj two Further nescience is the cause of estimating falsely But as Dionysius says Eccl Hier vi there can be nescience in the angels Therefore it seems there can be falsehood in them Obj three Further everything which falls short of the truth of wisdom and which has a depraved reason has falsehood or error in its intellect But Dionysius Div Nom vii affirms this of the demons Therefore it seems that there can be error in the minds of the angels On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima iii text forty one that the intelligence is always true Augustine likewise says QQ eighty three qu thirty two that nothing but what is true can be the object of intelligence Therefore there can be neither deception nor falsehood in the angel s knowledge I answer that The truth of this question depends partly upon what has gone before For it has been said A four that an angel understands not by composing and dividing but by understanding what a thing is Now the intellect is always true as regards what a thing is just as the sense regarding its proper object as is said in De Anima iii text twenty six But by accident deception and falsehood creep in when we understand the essence of a thing by some kind of composition and this happens either when we take the definition of one thing for another or when the parts of a definition do not hang together as if we were to accept as the definition of some creature a four footed flying beast for there is no such animal And this comes about in things composite the definition of which is drawn from diverse elements one of which is as matter to the other But there is no room for error in understanding simple quiddities as is stated in Metaph ix text twenty two for either they are not grasped at all and so we know nothing respecting them or else they are known precisely as they exist So therefore no falsehood error or deception can exist of itself in the mind of any angel yet it does so happen accidentally but very differently from the way it befalls us For we sometimes get at the quiddity of a thing by a composing and dividing process as when by division and demonstration we seek out the truth of a definition Such is not the method of the angels but through the knowledge of the essence of a thing they know everything that can be said regarding it Now it is quite evident that the quiddity of a thing can be a source of knowledge with regard to everything belonging to such thing or excluded from it but not of what may be dependent on God s supernatural ordinance Consequently owing to their upright will from their knowing the nature of every creature the good angels form no judgments as to the nature of the qualities therein save under the Divine ordinance hence there can be no error or falsehood in them But since the minds of demons are utterly perverted from the Divine wisdom they at times form their opinions of things simply according to the natural conditions of the same Nor are they ever deceived as to the natural properties of anything but they can be misled with regard to supernatural matters for example on seeing a dead man they may suppose that he will not rise again or on beholding Christ they may judge Him not to be God From all this the answers to the objections of both sides of the question are evident For the perversity of the demons comes of their not being subject to the Divine wisdom while nescience is in the angels as regards things knowable not naturally but supernaturally It is furthermore evident that their understanding of what a thing is is always true save accidentally according as it is in an undue manner referred to some composition or division SIXTH ARTICLE I Q fifty eight A six Whether There Is a Morning and an Evening Knowledge in the Angels Objection one It would seem that there is neither an evening nor a morning knowledge in the angels because evening and morning have an admixture of darkness But there is no darkness in the knowledge of an angel since there is no error nor falsehood Therefore the angelic knowledge ought not to be termed morning and evening knowledge Obj two Further between evening and morning the night intervenes while noonday falls between morning and evening Consequently if there be a morning and an evening knowledge in the angels for the same reason it appears that there ought to be a noonday and a night knowledge Obj three Further knowledge is diversified according to the difference of the objects known hence the Philosopher says De Anima iii text thirty eight The sciences are divided just as things are But there is a threefold existence of things to wit in the Word in their own natures and in the angelic knowledge as Augustine observes general ad lit ii eight If therefore a morning and an evening knowledge be admitted in the angels because of the existence of things in the Word and in their own nature then there ought to be admitted a third class of knowledge on account of the existence of things in the angelic mind On the contrary Augustine general ad lit iv twenty two thirty one De Civ Dei xii seven twenty divides the knowledge of the angels into morning and evening knowledge I answer that The expression morning and evening knowledge was devised by Augustine who interprets the six days wherein God made all things not as ordinary days measured by the solar circuit since the sun was only made on the fourth day but as one day namely the day of angelic knowledge as directed to six classes of things As in the ordinary day morning is the beginning and evening the close of day so their knowledge of the primordial being of things is called morning knowledge and this is according as things exist in the Word But their knowledge of the very being of the thing created as it stands in its own nature is termed evening knowledge because the being of things flows from the Word as from a kind of primordial principle and this flow is terminated in the being which they have in themselves Reply Obj one Evening and morning knowledge in the angelic knowledge are not taken as compared to an admixture of darkness but as compared to beginning and end Or else it can be said as Augustine puts it general ad lit iv twenty three that there is nothing to prevent us from calling something light in comparison with one thing and darkness with respect to another In the same way the life of the faithful and the just is called light in comparison with the wicked according to Eph five eight You were heretofore darkness but now light in the Lord yet this very life of the faithful when set in contrast to the life of glory is termed darkness according to two Pet one nineteen You have the firm prophetic word whereunto you do well to attend as to a light that shineth in a dark place So the angel s knowledge by which he knows things in their own nature is day in comparison with ignorance or error yet it is dark in comparison with the vision of the Word Reply Obj two The morning and evening knowledge belong to the day that is to the enlightened angels who are quite apart from the darkness that is from the evil spirits The good angels while knowing the creature do not adhere to it for that would be to turn to darkness and to night but they refer this back to the praise of God in Whom as in their principle they know all things Consequently after evening there is no night but morning so that morning is the end of the preceding day and the beginning of the following in so far as the angels refer to God s praise their knowledge of the preceding work Noonday is comprised under the name of day as the middle between the two extremes Or else the noon can be referred to their knowledge of God Himself Who has neither beginning nor end Reply Obj three The angels themselves are also creatures Accordingly the existence of things in the angelic knowledge is comprised under evening knowledge as also the existence of things in their own nature SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q fifty eight Art seven Whether the Morning and Evening Knowledge Are One Objection one It would seem that the morning and the evening knowledge are one For it is said general one five There was evening and morning one day But by the expression day the knowledge of the angels is to be understood as Augustine says general ad lit iv twenty three Therefore the morning and evening knowledge of the angels are one and the same Obj two Further it is impossible for one faculty to have two operations at the same time But the angels are always using their morning knowledge because they are always beholding God and things in God according to Matt eighteen ten Therefore if the evening knowledge were different from the morning the angel could never exercise his evening knowledge Obj three Further the Apostle says one Cor thirteen ten When that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away But if the evening knowledge be different from the morning it is compared to it as the less perfect to the perfect Therefore the evening knowledge cannot exist together with the morning knowledge On the contrary Augustine says general ad lit iv twenty four There is a vast difference between knowing anything as it is in the Word of God and as it is in its own nature so that the former belongs to the day and the latter to the evening I answer that As was observed A six the evening knowledge is that by which the angels know things in their proper nature This cannot be understood as if they drew their knowledge from the proper nature of things so that the preposition in denotes the form of a principle because as has been already stated Q fifty five A two the angels do not draw their knowledge from things It follows then that when we say in their proper nature we refer to the aspect of the thing known in so far as it is an object of knowledge that is to say that the evening knowledge is in the angels in so far as they know the being of things which those things have in their own nature Now they know this through a twofold medium namely by innate ideas or by the forms of things existing in the Word For by beholding the Word they know not merely the being of things as existing in the Word but the being as possessed by the things themselves as God by contemplating Himself sees that being which things have in their own nature It therefore it be called evening knowledge in so far as when the angels behold the Word they know the being which things have in their proper nature then the morning and the evening knowledge are essentially one and the same and only differ as to the things known If it be called evening knowledge in so far as through innate ideas they know the being which things have in their own natures then the morning and the evening knowledge differ Thus Augustine seems to understand it when he assigns one as inferior to the other Reply Obj one The six days as Augustine understands them are taken as the six classes of things known by the angels so that the day s unit is taken according to the unit of the thing understood which nevertheless can be apprehended by various ways of knowing it Reply Obj two There can be two operations of the same faculty at the one time one of which is referred to the other as is evident when the will at the same time wills the end and the means to the end and the intellect at the same instant perceives principles and conclusions through those principles when it has already acquired knowledge As Augustine says general ad lit iv twenty four the evening knowledge is referred to the morning knowledge in the angels hence there is nothing to hinder both from being at the same time in the angels Reply Obj three On the coming of what is perfect the opposite imperfect is done away just as faith which is of the things that are not seen is made void when vision succeeds But the imperfection of the evening knowledge is not opposed to the perfection of the morning knowledge For that a thing be known in itself is not opposite to its being known in its cause Nor again is there any inconsistency in knowing a thing through two mediums one of which is more perfect and the other less perfect just as we can have a demonstrative and a probable medium for reaching the same conclusion In like manner a thing can be known by the angel through the uncreated Word and through an innate idea QUESTION fifty nine THE WILL OF THE ANGELS FOUR ARTICLES In the next place we must treat of things concerning the will of the angels In the first place we shall treat of the will itself secondly of its movement which is love Under the first heading there are four points of inquiry one Whether there is will in the angels two Whether the will of the angel is his nature or his intellect three Is there free will in the angels four Is there an irascible and a concupiscible appetite in them FIRST ARTICLE I Q fifty nine Art one Whether There Is Will in the Angels Objection one It would seem that there is no will in the angels For as the Philosopher says De Anima iii text forty two The will is in the reason But there is no reason in the angels but something higher than reason Therefore there is no will in the angels but something higher than the will Obj two Further the will is comprised under the appetite as is evident from the Philosopher De Anima iii text forty two But the appetite argues something imperfect because it is a desire of something not as yet possessed Therefore since there is no imperfection in the angels especially in the blessed ones it seems that there is no will in them Obj three Further the Philosopher says De Anima ii text fifty four that the will is a mover which is moved for it is moved by the appetible object understood Now the angels are immovable since they are incorporeal Therefore there is no will in the angels On the contrary Augustine says De Trin x eleven twelve that the image of the Trinity is found in the soul according to memory understanding and will But God s image is found not only in the soul of man but also in the angelic mind since it also is capable of knowing God Therefore there is will in the angels I answer that We must necessarily place a will in the angels In evidence thereof it must be borne in mind that since all things flow from the Divine will all things in their own way are inclined by appetite towards good but in different ways Some are inclined to good by their natural inclination without knowledge as plants and inanimate bodies Such inclination towards good is called a natural appetite Others again are inclined towards good but with some knowledge not that they know the aspect of goodness but that they apprehend some particular good as in the sense which knows the sweet the white and so on The inclination which follows this apprehension is called a sensitive appetite Other things again have an inclination towards good but with a knowledge whereby they perceive the aspect of goodness this belongs to the intellect This is most perfectly inclined towards what is good not indeed as if it were merely guided by another towards some particular good only like things devoid of knowledge nor towards some particular good only as things which have only sensitive knowledge but as inclined towards good in general Such inclination is termed will Accordingly since the angels by their intellect know the universal aspect of goodness it is manifest that there is a will in them Reply Obj one Reason surpasses sense in a different way from that in which intellect surpasses reason Reason surpasses sense according to the diversity of the objects known for sense judges of particular objects while reason judges of universals Therefore there must be one appetite tending towards good in the abstract which appetite belongs to reason and another with a tendency towards particular good which appetite belongs to sense But intellect and reason differ as to their manner of knowing because the intellect knows by simple intuition while reason knows by a process of discursion from one thing to another Nevertheless by such discursion reason comes to know what intellect learns without it namely the universal Consequently the object presented to the appetitive faculty on the part of reason and on the part of intellect is the same Therefore in the angels who are purely intellectual there is no appetite higher than the will Reply Obj two Although the name of the appetitive part is derived from seeking things not yet possessed yet the appetitive part reaches out not to these things only but also to many other things thus the name of a stone lapis is derived from injuring the foot laesione pedis though not this alone belongs to a stone In the same way the irascible faculty is so denominated from anger ira though at the same time there are several other passions in it as hope daring and the rest Reply Obj three The will is called a mover which is moved according as to will and to understand are termed movements of a kind and there is nothing to prevent movement of this kind from existing in the angels since such movement is the act of a perfect agent as stated in De Anima iii text twenty eight SECOND ARTICLE I Q fifty nine Art two Whether in the Angels the Will Differs from the Intellect Objection one It would seem that in the angel the will does not differ from the intellect and from the nature For an angel is more simple than a natural body But a natural body is inclined through its form towards its end which is its good Therefore much more so is the angel Now the angel s form is either the nature in which he subsists or else it is some species within his intellect Therefore the angel inclines towards the good through his own nature or through an intelligible species But such inclination towards the good belongs to the will Therefore the will of the angel does not differ from his nature or his intellect Obj two Further the object of the intellect is the true while the object of the will is the good Now the good and the true differ not really but only logically Cf Q sixteen A four Therefore will and intellect are not really different Obj three Further the distinction of common and proper does not differentiate the faculties for the same power of sight perceives color and whiteness But the good and the true seem to be mutually related as common to particular for the true is a particular good to wit of the intellect Therefore the will whose object is the good does not differ from the intellect whose object is the true On the contrary The will in the angels regards good things only while their intellect regards both good and bad things for they know both Therefore the will of the angels is distinct from their intellect I answer that In the angels the will is a special faculty or power which is neither their nature nor their intellect That it is not their nature is manifest from this that the nature or essence of a thing is completely comprised within it whatever then extends to anything beyond it is not its essence Hence we see in natural bodies that the inclination to being does not come from anything superadded to the essence but from the matter which desires being before possessing it and from the form which keeps it in such being when once it exists But the inclination towards something extrinsic comes from something superadded to the essence as tendency to a place comes from gravity or lightness while the inclination to make something like itself comes from the active qualities Now the will has a natural tendency towards good Consequently there alone are essence and will identified where all good is contained within the essence of him who wills that is to say in God Who wills nothing beyond Himself except on account of His goodness This cannot be said of any creature because infinite goodness is quite foreign to the nature of any created thing Accordingly neither the will of the angel nor that of any creature can be the same thing as its essence In like manner neither can the will be the same thing as the intellect of angel or man Because knowledge comes about in so far as the object known is within the knower consequently the intellect extends itself to what is outside it according as what in its essence is outside it is disposed to be somehow within it On the other hand the will goes out to what is beyond it according as by a kind of inclination it tends in a manner to what is outside it Now it belongs to one faculty to have within itself something which is outside it and to another faculty to tend to what is outside it Consequently intellect and will must necessarily be different powers in every creature It is not so with God for He has within Himself universal being and the universal good Therefore both intellect and will are His nature Reply Obj one A natural body is moved to its own being by its substantial form while it is inclined to something outside by something additional as has been said Reply Obj two Faculties are not differentiated by any material difference of their objects but according to their formal distinction which is taken from the nature of the object as such Consequently the diversity derived from the notion of good and true suffices for the difference of intellect from will Reply Obj three Because the good and the true are really convertible it follows that the good is apprehended by the intellect as something true while the true is desired by the will as something good Nevertheless the diversity of their aspects is sufficient for diversifying the faculties as was said above ad two THIRD ARTICLE I Q fifty nine Art three Whether There Is Free Will in the Angels Objection one It would seem that there is no free will in the angels For the act of free will is to choose But there can be no choice with the angels because choice is the desire of something after taking counsel while counsel is a kind of inquiry as stated in Ethic iii three But the angels knowledge is not the result of inquiring for this belongs to the discursiveness of reason Therefore it appears that there is no free will in the angels Obj two Further free will implies indifference to alternatives But in the angels on the part of their intellect there is no such indifference because as was observed already Q fifty eight A five their intellect is not deceived as to things which are naturally intelligible to them Therefore neither on the part of their appetitive faculty can there be free will Obj three Further the natural endowments of the angels belong to them according to degrees of more or less because in the higher angels the intellectual nature is more perfect than in the lower But the free will does not admit of degrees Therefore there is no free will in them On the contrary Free will is part of man s dignity But the angels dignity surpasses that of men Therefore since free will is in men with much more reason is it in the angels I answer that Some things there are which act not from any previous judgment but as it were moved and made to act by others just as the arrow is directed to the target by the archer Others act from some kind of judgment but not from free will such as irrational animals for the sheep flies from the wolf by a kind of judgment whereby it esteems it to be hurtful to itself such a judgment is not a free one but implanted by nature Only an agent endowed with an intellect can act with a judgment which is free in so far as it apprehends the common note of goodness from which it can judge this or the other thing to be good Consequently wherever there is intellect there is free will It is therefore manifest that just as there is intellect so is there free will in the angels and in a higher degree of perfection than in man Reply Obj one The Philosopher is speaking of choice as it is in man As a man s estimate in speculative matters differs from an angel s in this that the one needs not to inquire while the other does so need so is it in practical matters Hence there is choice in the angels yet not with the inquisitive deliberation of counsel but by the sudden acceptance of truth Reply Obj two As was observed already A two knowledge is effected by the presence of the known within the knower Now it is a mark of imperfection in anything not to have within it what it should naturally have Consequently an angel would not be perfect in his nature if his intellect were not determined to every truth which he can know naturally But the act of the appetitive faculty comes of this that the affection is directed to something outside Yet the perfection of a thing does not come from everything to which it is inclined but only from something which is higher than it Therefore it does not argue imperfection in an angel if his will be not determined with regard to things beneath him but it would argue imperfection in him were he to be indeterminate to what is above him Reply Obj three Free will exists in a nobler manner in the higher angels than it does in the lower as also does the judgment of the intellect Yet it is true that liberty in so far as the removal of compulsion is considered is not susceptible of greater and less degree because privations and negations are not lessened nor increased directly of themselves but only by their cause or through the addition of some qualification FOURTH ARTICLE I Q fifty nine Art four Whether There Is an Irascible and a Concupiscible Appetite in the Angels Objection one It would seem that there is an irascible and a concupiscible appetite in the angels For Dionysius says Div Nom iv that in the demons there is unreasonable fury and wild concupiscence But demons are of the same nature as angels for sin has not altered their nature Therefore there is an irascible and a concupiscible appetite in the angels Obj two Further love and joy are in the concupiscible while anger hope and fear are in the irascible appetite But in the Sacred Scriptures these things are attributed both to the good and to the wicked angels Therefore there is an irascible and a concupiscible appetite in the angels Obj three Further some virtues are said to reside in the irascible appetite and some in the concupiscible thus charity and temperance appear to be in the concupiscible while hope and fortitude are in the irascible But these virtues are in the angels Therefore there is both a concupiscible and an irascible appetite in the angels On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima iii text forty two that the irascible and concupiscible are in the sensitive part which does not exist in angels Consequently there is no irascible or concupiscible appetite in the angels I answer that The intellective appetite is not divided into irascible and concupiscible only the sensitive appetite is so divided The reason of this is because since the faculties are distinguished from one another not according to the material but only by the formal distinction of objects if to any faculty there respond an object according to some common idea there will be no distinction of faculties according to the diversity of the particular things contained under that common idea Just as if the proper object of the power of sight be color as such then there are not several powers of sight distinguished according to the difference of black and white whereas if the proper object of any faculty were white as white then the faculty of seeing white would be distinguished from the faculty of seeing black Now it is quite evident from what has been said A one Q sixteen A one that the object of the intellective appetite otherwise known as the will is good according to the common aspect of goodness nor can there be any appetite except of what is good Hence in the intellective part the appetite is not divided according to the distinction of some particular good things as the sensitive appetite is divided which does not crave for what is good according to its common aspect but for some particular good object Accordingly since there exists in the angels only an intellective appetite their appetite is not distinguished into irascible and concupiscible but remains undivided and it is called the will Reply Obj one Fury and concupiscence are metaphorically said to be in the demons as anger is sometimes attributed to God on account of the resemblance in the effect Reply Obj two Love and joy in so far as they are passions are in the concupiscible appetite but in so far as they express a simple act of the will they are in the intellective part in this sense to love is to wish well to anyone and to be glad is for the will to repose in some good possessed Universally speaking none of these things is said of the angels as by way of passions as Augustine says De Civ Dei ix Reply Obj three Charity as a virtue is not in the concupiscible appetite but in the will because the object of the concupiscible appetite is the good as delectable to the senses But the Divine goodness which is the object of charity is not of any such kind For the same reason it must be said that hope does not exist in the irascible appetite because the object of the irascible appetite is something arduous belonging to the sensible order which the virtue of hope does not regard since the object of hope is arduous and divine Temperance however considered as a human virtue deals with the desires of sensible pleasures which belong to the concupiscible faculty Similarly fortitude regulates daring and fear which reside in the irascible part Consequently temperance in so far as it is a human virtue resides in the concupiscible part and fortitude in the irascible But they do not exist in the angels in this manner For in them there are no passions of concupiscence nor of fear and daring to be regulated by temperance and fortitude But temperance is predicated of them according as in moderation they display their will in conformity with the Divine will Fortitude is likewise attributed to them in so far as they firmly carry out the Divine will All of this is done by their will and not by the irascible or concupiscible appetite QUESTION sixty OF THE LOVE OR DILECTION OF THE ANGELS In Five Articles The next subject for our consideration is that act of the will which is love or dilection because every act of the appetitive faculty comes of love Under this heading there are five points of inquiry 
6323-10337-0000	train-other-500	one Whether there is natural love in the angels two Whether there is in them love of choice three Whether the angel loves himself with natural love or with love of choice four
6323-10337-0001	train-other-500	Whether one angel loves another with natural love as he loves himself five Whether the angel loves God more than self with natural love FIRST ARTICLE
none	none	 I Q sixty Art one 
6323-10337-0002	train-other-500	Whether There Is Natural Love or Dilection in an Angel Objection one It would seem that there is no natural love or dilection in the angels For natural love is contradistinguished from intellectual love
none	none	 as stated by Dionysius Div Nom iv But an angel s love is intellectual Therefore it is not natural Obj two 
6323-10337-0003	train-other-500	Further those who love with natural love are more acted upon than active in themselves for nothing has control over its own nature Now the angels are not acted upon but act of themselves because they possess free will as was shown above
none	none	 Q fifty nine A three 
6323-10337-0004	train-other-500	Consequently there is no natural love in them
none	none	 Obj three 
6323-10337-0005	train-other-500	Further every love is either ordinate or inordinate Now ordinate love belongs to charity while inordinate love belongs to wickedness
none	none	 But neither of these belongs to nature because charity is above nature 
6323-10337-0006	train-other-500	while wickedness is against nature Therefore there is no natural love in the angels On the contrary Love results from knowledge
none	none	 for nothing is loved except it be first known as Augustine says De Trin x twelve But there is natural knowledge in the angels Therefore there is also natural love I answer that We must necessarily place natural love in the angels In evidence of this we must bear in mind that what comes first is always sustained in what comes after it 
6323-10337-0008	train-other-500	Now nature comes before intellect because the nature of every subject is its essence Consequently whatever belongs to nature must be preserved likewise in such subjects as have intellect But it is common to every nature to have some inclination
6323-10337-0009	train-other-500	and this is its natural appetite or love This inclination is found to exist differently in different natures but in each according to its mode Consequently in the intellectual nature there is to be found a natural inclination coming from the will
6323-10337-0010	train-other-500	in the sensitive nature according to the sensitive appetite but in a nature devoid of knowledge only according to the tendency of the nature to something Therefore since an angel is an intellectual nature
none	none	 there must be a natural love in his will Reply Obj one 
6323-10337-0011	train-other-500	Intellectual love is contradistinguished from that natural love which is merely natural in so far as it belongs to a nature which has not likewise the perfection of either sense or intellect
none	none	 Reply Obj two All things in the world are moved to act by something else except the First Agent 
6323-10337-0012	train-other-500	Who acts in such a manner that He is in no way moved to act by another and in Whom nature and will are the same So there is nothing unfitting in an angel being moved to act in so far as such
none	none	 natural inclination is implanted in him by the Author of his nature Yet he is not so moved to act that he does not act himself because he has free will Reply Obj three 
6323-10337-0013	train-other-500	As natural knowledge is always true so is natural love well regulated
none	none	 because natural love is nothing else than the inclination implanted in nature by its Author 
6323-10337-0014	train-other-500	To say that a natural inclination is not well regulated is to derogate from the Author of nature Yet the rectitude of natural love is different from the rectitude of charity and virtue because the one rectitude perfects the other
6323-10337-0015	train-other-500	even so the truth of natural knowledge is of one kind and the truth of infused or acquired knowledge is of another SECOND ARTICLE
none	none	 I Q sixty Art two Whether There Is Love of Choice in the Angels Objection one It would seem that there is no love of choice in the angels For love of choice appears to be rational love since choice follows counsel which lies in inquiry as stated in Ethic iii three 
6323-10337-0017	train-other-500	Now rational love is contrasted with intellectual which is proper to angels
none	none	 as is said Div Nom iv Therefore there is no love of choice in the angels Obj two 
6323-10337-0018	train-other-500	Further the angels have only natural knowledge besides such as is infused since they do not proceed from principles to acquire the knowledge of conclusions Hence they are disposed to everything they can know as our intellect is disposed towards first principles
none	none	 which it can know naturally Now love follows knowledge as has been already stated A one Q sixteen A one Consequently besides their infused love 
6323-10337-0019	train-other-500	there is only natural love in the angels Therefore there is no love of choice in them On the contrary We neither merit nor demerit by our natural acts But by their love the angels merit or demerit Therefore there is love of choice in them
6323-10337-0020	train-other-500	I answer that There exists in the angels a natural love and a love of choice Their natural love is the principle of their love of choice because what belongs to that which precedes has always the nature of a principle
6323-10337-0021	train-other-500	Wherefore since nature is first in everything what belongs to nature must be a principle in everything This is clearly evident in man with respect to both his intellect and his will For the intellect knows principles naturally
6323-10337-0022	train-other-500	and from such knowledge in man comes the knowledge of conclusions which are known by him not naturally but by discovery or by teaching In like manner the end acts in the will in the same way as the principle does in the intellect
none	none	 as is laid down in Phys ii text eighty nine 
6323-10337-0023	train-other-500	Consequently the will tends naturally to its last end for every man naturally wills happiness and all other desires are caused by this natural desire since whatever a man wills he wills on account of the end Therefore the love of that good which a man naturally wills as an end
6323-10337-0024	train-other-500	is his natural love but the love which comes of this which is of something loved for the end s sake is the love of choice There is however a difference on the part of the intellect and on the part of the will Because as was stated already
none	none	 Q fifty nine A two 
6323-10337-0025	train-other-500	the mind s knowledge is brought about by the inward presence of the known within the knower It comes of the imperfection of man s intellectual nature that his mind does not simultaneously possess all things capable of being understood
6323-10337-0026	train-other-500	but only a few things from which he is moved in a measure to grasp other things The act of the appetitive faculty on the contrary follows the inclination of man towards things some of which are good in themselves and consequently are appetible in themselves
6323-10337-0027	train-other-500	others being good only in relation to something else and being appetible on account of something else Consequently it does not argue imperfection in the person desiring for him to seek one thing naturally as his end
6323-10337-0028	train-other-500	and something else from choice as ordained to such end Therefore since the intellectual nature of the angels is perfect only natural and not deductive knowledge is to be found in them but there is to be found in them both natural love and love of choice
none	none	 In saying all this we are passing over all that regards things which are above nature 
6323-10337-0029	train-other-500	since nature is not the sufficient principle thereof
none	none	 but we shall speak of them later on Q sixty two Reply Obj one 
6323-10337-0030	train-other-500	Not all love of choice is rational love according as rational is distinguished from intellectual love For rational love is so called which follows deductive knowledge
none	none	 but as was said above Q fifty nine A three 
6323-10337-0031	train-other-500	ad one when treating of free will every choice does not follow a discursive act of the reason but only human choice Consequently the conclusion does not follow The reply to the second objection follows from what has been said THIRD ARTICLE
none	none	 I Q sixty Art four 
6323-10337-0032	train-other-500	Whether the Angel Loves Himself with Both Natural Love and Love of Choice Objection one It would seem that the angel does not love himself both with natural love and a love of choice
none	none	 For as was said A two 
6323-10337-0033	train-other-500	natural love regards the end itself while love of choice regards the means to the end But the same thing with regard to the same cannot be both the end and a means to the end Therefore natural love and the love of choice cannot have the same object
none	none	 Obj two Further as Dionysius observes Div Nom iv Love is a uniting and a binding power 
6323-10337-0034	train-other-500	But uniting and binding imply various things brought together Therefore the angel cannot love himself
none	none	 Obj three 
6323-10337-0035	train-other-500	Further love is a kind of movement But every movement tends towards something else Therefore it seems that an angel cannot love himself
none	none	 with either natural or elective love 
6323-10337-0036	train-other-500	On the contrary The Philosopher says Ethic ix
6323-10337-0037	train-other-500	eight Love for others comes of love for oneself I answer that Since the object of love is good and good is to be found both in substance and in accident
none	none	 as is clear from Ethic i six 
6323-10337-0038	train-other-500	a thing may be loved in two ways first of all as a subsisting good and secondly as an accidental or inherent good That is loved as a subsisting good
none	none	 which is so loved that we wish well to it 
6323-10337-0039	train-other-500	But that which we wish unto another is loved as an accidental or inherent good thus knowledge is loved
none	none	 not that any good may come to it but that it may be possessed 
6323-10337-0040	train-other-500	This kind of love has been called by the name concupiscence while the first is called friendship
none	none	 Now it is manifest that in things devoid of knowledge 
6323-10337-0041	train-other-500	everything naturally seeks to procure what is good for itself as fire seeks to mount upwards Consequently both angel and man naturally seek their own good and perfection This is to love self
6323-10337-0042	train-other-500	Hence angel and man naturally love self in so far as by natural appetite each desires what is good for self On the other hand each loves self with the love of choice in so far as from choice he wishes for something which will benefit himself
none	none	 Reply Obj one 
6323-10337-0043	train-other-500	It is not under the same but under quite different aspects that an angel or a man loves self with natural and with elective love as was observed above
none	none	 Reply Obj two 
6323-10337-0044	train-other-500	As to be one is better than to be united
none	none	 so there is more oneness in love which is directed to self than in love which unites one to others Dionysius used the terms uniting and binding in order to show the derivation of love from self to things outside self as uniting is derived from unity Reply Obj three As love is an action which remains within the agent so also is it a movement which abides within the lover 
6323-10337-0045	train-other-500	but does not of necessity tend towards something else yet it can be reflected back upon the lover so that he loves himself just as knowledge is reflected back upon the knower in such a way that he knows himself FOURTH ARTICLE
none	none	 I Q sixty Art four Whether an Angel Loves Another with Natural Love As He Loves Himself Objection one It would seem that an angel does not love another with natural love as he loves himself For love follows knowledge 
6323-10337-0047	train-other-500	But an angel does not know another as he knows himself because he knows himself by his essence
none	none	 while he knows another by his similitude as was said above Q fifty six AA one two 
6323-10337-0049	train-other-500	Therefore it seems that one angel does not love another with natural love as he loves himself
none	none	 Obj two 
6323-10337-0050	train-other-500	Further the cause is more powerful than the effect and the principle than what is derived from it But love for another comes of love for self as the Philosopher says Ethic
none	none	 ix eight 
6323-10337-0051	train-other-500	Therefore one angel does not love another as himself but loves himself more
none	none	 Obj three 
6323-10337-0052	train-other-500	Further natural love is of something as an end and is unremovable But no angel is the end of another and again such love can be severed from him as is the case with the demons who have no love for the good angels
6323-10337-0053	train-other-500	Therefore an angel does not love another with natural love as he loves himself On the contrary That seems to be a natural property which is found in all even in such as devoid of reason But every beast loves its like as is said
none	none	 Ecclus 
6323-10337-0054	train-other-500	thirteen nineteen Therefore an angel naturally loves another as he loves himself
none	none	 I answer that As was observed A three 
6323-10337-0055	train-other-500	both angel and man naturally love self Now what is one with a thing is that thing itself consequently every thing loves what is one with itself So if this be one with it by natural union it loves it with natural love
6323-10337-0056	train-other-500	but if it be one with it by non natural union then it loves it with non natural love Thus a man loves his fellow townsman with a social love while he loves a blood relation with natural affection
6323-10337-0057	train-other-500	in so far as he is one with him in the principle of natural generation Now it is evident that what is generically or specifically one with another is the one according to nature And so everything loves another
6323-10337-0058	train-other-500	which is one with it in species with a natural affection in so far as it loves its own species This is manifest even in things devoid of knowledge for fire has a natural inclination to communicate its form to another thing
none	none	 wherein consists this other thing s good as it is naturally inclined to seek its own good 
6323-10337-0059	train-other-500	namely to be borne upwards So then it must be said that one angel loves another with natural affection in so far as he is one with him in nature But so far as an angel has something else in common with another angel
6323-10337-0060	train-other-500	or differs from him in other respects he does not love him with natural love
none	none	 Reply Obj one 
6323-10337-0061	train-other-500	The expression as himself can in one way qualify the knowledge and the love on the part of the one known and loved and thus one angel knows another as himself because he knows the other to be even as he knows himself to be
6323-10337-0062	train-other-500	In another way the expression can qualify the knowledge and the love on the part of the knower and lover And thus one angel does not know another as himself because he knows himself by his essence and the other not by the other s essence
6323-10337-0063	train-other-500	In like manner he does not love another as he loves himself because he loves himself by his own will but he does not love another by the other s will
none	none	 Reply Obj two 
6323-10337-0064	train-other-500	The expression as does not denote equality but likeness For since natural affection rests upon natural unity the angel naturally loves less what is less one with him
6323-10337-0065	train-other-500	Consequently he loves more what is numerically one with himself than what is one only generically or specifically But it is natural for him to have a like love for another as for himself in this respect
6323-10337-0066	train-other-500	that as he loves self in wishing well to self so he loves another in wishing well to him
none	none	 Reply Obj three Natural love is said to be of the end 
6323-10337-0067	train-other-500	not as of that end to which good is willed but rather as of that good which one wills for oneself and in consequence for another as united to oneself Nor can such natural love be stripped from the wicked angels
6323-10337-0068	train-other-500	without their still retaining a natural affection towards the good angels in so far as they share the same nature with them But they hate them in so far as they are unlike them according to righteousness and unrighteousness FIFTH ARTICLE
none	none	 I Q sixty Art five 
6323-10337-0069	train-other-500	Whether an angel by natural love loves God more than he loves himself Objection one
none	none	 It would seem that the angel does not love God by natural love more than he loves himself For as was stated A four 
6323-10337-0070	train-other-500	natural love rests upon natural union Now the Divine nature is far above the angelic nature Therefore according to natural love the angel loves God less than self or even than another angel
none	none	 Obj two Further That on account of which a thing is such is yet more so 
6323-10337-0071	train-other-500	But every one loves another with natural love for his own sake because one thing loves another as good for itself Therefore the angel does not love God more than self with natural love
none	none	 Obj three 
6323-10337-0072	train-other-500	Further nature is self centered in its operation for we behold every agent acting naturally for its own preservation But nature s operation would not be self centered were it to tend towards anything else more than to nature itself
6323-10337-0073	train-other-500	Therefore the angel does not love God more than himself from natural love
none	none	 Obj four 
6323-10337-0074	train-other-500	Further it is proper to charity to love God more than self But to love from charity is not natural to the angels for it is poured out upon their hearts by the Holy Spirit Who is given to them as Augustine says
none	none	 De Civ Dei xii nine 
6323-10337-0075	train-other-500	Therefore the angels do not love God more than themselves by natural love
none	none	 Obj five 
6323-10337-0076	train-other-500	Further natural love lasts while nature endures But the love of God more than self does not remain in the angel or man who sins
none	none	 for Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv 
6323-10337-0077	train-other-500	Two loves have made two cities namely love of self
none	none	 unto the contempt of God has made the earthly city 
6323-10337-0078	train-other-500	while love of God unto the contempt of self has made the heavenly city
none	none	 Therefore it is not natural to love God more than self On the contrary All the moral precepts of the law come of the law of nature 
6323-10337-0079	train-other-500	But the precept of loving God more than self is a moral precept of the law Therefore it is of the law of nature Consequently from natural love the angel loves God more than himself I answer that
6323-10337-0080	train-other-500	There have been some who maintained that an angel loves God more than himself with natural love both as to the love of concupiscence through his seeking the Divine good for himself rather than his own good and in a fashion
none	none	 as to the love of friendship 
6323-10337-0081	train-other-500	in so far as he naturally desires a greater good to God than to himself because he naturally wishes God to be God while as for himself he wills to have his own nature But absolutely speaking out of the natural love he loves himself more than he does God
6323-10337-0082	train-other-500	because he naturally loves himself before God and with greater intensity The falsity of such an opinion stands in evidence if one but consider whither natural movement tends in the natural order of things because the natural tendency of things devoid of reason
6323-10337-0083	train-other-500	shows the nature of the natural inclination residing in the will of an intellectual nature Now in natural things everything which as such naturally belongs to another is principally and more strongly inclined to that other to which it belongs
none	none	 than towards itself Such a natural tendency is evidenced from things which are moved according to nature because according as a thing is moved naturally it has an inborn aptitude to be thus moved as stated in Phys ii text seventy eight For we observe that the part naturally exposes itself in order to safeguard the whole as for instance the hand is without deliberation exposed to the blow for the whole body s safety And since reason copies nature 
6323-10337-0084	train-other-500	we find the same inclination among the social virtues for it behooves the virtuous citizen to expose himself to the danger of death for the public weal of the state and if man were a natural part of the city then such inclination would be natural to him
6323-10337-0085	train-other-500	Consequently since God is the universal good and under this good both man and angel and all creatures are comprised
none	none	 because every creature in regard to its entire being 
6323-10337-0086	train-other-500	naturally belongs to God it follows that from natural love angel and man alike love God before themselves and with a greater love Otherwise if either of them loved self more than God it would follow that natural love would be perverse
6323-10337-0087	train-other-500	and that it would not be perfected but destroyed by charity
none	none	 Reply Obj one 
6323-10337-0088	train-other-500	Such reasoning holds good of things adequately divided whereof one is not the cause of the existence and goodness of the other
none	none	 for in such natures each loves itself naturally more than it does the other inasmuch as it is more one with itself than it is with the other 
6323-10337-0089	train-other-500	But where one is the whole cause of the existence and goodness of the other that one is naturally more loved than self because as we said above each part naturally loves the whole more than itself and each individual naturally loves the good of the species
6323-10337-0090	train-other-500	more than its own individual good Now God is not only the good of one species but is absolutely the universal good
none	none	 hence everything in its own way naturally loves God more than itself Reply Obj two 
6323-10337-0091	train-other-500	When it is said that God is loved by an angel in so far as He is good to the angel if the expression in so far denotes an end then it is false for he does not naturally love God for his own good but for God s sake
6323-10337-0092	train-other-500	If it denotes the nature of love on the lover s part then it is true
none	none	 for it would not be in the nature of anyone to love God 
6323-10337-0093	train-other-500	except from this that everything is dependent on that good which is God
none	none	 Reply Obj three 
6323-10337-0094	train-other-500	Nature s operation is self centered not merely as to certain particular details but much more as to what is common for everything is inclined to preserve not merely its individuality but likewise its species
6323-10337-0095	train-other-500	And much more has everything a natural inclination towards what is the absolutely universal good
none	none	 Reply Obj four God in so far as He is the universal good from Whom every natural good depends 
6323-10337-0096	train-other-500	is loved by everything with natural love
none	none	 So far as He is the good which of its very nature beatifies all with supernatural beatitude 
6323-10337-0097	train-other-500	He is love with the love of charity
none	none	 Reply Obj five 
6323-10337-0098	train-other-500	Since God s substance and universal goodness are one and the same all who behold God s essence are by the same movement of love moved towards the Divine essence as it is distinct from other things and according as it is the universal good
6323-10337-0099	train-other-500	And because He is naturally loved by all so far as He is the universal good it is impossible that whoever sees Him in His essence should not love Him But such as do not behold His essence know Him by some particular effects
6323-10337-0100	train-other-500	which are sometimes opposed to their will
none	none	 So in this way they are said to hate God yet nevertheless so far as He is the universal good of all every thing naturally loves God more than itself QUESTION sixty one OF THE PRODUCTION OF THE ANGELS IN THE ORDER OF NATURAL BEING In Four Articles After dealing with the nature of the angels their knowledge and will it now remains for us to treat of their creation or speaking in a general way of their origin Such consideration is threefold In the first place we must see how they were brought into natural existence secondly how they were made perfect in grace or glory and thirdly how some of them became wicked Under the first heading there are four points of inquiry one Whether the angel has a cause of his existence two Whether he has existed from eternity three Whether he was created before corporeal creatures four Whether the angels were created in the empyrean heaven FIRST ARTICLE I Q sixty one Art one Whether the Angels Have a Cause of Their Existence Objection one It would seem that the angels have no cause of their existence For the first chapter of Genesis treats of things created by God But there is no mention of angels Therefore the angels were not created by God Obj two Further the Philosopher says Metaph viii text sixteen that if any substance be a form without matter straightway it has being and unity of itself and has no cause of its being and unity But the angels are immaterial forms as was shown above Q fifty A two Therefore they have no cause of their being Obj three Further whatever is produced by any agent from the very fact of its being produced receives form from it But since the angels are forms they do not derive their form from any agent Therefore the angels have no active cause On the contrary It is said Ps one hundred forty eight two Praise ye Him all His angels and further on verse five For He spoke and they were made I answer that It must be affirmed that angels and everything existing except God were made by God God alone is His own existence while in everything else the essence differs from the existence as was shown above Q three A four From this it is clear that God alone exists of His own essence while all other things have their existence by participation Now whatever exists by participation is caused by what exists essentially as everything ignited is caused by fire Consequently the angels of necessity were made by God Reply Obj one Augustine says De Civ Dei xi fifty that the angels were not passed over in that account of the first creation of things but are designated by the name heavens or of light And they were either passed over or else designated by the names of corporeal things because Moses was addressing an uncultured people as yet incapable of understanding an incorporeal nature and if it had been divulged that there were creatures existing beyond corporeal nature it would have proved to them an occasion of idolatry to which they were inclined and from which Moses especially meant to safeguard them Reply Obj two Substances that are subsisting forms have no formal cause of their existence and unity nor such active cause as produces its effect by changing the matter from a state of potentiality to actuality but they have a cause productive of their entire substance From this the solution of the third difficulty is manifest SECOND ARTICLE I Q sixty one Art two Whether the Angel Was Produced by God from Eternity Objection one It would seem that the angel was produced by God from eternity For God is the cause of the angel by His being for He does not act through something besides His essence But His being is eternal Therefore He produced the angels from eternity Obj two Further everything which exists at one period and not at another is subject to time But the angel is above time as is laid down in the book De Causis Therefore the angel is not at one time existing and at another non existing but exists always Obj three Further Augustine De Trin xiii proves the soul s incorruptibility by the fact that the mind is capable of truth But as truth is incorruptible so is it eternal Therefore the intellectual nature of the soul and of the angel is not only incorruptible but likewise eternal On the contrary It is said Prov eight twenty two in the person of begotten Wisdom The Lord possessed me in the beginning of His ways before He made anything from the beginning But as was shown above A one the angels were made by God Therefore at one time the angels were not I answer that God alone Father Son and Holy Ghost is from eternity Catholic Faith holds this without doubt and everything to the contrary must be rejected as heretical For God so produced creatures that He made them from nothing that is after they had not been Reply Obj one God s being is His will So the fact that God produced the angels and other creatures by His being does not exclude that He made them also by His will But as was shown above Q nineteen A three Q forty six A one God s will does not act by necessity in producing creatures Therefore He produced such as He willed and when He willed Reply Obj two An angel is above that time which is the measure of the movement of the heavens because he is above every movement of a corporeal nature Nevertheless he is not above time which is the measure of the succession of his existence after his non existence and which is also the measure of the succession which is in his operations Hence Augustine says general ad lit viii twenty twenty one that God moves the spiritual creature according to time Reply Obj three Angels and intelligent souls are incorruptible by the very fact of their having a nature whereby they are capable of truth But they did not possess this nature from eternity it was bestowed upon them when God Himself willed it Consequently it does not follow that the angels existed from eternity THIRD ARTICLE I Q sixty one Art three Whether the Angels Were Created Before the Corporeal World Objection one It would seem that the angels were created before the corporeal world For Jerome says In Ep ad Tit i two Six thousand years of our time have not yet elapsed yet how shall we measure the time how shall we count the ages in which the Angels Thrones Dominations and the other orders served God

none	none	 says De Fide Orth ii Some say that the angels were begotten before all creation as Gregory the Theologian declares He first of all devised the angelic and heavenly powers and the devising was the making thereof Obj two Further the angelic nature stands midway between the Divine and the corporeal natures But the Divine nature is from eternity while corporeal nature is from time Therefore the angelic nature was produced ere time was made and after eternity Obj three Further the angelic nature is more remote from the corporeal nature than one corporeal nature is from another But one corporeal nature was made before another hence the six days of the production of things are set forth in the opening of Genesis Much more therefore was the angelic nature made before every corporeal nature On the contrary It is said general one one In the beginning God created heaven and earth Now this would not be true if anything had been created previously Consequently the angels were not created before corporeal nature I answer that There is a twofold opinion on this point to be found in the writings of the Fathers The more probable one holds that the angels were created at the same time as corporeal creatures For the angels are part of the universe they do not constitute a universe of themselves but both they and corporeal natures unite in constituting one universe This stands in evidence from the relationship of creature to creature because the mutual relationship of creatures makes up the good of the universe But no part is perfect if separate from the whole Consequently it is improbable that God Whose works are perfect as it is said Deut thirty two four should have created the angelic creature before other creatures At the same time the contrary is not to be deemed erroneous especially on account of the opinion of Gregory Nazianzen whose authority in Christian doctrine is of such weight that no one has ever raised objection to his teaching as is also the case with the doctrine of Athanasius as Jerome says Reply Obj one Jerome is speaking according to the teaching of the Greek Fathers all of whom hold the creation of the angels to have taken place previously to that of the corporeal world Reply Obj two God is not a part of but far above the whole universe possessing within Himself the entire perfection of the universe in a more eminent way But an angel is a part of the universe Hence the comparison does not hold Reply Obj three All corporeal creatures are one in matter while the angels do not agree with them in matter Consequently the creation of the matter of the corporeal creature involves in a manner the creation of all things but the creation of the angels does not involve creation of the universe If the contrary view be held then in the text of general one In the beginning God created heaven and earth the words In the beginning must be interpreted In the Son or In the beginning of time but not In the beginning before which there was nothing unless we say Before which there was nothing of the nature of corporeal creatures FOURTH ARTICLE I Q sixty one Art four Whether the Angels Were Created in the Empyrean Heaven Objection one It would seem that the angels were not created in the empyrean heaven For the angels are incorporeal substances Now a substance which is incorporeal is not dependent upon a body for its existence and as a consequence neither is it for its creation Therefore the angels were not created in any corporeal place Obj two Further Augustine remarks general ad lit iii ten that the angels were created in the upper atmosphere therefore not in the empyrean heaven Obj three Further the empyrean heaven is said to be the highest heaven If therefore the angels were created in the empyrean heaven it would not beseem them to mount up to a still higher heaven And this is contrary to what is said in Isaias speaking in the person of the sinning angel I will ascend into heaven Isa fourteen thirteen On the contrary Strabus commenting on the text In the beginning God created heaven and earth says By heaven he does not mean the visible firmament but the empyrean that is the fiery or intellectual firmament which is not so styled from its heat but from its splendor and which was filled with angels directly it was made I answer that As was observed A three the universe is made up of corporeal and spiritual creatures Consequently spiritual creatures were so created as to bear some relationship to the corporeal creature and to rule over every corporeal creature Hence it was fitting for the angels to be created in the highest corporeal place as presiding over all corporeal nature whether it be styled the empyrean heaven or whatever else it be called So Isidore says that the highest heaven is the heaven of the angels explaining the passage of Deut ten fourteen Behold heaven is the Lord s thy God and the heaven of heaven Reply Obj one The angels were created in a corporeal place not as if depending upon a body either as to their existence or as to their being made because God could have created them before all corporeal creation as many holy Doctors hold They were made in a corporeal place in order to show their relationship to corporeal nature and that they are by their power in touch with bodies Reply Obj two By the uppermost atmosphere Augustine possibly means the highest part of heaven to which the atmosphere has a kind of affinity owing to its subtlety and transparency Or else he is not speaking of all the angels but only of such as sinned who in the opinion of some belonged to the inferior orders But there is nothing to hinder us from saying that the higher angels as having an exalted and universal power over all corporeal things were created in the highest place of the corporeal creature while the other angels as having more restricted powers were created among the inferior bodies Reply Obj three Isaias is not speaking there of any corporeal heaven but of the heaven of the Blessed Trinity unto which the sinning angel wished to ascend when he desired to be equal in some manner to God as will appear later on Q sixty three A three QUESTION sixty two OF THE PERFECTION OF THE ANGELS IN THE ORDER OF GRACE AND OF GLORY In Nine Articles In due sequence we have to inquire how the angels were made in the order of grace and of glory under which heading there are nine points of inquiry one Were the angels created in beatitude two Did they need grace in order to turn to God three Were they created in grace four Did they merit their beatitude five Did they at once enter into beatitude after merit six Did they receive grace and glory according to their natural capacities seven After entering glory did their natural love and knowledge remain eight Could they have sinned afterwards nine After entering into glory could they advance farther FIRST ARTICLE I Q sixty two Art one Whether the Angels Were Created in Beatitude Objection one It would seem that the angels were created in beatitude For it is stated De Eccl Dogm xxix that the angels who continue in the beatitude wherein they were created do not of their nature possess the excellence they have Therefore the angels were created in beatitude Obj two Further the angelic nature is nobler than the corporeal creature But the corporeal creature straightway from its creation was made perfect and complete nor did its lack of form take precedence in time but only in nature as Augustine says general ad lit i fifteen Therefore neither did God create the angelic nature imperfect and incomplete But its formation and perfection are derived from its beatitude whereby it enjoys God Therefore it was created in beatitude Obj three Further according to Augustine general ad lit iv thirty four v five the things which we read of as being made in the works of the six days were made together at one time and so all the six days must have existed instantly from the beginning of creation But according to his exposition in those six days the morning was the angelic knowledge according to which they knew the Word and things in the Word Therefore straightway from their creation they knew the Word and things in the Word But the bliss of the angels comes of seeing the Word Consequently the angels were in beatitude straightway from the very beginning of their creation On the contrary To be established or confirmed in good is of the nature of beatitude But the angels were not confirmed in good as soon as they were created the fall of some of them shows this Therefore the angels were not in beatitude from their creation I answer that By the name of beatitude is understood the ultimate perfection of rational or of intellectual nature and hence it is that it is naturally desired since everything naturally desires its ultimate perfection Now there is a twofold ultimate perfection of rational or of intellectual nature The first is one which it can procure of its own natural power and this is in a measure called beatitude or happiness Hence Aristotle Ethic x says that man s ultimate happiness consists in his most perfect contemplation whereby in this life he can behold the best intelligible object and that is God Above this happiness there is still another which we look forward to in the future whereby we shall see God as He is This is beyond the nature of every created intellect as was shown above Q twelve A four So then it remains to be said that as regards this first beatitude which the angel could procure by his natural power he was created already blessed Because the angel does not acquire such beatitude by any progressive action as man does but as was observed above Q fifty eight AA three four is straightway in possession thereof owing to his natural dignity But the angels did not have from the beginning of their creation that ultimate beatitude which is beyond the power of nature because such beatitude is no part of their nature but its end and consequently they ought not to have it immediately from the beginning Reply Obj one Beatitude is there taken for that natural perfection which the angel had in the state of innocence Reply Obj two The corporeal creature instantly in the beginning of its creation could not have the perfection to which it is brought by its operation consequently according to Augustine general ad lit v four twenty three viii three the growing of plants from the earth did not take place at once among the first works in which only the germinating power of the plants was bestowed upon the earth In the same way the angelic creature in the beginning of its existence had the perfection of its nature but it did not have the perfection to which it had to come by its operation Reply Obj three The angel has a twofold knowledge of the Word the one which is natural and the other according to glory He has a natural knowledge whereby he knows the Word through a similitude thereof shining in his nature and he has a knowledge of glory whereby he knows the Word through His essence By both kinds of knowledge the angel knows things in the Word imperfectly by his natural knowledge and perfectly by his knowledge of glory Therefore the first knowledge of things in the Word was present to the angel from the outset of his creation while the second was not but only when the angels became blessed by turning to the good And this is properly termed their morning knowledge SECOND ARTICLE I Q sixty two Art two Whether an Angel Needs Grace in Order to Turn to God Objection one It would seem that the angel had no need of grace in order to turn to God For we have no need of grace for what we can accomplish naturally But the angel naturally turns to God because he loves God naturally as is clear from what has been said Q sixty A five Therefore an angel did not need grace in order to turn to God Obj two Further seemingly we need help only for difficult tasks Now it was not a difficult task for the angel to turn to God because there was no obstacle in him to such turning Therefore the angel had no need of grace in order to turn to God Obj three Further to turn oneself to God is to dispose oneself for grace hence it is said Zech one three Turn ye to Me and I will turn to you But we do not stand in need of grace in order to prepare ourselves for grace for thus we should go on to infinity Therefore the angel did not need grace to turn to God On the contrary It was by turning to God that the angel reached to beatitude If then he had needed no grace in order to turn to God it would follow that he did not require grace in order to possess everlasting life But this is contrary to the saying of the Apostle Rom six twenty three The grace of God is life everlasting I answer that The angels stood in need of grace in order to turn to God as the object of beatitude For as was observed above Q sixty A two the natural movement of the will is the principle of all things that we will But the will s natural inclination is directed towards what is in keeping with its nature Therefore if there is anything which is above nature the will cannot be inclined towards it unless helped by some other supernatural principle Thus it is clear that fire has a natural tendency to give forth heat and to generate fire whereas to generate flesh is beyond the natural power of fire consequently fire has no tendency thereto except in so far as it is moved instrumentally by the nutritive soul Now it was shown above Q twelve AA four five when we were treating of God s knowledge that to see God in His essence wherein the ultimate beatitude of the rational creature consists is beyond the nature of every created intellect Consequently no rational creature can have the movement of the will directed towards such beatitude except it be moved thereto by a supernatural agent This is what we call the help of grace Therefore it must be said that an angel could not of his own will be turned to such beatitude except by the help of grace Reply Obj one The angel loves God naturally so far as God is the author of his natural being But here we are speaking of turning to God so far as God bestows beatitude by the vision of His essence Reply Obj two A thing is difficult which is beyond a power and this happens in two ways First of all because it is beyond the natural capacity of the power Thus if it can be attained by some help it is said to be difficult but if it can in no way be attained then it is impossible thus it is impossible for a man to fly In another way a thing may be beyond the power not according to the natural order of such power but owing to some intervening hindrance as to mount upwards is not contrary to the natural order of the motive power of the soul because the soul considered in itself can be moved in any direction but is hindered from so doing by the weight of the body consequently it is difficult for a man to mount upwards To be turned to his ultimate beatitude is difficult for man both because it is beyond his nature and because he has a hindrance from the corruption of the body and infection of sin But it is difficult for an angel only because it is supernatural Reply Obj three Every movement of the will towards God can be termed a conversion to God And so there is a threefold turning to God The first is by the perfect love of God this belongs to the creature enjoying the possession of God and for such conversion consummate grace is required The next turning to God is that which merits beatitude and for this there is required habitual grace which is the principle of merit The third conversion is that whereby a man disposes himself so that he may have grace for this no habitual grace is required but the operation of God Who draws the soul towards Himself according to Lament five twenty one Convert us O Lord to Thee and we shall be converted Hence it is clear that there is no need to go on to infinity THIRD ARTICLE I Q sixty two Art three Whether the Angels Were Created in Grace Objection one It would seem that the angels were not created in grace For Augustine says general ad lit ii eight that the angelic nature was first made without form and was called heaven but afterwards it received its form and was then called light But such formation comes from grace Therefore they were not created in grace Obj two Further grace turns the rational creature towards God If therefore the angel had been created in grace no angel would ever have turned away from God Obj three Further grace comes midway between nature and glory But the angels were not beatified in their creation Therefore it seems that they were not created in grace but that they were first created in nature only and then received grace and that last of all they were beatified On the contrary Augustine says De Civ Dei xii nine Who wrought the good will of the angels Who save Him Who created them with His will that is with the pure love wherewith they cling to Him at the same time building up their nature and bestowing grace on them I answer that Although there are conflicting opinions on this point some holding that the angels were created only in a natural state while others maintain that they were created in grace yet it seems more probable and more in keeping with the sayings of holy men that they were created in sanctifying grace For we see that all things which in the process of time being created by the work of Divine Providence were produced by the operation of God were created in the first fashioning of things according to seedlike forms as Augustine says general ad lit viii three such as trees animals and the rest Now it is evident that sanctifying grace bears the same relation to beatitude as the seedlike form in nature does to the natural effect hence one John three nine grace is called the seed of God As then in Augustine s opinion it is contended that the seedlike forms of all natural effects were implanted in the creature when corporeally created so straightway from the beginning the angels were created in grace Reply Obj one Such absence of form in the angels can be understood either by comparison with their formation in glory and so the absence of formation preceded formation by priority of time Or else it can be understood of the formation according to grace and so it did not precede in the order of time but in the order of nature as Augustine holds with regard to the formation of corporeal things general ad lit i fifteen Reply Obj two Every form inclines the subject after the mode of the subject s nature Now it is the mode of an intellectual nature to be inclined freely towards the objects it desires Consequently the movement of grace does not impose necessity but he who has grace can fail to make use of it and can sin Reply Obj three Although in the order of nature grace comes midway between nature and glory nevertheless in the order of time in created nature glory is not simultaneous with nature because glory is the end of the operation of nature helped by grace But grace stands not as the end of operation because it is not of works but as the principle of right operation Therefore it was fitting for grace to be given straightway with nature FOURTH ARTICLE I Q sixty two Art four Whether an Angel Merits His Beatitude Objection one It would seem that the angel did not merit his beatitude For merit arises from the difficulty of the meritorious act But the angel experienced no difficulty in acting rightly Therefore righteous action was not meritorious for him Obj two Further we do not merit by merely natural operations But it was quite natural for the angel to turn to God Therefore he did not thereby merit beatitude Obj three Further if a beatified angel merited his beatitude he did so either before he had it or else afterwards But it was not before because in the opinion of many he had no grace before whereby to merit it Nor did he merit it afterwards because thus he would be meriting it now which is clearly false because in that case a lower angel could by meriting rise up to the rank of a higher and the distinct degrees of grace would not be permanent which is not admissible Consequently the angel did not merit his beatitude On the contrary It is stated Apoc twenty one seventeen that the measure of the angel in that heavenly Jerusalem is the measure of a man Therefore the same is the case with the angel I answer that Perfect beatitude is natural only to God because existence and beatitude are one and the same thing in Him Beatitude however is not of the nature of the creature but is its end Now everything attains its last end by its operation Such operation leading to the end is either productive of the end when such end is not beyond the power of the agent working for the end as the healing art is productive of health or else it is deserving of the end when such end is beyond the capacity of the agent striving to attain it wherefore it is looked for from another s bestowing Now it is evident from what has gone before AA one two Q twelve AA four five ultimate beatitude exceeds both the angelic and the human nature It remains then that both man and angel merited their beatitude And if the angel was created in grace without which there is no merit there would be no difficulty in saying that he merited beatitude as also if one were to say that he had grace in any way before he had glory But if he had no grace before entering upon beatitude it would then have to be said that he had beatitude without merit even as we have grace This however is quite foreign to the idea of beatitude which conveys the notion of an end and is the reward of virtue as even the Philosopher says Ethic i nine Or else it will have to be said as some others have maintained that the angels merit beatitude by their present ministrations while in beatitude This is quite contrary again to the notion of merit since merit conveys the idea of a means to an end while what is already in its end cannot properly speaking be moved towards such end and so no one merits to produce what he already enjoys Or else it will have to be said that one and the same act of turning to God so far as it comes of free will is meritorious and so far as it attains the end is the fruition of beatitude Even this view will not stand because free will is not the sufficient cause of merit and consequently an act cannot be meritorious as coming from free will except in so far as it is informed by grace but it cannot at the same time be informed by imperfect grace which is the principle of meriting and by perfect grace which is the principle of enjoying Hence it does not appear to be possible for anyone to enjoy beatitude and at the same time to merit it Consequently it is better to say that the angel had grace ere he was admitted to beatitude and that by such grace he merited beatitude Reply Obj one The angel s difficulty of working righteously does not come from any contrariety or hindrance of natural powers but from the fact that the good work is beyond his natural capacity Reply Obj two An angel did not merit beatitude by natural movement towards God but by the movement of charity which comes of grace The answer to the Third Objection is evident from what we have said FIFTH ARTICLE I Q sixty two Art five Whether the Angel Obtained Beatitude Immediately After One Act of Merit Objection one It would seem that the angel did not possess beatitude instantly after one act of merit For it is more difficult for a man to do well than for an angel But man is not rewarded at once after one act of merit Therefore neither was the angel Obj two Further an angel could act at once and in an instant from the very outset of his creation for even natural bodies begin to be moved in the very instant of their creation and if the movement of a body could be instantaneous like operations of mind and will it would have movement in the first instant of its generation Consequently if the angel merited beatitude by one act of his will he merited it in the first instant of his creation and so if their beatitude was not retarded then the angels were in beatitude in the first instant Obj three Further there must be many intervals between things which are far apart But the beatific state of the angels is very far remote from their natural condition while merit comes midway between Therefore the angel would have to pass through many stages of merit in order to reach beatitude On the contrary Man s soul and an angel are ordained alike for beatitude consequently equality with angels is promised to the saints Now the soul separated from the body if it has merit deserving beatitude enters at once into beatitude unless there be some obstacle Therefore so does an angel Now an angel instantly in his first act of charity had the merit of beatitude Therefore since there was no obstacle within him he passed at once into beatitude by only one meritorious act I answer that The angel was beatified instantly after the first act of charity whereby he merited beatitude The reason whereof is because grace perfects nature according to the manner of the nature as every perfection is received in the subject capable of perfection according to its mode Now it is proper to the angelic nature to receive its natural perfection not by passing from one stage to another but to have it at once naturally as was shown above A one Q fifty eight AA three four But as the angel is of his nature inclined to natural perfection so is he by merit inclined to glory Hence instantly after merit the angel secured beatitude Now the merit of beatitude in angel and man alike can be from merely one act because man merits beatitude by every act informed by charity Hence it remains that an angel was beatified straightway after one act of charity Reply Obj one Man was not intended to secure his ultimate perfection at once like the angel Hence a longer way was assigned to man than to the angel for securing beatitude Reply Obj two The angel is above the time of corporeal things hence the various instants regarding the angels are not to be taken except as reckoning the succession of their acts Now their act which merited beatitude could not be in them simultaneously with the act of beatitude which is fruition since the one belongs to imperfect grace and the other to consummate grace Consequently it remains for different instants to be conceived in one of which the angel merited beatitude and in another was beatified Reply Obj three It is of the nature of an angel instantly to attain the perfection unto which he is ordained Consequently only one meritorious act is required which act can so far be called an interval as through it the angel is brought to beatitude SIXTH ARTICLE I Q sixty two Art six Whether the Angels Receive Grace and Glory According to the Degree of Their Natural Gifts Objection one It would seem that the angels did not receive grace and glory according to the degree of their natural gifts For grace is bestowed of God s absolute will Therefore the degree of grace depends on God s will and not on the degree of their natural gifts Obj two Further a moral act seems to be more closely allied with grace than nature is because a moral act is preparatory to grace But grace does not come of works as is said Rom eleven six Therefore much less does the degree of grace depend upon the degree of their natural gifts Obj three Further man and angel are alike ordained for beatitude or grace But man does not receive more grace according to the degree of his natural gifts Therefore neither does the angel On the contrary Is the saying of the Master of the Sentences Sent ii D three that those angels who were created with more subtle natures and of keener intelligence in wisdom were likewise endowed with greater gifts of grace I answer that It is reasonable to suppose that gifts of graces and perfection of beatitude were bestowed on the angels according to the degree of their natural gifts The reason for this can be drawn from two sources First of all on the part of God Who in the order of His wisdom established various degrees in the angelic nature Now as the angelic nature was made by God for attaining grace and beatitude so likewise the grades of the angelic nature seem to be ordained for the various degrees of grace and glory just as when for example the builder chisels the stones for building a house from the fact that he prepares some more artistically and more fittingly than others it is clear that he is setting them apart for the more ornate part of the house So it seems that God destined those angels for greater gifts of grace and fuller beatitude whom He made of a higher nature Secondly the same is evident on the part of the angel The angel is not a compound of different natures so that the inclination of the one thwarts or retards the tendency of the other as happens in man in whom the movement of his intellective part is either retarded or thwarted by the inclination of his sensitive part But when there is nothing to retard or thwart it nature is moved with its whole energy So it is reasonable to suppose that the angels who had a higher nature were turned to God more mightily and efficaciously The same thing happens in men since greater grace and glory are bestowed according to the greater earnestness of their turning to God Hence it appears that the angels who had the greater natural powers had the more grace and glory Reply Obj one As grace comes of God s will alone so likewise does the nature of the angel and as God s will ordained nature for grace so did it ordain the various degrees of nature to the various degrees of grace Reply Obj two The acts of the rational creature are from the creature itself whereas nature is immediately from God Accordingly it seems rather that grace is bestowed according to degree of nature than according to works Reply Obj three Diversity of natural gifts is in one way in the angels who are themselves different specifically and in quite another way in men who differ only numerically For specific difference is on account of the end while numerical difference is because of the matter Furthermore there is something in man which can thwart or impede the movement of his intellective nature but not in the angels Consequently the argument is not the same for both SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q sixty two Art seven Whether Natural Knowledge and Love Remain in the Beatified Angels Objection one It would seem that natural knowledge and love do not remain in the beatified angels For it is said one Cor thirteen ten When that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away But natural love and knowledge are imperfect in comparison with beatified knowledge and love Therefore in beatitude natural knowledge and love cease Obj two Further where one suffices another is superfluous But the knowledge and love of glory suffice for the beatified angels Therefore it would be superfluous for their natural knowledge and love to remain Obj three Further the same faculty has not two simultaneous acts as the same line cannot at the same end be terminated in two points But the beatified angels are always exercising their beatified knowledge and love for as is said Ethic i eight happiness consists not in habit but in act Therefore there can never be natural knowledge and love in the angels On the contrary So long as a nature endures its operation remains But beatitude does not destroy nature since it is its perfection Therefore it does not take away natural knowledge and love I answer that Natural knowledge and love remain in the angels For as principles of operations are mutually related so are the operations themselves Now it is manifest that nature is to beatitude as first to second because beatitude is superadded to nature But the first must ever be preserved in the second Consequently nature must be preserved in beatitude and in like manner the act of nature must be preserved in the act of beatitude Reply Obj one The advent of a perfection removes the opposite imperfection Now the imperfection of nature is not opposed to the perfection of beatitude but underlies it as the imperfection of the power underlies the perfection of the form and the power is not taken away by the form but the privation which is opposed to the form In the same way the imperfection of natural knowledge is not opposed to the perfection of the knowledge in glory for nothing hinders us from knowing a thing through various mediums as a thing may be known at the one time through a probable medium and through a demonstrative one In like manner an angel can know God by His essence and this appertains to his knowledge of glory and at the same time he can know God by his own essence which belongs to his natural knowledge Reply Obj two All things which make up beatitude are sufficient of themselves But in order for them to exist they presuppose the natural gifts because no beatitude is self subsisting except the uncreated beatitude Reply Obj three There cannot be two operations of the one faculty at the one time except the one be ordained to the other But natural knowledge and love are ordained to the knowledge and love of glory Accordingly there is nothing to hinder natural knowledge and love from existing in the angel conjointly with those of glory EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q sixty two Art eight Whether a Beatified Angel Can Sin Objection one It would seem that a beatified angel can sin For as as said above A seven beatitude does not do away with nature But it is of the very notion of created nature that it can fail Therefore a beatified angel can sin Obj two Further the rational powers are referred to opposites as the Philosopher observes Metaph iv text three But the will of the angel in beatitude does not cease to be rational Therefore it is inclined towards good and evil Obj three Further it belongs to the liberty of free will for man to be able to choose good or evil But the freedom of will is not lessened in the beatified angels Therefore they can sin On the contrary Augustine says general ad lit xi that there is in the holy angels that nature which cannot sin Therefore the holy angels cannot sin I answer that The beatified angels cannot sin The reason for this is because their beatitude consists in seeing God through His essence Now God s essence is the very essence of goodness Consequently the angel beholding God is disposed towards God in the same way as anyone else not seeing God is to the common form of goodness Now it is impossible for any man either to will or to do anything except aiming at what is good or for him to wish to turn away from good precisely as such Therefore the beatified angel can neither will nor act except as aiming towards God Now whoever wills or acts in this manner cannot sin Consequently the beatified angel cannot sin Reply Obj one Created good considered in itself can fail But from its perfect union with the uncreated good such as is the union of beatitude it is rendered unable to sin for the reason already alleged Reply Obj two The rational powers are referred to opposites in the things to which they are not inclined naturally but as to the things whereunto they have a natural tendency they are not referred to opposites For the intellect cannot but assent to naturally known principles in the same way the will cannot help clinging to good formally as good because the will is naturally ordained to good as to its proper object Consequently the will of the angels is referred to opposites as to doing many things or not doing them But they have no tendency to opposites with regard to God Himself Whom they see to be the very nature of goodness but in all things their aim is towards God which ever alternative they choose that is not sinful Reply Obj three Free will in its choice of means to an end is disposed just as the intellect is to conclusions Now it is evident that it belongs to the power of the intellect to be able to proceed to different conclusions according to given principles but for it to proceed to some conclusion by passing out of the order of the principles comes of its own defect Hence it belongs to the perfection of its liberty for the free will to be able to choose between opposite things keeping the order of the end in view but it comes of the defect of liberty for it to choose anything by turning away from the order of the end and this is to sin Hence there is greater liberty of will in the angels who cannot sin than there is in ourselves who can sin NINTH ARTICLE I Q sixty two Art three Whether the Beatified Angels Advance in Beatitude Objection one It would seem that the beatified angels can advance in beatitude For charity is the principle of merit But there is perfect charity in the angels Therefore the beatified angels can merit Now as merit increases the reward of beatitude increases Therefore the beatified angels can progress in beatitude Obj two Further Augustine says De Doctr Christ i that God makes use of us for our own gain and for His own goodness The same thing happens to the angels whom He uses for spiritual ministrations since they are all Vulg Are they not all ministering spirits sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation Heb one fourteen This would not be for their profit were they not to merit thereby nor to advance to beatitude It remains then that the beatified angels can merit and can advance in beatitude Obj three Further it argues imperfection for anyone not occupying the foremost place not to be able to advance But the angels are not in the highest degree of beatitude Therefore if unable to ascend higher it would appear that there is imperfection and defect in them which is not admissible On the contrary Merit and progress belong to this present condition of life But angels are not wayfarers travelling towards beatitude they are already in possession of beatitude Consequently the beatified angels can neither merit nor advance in beatitude I answer that In every movement the mover s intention is centered upon one determined end to which he intends to lead the movable subject because intention looks to the end to which infinite progress is repugnant Now it is evident since the rational creature cannot of its own power attain to its beatitude which consists in the vision of God as is clear from what has gone before Q twelve A four that it needs to be moved by God towards its beatitude Therefore there must be some one determined thing to which every rational creature is directed as to its last end Now this one determinate object cannot in the vision of God consist precisely in that which is seen for the Supreme Truth is seen by all the blessed in various degrees but it is on the part of the mode of vision that diverse terms are fixed beforehand by the intention of Him Who directs towards the end For it is impossible that as the rational creature is led on to the vision of the Supreme Essence it should be led on in the same way to the supreme mode of vision which is comprehension for this belongs to God only as is evident from what was said above Q twelve A seven Q fourteen A three But since infinite efficacy is required for comprehending God while the creature s efficacy in beholding is only finite and since every finite being is in infinite degrees removed from the infinite it comes to pass that the rational creature understands God more or less clearly according to infinite degrees And as beatitude consists in vision so the degree of vision lies in a determinate mode of the vision Therefore every rational creature is so led by God to the end of its beatitude that from God s predestination it is brought even to a determinate degree of beatitude Consequently when that degree is once secured it cannot pass to a higher degree Reply Obj one Merit belongs to a subject which is moving towards its end Now the rational creature is moved towards its end not merely passively but also by working actively If the end is within the power of the rational creature then its action is said to procure the end as man acquires knowledge by reflection but if the end be beyond its power and is looked for from another then the action will be meritorious of such end But what is already in the ultimate term is not said to be moved but to have been moved Consequently to merit belongs to the imperfect charity of this life whereas perfect charity does not merit but rather enjoys the reward Even as in acquired habits the operation preceding the habit is productive of the habit but the operation from an acquired habit is both perfect and enjoyable In the same way the act of perfect charity has no quality of merit but belongs rather to the perfection of the reward Reply Obj two A thing can be termed useful in two ways First of all as being on the way to an end and so the merit of beatitude is useful Secondly as the part is useful for the whole as the wall for a house In this way the angelic ministerings are useful for the beatified angels inasmuch as they are a part of their beatitude for to pour out acquired perfection upon others is of the nature of what is perfect considered as perfect Reply Obj three Although a beatified angel is not absolutely in the highest degree of beatitude yet in his own regard he is in the highest degree according to Divine predestination Nevertheless the joy of the angels can be increased with regard to the salvation of such as are saved by their ministrations according to Luke fifteen ten There is Vulg shall be joy before the angels of God upon one sinner doing penance Such joy belongs to their accidental reward which can be increased unto judgment day Hence some writers say that they can merit as to their accidental reward But it is better to say that the Blessed can in no wise merit without being at the same time a wayfarer and a comprehensor like Christ Who alone was such For the Blessed acquire such joy from the virtue of their beatitude rather than merit it QUESTION sixty three THE MALICE OF THE ANGELS WITH REGARD TO SIN In Nine Articles In the next place we must consider how angels became evil first of all with regard to the evil of fault and secondly as to the evil of punishment Under the first heading there are nine points for consideration one Can there be evil of fault in the angels two What kind of sins can be in them three What did the angel seek in sinning four Supposing that some became evil by a sin of their own choosing are any of them naturally evil five Supposing that it is not so could any one of them become evil in the first instant of his creation by an act of his own will six Supposing that he did not was there any interval between his creation and fall seven Was the highest of them who fell absolutely the highest among the angels eight Was the sin of the foremost angel the cause of the others sinning nine Did as many sin as remained steadfast FIRST ARTICLE I Q sixty three Art one Whether the Evil of Fault Can Be in the Angels Objection one It would seem that there can be no evil of fault in the angels For there can be no evil except in things which are in potentiality as is said by the Philosopher Metaph ix text nineteen because the subject of privation is a being in potentiality But the angels have not being in potentiality since they are subsisting forms Therefore there can be no evil in them Obj two Further the angels are higher than the heavenly bodies But philosophers say that there cannot be evil in the heavenly bodies Therefore neither can there be in the angels Obj three Further what is natural to a thing is always in it But it is natural for the angels to be moved by the movement of love towards God Therefore such love cannot be withdrawn from them But in loving God they do not sin Consequently the angels cannot sin Obj four Further desire is only of what is good or apparently good Now for the angels there can be no apparent good which is not a true good because in them either there can be no error at all or at least not before guilt Therefore the angels can desire only what it truly good But no one sins by desiring what is truly good Consequently the angel does not sin by desire On the contrary It is said Job four eighteen In His angels He found wickedness I answer that An angel or any other rational creature considered in his own nature can sin and to whatever creature it belongs not to sin such creature has it as a gift of grace and not from the condition of nature The reason of this is because sinning is nothing else than a deviation from that rectitude which an act ought to have whether we speak of sin in nature art or morals That act alone the rule of which is the very virtue of the agent can never fall short of rectitude Were the craftsman s hand the rule itself engraving he could not engrave the wood otherwise than rightly but if the rightness of engraving be judged by another rule then the engraving may be right or faulty Now the Divine will is the sole rule of God s act because it is not referred to any higher end But every created will has rectitude of act so far only as it is regulated according to the Divine will to which the last end is to be referred as every desire of a subordinate ought to be regulated by the will of his superior for instance the soldier s will according to the will of his commanding officer Thus only in the Divine will can there be no sin whereas there can be sin in the will of every creature considering the condition of its nature Reply Obj one In the angels there is no potentiality to natural existence Yet there is potentiality in their intellective part as regards their being inclined to this or the other object In this respect there can be evil in them Reply Obj two The heavenly bodies have none but a natural operation Therefore as there can be no evil of corruption in their nature so neither can there be evil of disorder in their natural action But besides their natural action there is the action of free will in the angels by reason of which evil may be in them Reply Obj three It is natural for the angel to turn to God by the movement of love according as God is the principle of his natural being But for him to turn to God as the object of supernatural beatitude comes of infused love from which he could be turned away by sinning Reply Obj four Mortal sin occurs in two ways in the act of free will First when something evil is chosen as man sins by choosing adultery which is evil of itself Such sin always comes of ignorance or error otherwise what is evil would never be chosen as good The adulterer errs in the particular choosing this delight of an inordinate act as something good to be performed now from the inclination of passion or of habit even though he does not err in his universal judgment but retains a right opinion in this respect In this way there can be no sin in the angel because there are no passions in the angels to fetter reason or intellect as is manifest from what has been said above Q fifty nine A four nor again could any habit inclining to sin precede their first sin In another way sin comes of free will by choosing something good in itself but not according to proper measure or rule so that the defect which induces sin is only on the part of the choice which is not properly regulated but not on the part of the thing chosen as if one were to pray without heeding the order established by the Church Such a sin does not presuppose ignorance but merely absence of consideration of the things which ought to be considered In this way the angel sinned by seeking his own good from his own free will insubordinately to the rule of the Divine will SECOND ARTICLE I Q sixty three Art two Whether Only the Sin of Pride and Envy Can Exist in an Angel Objection one It would seem that there can be other sins in the angels besides those of pride and envy Because whosoever can delight in any kind of sin can fall into the sin itself But the demons delight even in the obscenities of carnal sins as Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv three Therefore there can also be carnal sins in the demons Obj two Further as pride and envy are spiritual sins so are sloth avarice and anger But spiritual sins are concerned with the spirit just as carnal sins are with the flesh Therefore not only can there be pride and envy in the angels but likewise sloth and avarice Obj three Further according to Gregory Moral xxxi many vices spring from pride and in like manner from envy But if the cause is granted the effect follows If therefore there can be pride and envy in the angels for the same reason there can likewise be other vices in them On the contrary Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv three that the devil is not a fornicator nor a drunkard nor anything of the like sort yet he is proud and envious I answer that Sin can exist in a subject in two ways first of all by actual guilt and secondly by affection As to guilt all sins are in the demons since by leading men to sin they incur the guilt of all sins But as to affection only those sins can be in the demons which can belong to a spiritual nature Now a spiritual nature cannot be affected by such pleasures as appertain to bodies but only by such as are in keeping with spiritual things because nothing is affected except with regard to something which is in some way suited to its nature But there can be no sin when anyone is incited to good of the spiritual order unless in such affection the rule of the superior be not kept Such is precisely the sin of pride not to be subject to a superior when subjection is due Consequently the first sin of the angel can be none other than pride Yet as a consequence it was possible for envy also to be in them since for the appetite to tend to the desire of something involves on its part resistance to anything contrary Now the envious man repines over the good possessed by another inasmuch as he deems his neighbor s good to be a hindrance to his own But another s good could not be deemed a hindrance to the good coveted by the wicked angel except inasmuch as he coveted a singular excellence which would cease to be singular because of the excellence of some other So after the sin of pride there followed the evil of envy in the sinning angel whereby he grieved over man s good and also over the Divine excellence according as against the devil s will God makes use of man for the Divine glory Reply Obj one The demons do not delight in the obscenities of the sins of the flesh as if they themselves were disposed to carnal pleasures it is wholly through envy that they take pleasure in all sorts of human sins so far as these are hindrances to a man s good Reply Obj two Avarice considered as a special kind of sin is the immoderate greed of temporal possessions which serve the use of human life and which can be estimated in value of money to these demons are not at all inclined any more than they are to carnal pleasures Consequently avarice properly so called cannot be in them But if every immoderate greed of possessing any created good be termed avarice in this way avarice is contained under the pride which is in the demons Anger implies passion and so does concupiscence consequently they can only exist metaphorically in the demons Sloth is a kind of sadness whereby a man becomes sluggish in spiritual exercises because they weary the body which does not apply to the demons So it is evident that pride and envy are the only spiritual sins which can be found in demons yet so that envy is not to be taken for a passion but for a will resisting the good of another Reply Obj three Under envy and pride as found in the demons are comprised all other sins derived from them THIRD ARTICLE I Q sixty three Art three Whether the Devil Desired to Be As God Objection one It would seem that the devil did not desire to be as God For what does not fall under apprehension does not fall under desire because the good which is apprehended moves the appetite whether sensible rational or intellectual and sin consists only in such desire But for any creature to be God s equal does not fall under apprehension because it implies a contradiction for it the finite equals the infinite then it would itself be infinite Therefore an angel could not desire to be as God Obj two Further the natural end can always be desired without sin But to be likened unto God is the end to which every creature naturally tends If therefore the angel desired to be as God not by equality but by likeness it would seem that he did not thereby sin Obj three Further the angel was created with greater fulness of wisdom than man But no man save a fool ever makes choice of being the equal of an angel still less of God because choice regards only things which are possible regarding which one takes deliberation Therefore much less did the angel sin by desiring to be as God On the contrary It is said in the person of the devil Isa fourteen thirteen fourteen I will ascend into heaven I will be like the Most High And Augustine De Qu Vet Test cxiii says that being inflated with pride he wished to be called God I answer that Without doubt the angel sinned by seeking to be as God But this can be understood in two ways first by equality secondly by likeness He could not seek to be as God in the first way because by natural knowledge he knew that this was impossible and there was no habit preceding his first sinful act nor any passion fettering his mind so as to lead him to choose what was impossible by failing in some particular as sometimes happens in ourselves And even supposing it were possible it would be against the natural desire because there exists in everything the natural desire of preserving its own nature which would not be preserved were it to be changed into another nature Consequently no creature of a lower order can ever covet the grade of a higher nature just as an ass does not desire to be a horse for were it to be so upraised it would cease to be itself But herein the imagination plays us false for one is liable to think that because a man seeks to occupy a higher grade as to accidentals which can increase without the destruction of the subject he can also seek a higher grade of nature to which he could not attain without ceasing to exist Now it is quite evident that God surpasses the angels not merely in accidentals but also in degree of nature and one angel another Consequently it is impossible for one angel of lower degree to desire equality with a higher and still more to covet equality with God To desire to be as God according to likeness can happen in two ways In one way as to that likeness whereby everything is made to be likened unto God And so if anyone desire in this way to be Godlike he commits no sin provided that he desires such likeness in proper order that is to say that he may obtain it of God But he would sin were he to desire to be like unto God even in the right way as of his own and not of God s power In another way one may desire to be like unto God in some respect which is not natural to one as if one were to desire to create heaven and earth which is proper to God in which desire there would be sin It was in this way that the devil desired to be as God Not that he desired to resemble God by being subject to no one else absolutely for so he would be desiring his own not being since no creature can exist except by holding its existence under God But he desired resemblance with God in this respect by desiring as his last end of beatitude something which he could attain by the virtue of his own nature turning his appetite away from supernatural beatitude which is attained by God s grace Or if he desired as his last end that likeness of God which is bestowed by grace he sought to have it by the power of his own nature and not from Divine assistance according to God s ordering This harmonizes with Anselm s opinion who says De casu diaboli iv that he sought that to which he would have come had he stood fast These two views in a manner coincide because according to both he sought to have final beatitude of his own power whereas this is proper to God alone Since then what exists of itself is the cause of what exists of another it follows from this furthermore that he sought to have dominion over others wherein he also perversely wished to be like unto God From this we have the answer to all the objections FOURTH ARTICLE I Q sixty three Art four Whether Any Demons Are Naturally Wicked Objection one It would seem that some demons are naturally wicked For Porphyry says as quoted by Augustine De Civ Dei x eleven There is a class of demons of crafty nature pretending that they are gods and the souls of the dead But to be deceitful is to be evil Therefore some demons are naturally wicked Obj two Further as the angels are created by God so are men But some men are naturally wicked of whom it is said Wis twelve ten Their malice is natural Therefore some angels may be naturally wicked Obj three Further some irrational animals have wicked dispositions by nature thus the fox is naturally sly and the wolf naturally rapacious yet they are God s creatures Therefore although the demons are God s creatures they may be naturally wicked On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom iv that the demons are not naturally wicked I answer that Everything which exists so far as it exists and has a particular nature tends naturally towards some good since it comes from a good principle because the effect always reverts to its principle Now a particular good may happen to have some evil connected with it thus fire has this evil connected with it that it consumes other things but with the universal good no evil can be connected If then there be anything whose nature is inclined towards some particular good it can tend naturally to some evil not as evil but accidentally as connected with some good But if anything of its nature be inclined to good in general then of its own nature it cannot be inclined to evil Now it is manifest that every intellectual nature is inclined towards good in general which it can apprehend and which is the object of the will Hence since the demons are intellectual substances they can in no wise have a natural inclination towards any evil whatsoever consequently they cannot be naturally evil Reply Obj one Augustine rebukes Porphyry for saying that the demons are naturally deceitful himself maintaining that they are not naturally so but of their own will Now the reason why Porphyry held that they are naturally deceitful was that as he contended demons are animals with a sensitive nature Now the sensitive nature is inclined towards some particular good with which evil may be connected In this way then it can have a natural inclination to evil yet only accidentally inasmuch as evil is connected with good Reply Obj two The malice of some men can be called natural either because of custom which is a second nature or on account of the natural proclivity on the part of the sensitive nature to some inordinate passion as some people are said to be naturally wrathful or lustful but not on the part of the intellectual nature Reply Obj three Brute beasts have a natural inclination in their sensitive nature towards certain particular goods with which certain evils are connected thus the fox in seeking its food has a natural inclination to do so with a certain skill coupled with deceit Wherefore it is not evil in the fox to be sly since it is natural to him as it is not evil in the dog to be fierce as Dionysius observes De Div Nom iv FIFTH ARTICLE I Q sixty three Art five Whether the Devil Was Wicked by the Fault of His Own Will in the First Instant of His Creation Objection one It would seem that the devil was wicked by the fault of his own will in the first instant of his creation For it is said of the devil John eight forty four He was a murderer from the beginning Obj two Further according to Augustine general ad lit i fifteen the lack of form in the creature did not precede its formation in order of time but merely in order of nature Now according to him general ad lit ii eight the heaven which is said to have been created in the beginning signifies the angelic nature while as yet not fully formed and when it is said that God said Be light made and light was made we are to understand the full formation of the angel by turning to the Word Consequently the nature of the angel was created and light was made in the one instant But at the same moment that light was made it was made distinct from darkness whereby the angels who sinned are denoted Therefore in the first instant of their creation some of the angels were made blessed and some sinned Obj three Further sin is opposed to merit But some intellectual nature can merit in the first instant of its creation as the soul of Christ or also the good angels Therefore the demons likewise could sin in the first instant of their creation Obj four Further the angelic nature is more powerful than the corporeal nature But a corporeal thing begins to have its operation in the first instant of its creation as fire begins to move upwards in the first instant it is produced Therefore the angel could also have his operation in the first instant of his creation Now this operation was either ordinate or inordinate If ordinate then since he had grace he thereby merited beatitude But with the angels the reward follows immediately upon merit as was said above Q sixty two A five Consequently they would have become blessed at once and so would never have sinned which is false It remains then that they sinned by inordinate action in their first instant On the contrary It is written general one thirty one God saw all the things that He had made and they were very good But among them were also the demons Therefore the demons were at some time good I answer that Some have maintained that the demons were wicked straightway in the first instant of their creation not by their nature but by the sin of their own will because as soon as he was made the devil refused righteousness To this opinion as Augustine says De Civ Dei xi thirteen if anyone subscribes he does not agree with those Manichean heretics who say that the devil s nature is evil of itself Since this opinion however is in contradiction with the authority of Scripture for it is said of the devil under the figure of the prince of Babylon Isa fourteen twelve How art thou fallen O Lucifer who didst rise in the morning and it is said to the devil in the person of the King of Tyre Ezech twenty eight thirteen Thou wast in the pleasures of the paradise of God consequently this opinion was reasonably rejected by the masters as erroneous Hence others have said that the angels in the first instant of their creation could have sinned but did not Yet this view also is repudiated by some because when two operations follow one upon the other it seems impossible for each operation to terminate in the one instant Now it is clear that the angel s sin was an act subsequent to his creation But the term of the creative act is the angel s very being while the term of the sinful act is the being wicked It seems then an impossibility for the angel to have been wicked in the first instant of his existence This argument however does not satisfy For it holds good only in such movements as are measured by time and take place successively thus if local movement follows a change then the change and the local movement cannot be terminated in the same instant But if the changes are instantaneous then all at once and in the same instant there can be a term to the first and the second change thus in the same instant in which the moon is lit up by the sun the atmosphere is lit up by the moon Now it is manifest that creation is instantaneous so also is the movement of free will in the angels for as has been already stated they have no occasion for comparison or discursive reasoning Q fifty eight A three Consequently there is nothing to hinder the term of creation and of free will from existing in the same instant We must therefore reply that on the contrary it was impossible for the angel to sin in the first instant by an inordinate act of free will For although a thing can begin to act in the first instant of its existence nevertheless that operation which begins with the existence comes of the agent from which it drew its nature just as upward movement in fire comes of its productive cause Therefore if there be anything which derives its nature from a defective cause which can be the cause of a defective action it can in the first instant of its existence have a defective operation just as the leg which is defective from birth through a defect in the principle of generation begins at once to limp But the agent which brought the angels into existence namely God cannot be the cause of sin Consequently it cannot be said that the devil was wicked in the first instant of his creation Reply Obj one As Augustine says De Civ Dei xi fifteen when it is stated that the devil sins from the beginning he is not to be thought of as sinning from the beginning wherein he was created but from the beginning of sin that is to say because he never went back from his sin Reply Obj two That distinction of light and darkness whereby the sins of the demons are understood by the term darkness must be taken as according to God s foreknowledge Hence Augustine says De Civ Dei xi fifteen that He alone could discern light and darkness Who also could foreknow before they fell those who would fall Reply Obj three All that is in merit is from God and consequently an angel could merit in the first instant of his creation The same reason does not hold good of sin as has been said Reply Obj four God did not distinguish between the angels before the turning away of some of them and the turning of others to Himself as Augustine says De Civ Dei xi fifteen Therefore as all were created in grace all merited in their first instant But some of them at once placed an impediment to their beatitude thereby destroying their preceding merit and consequently they were deprived of the beatitude which they had merited SIXTH ARTICLE I Q sixty three Art six Whether There Was Any Interval Between the Creation and the Fall of the Angel Objection one It would seem that there was some interval between the angel s creation and his fall For it is said Ezech twenty eight fifteen Thou didst walk perfect Vulg Thou hast walked in the midst of the stones of fire thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day of thy creation until iniquity was found in thee But since walking is continuous movement it requires an interval Therefore there was some interval between the devil s creation and his fall Obj two Further Origen says Hom i in Ezech that the serpent of old did not from the first walk upon his breast and belly which refers to his sin Therefore the devil did not sin at once after the first instant of his creation Obj three Further capability of sinning is common alike to man and angel But there was some delay between man s formation and his sin Therefore for the like reason there was some interval between the devil s formation and his sin Obj four Further the instant wherein the devil sinned was distinct from the instant wherein he was created But there is a middle time between every two instants Therefore there was an interval between his creation and his fall On the contrary It is said of the devil John eight forty four He stood not in the truth and as Augustine says De Civ Dei xi fifteen we must understand this in the sense that he was in the truth but did not remain in it I answer that There is a twofold opinion on this point But the more probable one which is also more in harmony with the teachings of the Saints is that the devil sinned at once after the first instant of his creation This must be maintained if it be held that he elicited an act of free will in the first instant of his creation and that he was created in grace as we have said Q sixty two A three For since the angels attain beatitude by one meritorious act as was said above Q sixty two A five if the devil created in grace merited in the first instant he would at once have received beatitude after that first instant if he had not placed an impediment by sinning If however it be contended that the angel was not created in grace or that he could not elicit an act of free will in the first instant then there is nothing to prevent some interval being interposed between his creation and fall Reply Obj one Sometimes in Holy Scripture spiritual instantaneous movements are represented by corporeal movements which are measured by time In this way by walking we are to understand the movement of free will tending towards good Reply Obj two Origen says The serpent of old did not from the first walk upon his breast and belly because of the first instant in which he was not wicked Reply Obj three An angel has an inflexible free will after once choosing consequently if after the first instant in which he had a natural movement to good he had not at once placed a barrier to beatitude he would have been confirmed in good It is not so with man and therefore the argument does not hold good Reply Obj four It is true to say that there is a middle time between every two instants so far as time is continuous as it is proved Phys vi text two But in the angels who are not subject to the heavenly movement which is primarily measured by continuous time time is taken to mean the succession of their mental acts or of their affections So the first instant in the angels is understood to respond to the operation of the angelic mind whereby it introspects itself by its evening knowledge because on the first day evening is mentioned but not morning This operation was good in them all From such operation some of them were converted to the praise of the Word by their morning knowledge while others absorbed in themselves became night swelling up with pride as Augustine says general ad lit iv twenty four Hence the first act was common to them all but in their second they were separated Consequently they were all of them good in the first instant but in the second the good were set apart from the wicked SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q sixty three Art seven Whether the Highest Angel Among Those Who Sinned Was the Highest of All Objection one It would seem that the highest among the angels who sinned was not the highest of all For it is stated Ezech twenty eight fourteen Thou wast a cherub stretched out and protecting and I set thee in the holy mountain of God Now the order of the Cherubim is under the order of the Seraphim as Dionysius says Coel Hier vi vii Therefore the highest angel among those who sinned was not the highest of all Obj two Further God made intellectual nature in order that it might attain to beatitude If therefore the highest of the angels sinned it follows that the Divine ordinance was frustrated in the noblest creature which is unfitting Obj three Further the more a subject is inclined towards anything so much the less can it fall away from it But the higher an angel is so much the more is he inclined towards God Therefore so much the less can he turn away from God by sinning And so it seems that the angel who sinned was not the highest of all but one of the lower angels On the contrary Gregory Hom xxxiv in Ev says that the chief angel who sinned being set over all the hosts of angels surpassed them in brightness and was by comparison the most illustrious among them I answer that Two things have to be considered in sin namely the proneness to sin and the motive for sinning If then in the angels we consider the proneness to sin it seems that the higher angels were less likely to sin than the lower On this account Damascene says De Fide Orth ii that the highest of those who sinned was set over the terrestrial order This opinion seems to agree with the view of the Platonists which Augustine quotes De Civ Dei vii six seven x nine ten eleven For they said that all the gods were good whereas some of the demons were good and some bad naming as gods the intellectual substances which are above the lunar sphere and calling by the name of demons the intellectual substances which are beneath it yet higher than men in the order of nature Nor is this opinion to be rejected as contrary to faith because the whole corporeal creation is governed by God through the angels as Augustine says De Trin iii forty five Consequently there is nothing to prevent us from saying that the lower angels were divinely set aside for presiding over the lower bodies the higher over the higher bodies and the highest to stand before God And in this sense Damascene says De Fide Orth ii that they who fell were of the lower grade of angels yet in that order some of them remained good But if the motive for sinning be considered we find that it existed in the higher angels more than in the lower For as has been said A two the demons sin was pride and the motive of pride is excellence which was greater in the higher spirits Hence Gregory says that he who sinned was the very highest of all This seems to be the more probable view because the angels sin did not come of any proneness but of free choice alone Consequently that argument seems to have the more weight which is drawn from the motive in sinning Yet this must not be prejudicial to the other view because there might be some motive for sinning in him also who was the chief of the lower angels Reply Obj one Cherubim is interpreted fulness of knowledge while Seraphim means those who are on fire or who set on fire Consequently Cherubim is derived from knowledge which is compatible with mortal sin but Seraphim is derived from the heat of charity which is incompatible with mortal sin Therefore the first angel who sinned is called not a Seraph but a Cherub Reply Obj two The Divine intention is not frustrated either in those who sin or in those who are saved for God knows beforehand the end of both and He procures glory from both saving these of His goodness and punishing those of His justice But the intellectual creature when it sins falls away from its due end Nor is this unfitting in any exalted creature because the intellectual creature was so made by God that it lies within its own will to act for its end Reply Obj three However great was the inclination towards good in the highest angel there was no necessity imposed upon him consequently it was in his power not to follow it EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q sixty three Art eight Whether the Sin of the Highest Angel Was the Cause of the Others Sinning Objection one It would seem that the sin of the highest angel was not the cause of the others sinning For the cause precedes the effect But as Damascene observes De Fide Orth ii they all sinned at one time Therefore the sin of one was not the cause of the others sinning Obj two Further an angel s first sin can only be pride as was shown above A two But pride seeks excellence Now it is more contrary to excellence for anyone to be subject to an inferior than to a superior and so it does not appear that the angels sinned by desiring to be subject to a higher angel rather than to God Yet the sin of one angel would have been the cause of the others sinning if he had induced them to be his subjects Therefore it does not appear that the sin of the highest angel was the cause of the others sinning Obj three Further it is a greater sin to wish to be subject to another against God than to wish to be over another against God because there is less motive for sinning If therefore the sin of the foremost angel was the cause of the others sinning in that he induced them to subject themselves to him then the lower angels would have sinned more deeply than the highest one which is contrary to a gloss on Ps one hundred three twenty six This dragon which Thou hast formed He who was the more excellent than the rest in nature became the greater in malice Therefore the sin of the highest angel was not the cause of the others sinning On the contrary It is said Apoc twelve four that the dragon drew with him the third part of the stars of heaven I answer that The sin of the highest angel was the cause of the others sinning not as compelling them but as inducing them by a kind of exhortation A token thereof appears in this that all the demons are subjects of that highest one as is evident from our Lord s words Go Vulg Depart from Me you cursed into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels Matt twenty five forty one For the order of Divine justice exacts that whosoever consents to another s evil suggestion shall be subjected to him in his punishment according to two Pet two nineteen By whom a man is overcome of the same also he is the slave Reply Obj one Although the demons all sinned in the one instant yet the sin of one could be the cause of the rest sinning For the angel needs no delay of time for choice exhortation or consent as man who requires deliberation in order to choose and consent and vocal speech in order to exhort both of which are the work of time And it is evident that even man begins to speak in the very instant when he takes thought and in the last instant of speech another who catches his meaning can assent to what is said as is especially evident with regard to primary concepts which everyone accepts directly they are heard Boethius De Hebdom Taking away then the time for speech and deliberation which is required in us in the same instant in which the highest angel expressed his affection by intelligible speech it was possible for the others to consent thereto Reply Obj two Other things being equal the proud would rather be subject to a superior than to an inferior Yet he chooses rather to be subject to an inferior than to a superior if he can procure an advantage under an inferior which he cannot under a superior Consequently it was not against the demons pride for them to wish to serve an inferior by yielding to his rule for they wanted to have him as their prince and leader so that they might attain their ultimate beatitude of their own natural powers especially because in the order of nature they were even then subject to the highest angel Reply Obj three As was observed above Q sixty two A six an angel has nothing in him to retard his action and with his whole might he is moved to whatsoever he is moved be it good or bad Consequently since the highest angel had greater natural energy than the lower angels he fell into sin with intenser energy and therefore he became the greater in malice NINTH ARTICLE I Q sixty three Art nine Whether Those Who Sinned Were As Many As Those Who Remained Firm Objection one It would seem that more angels sinned than stood firm For as the Philosopher says Ethic ii six Evil is in many but good is in few Obj two Further justice and sin are to be found in the same way in men and in angels But there are more wicked men to be found than good according to Eccles one fifteen The number of fools is infinite Therefore for the same reason it is so with the angels Obj three Further the angels are distinguished according to persons and orders Therefore if more angelic persons stood firm it would appear that those who sinned were not from all the orders On the contrary It is said four Kings six sixteen There are more with us than with them which is expounded of the good angels who are with us to aid us and the wicked spirits who are our foes I answer that More angels stood firm than sinned Because sin is contrary to the natural inclination while that which is against the natural order happens with less frequency for nature procures its effects either always or more often than not Reply Obj one The Philosopher is speaking with regard to men in whom evil comes to pass from seeking after sensible pleasures which are known to most men and from forsaking the good dictated by reason which good is known to the few In the angels there is only an intellectual nature hence the argument does not hold And from this we have the answer to the second difficulty Reply Obj three According to those who hold that the chief devil belonged to the lower order of the angels who are set over earthly affairs it is evident that some of every order did not fall but only those of the lowest order According to those who maintain that the chief devil was of the highest order it is probable that some fell of every order just as men are taken up into every order to supply for the angelic ruin In this view the liberty of free will is more established which in every degree of creature can be turned to evil In the Sacred Scripture however the names of some orders as of Seraphim and Thrones are not attributed to demons since they are derived from the ardor of love and from God s indwelling which are not consistent with mortal sin Yet the names of Cherubim Powers and Principalities are attributed to them because these names are derived from knowledge and from power which can be common to both good and bad QUESTION sixty four THE PUNISHMENT OF THE DEMONS In Four Articles It now remains as a sequel to deal with the punishment of the demons under which heading there are four points of inquiry one Of their darkness of intellect two Of their obstinacy of will three Of their grief four Of their place of punishment FIRST ARTICLE I Q sixty four Art one Whether the Demons Intellect Is Darkened by Privation of the Knowledge of All Truth Objection one It would seem that the demons intellect is darkened by being deprived of the knowledge of all truth For if they knew any truth at all they would most of all know themselves which is to know separated substances But this is not in keeping with their unhappiness for this seems to belong to great happiness insomuch as that some writers have assigned as man s last happiness the knowledge of the separated substances Therefore the demons are deprived of all knowledge of truth Obj two Further what is most manifest in its nature seems to be specially manifest to the angels whether good or bad That the same is not manifest with regard to ourselves comes from the weakness of our intellect which draws its knowledge from phantasms as it comes from the weakness of its eye that the owl cannot behold the light of the sun But the demons cannot know God Who is most manifest of Himself because He is the sovereign truth and this is because they are not clean of heart whereby alone can God be seen Therefore neither can they know other things Obj three Further according to Augustine general ad lit iv twenty two the proper knowledge of the angels is twofold namely morning and evening But the demons have no morning knowledge because they do not see things in the Word nor have they the evening knowledge because this evening knowledge refers the things known to the Creator s praise hence after evening comes morning general one Therefore the demons can have no knowledge of things Obj four Further the angels at their creation knew the mystery of the kingdom of God as Augustine says general ad lit v nineteen De Civ Dei xi But the demons are deprived of such knowledge for if they had known it they would never have crucified the Lord of glory as is said one Cor two eight Therefore for the same reason they are deprived of all other knowledge of truth Obj five Further whatever truth anyone knows is known either naturally as we know first principles or by deriving it from someone else as we know by learning or by long experience as the things we learn by discovery Now the demons cannot know the truth by their own nature because as Augustine says De Civ Dei xi thirty three the good angels are separated from them as light is from darkness and every manifestation is made through light as is said Eph five thirteen In like manner they cannot learn by revelation nor by learning from the good angels because there is no fellowship of light with darkness Vulg What fellowship hath two Cor six fourteen Nor can they learn by long experience because experience comes of the senses Consequently there is no knowledge of truth in them On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom iv that certain gifts were bestowed upon the demons which we say have not been changed at all but remain entire and most brilliant Now the knowledge of truth stands among those natural gifts Consequently there is some knowledge of truth in them I answer that The knowledge of truth is twofold one which comes of nature and one which comes of grace The knowledge which comes of grace is likewise twofold the first is purely speculative as when Divine secrets are imparted to an individual the other is effective and produces love for God which knowledge properly belongs to the gift of wisdom Of these three kinds of knowledge the first was neither taken away nor lessened in the demons For it follows from the very nature of the angel who according to his nature is an intellect or mind since on account of the simplicity of his substance nothing can be withdrawn from his nature so as to punish him by subtracting from his natural powers as a man is punished by being deprived of a hand or a foot or of something else Therefore Dionysius says Div Nom iv that the natural gifts remain entire in them Consequently their natural knowledge was not diminished The second kind of knowledge however which comes of grace and consists in speculation has not been utterly taken away from them but lessened because of these Divine secrets only so much is revealed to them as is necessary and that is done either by means of the angels or through some temporal workings of Divine power as Augustine says De Civ Dei ix twenty one but not in the same degree as to the holy angels to whom many more things are revealed and more fully in the Word Himself But of the third knowledge as likewise of charity they are utterly deprived Reply Obj one Happiness consists in self application to something higher The separated substances are above us in the order of nature hence man can have happiness of a kind by knowing the separated substances although his perfect happiness consists in knowing the first substance namely God But it is quite natural for one separate substance to know another as it is natural for us to know sensible natures Hence as man s happiness does not consist in knowing sensible natures so neither does the angel s happiness consist in knowing separated substances Reply Obj two What is most manifest in its nature is hidden from us by its surpassing the bounds of our intellect and not merely because our intellect draws knowledge from phantasms Now the Divine substance surpasses the proportion not only of the human intellect but even of the angelic Consequently not even an angel can of his own nature know God s substance Yet on account of the perfection of his intellect he can of his nature have a higher knowledge of God than man can have Such knowledge of God remains also in the demons Although they do not possess the purity which comes with grace nevertheless they have purity of nature and this suffices for the knowledge of God which belongs to them from their nature Reply Obj three The creature is darkness in comparison with the excellence of the Divine light and therefore the creature s knowledge in its own nature is called evening knowledge For the evening is akin to darkness yet it possesses some light but when the light fails utterly then it is night So then the knowledge of things in their own nature when referred to the praise of the Creator as it is in the good angels has something of the Divine light and can be called evening knowledge but if it be not referred to God as is the case with the demons it is not called evening but nocturnal knowledge Accordingly we read in general one five that the darkness which God separated from the light He called night Reply Obj four All the angels had some knowledge from the very beginning respecting the mystery of God s kingdom which found its completion in Christ and most of all from the moment when they were beatified by the vision of the Word which vision the demons never had Yet all the angels did not fully and equally apprehend it hence the demons much less fully understood the mystery of the Incarnation when Christ was in the world For as Augustine observes De Civ Dei ix twenty one It was not manifested to them as it was to the holy angels who enjoy a participated eternity of the Word but it was made known by some temporal effects so as to strike terror into them For had they fully and certainly known that He was the Son of God and the effect of His passion they would never have procured the crucifixion of the Lord of glory Reply Obj five The demons know a truth in three ways first of all by the subtlety of their nature for although they are darkened by privation of the light of grace yet they are enlightened by the light of their intellectual nature secondly by revelation from the holy angels for while not agreeing with them in conformity of will they do agree nevertheless by their likeness of intellectual nature according to which they can accept what is manifested by others thirdly they know by long experience not as deriving it from the senses but when the similitude of their innate intelligible species is completed in individual things they know some things as present which they previously did not know would come to pass as we said when dealing with the knowledge of the angels Q fifty seven A three ad three SECOND ARTICLE I Q sixty four Art two Whether the Will of the Demons Is Obstinate in Evil Objection one It would seem that the will of the demons is not obstinate in evil For liberty of will belongs to the nature of an intellectual being which nature remains in the demons as we said above A one But liberty of will is directly and firstly ordained to good rather than to evil Therefore the demons will is not so obstinate in evil as not to be able to return to what is good Obj two Further since God s mercy is infinite it is greater than the demons malice which is finite But no one returns from the malice of sin to the goodness of justice save through God s mercy Therefore the demons can likewise return from their state of malice to the state of justice Obj three Further if the demons have a will obstinate in evil then their will would be especially obstinate in the sin whereby they fell But that sin namely pride is in them no longer because the motive for the sin no longer endures namely excellence Therefore the demon is not obstinate in malice Obj four Further Gregory says Moral iv that man can be reinstated by another since he fell through another But as was observed already Q sixty three A eight the lower demons fell through the highest one Therefore their fall can be repaired by another Consequently they are not obstinate in malice Obj five Further whoever is obstinate in malice never performs any good work But the demon performs some good works for he confesses the truth saying to Christ I know Who Thou art the holy one of God Mark one twenty four The demons also believe and tremble James two nineteen And Dionysius observes Div Nom iv that they desire what is good and best which is to be to live to understand Therefore they are not obstinate in malice On the contrary It is said Ps seventy three twenty three The pride of them that hate Thee ascendeth continually and this is understood of the demons Therefore they remain ever obstinate in their malice I answer that It was Origen s opinion Peri Archon i six that every will of the creature can by reason of free will be inclined to good and evil with the exception of the soul of Christ on account of the union of the Word Such a statement deprives angels and saints of true beatitude because everlasting stability is of the very nature of true beatitude hence it is termed life everlasting It is also contrary to the authority of Sacred Scripture which declares that demons and wicked men shall be sent into everlasting punishment and the good brought into everlasting life Consequently such an opinion must be considered erroneous while according to Catholic Faith it must be held firmly both that the will of the good angels is confirmed in good and that the will of the demons is obstinate in evil We must seek for the cause of this obstinacy not in the gravity of the sin but in the condition of their nature or state For as Damascene says De Fide Orth ii death is to men what the fall is to the angels Now it is clear that all the mortal sins of men grave or less grave are pardonable before death whereas after death they are without remission and endure for ever To find the cause then of this obstinacy it must be borne in mind that the appetitive power is in all things proportioned to the apprehensive whereby it is moved as the movable by its mover For the sensitive appetite seeks a particular good while the will seeks the universal good as was said above Q fifty nine A one as also the sense apprehends particular objects while the intellect considers universals Now the angel s apprehension differs from man s in this respect that the angel by his intellect apprehends immovably as we apprehend immovably first principles which are the object of the habit of intelligence whereas man by his reason apprehends movably passing from one consideration to another and having the way open by which he may proceed to either of two opposites Consequently man s will adheres to a thing movably and with the power of forsaking it and of clinging to the opposite whereas the angel s will adheres fixedly and immovably Therefore if his will be considered before its adhesion it can freely adhere either to this or to its opposite namely in such things as he does not will naturally but after he has once adhered he clings immovably So it is customary to say that man s free will is flexible to the opposite both before and after choice but the angel s free will is flexible either opposite before the choice but not after Therefore the good angels who adhered to justice were confirmed therein whereas the wicked ones sinning are obstinate in sin Later on we shall treat of the obstinacy of men who are damned Suppl Q ninety eight AA one two Reply Obj one The good and wicked angels have free will but according to the manner and condition of their state as has been said Reply Obj two God s mercy delivers from sin those who repent But such as are not capable of repenting cling immovably to sin and are not delivered by the Divine mercy Reply Obj three The devil s first sin still remains in him according to desire although not as to his believing that he can obtain what he desired Even so if a man were to believe that he can commit murder and wills to commit it and afterwards the power is taken from him nevertheless the will to murder can stay with him so that he would he had done it or still would do it if he could Reply Obj four The fact that man sinned from another s suggestion is not the whole cause of man s sin being pardonable Consequently the argument does not hold good Reply Obj five A demon s act is twofold One comes of deliberate will and this is properly called his own act Such an act on the demon s part is always wicked because although at times he does something good yet he does not do it well as when he tells the truth in order to deceive and when he believes and confesses yet not willingly but compelled by the evidence of things Another kind of act is natural to the demon this can be good and bears witness to the goodness of nature Yet he abuses even such good acts to evil purpose THIRD ARTICLE I Q sixty four Art three Whether There Is Sorrow in the Demons Objection one It would seem that there is no sorrow in the demons For since sorrow and joy are opposites they cannot be together in the same subject But there is joy in the demons for Augustine writing against the Maniches De general Contra Manich ii seventeen says The devil has power over them who despise God s commandments and he rejoices over this sinister power Therefore there is no sorrow in the demons Obj two Further sorrow is the cause of fear for those things cause fear while they are future which cause sorrow when they are present But there is no fear in the demons according to Job forty one twenty four Who was made to fear no one Therefore there is no grief in the demons Obj three Further it is a good thing to be sorry for evil But the demons can do no good action Therefore they cannot be sorry at least for the evil of sin which applies to the worm of conscience On the contrary The demon s sin is greater than man s sin But man is punished with sorrow on account of the pleasure taken in sin according to Apoc eighteen seven As much as she hath glorified herself and lived in delicacies so much torment and sorrow give ye to her Consequently much more is the devil punished with the grief of sorrow because he especially glorified himself I answer that Fear sorrow joy and the like so far as they are passions cannot exist in the demons for thus they are proper to the sensitive appetite which is a power in a corporeal organ According however as they denote simple acts of the will they can be in the demons And it must be said that there is sorrow in them because sorrow as denoting a simple act of the will is nothing else than the resistance of the will to what is or to what is not Now it is evident that the demons would wish many things not to be which are and others to be which are not for out of envy they would wish others to be damned who are saved Consequently sorrow must be said to exist in them and especially because it is of the very notion of punishment for it to be repugnant to the will Moreover they are deprived of happiness which they desire naturally and their wicked will is curbed in many respects Reply Obj one Joy and sorrow about the same thing are opposites but not about different things Hence there is nothing to hinder a man from being sorry for one thing and joyful for another especially so far as sorrow and joy imply simple acts of the will because not merely in different things but even in one and the same thing there can be something that we will and something that we will not Reply Obj two As there is sorrow in the demons over present evil so also there is fear of future evil Now when it is said He was made to fear no one this is to be understood of the fear of God which restrains from sin For it is written elsewhere that the devils believe and tremble James two nineteen Reply Obj three To be sorry for the evil of sin on account of the sin bears witness to the goodness of the will to which the evil of sin is opposed But to be sorry for the evil of punishment or for the evil of sin on account of the punishment bears witness to the goodness of nature to which the evil of punishment is opposed Hence Augustine says De Civ Dei xix thirteen that sorrow for good lost by punishment is the witness to a good nature Consequently since the demon has a perverse and obstinate will he is not sorry for the evil of sin FOURTH ARTICLE I Q sixty four Art four Whether Our Atmosphere Is the Demons Place of Punishment Objection one It would seem that this atmosphere is not the demons place of punishment For a demon is a spiritual nature But a spiritual nature is not affected by place Therefore there is no place of punishment for demons Obj two Further man s sin is not graver than the demons But man s place of punishment is hell Much more therefore is it the demons place of punishment and consequently not the darksome atmosphere Obj three Further the demons are punished with the pain of fire But there is no fire in the darksome atmosphere Therefore the darksome atmosphere is not the place of punishment for the demons On the contrary Augustine says general ad lit iii ten that the darksome atmosphere is as a prison to the demons until the judgment day I answer that The angels in their own nature stand midway between God and men Now the order of Divine providence so disposes that it procures the welfare of the inferior orders through the superior But man s welfare is disposed by Divine providence in two ways first of all directly when a man is brought unto good and withheld from evil and this is fittingly done through the good angels In another way indirectly as when anyone assailed is exercised by fighting against opposition It was fitting for this procuring of man s welfare to be brought about through the wicked spirits lest they should cease to be of service in the natural order Consequently a twofold place of punishment is due to the demons one by reason of their sin and this is hell and another in order that they may tempt men and thus the darksome atmosphere is their due place of punishment Now the procuring of men s salvation is prolonged even to the judgment day consequently the ministry of the angels and wrestling with demons endure until then Hence until then the good angels are sent to us here and the demons are in this dark atmosphere for our trial although some of them are even now in hell to torment those whom they have led astray just as some of the good angels are with the holy souls in heaven But after the judgment day all the wicked both men and angels will be in hell and the good in heaven Reply Obj one A place is not penal to angel or soul as if affecting the nature by changing it but as affecting the will by saddening it because the angel or the soul apprehends that it is in a place not agreeable to its will Reply Obj two One soul is not set over another in the order of nature as the demons are over men in the order of nature consequently there is no parallel Reply Obj three Some have maintained that the pain of sense for demons and souls is postponed until the judgment day and that the beatitude of the saints is likewise postponed until the judgment day But this is erroneous and contrary to the teaching of the Apostle two Cor five one If our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved we have a house in heaven Others again while not admitting the same of souls admit it as to demons But it is better to say that the same judgment is passed upon wicked souls and wicked angels even as on good souls and good angels Consequently it must be said that although a heavenly place belongs to the glory of the angels yet their glory is not lessened by their coming to us for they consider that place to be their own in the same way as we say that the bishop s honor is not lessened while he is not actually sitting on his throne In like manner it must be said that although the demons are not actually bound within the fire of hell while they are in this dark atmosphere nevertheless their punishment is none the less because they know that such confinement is their due Hence it is said in a gloss upon James three six They carry fire of hell with them wherever they go Nor is this contrary to what is said Luke eight thirty one They besought the Lord not to cast them into the abyss for they asked for this deeming it to be a punishment for them to be cast out of a place where they could injure men Hence it is stated They Vulg He besought Him that He would not expel them Vulg him out of the country Mark five ten TREATISE ON THE WORK OF THE SIX DAYS QQ sixty five seventy four QUESTION sixty five THE WORK OF CREATION OF CORPOREAL CREATURES In Four Articles From the consideration of spiritual creatures we proceed to that of corporeal creatures in the production of which as Holy Scripture makes mention three works are found namely the work of creation as given in the words In the beginning God created heaven and earth the work of distinction as given in the words He divided the light from the darkness and the waters that are above the firmament from the waters that are under the firmament and the work of adornment expressed thus Let there be lights in the firmament First then we must consider the work of creation secondly the work of distinction and thirdly the work of adornment Under the first head there are four points of inquiry one Whether corporeal creatures are from God two Whether they were created on account of God s goodness three Whether they were created by God through the medium of the angels four Whether the forms of bodies are from the angels or immediately from God FIRST ARTICLE I Q sixty five Art one Whether Corporeal Creatures Are from God Objection one It would seem that corporeal creatures are not from God For it is said Eccles three fourteen I have learned that all the works which God hath made continue for ever But visible bodies do not continue for ever for it is said two Cor four eighteen The things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal Therefore God did not make visible bodies Obj two Further it is said general one thirty one God saw all things that He had made and they were very good But corporeal creatures are evil since we find them harmful in many ways as may be seen in serpents in the sun s heat and other things Now a thing is called evil in so far as it is harmful Corporeal creatures therefore are not from God Obj three Further what is from God does not withdraw us from God but leads us to Him But corporeal creatures withdraw us from God Hence the Apostle two Cor four eighteen While we look not at the things which are seen Corporeal creatures therefore are not from God On the contrary It is said Ps one hundred forty five six Who made heaven and earth the sea and all things that are in them I answer that Certain heretics maintain that visible things are not created by the good God but by an evil principle and allege in proof of their error the words of the Apostle two Cor four four The god of this world hath blinded the minds of unbelievers But this position is altogether untenable For if things that differ agree in some point there must be some cause for that agreement since things diverse in nature cannot be united of themselves Hence whenever in different things some one thing common to all is found it must be that these different things receive that one thing from some one cause as different bodies that are hot receive their heat from fire But being is found to be common to all things however otherwise different There must therefore be one principle of being from which all things in whatever way existing have their being whether they are invisible and spiritual or visible and corporeal But the devil is called the god of this world not as having created it but because worldlings serve him of whom also the Apostle says speaking in the same sense Whose god is their belly Phil three nineteen Reply Obj one All the creatures of God in some respects continue for ever at least as to matter since what is created will never be annihilated even though it be corruptible And the nearer a creature approaches God Who is immovable the more it also is immovable For corruptible creatures endure for ever as regards their matter though they change as regards their substantial form But incorruptible creatures endure with respect to their substance though they are mutable in other respects such as place for instance the heavenly bodies or the affections as spiritual creatures But the Apostle s words The things which are seen are temporal though true even as regards such things considered in themselves in so far as every visible creature is subject to time either as to being or as to movement are intended to apply to visible things in so far as they are offered to man as rewards For such rewards as consist in these visible things are temporal while those that are invisible endure for ever Hence he said before two Cor four seventeen It worketh for us an eternal weight of glory Reply Obj two Corporeal creatures according to their nature are good though this good is not universal but partial and limited the consequence of which is a certain opposition of contrary qualities though each quality is good in itself To those however who estimate things not by the nature thereof but by the good they themselves can derive therefrom everything which is harmful to themselves seems simply evil For they do not reflect that what is in some way injurious to one person to another is beneficial and that even to themselves the same thing may be evil in some respects but good in others And this could not be if bodies were essentially evil and harmful Reply Obj three Creatures of themselves do not withdraw us from God but lead us to Him for the invisible things of God are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made Rom one twenty If then they withdraw men from God it is the fault of those who use them foolishly Thus it is said Wis fourteen eleven Creatures are turned into a snare to the feet of the unwise And the very fact that they can thus withdraw us from God proves that they came from Him for they cannot lead the foolish away from God except by the allurements of some good that they have from Him SECOND ARTICLE I Q sixty five Art two Whether Corporeal Things Were Made on Account of God s Goodness Objection one It would seem that corporeal creatures were not made on account of God s goodness For it is said Wis one fourteen that God created all things that they might be Therefore all things were created for their own being s sake and not on account of God s goodness Obj two Further good has the nature of an end therefore the greater good in things is the end of the lesser good But spiritual creatures are related to corporeal creatures as the greater good to the lesser Corporeal creatures therefore are created for the sake of spiritual creatures and not on account of God s goodness Obj three Further justice does not give unequal things except to the unequal Now God is just therefore inequality not created by God must precede all inequality created by Him But an inequality not created by God can only arise from free will and consequently all inequality results from the different movements of free will Now corporeal creatures are unequal to spiritual creatures Therefore the former were made on account of movements of free will and not on account of God s goodness On the contrary It is said Prov sixteen four The Lord hath made all things for Himself I answer that Origen laid down Peri Archon ii that corporeal creatures were not made according to God s original purpose but in punishment of the sin of spiritual creatures For he maintained that God in the beginning made spiritual creatures only and all of equal nature but that of these by the use of free will some turned to God and according to the measure of their conversion were given a higher or a lower rank retaining their simplicity while others turned from God and became bound to different kinds of bodies according to the degree of their turning away But this position is erroneous In the first place because it is contrary to Scripture which after narrating the production of each kind of corporeal creatures subjoins God saw that it was good general one as if to say that everything was brought into being for the reason that it was good for it to be But according to Origen s opinion the corporeal creature was made not because it was good that it should be but that the evil in another might be punished Secondly because it would follow that the arrangement which now exists of the corporeal world would arise from mere chance For it the sun s body was made what it is that it might serve for a punishment suitable to some sin of a spiritual creature it would follow if other spiritual creatures had sinned in the same way as the one to punish whom the sun had been created that many suns would exist in the world and so of other things But such a consequence is altogether inadmissible Hence we must set aside this theory as false and consider that the entire universe is constituted by all creatures as a whole consists of its parts Now if we wish to assign an end to any whole and to the parts of that whole we shall find first that each and every part exists for the sake of its proper act as the eye for the act of seeing secondly that less honorable parts exist for the more honorable as the senses for the intellect the lungs for the heart and thirdly that all parts are for the perfection of the whole as the matter for the form since the parts are as it were the matter of the whole Furthermore the whole man is on account of an extrinsic end that end being the fruition of God So therefore in the parts of the universe also every creature exists for its own proper act and perfection and the less noble for the nobler as those creatures that are less noble than man exist for the sake of man whilst each and every creature exists for the perfection of the entire universe Furthermore the entire universe with all its parts is ordained towards God as its end inasmuch as it imitates as it were and shows forth the Divine goodness to the glory of God Reasonable creatures however have in some special and higher manner God as their end since they can attain to Him by their own operations by knowing and loving Him Thus it is plain that the Divine goodness is the end of all corporeal things Reply Obj one In the very fact of any creature possessing being it represents the Divine being and Its goodness And therefore that God created all things that they might have being does not exclude that He created them for His own goodness Reply Obj two The proximate end does not exclude the ultimate end Therefore that corporeal creatures were in a manner made for the sake of the spiritual does not prevent their being made on account of God s goodness Reply Obj three Equality of justice has its place in retribution since equal rewards or punishments are due to equal merit or demerit But this does not apply to things as at first instituted For just as an architect without injustice places stones of the same kind in different parts of a building not on account of any antecedent difference in the stones but with a view to securing that perfection of the entire building which could not be obtained except by the different positions of the stones even so God from the beginning to secure perfection in the universe has set therein creatures of various and unequal natures according to His wisdom and without injustice since no diversity of merit is presupposed THIRD ARTICLE I Q sixty five Art three Whether Corporeal Creatures Were Produced by God Through the Medium of the Angels Objection one It would seem that corporeal creatures were produced by God through the medium of the angels For as all things are governed by the Divine wisdom so by it were all things made according to Ps one hundred three twenty four Thou hast made all things in wisdom But it belongs to wisdom to ordain as stated in the beginning of the Metaphysics i two Hence in the government of things the lower is ruled by the higher in a certain fitting order as Augustine says De Trin iii four Therefore in the production of things it was ordained that the corporeal should be produced by the spiritual as the lower by the higher Obj two Further diversity of effects shows diversity of causes since like always produces like If then all creatures both spiritual and corporeal were produced immediately by God there would be no diversity in creatures for one would not be further removed from God than another But this is clearly false for the Philosopher says that some things are corruptible because they are far removed from God De general et Corrup ii text fifty nine Obj three Further infinite power is not required to produce a finite effect But every corporeal thing is finite Therefore it could be and was produced by the finite power of spiritual creatures for in suchlike beings there is no distinction between what is and what is possible especially as no dignity befitting a nature is denied to that nature unless it be in punishment of a fault On the contrary It is said general one one In the beginning God created heaven and earth by which are understood corporeal creatures These therefore were produced immediately by God I answer that Some have maintained that creatures proceeded from God by degrees in such a way that the first creature proceeded from Him immediately and in its turn produced another and so on until the production of corporeal creatures But this position is untenable since the first production of corporeal creatures is by creation by which matter itself is produced for in the act of coming into being the imperfect must be made before the perfect and it is impossible that anything should be created save by God alone In proof whereof it must be borne in mind that the higher the cause the more numerous the objects to which its causation extends Now the underlying principle in things is always more universal than that which informs and restricts it thus being is more universal than living living than understanding matter than form The more widely then one thing underlies others the more directly does that thing proceed from a higher cause Thus the thing that underlies primarily all things belongs properly to the causality of the supreme cause Therefore no secondary cause can produce anything unless there is presupposed in the thing produced something that is caused by a higher cause But creation is the production of a thing in its entire substance nothing being presupposed either uncreated or created Hence it remains that nothing can create except God alone Who is the first cause Therefore in order to show that all bodies were created immediately by God Moses said In the beginning God created heaven and earth Reply Obj one In the production of things an order exists but not such that one creature is created by another for that is impossible but rather such that by the Divine wisdom diverse grades are constituted in creatures Reply Obj two God Himself though one has knowledge of many and different things without detriment to the simplicity of His nature as has been shown above Q fifteen A two so that by His wisdom He is the cause of diverse things as known by Him even as an artificer by apprehending diverse forms produces diverse works of art Reply Obj three The amount of the power of an agent is measured not only by the thing made but also by the manner of making it for one and the same thing is made in one way by a higher power in another by a lower But the production of finite things where nothing is presupposed as existing is the work of infinite power and as such can belong to no creature FOURTH ARTICLE I Q sixty five Art four Whether the Forms of Bodies Are from the Angels Objection one It would seem that the forms of bodies come from the angels For Boethius says De Trin i From forms that are without matter come the forms that are in matter But forms that are without matter are spiritual substances and forms that are in matter are the forms of bodies Therefore the forms of bodies are from spiritual substances Obj two Further all that is such by participation is reduced to that which is such by its essence But spiritual substances are forms essentially whereas corporeal creatures have forms by participation Therefore the forms of corporeal things are derived from spiritual substances Obj three Further spiritual substances have more power of causation than the heavenly bodies But the heavenly bodies give form to things here below for which reason they are said to cause generation and corruption Much more therefore are material forms derived from spiritual substances On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iii eight We must not suppose that this corporeal matter serves the angels at their nod but rather that it obeys God thus But corporeal matter may be said thus to serve that from which it receives its form Corporeal forms then are not from the angels but from God I answer that It was the opinion of some that all corporeal forms are derived from spiritual substances which we call the angels And there are two ways in which this has been stated For Plato held that the forms of corporeal matter are derived from and formed by forms immaterially subsisting by a kind of participation Thus he held that there exists an immaterial man and an immaterial horse and so forth and that from such the individual sensible things that we see are constituted in so far as in corporeal matter there abides the impression received from these separate forms by a kind of assimilation or as he calls it participation Phaedo xlix And according to the Platonists the order of forms corresponds to the order of those separate substances for example that there is a single separate substance which is horse and the cause of all horses whilst above this is separate life or per se life as they term it which is the cause of all life and that above this again is that which they call being itself which is the cause of all being Avicenna however and certain others have maintained that the forms of corporeal things do not subsist per se in matter but in the intellect only Thus they say that from forms existing in the intellect of spiritual creatures called intelligences by them but angels by us proceed all the forms of corporeal matter as the form of his handiwork proceeds from the forms in the mind of the craftsman This theory seems to be the same as that of certain heretics of modern times who say that God indeed created all things but that the devil formed corporeal matter and differentiated it into species But all these opinions seem to have a common origin they all in fact sought for a cause of forms as though the form were of itself brought into being Whereas as Aristotle Metaph vii text twenty six twenty seven twenty eight proves what is properly speaking made is the composite Now such are the forms of corruptible things that at one time they exist and at another exist not without being themselves generated or corrupted but by reason of the generation or corruption of the composite since even forms have not being but composites have being through forms for according to a thing s mode of being is the mode in which it is brought into being Since then like is produced from like we must not look for the cause of corporeal forms in any immaterial form but in something that is composite as this fire is generated by that fire Corporeal forms therefore are caused not as emanations from some immaterial form but by matter being brought from potentiality into act by some composite agent But since the composite agent which is a body is moved by a created spiritual substance as Augustine says De Trin iii four five it follows further that even corporeal forms are derived from spiritual substances not emanating from them but as the term of their movement And further still the species of the angelic intellect which are as it were the seminal types of corporeal forms must be referred to God as the first cause But in the first production of corporeal creatures no transmutation from potentiality to act can have taken place and accordingly the corporeal forms that bodies had when first produced came immediately form God whose bidding alone matter obeys as its own proper cause To signify this Moses prefaces each work with the words God said Let this thing be or that to denote the formation of all things by the Word of God from Whom according to Augustine Tract i in Joan and general ad lit i four is all form and fitness and concord of parts Reply Obj one By immaterial forms Boethius understands the types of things in the mind of God Thus the Apostle says Heb eleven three By faith we understand that the world was framed by the Word of God that from invisible things visible things might be made But if by immaterial forms he understands the angels we say that from them come material forms not by emanation but by motion Reply Obj two Forms received into matter are to be referred not to self subsisting forms of the same type as the Platonists held but either to intelligible forms of the angelic intellect from which they proceed by movement or still higher to the types in the Divine intellect by which the seeds of forms are implanted in created things that they may be able to be brought by movement into act Reply Obj three The heavenly bodies inform earthly ones by movement not by emanation QUESTION sixty six ON THE ORDER OF CREATION TOWARDS DISTINCTION In Four Articles We must next consider the work of distinction first the ordering of creation towards distinction secondly the distinction itself Under the first head there are four points of inquiry one Whether formlessness of created matter preceded in time its formation two Whether the matter of all corporeal things is the same three Whether the empyrean heaven was created contemporaneously with formless matter four Whether time was created simultaneously with it FIRST ARTICLE I Q sixty six Art one Objection one It would seem that formlessness of matter preceded in time its formation For it is said general one two The earth was void and empty or invisible and shapeless according to another version Septuagint by which is understood the formlessness of matter as Augustine says Confess xii twelve Therefore matter was formless until it received its form Obj two Further nature in its working imitates the working of God as a secondary cause imitates a first cause But in the working of nature formlessness precedes form in time It does so therefore in the Divine working Obj three Further matter is higher than accident for matter is part of substance But God can effect that accident exist without substance as in the Sacrament of the Altar He could therefore cause matter to exist without form On the contrary An imperfect effect proves imperfection in the agent But God is an agent absolutely perfect wherefore it is said of Him Deut thirty two four The works of God are perfect Therefore the work of His creation was at no time formless Further the formation of corporeal creatures was effected by the work of distinction But confusion is opposed to distinction as formlessness to form If therefore formlessness preceded in time the formation of matter it follows that at the beginning confusion called by the ancients chaos existed in the corporeal creation I answer that On this point holy men differ in opinion Augustine for instance general ad lit i fifteen believes that the formlessness of matter was not prior in time to its formation but only in origin or the order of nature whereas others as Basil Hom ii In Hexaem Ambrose In Hexaem i and Chrysostom Hom ii In general hold that formlessness of matter preceded in time its formation And although these opinions seem mutually contradictory in reality they differ but little for Augustine takes the formlessness of matter in a different sense from the others In his sense it means the absence of all form and if we thus understand it we cannot say that the formlessness of matter was prior in time either to its formation or to its distinction As to formation the argument is clear For if formless matter preceded in duration it already existed for this is implied by duration since the end of creation is being in act and act itself is a form To say then that matter preceded but without form is to say that being existed actually yet without act which is a contradiction in terms Nor can it be said that it possessed some common form on which afterwards supervened the different forms that distinguish it For this would be to hold the opinion of the ancient natural philosophers who maintained that primary matter was some corporeal thing in act as fire air water or some intermediate substance Hence it followed that to be made means merely to be changed for since that preceding form bestowed actual substantial being and made some particular thing to be it would result that the supervening form would not simply make an actual being but this actual being which is the proper effect of an accidental form Thus the consequent forms would be merely accidents implying not generation but alteration Hence we must assert that primary matter was not created altogether formless nor under any one common form but under distinct forms And so if the formlessness of matter be taken as referring to the condition of primary matter which in itself is formless this formlessness did not precede in time its formation or distinction but only in origin and nature as Augustine says in the same way as potentiality is prior to act and the part to the whole But the other holy writers understand by formlessness not the exclusion of all form but the absence of that beauty and comeliness which are now apparent in the corporeal creation Accordingly they say that the formlessness of corporeal matter preceded its form in duration And so when this is considered it appears that Augustine agrees with them in some respects and in others disagrees as will be shown later Q sixty nine A one Q seventy four A two As far as may be gathered from the text of Genesis a threefold beauty was wanting to corporeal creatures for which reason they are said to be without form For the beauty of light was wanting to all that transparent body which we call the heavens whence it is said that darkness was upon the fact of the deep And the earth lacked beauty in two ways first that beauty which it acquired when its watery veil was withdrawn and so we read that the earth was void or invisible inasmuch as the waters covered and concealed it from view secondly that which it derives from being adorned by herbs and plants for which reason it is called empty or according to another reading Septuagint shapeless that is unadorned Thus after mention of two created natures the heaven and the earth the formlessness of the heaven is indicated by the words darkness was upon the face of the deep since the air is included under heaven and the formlessness of the earth by the words the earth was void and empty Reply Obj one The word earth is taken differently in this passage by Augustine and by other writers Augustine holds that by the words earth and water in this passage primary matter itself is signified on account of its being impossible for Moses to make the idea of such matter intelligible to an ignorant people except under the similitude of well known objects Hence he uses a variety of figures in speaking of it calling it not water only nor earth only lest they should think it to be in very truth water or earth At the same time it has so far a likeness to earth in that it is susceptible of form and to water in its adaptability to a variety of forms In this respect then the earth is said to be void and empty or invisible and shapeless that matter is known by means of form Hence considered in itself it is called invisible or void and its potentiality is completed by form thus Plato says that matter is place Timaeus quoted by Aristotle Phys iv text fifteen But other holy writers understand by earth the element of earth and we have said A one how in this sense the earth was according to them without form Reply Obj two Nature produces effect in act from being in potentiality and consequently in the operations of nature potentiality must precede act in time and formlessness precede form But God produces being in act out of nothing and can therefore produce a perfect thing in an instant according to the greatness of His power Reply Obj three Accident inasmuch as it is a form is a kind of act whereas matter as such is essentially being in potentiality Hence it is more repugnant that matter should be in act without form than for accident to be without subject In reply to the first argument in the contrary sense we say that if according to some holy writers formlessness was prior in time to the informing of matter this arose not from want of power on God s part but from His wisdom and from the design of preserving due order in the disposition of creatures by developing perfection from imperfection In reply to the second argument we say that certain of the ancient natural philosophers maintained confusion devoid of all distinction except Anaxagoras who taught that the intellect alone was distinct and without admixture But previous to the work of distinction Holy Scripture enumerates several kinds of differentiation the first being that of the heaven from the earth in which even a material distinction is expressed as will be shown later A three Q sixty eight A one This is signified by the words In the beginning God created heaven and earth The second distinction mentioned is that of the elements according to their forms since both earth and water are named That air and fire are not mentioned by name is due to the fact that the corporeal nature of these would not be so evident as that of earth and water to the ignorant people to whom Moses spoke Plato Timaeus xxvi nevertheless understood air to be signified by the words Spirit of God since spirit is another name for air and considered that by the word heaven is meant fire for he held heaven to be composed of fire as Augustine relates De Civ Dei viii eleven But Rabbi Moses Perplex ii though otherwise agreeing with Plato says that fire is signified by the word darkness since said he fire does not shine in its own sphere However it seems more reasonable to hold to what we stated above because by the words Spirit of God Scripture usually means the Holy Ghost Who is said to move over the waters not indeed in bodily shape but as the craftsman s will may be said to move over the material to which he intends to give a form The third distinction is that of place since the earth is said to be under the waters that rendered it invisible whilst the air the subject of darkness is described as being above the waters in the words Darkness was upon the face of the deep The remaining distinctions will appear from what follows Q seventy one SECOND ARTICLE I Q sixty six Art two Whether the Formless Matter of All Corporeal Things Is the Same Objection one It would seem that the formless matter of all corporeal things is the same For Augustine says Confess xii twelve I find two things Thou hast made one formed the other formless and he says that the latter was the earth invisible and shapeless whereby he says the matter of all corporeal things is designated Therefore the matter of all corporeal things is the same Obj two Further the Philosopher says Metaph v text ten Things that are one in genus are one in matter But all corporeal things are in the same genus of body Therefore the matter of all bodies is the same Obj three Further different acts befit different potentialities and the same act befits the same potentiality But all bodies have the same form corporeity Therefore all bodies have the same matter Obj four Further matter considered in itself is only in potentiality But distinction is due to form Therefore matter considered in itself is the same in all corporeal things On the contrary Things of which the matter is the same are mutually interchangeable and mutually active or passive as is said De Gener i text fifty But heavenly and earthly bodies do not act upon each other mutually Therefore their matter is not the same I answer that On this question the opinions of philosophers have differed Plato and all who preceded Aristotle held that all bodies are of the nature of the four elements Hence because the four elements have one common matter as their mutual generation and corruption prove it followed that the matter of all bodies is the same But the fact of the incorruptibility of some bodies was ascribed by Plato not to the condition of matter but to the will of the artificer God Whom he represents as saying to the heavenly bodies By your own nature you are subject to dissolution but by My will you are indissoluble for My will is more powerful than the link that binds you together But this theory Aristotle De Caelo i text five disproves by the natural movements of bodies For since he says the heavenly bodies have a natural movement different from that of the elements it follows that they have a different nature from them For movement in a circle which is proper to the heavenly bodies is not by contraries whereas the movements of the elements are mutually opposite one tending upwards another downwards so therefore the heavenly body is without contrariety whereas the elemental bodies have contrariety in their nature And as generation and corruption are from contraries it follows that whereas the elements are corruptible the heavenly bodies are incorruptible But in spite of this difference of natural corruption and incorruption Avicebron taught unity of matter in all bodies arguing from their unity of form And indeed if corporeity were one form in itself on which the other forms that distinguish bodies from each other supervene this argument would necessarily be true for this form of corporeity would inhere in matter immutably and so far all bodies would be incorruptible But corruption would then be merely accidental through the disappearance of successive forms that is to say it would be corruption not pure and simple but partial since a being in act would subsist under the transient form Thus the ancient natural philosophers taught that the substratum of bodies was some actual being such as air or fire But supposing that no form exists in corruptible bodies which remains subsisting beneath generation and corruption it follows necessarily that the matter of corruptible and incorruptible bodies is not the same For matter as it is in itself is in potentiality to form Considered in itself then it is in potentiality in respect to all those forms to which it is common and in receiving any one form it is in act only as regards that form Hence it remains in potentiality to all other forms And this is the case even where some forms are more perfect than others and contain these others virtually in themselves For potentiality in itself is indifferent with respect to perfection and imperfection so that under an imperfect form it is in potentiality to a perfect form and vice versa Matter therefore whilst existing under the form of an incorruptible body would be in potentiality to the form of a corruptible body and as it does not actually possess the latter it has both form and the privation of form for want of a form in that which is in potentiality thereto is privation But this condition implies corruptibility It is therefore impossible that bodies by nature corruptible and those by nature incorruptible should possess the same matter Neither can we say as Averroes De Substantia Orbis ii imagines that a heavenly body itself is the matter of the heaven being in potentiality with regard to place though not to being and that its form is a separate substance united to it as its motive force For it is impossible to suppose any being in act unless in its totality it be act and form or be something which has act or form Setting aside then in thought the separate substance stated to be endowed with motive power if the heavenly body is not something having form that is something composed of a form and the subject of that form it follows that in its totality it is form and act But every such thing is something actually understood which the heavenly bodies are not being sensible It follows then that the matter of the heavenly bodies considered in itself is in potentiality to that form alone which it actually possesses Nor does it concern the point at issue to inquire whether this is a soul or any other thing Hence this form perfects this matter in such a way that there remains in it no potentiality with respect to being but only to place as Aristotle De Coelo i text twenty says So then the matter of the heavenly bodies and of the elements is not the same except by analogy in so far as they agree in the character of potentiality Reply Obj one Augustine follows in this the opinion of Plato who does not admit a fifth essence Or we may say that formless matter is one with the unity of order as all bodies are one in the order of corporeal creatures Reply Obj two If genus is taken in a physical sense corruptible and incorruptible things are not in the same genus on account of their different modes of potentiality as is said in Metaph x text twenty six Logically considered however there is but one genus of all bodies since they are all included in the one notion of corporeity Reply Obj three The form of corporeity is not one and the same in all bodies being no other than the various forms by which bodies are distinguished as stated above Reply Obj four As potentiality is directed towards act potential beings are differentiated by their different acts as sight is by color hearing by sound Therefore for this reason the matter of the celestial bodies is different from that of the elemental because the matter of the celestial is not in potentiality to an elemental form THIRD ARTICLE I Q sixty six Art three Whether the Empyrean Heaven Was Created at the Same Time As Formless Matter Objection one It would seem that the empyrean heaven was not created at the same time as formless matter For the empyrean if it is anything at all must be a sensible body But all sensible bodies are movable and the empyrean heaven is not movable For if it were so its movement would be ascertained by the movement of some visible body which is not the case The empyrean heaven then was not created contemporaneously with formless matter Obj two Further Augustine says De Trin iii four that the lower bodies are governed by the higher in a certain order If therefore the empyrean heaven is the highest of bodies it must necessarily exercise some influence on bodies below it But this does not seem to be the case especially as it is presumed to be without movement for one body cannot move another unless itself also be moved Therefore the empyrean heaven was not created together with formless matter Obj three Further if it is held that the empyrean heaven is the place of contemplation and not ordained to natural effects on the contrary Augustine says De Trin iv twenty In so far as we mentally apprehend eternal things so far are we not of this world from which it is clear that contemplation lifts the mind above the things of this world Corporeal place therefore cannot be the seat of contemplation Obj four Further among the heavenly bodies exists a body partly transparent and partly luminous which we call the sidereal heaven There exists also a heaven wholly transparent called by some the aqueous or crystalline heaven If then there exists a still higher heaven it must be wholly luminous But this cannot be for then the air would be constantly illuminated and there would be no night Therefore the empyrean heaven was not created together with formless matter On the contrary Strabus says that in the passage In the beginning God created heaven and earth heaven denotes not the visible firmament but the empyrean or fiery heaven I answer that The empyrean heaven rests only on the authority of Strabus and Bede and also of Basil all of whom agree in one respect namely in holding it to be the place of the blessed Strabus and Bede say that as soon as created it was filled with angels and Basil Hom ii in Hexaem says Just as the lost are driven into the lowest darkness so the reward for worthy deeds is laid up in the light beyond this world where the just shall obtain the abode of rest But they differ in the reasons on which they base their statement Strabus and Bede teach that there is an empyrean heaven because the firmament which they take to mean the sidereal heaven is said to have been made not in the beginning but on the second day whereas the reason given by Basil is that otherwise God would seem to have made darkness His first work as the Manicheans falsely assert when they call the God of the Old Testament the God of darkness These reasons however are not very cogent For the question of the firmament said to have been made on the second day is solved in one way by Augustine and in another by other holy writers But the question of the darkness is explained according to Augustine general ad lit i vii by supposing that formlessness signified by darkness preceded form not by duration but by origin According to others however since darkness is no creature but a privation of light it is a proof of Divine wisdom that the things it created from nothing it produced first of all in an imperfect state and afterwards brought them to perfection But a better reason can be drawn from the state of glory itself For in the reward to come a two fold glory is looked for spiritual and corporeal not only in the human body to be glorified but in the whole world which is to be made new Now the spiritual glory began with the beginning of the world in the blessedness of the angels equality with whom is promised to the saints It was fitting then that even from the beginning there should be made some beginning of bodily glory in something corporeal free at the very outset from the servitude of corruption and change and wholly luminous even as the whole bodily creation after the Resurrection is expected to be So then that heaven is called the empyrean i e fiery not from its heat but from its brightness It is to be noticed however that Augustine De Civ Dei x nine twenty seven says that Porphyry sets the demons apart from the angels by supposing that the former inhabit the air the latter the ether or empyrean But Porphyry as a Platonist held the heaven known as sidereal to be fiery and therefore called it empyrean or ethereal taking ethereal to denote the burning of flame and not as Aristotle understands it swiftness of movement De Coel i text twenty two This much has been said to prevent anyone from supposing that Augustine maintained an empyrean heaven in the sense understood by modern writers Reply Obj one Sensible corporeal things are movable in the present state of the world for by the movement of corporeal creatures is secured by the multiplication of the elements But when glory is finally consummated the movement of bodies will cease And such must have been from the beginning the condition of the empyrean Reply Obj two It is sufficiently probable as some assert that the empyrean heaven having the state of glory for its ordained end does not influence inferior bodies of another order those namely that are directed only to natural ends Yet it seems still more probable that it does influence bodies that are moved though itself motionless just as angels of the highest rank who assist Infra Q one hundred twelve A three influence those of lower degree who act as messengers though they themselves are not sent as Dionysius teaches Coel Hier xii For this reason it may be said that the influence of the empyrean upon that which is called the first heaven and is moved produces therein not something that comes and goes as a result of movement but something of a fixed and stable nature as the power of conservation or causation or something of the kind pertaining to dignity Reply Obj three Corporeal place is assigned to contemplation not as necessary but as congruous that the splendor without may correspond to that which is within Hence Basil Hom ii in Hexaem says The ministering spirit could not live in darkness but made his habitual dwelling in light and joy Reply Obj four As Basil says Hom ii in Hexaem It is certain that the heaven was created spherical in shape of dense body and sufficiently strong to separate what is outside it from what it encloses On this account it darkens the region external to it the light by which itself is lit up being shut out from that region But since the body of the firmament though solid is transparent for that it does not exclude light as is clear from the fact that we can see the stars through the intervening heavens we may also say that the empyrean has light not condensed so as to emit rays as the sun does but of a more subtle nature Or it may have the brightness of glory which differs from mere natural brightness FOURTH ARTICLE I Q sixty six Art four Whether Time Was Created Simultaneously with Formless Matter Objection one It would seem that time was not created simultaneously with formless matter For Augustine says Confess xii twelve I find two things that Thou didst create before time was the primary corporeal matter and the angelic nature Therefore time was not created with formless matter Obj two Further time is divided by day and night But in the beginning there was neither day nor night for these began when God divided the light from the darkness Therefore in the beginning time was not Obj three Further time is the measure of the firmament s movement and the firmament is said to have been made on the second day Therefore in the beginning time was not Obj four Further movement precedes time and therefore should be reckoned among the first things created rather than time Obj five Further as time is the extrinsic measure of created things so is place Place then as truly as time must be reckoned among the things first created On the contrary Augustine says general ad lit i three Both spiritual and corporeal creatures were created at the beginning of time I answer that It is commonly said that the first things created were these four the angelic nature the empyrean heaven formless corporeal matter and time It must be observed however that this is not the opinion of Augustine For he Confess xii twelve specifies only two things as first created the angelic nature and corporeal matter making no mention of the empyrean heaven But these two namely the angelic nature and formless matter precede the formation by nature only and not by duration and therefore as they precede formation so do they precede movement and time Time therefore cannot be included among them But the enumeration above given is that of other holy writers who hold that the formlessness of matter preceded by duration its form and this view postulates the existence of time as the measure of duration for otherwise there would be no such measure Reply Obj one The teaching of Augustine rests on the opinion that the angelic nature and formless matter precede time by origin or nature Reply Obj two As in the opinion of some holy writers matter was in some measure formless before it received its full form so time was in a manner formless before it was fully formed and distinguished into day and night Reply Obj three If the movement of the firmament did not begin immediately from the beginning then the time that preceded was the measure not of the firmament s movement but of the first movement of whatsoever kind For it is accidental to time to be the measure of the firmament s movement in so far as this is the first movement But if the first movement was another than this time would have been its measure for everything is measured by the first of its kind And it must be granted that forthwith from the beginning there was movement of some kind at least in the succession of concepts and affections in the angelic mind while movement without time cannot be conceived since time is nothing else than the measure of priority and succession in movement Reply Obj four Among the first created things are to be reckoned those which have a general relationship to things And therefore among these time must be included as having the nature of a common measure but not movement which is related only to the movable subject Reply Obj five Place is implied as existing in the empyrean heaven this being the boundary of the universe And since place has reference to things permanent it was created at once in its totality But time as not being permanent was created in its beginning even as actually we cannot lay hold of any part of time save the now 
6727_10344_000002_000000	train-clean-360	QUESTION sixty seven
6727_10344_000003_000000	train-clean-360	ON THE WORK OF DISTINCTION IN ITSELF In Four Articles 
6727_10344_000004_000000	train-clean-360	We must consider next the work of distinction in itself 
6727_10344_000004_000001	train-clean-360	First the work of the first day secondly the work of the second day thirdly the work of the third day 
none	none	Under the first head there are four points of inquiry one 
6727_10344_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Whether the word light is used in its proper sense in speaking of spiritual things 
6727_10344_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 two Whether light in corporeal things is itself corporeal 
6727_10344_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 three Whether light is a quality 
6727_10344_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Whether light is a quality 
none	none	four Whether light was fittingly made on the first day FIRST ARTICLE I Q sixty seven Art one Whether the Word Light Is Used in Its Proper Sense in Speaking of Spiritual Things 
6727_10344_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that light is used in its proper sense in spiritual things 
none	none	For Augustine says general ad lit iv twenty eight that in spiritual things light is better and surer and that Christ is not called Light in the same sense as He is called the Stone the former is to be taken literally and the latter metaphorically Obj two Further Dionysius Div Nom iv includes Light among the intellectual names of God 
6727_10344_000013_000002	train-clean-360	But such names are used in their proper sense in spiritual things 
6727_10344_000013_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore light is used in its proper sense in spiritual matters 
none	none	Obj three Further the Apostle says Eph five thirteen All that is made manifest is light But to be made manifest belongs more properly to spiritual things than to corporeal 
6727_10344_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore also does light 
none	none	On the contrary Ambrose says De Fide ii that Splendor is among those things which are said of God metaphorically I answer that Any word may be used in two ways that is to say either in its original application or in its more extended meaning This is clearly shown in the word sight originally applied to the act of the sense and then as sight is the noblest and most trustworthy of the senses extended in common speech to all knowledge obtained through the other senses Thus we say Seeing how it tastes or smells or burns Further sight is applied to knowledge obtained through the intellect as in those words Blessed are the clean of heart for they shall see God Matt five eight 
6727_10344_000016_000003	train-clean-360	And thus it is with the word light 
6727_10344_000016_000004	train-clean-360	In its primary meaning it signifies that which makes manifest to the sense of sight afterwards it was extended to that which makes manifest to cognition of any kind 
none	none	If then the word is taken in its strict and primary meaning it is to be understood metaphorically when applied to spiritual things as Ambrose says De Fide ii 
6727_10344_000016_000006	train-clean-360	But if taken in its common and extended use as applied to manifestation of every kind it may properly be applied to spiritual things 
none	none	The answer to the objections will sufficiently appear from what has been said SECOND ARTICLE I Q sixty seven Art two 
6727_10344_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Whether Light Is a Body 
6727_10344_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that light is a body 
none	none	For Augustine says De Lib Arb iii five that light takes the first place among bodies 
6727_10344_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore light is a body 
none	none	Obj two Further the Philosopher says Topic v two that light is a species of fire But fire is a body and therefore so is light Obj three Further the powers of movement intersection reflection belong properly to bodies and all these are attributes of light and its rays Moreover different rays of light as Dionysius says Div Nom ii are united and separated which seems impossible unless they are bodies Therefore light is a body On the contrary Two bodies cannot occupy the same place simultaneously 
6727_10344_000023_000001	train-clean-360	But this is the case with light and air 
6727_10344_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore light is not a body 
none	none	I answer that Light cannot be a body for three evident reasons First on the part of place 
6727_10344_000024_000001	train-clean-360	For the place of any one body is different from that of any other nor is it possible naturally speaking for any two bodies of whatever nature to exist simultaneously in the same place since contiguity requires distinction of place 
6727_10344_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The second reason is from movement 
6727_10344_000025_000001	train-clean-360	For if light were a body its diffusion would be the local movement of a body 
6727_10344_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Now no local movement of a body can be instantaneous as everything that moves from one place to another must pass through the intervening space before reaching the end whereas the diffusion of light is instantaneous 
none	none	Nor can it be argued that the time required is too short to be perceived for though this may be the case in short distances it cannot be so in distances so great as that which separates the East from the West 
6727_10344_000025_000004	train-clean-360	Yet as soon as the sun is at the horizon the whole hemisphere is illuminated from end to end 
6727_10344_000025_000005	train-clean-360	It must also be borne in mind on the part of movement that whereas all bodies have their natural determinate movement that of light is indifferent as regards direction working equally in a circle as in a straight line 
6727_10344_000025_000006	train-clean-360	Hence it appears that the diffusion of light is not the local movement of a body 
6727_10344_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The third reason is from generation and corruption 
6727_10344_000026_000001	train-clean-360	For if light were a body it would follow that whenever the air is darkened by the absence of the luminary the body of light would be corrupted and its matter would receive a new form 
6727_10344_000026_000002	train-clean-360	But unless we are to say that darkness is a body this does not appear to be the case 
6727_10344_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Neither does it appear from what matter a body can be daily generated large enough to fill the intervening hemisphere 
6727_10344_000026_000004	train-clean-360	Also it would be absurd to say that a body of so great a bulk is corrupted by the mere absence of the luminary 
none	none	And should anyone reply that it is not corrupted but approaches and moves around with the sun we may ask why it is that when a lighted candle is obscured by the intervening object the whole room is darkened It is not that the light is condensed round the candle when this is done since it burns no more brightly then than it burned before 
6727_10344_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Since therefore these things are repugnant not only to reason but to common sense we must conclude that light cannot be a body 
none	none	Reply Obj one Augustine takes light to be a luminous body in act in other words to be fire the noblest of the four elements Reply Obj two Aristotle pronounces light to be fire existing in its own proper matter just as fire in aerial matter is flame or in earthly matter is burning coal Nor must too much attention be paid to the instances adduced by Aristotle in his works on logic as he merely mentions them as the more or less probable opinions of various writers Reply Obj three All these properties are assigned to light metaphorically and might in the same way be attributed to heat For because movement from place to place is naturally first in the order of movement as is proved Phys viii text 
6727_10344_000030_000002	train-clean-360	fifty five we use terms belonging to local movement in speaking of alteration and movement of all kinds 
none	none	For even the word distance is derived from the idea of remoteness of place to that of all contraries as is said Metaph x text thirteen THIRD ARTICLE I Q sixty seven Art three Whether Light Is a Quality 
6727_10344_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that light is not a quality 
none	none	For every quality remains in its subject though the active cause of the quality be removed as heat remains in water removed from the fire But light does not remain in the air when the source of light is withdrawn 
6727_10344_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore light is not a quality 
none	none	Obj two Further every sensible quality has its opposite as cold is opposed to heat blackness to whiteness 
6727_10344_000034_000001	train-clean-360	But this is not the case with light since darkness is merely a privation of light 
6727_10344_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Light therefore is not a sensible quality 
none	none	Obj three Further a cause is more potent than its effect 
6727_10344_000035_000001	train-clean-360	But the light of the heavenly bodies is a cause of substantial forms of earthly bodies and also gives to colors their immaterial being by making them actually visible 
6727_10344_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Light then is not a sensible quality but rather a substantial or spiritual form 
none	none	On the contrary Damascene De Fide Orth i says that light is a species of quality I answer that Some writers have said that the light in the air has not a natural being such as the color on a wall has but only an intentional being as a similitude of color in the air 
6727_10344_000037_000001	train-clean-360	But this cannot be the case for two reasons 
6727_10344_000037_000002	train-clean-360	First because light gives a name to the air since by it the air becomes actually luminous 
6727_10344_000037_000003	train-clean-360	But color does not do this for we do not speak of the air as colored 
6727_10344_000037_000004	train-clean-360	Secondly because light produces natural effects for by the rays of the sun bodies are warmed and natural changes cannot be brought about by mere intentions 
6727_10344_000037_000005	train-clean-360	Others have said that light is the sun s substantial form but this also seems impossible for two reasons 
none	none	First because substantial forms are not of themselves objects of the senses for the object of the intellect is what a thing is as is said De Anima iii text twenty six whereas light is visible of itself 
6727_10344_000037_000007	train-clean-360	In the second place because it is impossible that what is the substantial form of one thing should be the accidental form of another since substantial forms of their very nature constitute species wherefore the substantial form always and everywhere accompanies the species 
6727_10344_000037_000008	train-clean-360	But light is not the substantial form of air for if it were the air would be destroyed when light is withdrawn 
6727_10344_000037_000009	train-clean-360	Hence it cannot be the substantial form of the sun 
none	none	We must say then that as heat is an active quality consequent on the substantial form of fire so light is an active quality consequent on the substantial form of the sun or of another body that is of itself luminous if there is any such body 
6727_10344_000038_000001	train-clean-360	A proof of this is that the rays of different stars produce different effects according to the diverse natures of bodies 
none	none	Reply Obj one Since quality is consequent upon substantial form the mode in which the subject receives a quality differs as the mode differs in which a subject receives a substantial form 
6727_10344_000039_000001	train-clean-360	For when matter receives its form perfectly the qualities consequent upon the form are firm and enduring as when for instance water is converted into fire 
6727_10344_000039_000002	train-clean-360	When however substantial form is received imperfectly so as to be as it were in process of being received rather than fully impressed the consequent quality lasts for a time but is not permanent as may be seen when water which has been heated returns in time to its natural state 
6727_10344_000039_000003	train-clean-360	But light is not produced by the transmutation of matter as though matter were in receipt of a substantial form and light were a certain inception of substantial form 
6727_10344_000039_000004	train-clean-360	For this reason light disappears on the disappearance of its active cause 
none	none	Reply Obj two It is accidental to light not to have a contrary forasmuch as it is the natural quality of the first corporeal cause of change which is itself removed from contrariety Reply Obj three As heat acts towards perfecting the form of fire as an instrumental cause by virtue of the substantial form so does light act instrumentally by virtue of the heavenly bodies towards producing substantial forms and towards rendering colors actually visible inasmuch as it is a quality of the first sensible body FOURTH ARTICLE I Q sixty seven Art four 
6727_10344_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Whether the Production of Light Is Fittingly Assigned to the First Day 
6727_10344_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the production of light is not fittingly assigned to the first day 
none	none	For light as stated above A three is a quality 
6727_10344_000044_000002	train-clean-360	But qualities are accidents and as such should have not the first but a subordinate place 
6727_10344_000044_000003	train-clean-360	The production of light then ought not to be assigned to the first day 
none	none	Obj two Further it is light that distinguishes night from day and this is effected by the sun which is recorded as having been made on the fourth day 
6727_10344_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore the production of light could not have been on the first day 
none	none	Obj three Further night and day are brought about by the circular movement of a luminous body 
6727_10344_000046_000001	train-clean-360	But movement of this kind is an attribute of the firmament and we read that the firmament was made on the second day 
6727_10344_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the production of light dividing night from day ought not to be assigned to the first day 
none	none	Obj four Further if it be said that spiritual light is here spoken of it may be replied that the light made on the first day dispels the darkness But in the beginning spiritual darkness was not for even the demons were in the beginning good as has been shown Q sixty three A five 
6727_10344_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the production of light ought not to be assigned to the first day 
none	none	On the contrary That without which there could not be day must have been made on the first day 
6727_10344_000048_000001	train-clean-360	But there can be no day without light 
6727_10344_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore light must have been made on the first day 
none	none	I answer that There are two opinions as to the production of light Augustine seems to say De Civ Dei xi nine hundred thirty three that Moses could not have fittingly passed over the production of the spiritual creature and therefore when we read In the beginning God created heaven and earth a spiritual nature as yet formless is to be understood by the word heaven and formless matter of the corporeal creature by the word earth And spiritual nature was formed first as being of higher dignity than corporeal 
6727_10344_000049_000002	train-clean-360	The forming therefore of this spiritual nature is signified by the production of light that is to say of spiritual light 
6727_10344_000049_000003	train-clean-360	For a spiritual nature receives its form by the enlightenment whereby it is led to adhere to the Word of God 
6727_10344_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Other writers think that the production of spiritual creatures was purposely omitted by Moses and give various reasons 
none	none	Basil Hom i in Hexaem says that Moses begins his narrative from the beginning of time which belongs to sensible things but that the spiritual or angelic creation is passed over as created beforehand Chrysostom Hom ii in Genes gives as a reason for the omission that Moses was addressing an ignorant people to whom material things alone appealed and whom he was endeavoring to withdraw from the service of idols It would have been to them a pretext for idolatry if he had spoken to them of natures spiritual in substance and nobler than all corporeal creatures for they would have paid them Divine worship since they were prone to worship as gods even the sun moon and stars which was forbidden them Deut four 
6727_10344_000052_000000	train-clean-360	But mention is made of several kinds of formlessness in regard to the corporeal creature 
none	none	One is where we read that the earth was void and empty and another where it is said that darkness was upon the face of the deep Now it seems to be required for two reasons that the formlessness of darkness should be removed first of all by the production of light In the first place because light is a quality of the first body as was stated A three and thus by means of light it was fitting that the world should first receive its form 
6727_10344_000052_000003	train-clean-360	The second reason is because light is a common quality 
6727_10344_000052_000004	train-clean-360	For light is common to terrestrial and celestial bodies 
none	none	But as in knowledge we proceed from general principles so do we in work of every kind For the living thing is generated before the animal and the animal before the man as is shown in De Gener Anim ii three 
6727_10344_000052_000008	train-clean-360	It was fitting then as an evidence of the Divine wisdom that among the works of distinction the production of light should take first place since light is a form of the primary body and because it is more common quality 
none	none	Basil Hom ii in Hexaem indeed adds a third reason that all other things are made manifest by light 
6727_10344_000053_000001	train-clean-360	And there is yet a fourth already touched upon in the objections that day cannot be unless light exists which was made therefore on the first day 
none	none	Reply Obj one According to the opinion of those who hold that the formlessness of matter preceded its form in duration matter must be held to have been created at the beginning with substantial forms afterwards receiving those that are accidental among which light holds the first place Reply Obj two In the opinion of some the light here spoken of was a kind of luminous nebula and that on the making of the sun this returned to the matter of which it had been formed 
6727_10344_000055_000001	train-clean-360	But this cannot well be maintained as in the beginning of Genesis Holy Scripture records the institution of that order of nature which henceforth is to endure 
6727_10344_000055_000002	train-clean-360	We cannot then say that what was made at that time afterwards ceased to exist 
6727_10344_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Others therefore held that this luminous nebula continues in existence but so closely attached to the sun as to be indistinguishable 
none	none	But this is as much as to say that it is superfluous whereas none of God s works have been made in vain 
6727_10344_000056_000002	train-clean-360	On this account it is held by some that the sun s body was made out of this nebula 
6727_10344_000056_000003	train-clean-360	This too is impossible to those at least who believe that the sun is different in its nature from the four elements and naturally incorruptible 
6727_10344_000056_000004	train-clean-360	For in that case its matter cannot take on another form 
none	none	I answer then with Dionysius Div Nom iv that the light was the sun s light formless as yet being already the solar substance and possessing illuminative power in a general way to which was afterwards added the special and determinative power required to produce determinate effects 
6727_10344_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Thus then in the production of this light a triple distinction was made between light and darkness First as to the cause forasmuch as in the substance of the sun we have the cause of light and in the opaque nature of the earth the cause of darkness 
none	none	Secondly as to place for in one hemisphere there was light in the other darkness Thirdly as to time because there was light for one and darkness for another in the same hemisphere and this is signified by the words He called the light day and the darkness night Reply Obj three Basil says Hom ii in Hexaem that day and night were then caused by expansion and contraction of light rather than by movement But Augustine objects to this general ad lit i that there was no reason for this vicissitude of expansion and contraction since there were neither men nor animals on the earth at that time for whose service this was required 
6727_10344_000058_000003	train-clean-360	Nor does the nature of a luminous body seem to admit of the withdrawal of light so long as the body is actually present though this might be effected by a miracle 
none	none	As to this however Augustine remarks general ad lit i that in the first founding of the order of nature we must not look for miracles but for what is in accordance with nature 
6727_10344_000058_000006	train-clean-360	We hold then that the movement of the heavens is twofold 
6727_10344_000058_000007	train-clean-360	Of these movements one is common to the entire heaven and is the cause of day and night 
6727_10344_000058_000008	train-clean-360	This as it seems had its beginning on the first day 
6727_10344_000058_000009	train-clean-360	The other varies in proportion as it affects various bodies and by its variations is the cause of the succession of days months and years 
6727_10344_000058_000010	train-clean-360	Thus it is that in the account of the first day the distinction between day and night alone is mentioned this distinction being brought about by the common movement of the heavens 
none	none	The further distinction into successive days seasons and years recorded as begun on the fourth day in the words let them be for seasons and for days and years is due to proper movements Reply Obj four As Augustine teaches Confess xii general ad lit one fifteen formlessness did not precede forms in duration and so we must understand the production of light to signify the formation of spiritual creatures not indeed with the perfection of glory in which they were not created but with the perfection of grace which they possessed from their creation as said above Q sixty two A three Thus the division of light from darkness will denote the distinction of the spiritual creature from other created things as yet without form But if all created things received their form at the same time the darkness must be held to mean the spiritual darkness of the wicked not as existing from the beginning but such as God foresaw would exist QUESTION sixty eight ON THE WORK OF THE SECOND DAY In Four Articles We must next consider the work of the second day Under this head there are four points of inquiry one Whether the firmament was made on the second day two Whether there are waters above the firmament three Whether the firmament divides waters from waters four Whether there is more than one heaven FIRST ARTICLE I Q sixty eight Art one Whether the Firmament Was Made on the Second Day Objection one It would seem that the firmament was not made on the second day For it is said general one eight God called the firmament heaven But the heaven existed before days as is clear from the words In the beginning God created heaven and earth Therefore the firmament was not made on the second day Obj two Further the work of the six days is ordered conformably to the order of Divine wisdom Now it would ill become the Divine wisdom to make afterwards that which is naturally first But though the firmament naturally precedes the earth and the waters these are mentioned before the formation of light which was on the first day Therefore the firmament was not made on the second day Obj three Further all that was made in the six days was formed out of matter created before days began But the firmament cannot have been formed out of pre existing matter for if so it would be liable to generation and corruption Therefore the firmament was not made on the second day On the contrary It is written general one six God said let there be a firmament and further on verse eight And the evening and morning were the second day I answer that In discussing questions of this kind two rules are to be observed as Augustine teaches general ad lit i eighteen The first is to hold the truth of Scripture without wavering The second is that since Holy Scripture can be explained in a multiplicity of senses one should adhere to a particular explanation only in such measure as to be ready to abandon it if it be proved with certainty to be false lest Holy Scripture be exposed to the ridicule of unbelievers and obstacles be placed to their believing We say therefore that the words which speak of the firmament as made on the second day can be understood in two senses They may be understood first of the starry firmament on which point it is necessary to set forth the different opinions of philosophers Some of these believed it to be composed of the elements and this was the opinion of Empedocles who however held further that the body of the firmament was not susceptible of dissolution because its parts are so to say not in disunion but in harmony Others held the firmament to be of the nature of the four elements not indeed compounded of them but being as it were a simple element Such was the opinion of Plato who held that element to be fire Others again have held that the heaven is not of the nature of the four elements but is itself a fifth body existing over and above these This is the opinion of Aristotle De Coel i text six hundred thirty two According to the first opinion it may strictly speaking be granted that the firmament was made even as to substance on the second day For it is part of the work of creation to produce the substance of the elements while it belongs to the work of distinction and adornment to give forms to the elements that pre exist But the belief that the firmament was made as to its substance on the second day is incompatible with the opinion of Plato according to whom the making of the firmament implies the production of the element of fire This production however belongs to the work of creation at least according to those who hold that formlessness of matter preceded in time its formation since the first form received by matter is the elemental Still less compatible with the belief that the substance of the firmament was produced on the second day is the opinion of Aristotle seeing that the mention of days denotes succession of time whereas the firmament being naturally incorruptible is of a matter not susceptible of change of form wherefore it could not be made out of matter existing antecedently in time Hence to produce the substance of the firmament belongs to the work of creation But its formation in some degree belongs to the second day according to both opinions for as Dionysius says Div Nom iv the light of the sun was without form during the first three days and afterwards on the fourth day received its form If however we take these days to denote merely sequence in the natural order as Augustine holds general ad lit iv twenty two twenty four and not succession in time there is then nothing to prevent our saying whilst holding any one of the opinions given above that the substantial formation of the firmament belongs to the second day Another possible explanation is to understand by the firmament that was made on the second day not that in which the stars are set but the part of the atmosphere where the clouds are collected and which has received the name firmament from the firmness and density of the air For a body is called firm that is dense and solid thereby differing from a mathematical body as is remarked by Basil Hom iii in Hexaem If then this explanation is adopted none of these opinions will be found repugnant to reason Augustine in fact general ad lit ii four recommends it thus I consider this view of the question worthy of all commendation as neither contrary to faith nor difficult to be proved and believed Reply Obj one According to Chrysostom Hom iii in Genes Moses prefaces his record by speaking of the works of God collectively in the words In the beginning God created heaven and earth and then proceeds to explain them part by part in somewhat the same way as one might say This house was constructed by that builder and then add First he laid the foundations then built the walls and thirdly put on the roof In accepting this explanation we are therefore not bound to hold that a different heaven is spoken of in the words In the beginning God created heaven and earth and when we read that the firmament was made on the second day We may also say that the heaven recorded as created in the beginning is not the same as that made on the second day and there are several senses in which this may be understood Augustine says general ad lit i nine that the heaven recorded as made on the first day is the formless spiritual nature and that the heaven of the second day is the corporeal heaven According to Bede Hexaem i and Strabus the heaven made on the first day is the empyrean and the firmament made on the second day the starry heaven According to Damascene De Fide Orth ii that of the first day was spherical in form and without stars the same in fact that the philosophers speak of calling it the ninth sphere and the primary movable body that moves with diurnal movement while by the firmament made on the second day he understands the starry heaven According to another theory touched upon by Augustine general ad lit ii one the heaven made on the first day was the starry heaven and the firmament made on the second day was that region of the air where the clouds are collected which is also called heaven but equivocally And to show that the word is here used in an equivocal sense it is expressly said that God called the firmament heaven just as in a preceding verse it said that God called the light day since the word day is also used to denote a space of twenty four hours Other instances of a similar use occur as pointed out by Rabbi Moses The second and third objections are sufficiently answered by what has been already said SECOND ARTICLE I Q sixty eight Art two Whether There Are Waters Above the Firmament Objection one It would seem that there are not waters above the firmament For water is heavy by nature and heavy things tend naturally downwards not upwards Therefore there are not waters above the firmament Obj two Further water is fluid by nature and fluids cannot rest on a sphere as experience shows Therefore since the firmament is a sphere there cannot be water above it Obj three Further water is an element and appointed to the generation of composite bodies according to the relation in which imperfect things stand towards perfect But bodies of composite nature have their place upon the earth and not above the firmament so that water would be useless there But none of God s works are useless Therefore there are not waters above the firmament On the contrary It is written general one seven God divided the waters that were under the firmament from those that were above the firmament I answer with Augustine general ad lit ii five that These words of Scripture have more authority than the most exalted human intellect Hence whatever these waters are and whatever their mode of existence we cannot for a moment doubt that they are there As to the nature of these waters all are not agreed Origen says Hom i in general that the waters that are above the firmament are spiritual substances Wherefore it is written Ps one hundred forty eight four Let the waters that are above the heavens praise the name of the Lord and Dan three sixty Ye waters that are above the heavens bless the Lord To this Basil answers Hom iii in Hexaem that these words do not mean that these waters are rational creatures but that the thoughtful contemplation of them by those who understand fulfils the glory of the Creator Hence in the same context fire hail and other like creatures are invoked in the same way though no one would attribute reason to these We must hold then these waters to be material but their exact nature will be differently defined according as opinions on the firmament differ For if by the firmament we understand the starry heaven and as being of the nature of the four elements for the same reason it may be believed that the waters above the heaven are of the same nature as the elemental waters But if by the firmament we understand the starry heaven not however as being of the nature of the four elements then the waters above the firmament will not be of the same nature as the elemental waters but just as according to Strabus one heaven is called empyrean that is fiery solely on account of its splendor so this other heaven will be called aqueous solely on account of its transparence and this heaven is above the starry heaven Again if the firmament is held to be of other nature than the elements it may still be said to divide the waters if we understand by water not the element but formless matter Augustine in fact says Super general cont Manich i fifty seven that whatever divides bodies from bodies can be said to divide waters from waters If however we understand by the firmament that part of the air in which the clouds are collected then the waters above the firmament must rather be the vapors resolved from the waters which are raised above a part of the atmosphere and from which the rain falls But to say as some writers alluded to by Augustine general ad lit ii four that waters resolved into vapor may be lifted above the starry heaven is a mere absurdity The solid nature of the firmament the intervening region of fire wherein all vapor must be consumed the tendency in light and rarefied bodies to drift to one spot beneath the vault of the moon as well as the fact that vapors are perceived not to rise even to the tops of the higher mountains all to go to show the impossibility of this Nor is it less absurd to say in support of this opinion that bodies may be rarefied infinitely since natural bodies cannot be infinitely rarefied or divided but up to a certain point only Reply Obj one Some have attempted to solve this difficulty by supposing that in spite of the natural gravity of water it is kept in its place above the firmament by the Divine power Augustine general ad lit ii one however will not admit this solution but says It is our business here to inquire how God has constituted the natures of His creatures not how far it may have pleased Him to work on them by way of miracle We leave this view then and answer that according to the last two opinions on the firmament and the waters the solution appears from what has been said According to the first opinion an order of the elements must be supposed different from that given by Aristotle that is to say that the waters surrounding the earth are of a dense consistency and those around the firmament of a rarer consistency in proportion to the respective density of the earth and of the heaven Or by the water as stated we may understand the matter of bodies to be signified Reply Obj two The solution is clear from what has been said according to the last two opinions But according to the first opinion Basil gives two replies Hom iii in Hexaem He answers first that a body seen as concave beneath need not necessarily be rounded or convex above Secondly that the waters above the firmament are not fluid but exist outside it in a solid state as a mass of ice and that this is the crystalline heaven of some writers Reply Obj three According to the third opinion given the waters above the firmament have been raised in the form of vapors and serve to give rain to the earth But according to the second opinion they are above the heaven that is wholly transparent and starless This according to some is the primary mobile the cause of the daily revolution of the entire heaven whereby the continuance of generation is secured In the same way the starry heaven by the zodiacal movement is the cause whereby different bodies are generated or corrupted through the rising and setting of the stars and their various influences But according to the first opinion these waters are set there to temper the heat of the celestial bodies as Basil supposes Hom iii in Hexaem And Augustine says general ad lit ii five that some have considered this to be proved by the extreme cold of Saturn owing to its nearness to the waters that are above the firmament THIRD ARTICLE I Q sixty eight Art three Whether the Firmament Divides Waters from Waters Objection one It would seem that the firmament does not divide waters from waters For bodies that are of one and the same species have naturally one and the same place But the Philosopher says Topic i six All water is the same species Water therefore cannot be distinct from water by place Obj two Further should it be said that the waters above the firmament differ in species from those under the firmament it may be argued on the contrary that things distinct in species need nothing else to distinguish them If then these waters differ in species it is not the firmament that distinguishes them Obj three Further it would appear that what distinguishes waters from waters must be something which is in contact with them on either side as a wall standing in the midst of a river But it is evident that the waters below do not reach up to the firmament Therefore the firmament does not divide the waters from the waters On the contrary It is written general one six Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters I answer that The text of Genesis considered superficially might lead to the adoption of a theory similar to that held by certain philosophers of antiquity who taught that water was a body infinite in dimension and the primary element of all bodies Thus in the words Darkness was upon the face of the deep the word deep might be taken to mean the infinite mass of water understood as the principle of all other bodies These philosophers also taught that not all corporeal things are confined beneath the heaven perceived by our senses but that a body of water infinite in extent exists above that heaven On this view the firmament of heaven might be said to divide the waters without from those within that is to say from all bodies under the heaven since they took water to be the principle of them all As however this theory can be shown to be false by solid reasons it cannot be held to be the sense of Holy Scripture It should rather be considered that Moses was speaking to ignorant people and that out of condescension to their weakness he put before them only such things as are apparent to sense Now even the most uneducated can perceive by their senses that earth and water are corporeal whereas it is not evident to all that air also is corporeal for there have even been philosophers who said that air is nothing and called a space filled with air a vacuum Moses then while he expressly mentions water and earth makes no express mention of air by name to avoid setting before ignorant persons something beyond their knowledge In order however to express the truth to those capable of understanding it he implies in the words Darkness was upon the face of the deep the existence of air as attendant so to say upon the water For it may be understood from these words that over the face of the water a transparent body was extended the subject of light and darkness which in fact is the air Whether then we understand by the firmament the starry heaven or the cloudy region of the air it is true to say that it divides the waters from the waters according as we take water to denote formless matter or any kind of transparent body as fittingly designated under the name of waters For the starry heaven divides the lower transparent bodies from the higher and the cloudy region divides that higher part of the air where the rain and similar things are generated from the lower part which is connected with the water and included under that name Reply Obj one If by the firmament is understood the starry heaven the waters above are not of the same species as those beneath But if by the firmament is understood the cloudy region of the air both these waters are of the same species and two places are assigned to them though not for the same purpose the higher being the place of their begetting the lower the place of their repose Reply Obj two If the waters are held to differ in species the firmament cannot be said to divide the waters as the cause of their destruction but only as the boundary of each Reply Obj three On account of the air and other similar bodies being invisible Moses includes all such bodies under the name of water and thus it is evident that waters are found on each side of the firmament whatever be the sense in which the word is used FOURTH ARTICLE I Q sixty eight Art four Whether There Is Only One Heaven Objection one It would seem that there is only one heaven For the heaven is contrasted with the earth in the words In the beginning God created heaven and earth But there is only one earth Therefore there is only one heaven Obj two Further that which consists of the entire sum of its own matter must be one and such is the heaven as the Philosopher proves De Coel i text ninety five Therefore there is but one heaven Obj three Further whatever is predicated of many things univocally is predicated of them according to some common notion But if there are more heavens than one they are so called univocally for if equivocally only they could not properly be called many If then they are many there must be some common notion by reason of which each is called heaven but this common notion cannot be assigned Therefore there cannot be more than one heaven On the contrary It is said Ps one hundred forty eight four Praise Him ye heavens of heavens I answer that On this point there seems to be a diversity of opinion between Basil and Chrysostom The latter says that there is only one heaven Hom iv in general and that the words heavens of heavens are merely the translation of the Hebrew idiom according to which the word is always used in the plural just as in Latin there are many nouns that are wanting in the singular On the other hand Basil Hom iii in Hexaem whom Damascene follows De Fide Orth ii says that there are many heavens The difference however is more nominal than real For Chrysostom means by the one heaven the whole body that is above the earth and the water for which reason the birds that fly in the air are called birds of heaven Ps eight nine But since in this body there are many distinct parts Basil said that there are more heavens than one In order then to understand the distinction of heavens it must be borne in mind that Scripture speaks of heaven in a threefold sense Sometimes it uses the word in its proper and natural meaning when it denotes that body on high which is luminous actually or potentially and incorruptible by nature In this body there are three heavens the first is the empyrean which is wholly luminous the second is the aqueous or crystalline wholly transparent and the third is called the starry heaven in part transparent and in part actually luminous and divided into eight spheres One of these is the sphere of the fixed stars the other seven which may be called the seven heavens are the spheres of the planets In the second place the name heaven is applied to a body that participates in any property of the heavenly body as sublimity and luminosity actual or potential Thus Damascene De Fide Orth ii holds as one heaven all the space between the waters and the moon s orb calling it the aerial According to him then there are three heavens the aerial the starry and one higher than both these of which the Apostle is understood to speak when he says of himself that he was rapt to the third heaven But since this space contains two elements namely fire and air and in each of these there is what is called a higher and a lower region Rabanus subdivides this space into four distinct heavens The higher region of fire he calls the fiery heaven the lower the Olympian heaven from a lofty mountain of that name the higher region of air he calls from its brightness the ethereal heaven the lower the aerial When therefore these four heavens are added to the three enumerated above there are seven corporeal heavens in all in the opinion of Rabanus Thirdly there are metaphorical uses of the word heaven as when this name is applied to the Blessed Trinity Who is the Light and the Most High Spirit It is explained by some as thus applied in the words I will ascend into heaven whereby the evil spirit is represented as seeking to make himself equal with God Sometimes also spiritual blessings the recompense of the Saints from being the highest of all good gifts are signified by the word heaven and in fact are so signified according to Augustine De Serm Dom in Monte in the words Your reward is very great in heaven Matt five twelve Again three kinds of supernatural visions bodily imaginative and intellectual are called sometimes so many heavens in reference to which Augustine general ad lit xii expounds Paul s rapture to the third heaven Reply Obj one The earth stands in relation to the heaven as the centre of a circle to its circumference But as one center may have many circumferences so though there is but one earth there may be many heavens Reply Obj two The argument holds good as to the heaven in so far as it denotes the entire sum of corporeal creation for in that sense it is one Reply Obj three All the heavens have in common sublimity and some degree of luminosity as appears from what has been said QUESTION sixty nine ON THE WORK OF THE THIRD DAY In Two Articles We next consider the work of the third day Under this head there are two points of inquiry one About the gathering together of the waters two About the production of plants FIRST ARTICLE I Q sixty nine Art one Whether It Was Fitting That the Gathering Together of the Waters Should Take Place As Recorded on the Third Day Objection one It would seem that it was not fitting that the gathering together of the waters should take place on the third day For what was made on the first and second days is expressly said to have been made in the words God said Be light made and Let there be a firmament made But the third day is contradistinguished from the first and the second days Therefore the work of the third day should have been described as a making not as a gathering together Obj two Further the earth hitherto had been completely covered by the waters wherefore it was described as invisible See Q sixty six A one Obj one There was then no place on the earth to which the waters could be gathered together Obj three Further things which are not in continuous contact cannot occupy one place But not all the waters are in continuous contact and therefore all were not gathered together into one place Obj four Further a gathering together is a mode of local movement But the waters flow naturally and take their course towards the sea In their case therefore a Divine precept of this kind was unnecessary Obj five Further the earth is given its name at its first creation by the words In the beginning God created heaven and earth Therefore the imposition of its name on the third day seems to be recorded without necessity On the contrary The authority of Scripture suffices I answer that It is necessary to reply differently to this question according to the different interpretations given by Augustine and other holy writers In all these works according to Augustine general ad lit i fifteen iv twenty two thirty four De general Contr Manich i five seven there is no order of duration but only of origin and nature He says that the formless spiritual and formless corporeal natures were created first of all and that the latter are at first indicated by the words earth and water Not that this formlessness preceded formation in time but only in origin nor yet that one formation preceded another in duration but merely in the order of nature Agreeably then to this order the formation of the highest or spiritual nature is recorded in the first place where it is said that light was made on the first day For as the spiritual nature is higher than the corporeal so the higher bodies are nobler than the lower Hence the formation of the higher bodies is indicated in the second place by the words Let there be made a firmament by which is to be understood the impression of celestial forms on formless matter that preceded with priority not of time but of origin only But in the third place the impression of elemental forms on formless matter is recorded also with a priority of origin only Therefore the words Let the waters be gathered together and the dry land appear mean that corporeal matter was impressed with the substantial form of water so as to have such movement and with the substantial form of earth so as to have such an appearance According however to other holy writers See Q sixty six A one an order of duration in the works is to be understood by which is meant that the formlessness of matter precedes its formation and one form another in order of time Nevertheless they do not hold that the formlessness of matter implies the total absence of form since heaven earth and water already existed since these three are named as already clearly perceptible to the senses rather they understand by formlessness the want of due distinction and of perfect beauty and in respect of these three Scripture mentions three kinds of formlessness Heaven the highest of them was without form so long as darkness filled it because it was the source of light The formlessness of water which holds the middle place is called the deep because as Augustine says Contr Faust xxii eleven this word signifies the mass of waters without order Thirdly the formless state of the earth is touched upon when the earth is said to be void or invisible because it was covered by the waters Thus then the formation of the highest body took place on the first day And since time results from the movement of the heaven and is the numerical measure of the movement of the highest body from this formation resulted the distinction of time namely that of night and day On the second day the intermediate body water was formed receiving from the firmament a sort of distinction and order so that water be understood as including certain other things as explained above Q sixty eight A three On the third day the earth the lowest body received its form by the withdrawal of the waters and there resulted the distinction in the lowest body namely of land and sea Hence Scripture having clearly expressed the formless state of the earth by saying that it was invisible or void expresses the manner in which it received its form by the equally suitable words Let the dry land appear Reply Obj one According to Augustine general ad lit ii seven eight iii twenty Scripture does not say of the work of the third day that it was made as it says of those that precede in order to show that higher and spiritual forms such as the angels and the heavenly bodies are perfect and stable in being whereas inferior forms are imperfect and mutable Hence the impression of such forms is signified by the gathering of the waters and the appearing of the land For water to use Augustine s words glides and flows away the earth abides general ad lit ii eleven Others again hold that the work of the third day was perfected on that day only as regards movement from place to place and that for this reason Scripture had no reason to speak of it as made Reply Obj two This argument is easily solved according to Augustine s opinion De general Contr Manich i because we need not suppose that the earth was first covered by the waters and that these were afterwards gathered together but that they were produced in this very gathering together But according to the other writers there are three solutions which Augustine gives general ad lit i twelve The first supposes that the waters are heaped up to a greater height at the place where they were gathered together for it has been proved in regard to the Red Sea that the sea is higher than the land as Basil remarks Hom iv in Hexaem The second explains the water that covered the earth as being rarefied or nebulous which was afterwards condensed when the waters were gathered together The third suggests the existence of hollows in the earth to receive the confluence of waters Of the above the first seems the most probable Reply Obj three All the waters have the sea as their goal into which they flow by channels hidden or apparent and this may be the reason why they are said to be gathered together into one place Or one place is to be understood not simply but as contrasted with the place of the dry land so that the sense would be Let the waters be gathered together in one place that is apart from the dry land That the waters occupied more places than one seems to be implied by the words that follow The gathering together of the waters He called Seas Reply Obj four The Divine command gives bodies their natural movement and by these natural movements they are said to fulfill His word Or we may say that it was according to the nature of water completely to cover the earth just as the air completely surrounds both water and earth but as a necessary means towards an end namely that plants and animals might be on the earth it was necessary for the waters to be withdrawn from a portion of the earth Some philosophers attribute this uncovering of the earth s surface to the action of the sun lifting up the vapors and thus drying the land Scripture however attributes it to the Divine power not only in the Book of Genesis but also Job thirty eight ten where in the person of the Lord it is said I set My bounds around the sea and Jer five twenty two where it is written Will you not then fear Me saith the Lord who have set the sand a bound for the sea Reply Obj five According to Augustine De general Contr Manich i primary matter is meant by the word earth where first mentioned but in the present passage it is to be taken for the element itself Again it may be said with Basil Hom iv in Hexaem that the earth is mentioned in the first passage in respect of its nature but here in respect of its principal property namely dryness Wherefore it is written He called the dry land Earth It may also be said with Rabbi Moses that the expression He called denotes throughout an equivocal use of the name imposed Thus we find it said at first that He called the light Day for the reason that later on a period of twenty four hours is also called day where it is said that there was evening and morning one day In like manner it is said that the firmament that is the air He called heaven for that which was first created was also called heaven And here again it is said that the dry land that is the part from which the waters had withdrawn He called Earth as distinct from the sea although the name earth is equally applied to that which is covered with waters or not So by the expression He called we are to understand throughout that the nature or property He bestowed corresponded to the name He gave SECOND ARTICLE I Q sixty nine Art two Whether It Was Fitting That the Production of Plants Should Take Place on the Third Day Objection one It would seem that it was not fitting that the production of plants should take place on the third day For plants have life as animals have But the production of animals belongs to the work not of distinction but of adornment Therefore the production of plants as also belonging to the work of adornment ought not to be recorded as taking place on the third day which is devoted to the work of distinction Obj two Further a work by which the earth is accursed should have been recorded apart from the work by which it receives its form But the words of general three seventeen Cursed is the earth in thy work thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee show that by the production of certain plants the earth was accursed Therefore the production of plants in general should not have been recorded on the third day which is concerned with the work of formation Obj three Further as plants are firmly fixed to the earth so are stones and metals which are nevertheless not mentioned in the work of formation Plants therefore ought not to have been made on the third day On the contrary It is said general one twelve The earth brought forth the green herb after which there follows The evening and the morning were the third day I answer that On the third day as said A one the formless state of the earth comes to an end But this state is described as twofold On the one hand the earth was invisible or void being covered by the waters on the other hand it was shapeless or empty that is without that comeliness which it owes to the plants that clothe it as it were with a garment Thus therefore in either respect this formless state ends on the third day first when the waters were gathered together into one place and the dry land appeared secondly when the earth brought forth the green herb But concerning the production of plants Augustine s opinion differs from that of others For other commentators in accordance with the surface meaning of the text consider that the plants were produced in act in their various species on this third day whereas Augustine general ad lit v five viii three says that the earth is said to have then produced plants and trees in their causes that is it received then the power to produce them He supports this view by the authority of Scripture for it is said general two four five These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were created in the day that God made the heaven and the earth and every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth and every herb of the ground before it grew Therefore the production of plants in their causes within the earth took place before they sprang up from the earth s surface And this is confirmed by reason as follows In these first days God created all things in their origin or causes and from this work He subsequently rested Yet afterwards by governing His creatures in the work of propagation He worketh until now Now the production of plants from the earth is a work of propagation and therefore they were not produced in act on the third day but in their causes only However in accordance with other writers it may be said that the first constitution of species belongs to the work of the six days but the reproduction among them of like from like to the government of the universe And Scripture indicates this in the words before it sprung up in the earth and before it grew that is before like was produced from like just as now happens in the natural course by the production of seed Wherefore Scripture says pointedly general one eleven Let the earth bring forth the green herb and such as may seed as indicating the production of perfect species from which the seed of others should arise Nor does the question where the seminal power may reside whether in root stem or fruit affect the argument Reply Obj one Life in plants is hidden since they lack sense and local movement by which the animate and the inanimate are chiefly discernible And therefore since they are firmly fixed in the earth their production is treated as a part of the earth s formation Reply Obj two Even before the earth was accursed thorns and thistles had been produced either virtually or actually But they were not produced in punishment of man as though the earth which he tilled to gain his food produced unfruitful and noxious plants Hence it is said Shall it bring forth to thee Reply Obj three Moses put before the people such things only as were manifest to their senses as we have said Q sixty seven A four Q sixty eight A three But minerals are generated in hidden ways within the bowels of the earth Moreover they seem hardly specifically distinct from earth and would seem to be species thereof For this reason therefore he makes no mention of them QUESTION seventy OF THE WORK OF ADORNMENT AS REGARDS THE FOURTH DAY In Three Articles 
5876_10347_000000_000000	train-clean-360	We must next consider the work of adornment first as to each day by itself secondly as to all seven days in general 
5876_10347_000001_000000	train-clean-360	In the first place then we consider the work of the fourth day secondly that of the fifth day thirdly that of the sixth day and fourthly such matters as belong to the seventh day 
none	none	Under the first head there are three points of inquiry
5876_10347_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 one As to the production of the lights 
none	none	two As to the end of their production three Whether they are living beings FIRST ARTICLE I Q seventy Art one 
5876_10347_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Whether the Lights Ought to Have Been Produced on the Fourth Day 
5876_10347_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the lights ought not to have been produced on the fourth day 
5876_10347_000008_000001	train-clean-360	For the heavenly luminaries are by nature incorruptible bodies wherefore their matter cannot exist without their form 
5876_10347_000008_000002	train-clean-360	But as their matter was produced in the work of creation before there was any day so therefore were their forms 
5876_10347_000008_000003	train-clean-360	It follows then that the lights were not produced on the fourth day 
none	none	Obj two Further the luminaries are as it were vessels of light But light was made on the first day The luminaries therefore should have been made on the first day not on the fourth Obj three Further the lights are fixed in the firmament as plants are fixed in the earth 
5876_10347_000010_000001	train-clean-360	For the Scripture says He set them in the firmament But plants are described as produced when the earth to which they are attached received its form 
none	none	The lights therefore should have been produced at the same time as the firmament that is to say on the second day Obj four Further plants are an effect of the sun moon and other heavenly bodies 
5876_10347_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Now cause precedes effect in the order of nature The lights therefore ought not to have been produced on the fourth day but on the third day 
none	none	Obj five Further as astronomers say there are many stars larger than the moon 
5876_10347_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore the sun and the moon alone are not correctly described as the two great lights 
none	none	On the contrary Suffices the authority of Scripture I answer that In recapitulating the Divine works Scripture says general two one So the heavens and the earth were finished and all the furniture of them thereby indicating that the work was threefold In the first work that of creation the heaven and the earth were produced but as yet without form In the second or work of distinction the heaven and the earth were perfected either by adding substantial form to formless matter as Augustine holds general ad lit ii eleven or by giving them the order and beauty due to them as other holy writers suppose To these two works is added the work of adornment which is distinct from perfect ion 
5876_10347_000014_000004	train-clean-360	For the perfection of the heaven and the earth regards seemingly those things that belong to them intrinsically but the adornment those that are extrinsic just as the perfection of a man lies in his proper parts and forms and his adornment in clothing or such like 
5876_10347_000014_000005	train-clean-360	Now just as distinction of certain things is made most evident by their local movement as separating one from another so the work of adornment is set forth by the production of things having movement in the heavens and upon the earth 
none	none	But it has been stated above Q sixty nine A one that three things are recorded as created namely the heaven the water and the earth and these three received their form from the three days work of distinction so that heaven was formed on the first day on the second day the waters were separated and on the third day the earth was divided into sea and dry land So also is it in the work of adornment on the first day of this work which is the fourth of creation are produced the lights to adorn the heaven by their movements on the second day which is the fifth birds and fishes are called into being to make beautiful the intermediate element for they move in air and water which are here taken as one while on the third day which is the sixth animals are brought forth to move upon the earth and adorn it It must also here be noted that Augustine s opinion general ad lit v five on the production of lights is not at variance with that of other holy writers since he says that they were made actually and not merely virtually for the firmament has not the power of producing lights as the earth has of producing plants 
5876_10347_000014_000010	train-clean-360	Wherefore Scripture does not say Let the firmament produce lights though it says Let the earth bring forth the green herb 
none	none	Reply Obj one In Augustine s opinion there is no difficulty here for he does not hold a succession of time in these works and so there was no need for the matter of the lights to exist under another form Nor is there any difficulty in the opinion of those who hold the heavenly bodies to be of the nature of the four elements for it may be said that they were formed out of matter already existing as animals and plants were formed 
5876_10347_000015_000001	train-clean-360	For those however who hold the heavenly bodies to be of another nature from the elements and naturally incorruptible the answer must be that the lights were substantially created at the beginning but that their substance at first formless is formed on this day by receiving not its substantial form but a determination of power 
none	none	As to the fact that the lights are not mentioned as existing from the beginning but only as made on the fourth day Chrysostom Hom vi in general explains this by the need of guarding the people from the danger of idolatry since the lights are proved not to be gods by the fact that they were not from the beginning Reply Obj two No difficulty exists if we follow Augustine in holding the light made on the first day to be spiritual and that made on this day to be corporeal If however the light made on the first day is understood to be itself corporeal then it must be held to have been produced on that day merely as light in general and that on the fourth day the lights received a definite power to produce determinate effects 
5876_10347_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Thus we observe that the rays of the sun have one effect those of the moon another and so forth 
none	none	Hence speaking of such a determination of power Dionysius Div Nom iv says that the sun s light which previously was without form was formed on the fourth day Reply Obj three According to Ptolemy the heavenly luminaries are not fixed in the spheres but have their own movement distinct from the movement of the spheres Wherefore Chrysostom says Hom vi in general that He is said to have set them in the firmament not because He fixed them there immovably but because He bade them to be there even as He placed man in Paradise to be there In the opinion of Aristotle however the stars are fixed in their orbits and in reality have no other movement but that of the spheres and yet our senses perceive the movement of the luminaries and not that of the spheres De Coel ii text forty three But Moses describes what is obvious to sense out of condescension to popular ignorance as we have already said Q sixty seven A four Q sixty eight A three The objection however falls to the ground if we regard the firmament made on the second day as having a natural distinction from that in which the stars are placed even though the distinction is not apparent to the senses the testimony of which Moses follows as stated above De Coel ii text forty three For although to the senses there appears but one firmament if we admit a higher and a lower firmament the lower will be that which was made on the second day and on the fourth the stars were fixed in the higher firmament Reply Obj four In the words of Basil Hom v in Hexaem plants were recorded as produced before the sun and moon to prevent idolatry since those who believe the heavenly bodies to be gods hold that plants originate primarily from these bodies Although as Chrysostom remarks Hom vi in general the sun moon and stars cooperate in the work of production by their movements as the husbandman cooperates by his labor Reply Obj five As Chrysostom says the two lights are called great not so much with regard to their dimensions as to their influence and power For though the stars be of greater bulk than the moon yet the influence of the moon is more perceptible to the senses in this lower world Moreover as far as the senses are concerned its apparent size is greater SECOND ARTICLE I Q seventy Art two Whether the Cause Assigned for the Production of the Lights Is Reasonable Objection one It would seem that the cause assigned for the production of the lights is not reasonable For it is said Jer ten two Be not afraid of the signs of heaven which the heathens fear Therefore the heavenly lights were not made to be signs Obj two Further sign is contradistinguished from cause 
5876_10347_000023_000001	train-clean-360	But the lights are the cause of what takes place upon the earth 
5876_10347_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore they are not signs 
none	none	Obj three Further the distinction of seasons and days began from the first day Therefore the lights were not made for seasons and days and years that is in order to distinguish them Obj four Further nothing is made for the sake of that which is inferior to itself since the end is better than the means Topic iii 
5876_10347_000025_000001	train-clean-360	But the lights are nobler than the earth 
5876_10347_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore they were not made to enlighten it 
none	none	Obj five Further the new moon cannot be said to rule the night But such it probably did when first made for men begin to count from the new moon 
5876_10347_000026_000001	train-clean-360	The moon therefore was not made to rule the night 
none	none	On the contrary Suffices the authority of Scripture I answer that As we have said above Q sixty five A two a corporeal creature can be considered as made either for the sake of its proper act or for other creatures or for the whole universe or for the glory of God Of these reasons only that which points out the usefulness of these things to man is touched upon by Moses in order to withdraw his people from idolatry Hence it is written Deut four nineteen Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven thou see the sun and the moon and all the stars of heaven and being deceived by error thou adore and serve them which the Lord thy God created for the service of all nations Now he explains this service at the beginning of Genesis as threefold 
5876_10347_000028_000003	train-clean-360	First the lights are of service to man in regard to sight which directs him in his works and is most useful for perceiving objects 
none	none	In reference to this he says Let them shine in the firmament and give life to the earth Secondly as regards the changes of the seasons which prevent weariness preserve health and provide for the necessities of food all of which things could not be secured if it were always summer or winter In reference to this he says Let them be for seasons and for days and years Thirdly as regards the convenience of business and work in so far as the lights are set in the heavens to indicate fair or foul weather as favorable to various occupations 
5876_10347_000028_000006	train-clean-360	And in this respect he says Let them be for signs 
none	none	Reply Obj one The lights in the heaven are set for signs of changes effected in corporeal creatures but not of those changes which depend upon the free will Reply Obj two We are sometimes brought to the knowledge of hidden effects through their sensible causes and conversely 
5876_10347_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Hence nothing prevents a sensible cause from being a sign 
5876_10347_000030_000002	train-clean-360	But he says signs rather than causes to guard against idolatry 
none	none	Reply Obj three The general division of time into day and night took place on the first day as regards the diurnal movement which is common to the whole heaven and may be understood to have begun on that first day But the particular distinctions of days and seasons and years according as one day is hotter than another one season than another and one year than another are due to certain particular movements of the stars which movements may have had their beginning on the fourth day Reply Obj four Light was given to the earth for the service of man who by reason of his soul is nobler than the heavenly bodies 
5876_10347_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Nor is it untrue to say that a higher creature may be made for the sake of a lower considered not in itself but as ordained to the good of the universe

5876_10347_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the lights of heaven are living beings 
none	none	For the nobler a body is the more nobly it should be adorned But a body less noble than the heaven is adorned with living beings with fish birds and the beasts of the field 
5876_10347_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the lights of heaven as pertaining to its adornment should be living beings also 
none	none	Obj two Further the nobler a body is the nobler must be its form But the sun moon and stars are nobler bodies than plants or animals and must therefore have nobler forms 
5876_10347_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Now the noblest of all forms is the soul as being the first principle of life 
none	none	Hence Augustine De Vera Relig xxix says Every living substance stands higher in the order of nature than one that has not life The lights of heaven therefore are living beings Obj three Further a cause is nobler than its effect But the sun moon and stars are a cause of life as is especially evidenced in the case of animals generated from putrefaction which receive life from the power of the sun and stars 
5876_10347_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Much more therefore have the heavenly bodies a living soul 
none	none	Obj four Further the movement of the heaven and the heavenly bodies are natural De Coel i text seven eight and natural movement is from an intrinsic principle Now the principle of movement in the heavenly bodies is a substance capable of apprehension and is moved as the desirer is moved by the object desired Metaph xii text thirty six Therefore seemingly the apprehending principle is intrinsic to the heavenly bodies and consequently they are living beings Obj five Further the first of movables is the heaven Now of all things that are endowed with movement the first moves itself as is proved in Phys viii text

none	none	But only beings that are living move themselves as is shown in the same book text twenty seven 
5876_10347_000040_000004	train-clean-360	Therefore the heavenly bodies are living beings 
none	none	On the contrary Damascene says De Fide Orth ii Let no one esteem the heavens or the heavenly bodies to be living things for they have neither life nor sense I answer that Philosophers have differed on this question Anaxagoras for instance as Augustine mentions De Civ Dei xviii forty one was condemned by the Athenians for teaching that the sun was a fiery mass of stone and neither a god nor even a living being On the other hand the Platonists held that the heavenly bodies have life 
5876_10347_000042_000002	train-clean-360	Nor was there less diversity of opinion among the Doctors of the Church 
none	none	It was the belief of Origen Peri Archon i and Jerome that these bodies were alive and the latter seems to explain in that sense the words Eccles one six The spirit goeth forward surveying all places round about But Basil Hom iii vi in Hexaem and Damascene De Fide Orth ii maintain that the heavenly bodies are inanimate Augustine leaves the matter in doubt without committing himself to either theory though he goes so far as to say that if the heavenly bodies are really living beings their souls must be akin to the angelic nature general ad lit ii eighteen Enchiridion lviii 
5876_10347_000043_000000	train-clean-360	In examining the truth of this question where such diversity of opinion exists we shall do well to bear in mind that the union of soul and body exists for the sake of the soul and not of the body for the form does not exist for the matter but the matter for the form 
5876_10347_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Now the nature and power of the soul are apprehended through its operation which is to a certain extent its end 
5876_10347_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Yet for some of these operations as sensation and nutrition our body is a necessary instrument 
5876_10347_000043_000003	train-clean-360	Hence it is clear that the sensitive and nutritive souls must be united to a body in order to exercise their functions 
5876_10347_000043_000004	train-clean-360	There are however operations of the soul which are not exercised through the medium of the body though the body ministers as it were to their production 
none	none	The intellect for example makes use of the phantasms derived from the bodily senses and thus far is dependent on the body although capable of existing apart from it 
5876_10347_000043_000006	train-clean-360	It is not however possible that the functions of nutrition growth and generation through which the nutritive soul operates can be exercised by the heavenly bodies for such operations are incompatible with a body naturally incorruptible 
none	none	Equally impossible is it that the functions of the sensitive soul can appertain to the heavenly body since all the senses depend on the sense of touch which perceives elemental qualities and all the organs of the senses require a certain proportion in the admixture of elements whereas the nature of the heavenly bodies is not elemental 
5876_10347_000043_000008	train-clean-360	It follows then that of the operations of the soul the only ones left to be attributed to the heavenly bodies are those of understanding and moving for appetite follows both sensitive and intellectual perception and is in proportion thereto 
none	none	But the operations of the intellect which does not act through the body do not need a body as their instrument except to supply phantasms through the senses Moreover the operations of the sensitive soul as we have seen cannot be attributed to the heavenly bodies 
5876_10347_000043_000010	train-clean-360	Accordingly the union of a soul to a heavenly body cannot be for the purpose of the operations of the intellect 
none	none	It remains then only to consider whether the movement of the heavenly bodies demands a soul as the motive power not that the soul in order to move the heavenly body need be united to the latter as its form but by contact of power as a mover is united to that which he moves Wherefore Aristotle Phys viii text forty two forty three after showing that the first mover is made up of two parts the moving and the moved goes on to show the nature of the union between these two parts This he says is effected by contact which is mutual if both are bodies on the part of one only if one is a body and the other not 
5876_10347_000043_000015	train-clean-360	The Platonists explain the union of soul and body in the same way as a contact of a moving power with the object moved and since Plato holds the heavenly bodies to be living beings this means nothing else but that substances of spiritual nature are united to them and act as their moving power 
5876_10347_000043_000016	train-clean-360	A proof that the heavenly bodies are moved by the direct influence and contact of some spiritual substance and not like bodies of specific gravity by nature lies in the fact that whereas nature moves to one fixed end which having attained it rests this does not appear in the movement of heavenly bodies 
5876_10347_000043_000017	train-clean-360	Hence it follows that they are moved by some intellectual substances 
none	none	Augustine appears to be of the same opinion when he expresses his belief that all corporeal things are ruled by God through the spirit of life De Trin iii four 
5876_10347_000044_000000	train-clean-360	From what has been said then it is clear that the heavenly bodies are not living beings in the same sense as plants and animals and that if they are called so it can only be equivocally 
5876_10347_000044_000001	train-clean-360	It will also be seen that the difference of opinion between those who affirm and those who deny that these bodies have life is not a difference of things but of words 
none	none	Reply Obj one Certain things belong to the adornment of the universe by reason of their proper movement and in this way the heavenly luminaries agree with others that conduce to that adornment for they are moved by a living substance Reply Obj two One being may be nobler than another absolutely but not in a particular respect 
5876_10347_000046_000001	train-clean-360	While then it is not conceded that the souls of heavenly bodies are nobler than the souls of animals absolutely it must be conceded that they are superior to them with regard to their respective forms since their form perfects their matter entirely which is not in potentiality to other forms whereas a soul does not do this 
5876_10347_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Also as regards movement the power that moves the heavenly bodies is of a nobler kind 
none	none	Reply Obj three Since the heavenly body is a mover moved it is of the nature of an instrument which acts in virtue of the agent and therefore since this agent is a living substance the heavenly body can impart life in virtue of that agent Reply Obj four The movements of the heavenly bodies are natural not on account of their active principle but on account of their passive principle that is to say from a certain natural aptitude for being moved by an intelligent power Reply Obj five The heaven is said to move itself in as far as it is compounded of mover and moved not by the union of the mover as the form with the moved as the matter but by contact with the motive power as we have said So far then the principle that moves it may be called intrinsic and consequently its movement natural with respect to that active principle just as we say that voluntary movement is natural to the animal as animal Phys viii text twenty seven QUESTION seventy one ON THE WORK OF THE FIFTH DAY In One Article We must next consider the work of the fifth day Objection one It would seem that this work is not fittingly described For the waters produce that which the power of water suffices to produce But the power of water does not suffice for the production of every kind of fishes and birds since we find that many of them are generated from seed Therefore the words Let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life and the fowl that may fly over the earth do not fittingly describe this work Obj two Further fishes and birds are not produced from water only but earth seems to predominate over water in their composition as is shown by the fact that their bodies tend naturally to the earth and rest upon it It is not then fittingly said that fishes and birds are produced from water Obj three Further fishes move in the waters and birds in the air If then fishes are produced from the waters birds ought to be produced from the air and not from the waters Obj four Further not all fishes creep through the waters for some as seals have feet and walk on land Therefore the production of fishes is not sufficiently described by the words Let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life Obj five Further land animals are more perfect than birds and fishes which appears from the fact that they have more distinct limbs and generation of a higher order For they bring forth living beings whereas birds and fishes bring forth eggs But the more perfect has precedence in the order of nature Therefore fishes and birds ought not to have been produced on the fifth day before land animals On the contrary Suffices the authority of Scripture I answer that As said above Q seventy A one the order of the work of adornment corresponds to the order of the work of distinction Hence as among the three days assigned to the work of distinction the middle or second day is devoted to the work of distinction of water which is the intermediate body so in the three days of the work of adornment the middle day which is the fifth is assigned to the adornment of the intermediate body by the production of birds and fishes As then Moses makes mention of the lights and the light on the fourth day to show that the fourth day corresponds to the first day on which he had said that the light was made so on this fifth day he mentions the waters and the firmament of heaven to show that the fifth day corresponds to the second It must however be observed that Augustine differs from other writers in his opinion about the production of fishes and birds as he differs about the production of plants For while others say that fishes and birds were produced on the fifth day actually he holds that the nature of the waters produced them on that day potentially Reply Obj one It was laid down by Avicenna that animals of all kinds can be generated by various minglings of the elements and naturally without any kind of seed This however seems repugnant to the fact that nature produces its effects by determinate means and consequently those things that are naturally generated from seed cannot be generated naturally in any other way It ought then rather to be said that in the natural generation of all animals that are generated from seed the active principle lies in the formative power of the seed but that in the case of animals generated from putrefaction the formative power of is the influence of the heavenly bodies The material principle however in the generation of either kind of animals is either some element or something compounded of the elements But at the first beginning of the world the active principle was the Word of God which produced animals from material elements either in act as some holy writers say or virtually as Augustine teaches Not as though the power possessed by water or earth of producing all animals resides in the earth and the water themselves as Avicenna held but in the power originally given to the elements of producing them from elemental matter by the power of seed or the influence of the stars Reply Obj two The bodies of birds and fishes may be considered from two points of view If considered in themselves it will be evident that the earthly element must predominate since the element that is least active namely the earth must be the most abundant in quantity in order that the mingling may be duly tempered in the body of the animal But if considered as by nature constituted to move with certain specific motions thus they have some special affinity with the bodies in which they move and hence the words in which their generation is described Reply Obj three The air as not being so apparent to the senses is not enumerated by itself but with other things partly with the water because the lower region of the air is thickened by watery exhalations partly with the heaven as to the higher region But birds move in the lower part of the air and so are said to fly beneath the firmament even if the firmament be taken to mean the region of clouds Hence the production of birds is ascribed to the water Reply Obj four Nature passes from one extreme to another through the medium and therefore there are creatures of intermediate type between the animals of the air and those of the water having something in common with both and they are reckoned as belonging to that class to which they are most allied through the characters possessed in common with that class rather than with the other But in order to include among fishes all such intermediate forms as have special characters like to theirs the words Let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life are followed by these God created great whales et cetera Reply Obj five The order in which the production of these animals is given has reference to the order of those bodies which they are set to adorn rather than to the superiority of the animals themselves Moreover in generation also the more perfect is reached through the less perfect QUESTION seventy two ON THE WORK OF THE SIXTH DAY In One Article We must now consider the work of the sixth day Objection one It would seem that this work is not fittingly described For as birds and fishes have a living soul so also have land animals But these animals are not themselves living souls Therefore the words Let the earth bring forth the living creature should rather have been Let the earth bring forth the living four footed creatures Obj two Further a genus ought not to be opposed to its species But beasts and cattle are quadrupeds Therefore quadrupeds ought not to be enumerated as a class with beasts and cattle Obj three Further as animals belong to a determinate genus and species so also does man But in the making of man nothing is said of his genus and species and therefore nothing ought to have been said about them in the production of other animals whereas it is said according to its genus and in its species Obj four Further land animals are more like man whom God is recorded to have blessed than are birds and fishes But as birds and fishes are said to be blessed this should have been said with much more reason of the other animals as well Obj five Further certain animals are generated from putrefaction which is a kind of corruption But corruption is repugnant to the first founding of the world Therefore such animals should not have been produced at that time Obj six Further certain animals are poisonous and injurious to man But there ought to have been nothing injurious to man before man sinned Therefore such animals ought not to have been made by God at all since He is the Author of good or at least not until man had sinned On the contrary Suffices the authority of Scripture I answer that As on the fifth day the intermediate body namely the water is adorned and thus that day corresponds to the second day so the sixth day on which the lowest body or the earth is adorned by the production of land animals corresponds to the third day Hence the earth is mentioned in both places And here again Augustine says general ad lit v that the production was potential and other holy writers that it was actual Reply Obj one The different grades of life which are found in different living creatures can be discovered from the various ways in which Scripture speaks of them as Basil says Hom viii in Hexaem The life of plants for instance is very imperfect and difficult to discern and hence in speaking of their production nothing is said of their life but only their generation is mentioned since only in generation is a vital act observed in them For the powers of nutrition and growth are subordinate to the generative life as will be shown later on Q seventy eight A two But amongst animals those that live on land are generally speaking more perfect than birds and fishes not because the fish is devoid of memory as Basil upholds Hom viii in Hexaem and Augustine rejects general ad lit iii but because their limbs are more distinct and their generation of a higher order yet some imperfect animals such as bees and ants are more intelligent in certain ways Scripture therefore does not call fishes living creatures but creeping creatures having life whereas it does call land animals living creatures on account of their more perfect life and seems to imply that fishes are merely bodies having in them something of a soul whilst land animals from the higher perfection of their life are as it were living souls with bodies subject to them But the life of man as being the most perfect grade is not said to be produced like the life of other animals by earth or water but immediately by God Reply Obj two By cattle domestic animals are signified which in any way are of service to man but by beasts wild animals such as bears and lions are designated By creeping things those animals are meant which either have no feet and cannot rise from the earth as serpents or those whose feet are too short to lift them far from the ground as the lizard and tortoise But since certain animals as deer and goats seem to fall under none of these classes the word quadrupeds is added Or perhaps the word quadruped is used first as being the genus to which the others are added as species for even some reptiles such as lizards and tortoises are four footed Reply Obj three In other animals and in plants mention is made of genus and species to denote the generation of like from like But it was unnecessary to do so in the case of man as what had already been said of other creatures might be understood of him Again animals and plants may be said to be produced according to their kinds to signify their remoteness from the Divine image and likeness whereas man is said to be made to the image and likeness of God Reply Obj four The blessing of God gives power to multiply by generation and having been mentioned in the preceding account of the making of birds and fishes could be understood of the beasts of the earth without requiring to be repeated The blessing however is repeated in the case of man since in him generation of children has a special relation to the number of the elect Cf Augustine general ad lit iii twelve and to prevent anyone from saying that there was any sin whatever in the act of begetting children As to plants since they experience neither desire of propagation nor sensation in generating they are deemed unworthy of a formal blessing Reply Obj five Since the generation of one thing is the corruption of another it was not incompatible with the first formation of things that from the corruption of the less perfect the more perfect should be generated Hence animals generated from the corruption of inanimate things or of plants may have been generated then But those generated from corruption of animals could not have been produced then otherwise than potentially Reply Obj six In the words of Augustine Super general contr Manich i If an unskilled person enters the workshop of an artificer he sees in it many appliances of which he does not understand the use and which if he is a foolish fellow he considers unnecessary Moreover should he carelessly fall into the fire or wound himself with a sharp edged tool he is under the impression that many of the things there are hurtful whereas the craftsman knowing their use laughs at his folly And thus some people presume to find fault with many things in this world through not seeing the reasons for their existence For though not required for the furnishing of our house these things are necessary for the perfection of the universe And since man before he sinned would have used the things of this world conformably to the order designed poisonous animals would not have injured him QUESTION seventy three ON THE THINGS THAT BELONG TO THE SEVENTH DAY In Three Articles We must next consider the things that belong to the seventh day Under this head there are three points of inquiry one About the completion of the works two About the resting of God three About the blessing and sanctifying of this day FIRST ARTICLE I Q seventy three Art one Whether the Completion of the Divine Works Ought to Be Ascribed to the Seventh Day Objection one It would seem that the completion of the Divine works ought not to be ascribed to the seventh day For all things that are done in this world belong to the Divine works But the consummation of the world will be at the end of the world Matt thirteen thirty nine forty Moreover the time of Christ s Incarnation is a time of completion wherefore it is called the time of fulness Vulg the fulness of time Gal four four And Christ Himself at the moment of His death cried out It is consummated John nineteen thirty Hence the completion of the Divine works does not belong to the seventh day Obj two Further the completion of a work is an act in itself But we do not read that God acted at all on the seventh day but rather that He rested from all His work Therefore the completion of the works does not belong to the seventh day Obj three Further nothing is said to be complete to which many things are added unless they are merely superfluous for a thing is called perfect to which nothing is wanting that it ought to possess But many things were made after the seventh day as the production of many individual beings and even of certain new species that are frequently appearing especially in the case of animals generated from putrefaction Also God creates daily new souls Again the work of the Incarnation was a new work of which it is said Jer thirty one twenty two The Lord hath created a new thing upon the earth Miracles also are new works of which it is said Eccles thirty six six Renew thy signs and work new miracles Moreover all things will be made new when the Saints are glorified according to Apoc twenty one five And He that sat on the throne said Behold I make all things new Therefore the completion of the Divine works ought not to be attributed to the seventh day On the contrary It is said general two two On the seventh day God ended His work which He had made I answer that The perfection of a thing is twofold the first perfection and the second perfection The first perfection is that according to which a thing is substantially perfect and this perfection is the form of the whole which form results from the whole having its parts complete But the second perfection is the end which is either an operation as the end of the harpist is to play the harp or something that is attained by an operation as the end of the builder is the house that he makes by building But the first perfection is the cause of the second because the form is the principle of operation Now the final perfection which is the end of the whole universe is the perfect beatitude of the Saints at the consummation of the world and the first perfection is the completeness of the universe at its first founding and this is what is ascribed to the seventh day Reply Obj one The first perfection is the cause of the second as above said Now for the attaining of beatitude two things are required nature and grace Therefore as said above the perfection of beatitude will be at the end of the world But this consummation existed previously in its causes as to nature at the first founding of the world as to grace in the Incarnation of Christ For Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ John one seventeen So then on the seventh day was the consummation of nature in Christ s Incarnation the consummation of grace and at the end of the world will be the consummation of glory Reply Obj two God did act on the seventh day not by creating new creatures but by directing and moving His creatures to the work proper to them and thus He made some beginning of the second perfection So that according to our version of the Scripture the completion of the works is attributed to the seventh day though according to another it is assigned to the sixth Either version however may stand since the completion of the universe as to the completeness of its parts belongs to the sixth day but its completion as regards their operation to the seventh It may also be added that in continuous movement so long as any movement further is possible movement cannot be called completed till it comes to rest for rest denotes consummation of movement Now God might have made many other creatures besides those which He made in the six days and hence by the fact that He ceased making them on the seventh day He is said on that day to have consummated His work Reply Obj three Nothing entirely new was afterwards made by God but all things subsequently made had in a sense been made before in the work of the six days Some things indeed had a previous experience materially as the rib from the side of Adam out of which God formed Eve whilst others existed not only in matter but also in their causes as those individual creatures that are now generated existed in the first of their kind Species also that are new if any such appear existed beforehand in various active powers so that animals and perhaps even new species of animals are produced by putrefaction by the power which the stars and elements received at the beginning Again animals of new kinds arise occasionally from the connection of individuals belonging to different species as the mule is the offspring of an ass and a mare but even these existed previously in their causes in the works of the six days Some also existed beforehand by way of similitude as the souls now created And the work of the Incarnation itself was thus foreshadowed for as we read Phil two seven The Son of God was made in the likeness of men And again the glory that is spiritual was anticipated in the angels by way of similitude and that of the body in the heaven especially the empyrean Hence it is written Eccles one ten Nothing under the sun is new for it hath already gone before in the ages that were before us SECOND ARTICLE I Q seventy three Art two Whether God Rested on the Seventh Day from All His Work Objection one It would seem that God did not rest on the seventh day from all His work For it is said John five seventeen My Father worketh until now and I work God then did not rest on the seventh day from all His work Obj two Further rest is opposed to movement or to labor which movement causes But as God produced His work without movement and without labor He cannot be said to have rested on the seventh day from His work Obj three Further should it be said that God rested on the seventh day by causing man to rest against this it may be argued that rest is set down in contradistinction to His work now the words God created or made this thing or the other cannot be explained to mean that He made man create or make these things Therefore the resting of God cannot be explained as His making man to rest On the contrary It is said general two two God rested on the seventh day from all the work which He had done I answer that Rest is properly speaking opposed to movement and consequently to the labor that arises from movement But although movement strictly speaking is a quality of bodies yet the word is applied also to spiritual things and in a twofold sense On the one hand every operation may be called a movement and thus the Divine goodness is said to move and go forth to its object in communicating itself to that object as Dionysius says Div Nom ii On the other hand the desire that tends to an object outside itself is said to move towards it Hence rest is taken in two senses in one sense meaning a cessation from work in the other the satisfying of desire Now in either sense God is said to have rested on the seventh day First because He ceased from creating new creatures on that day for as said above A one ad three He made nothing afterwards that had not existed previously in some degree in the first works secondly because He Himself had no need of the things that He had made but was happy in the fruition of Himself Hence when all things were made He is not said to have rested in His works as though needing them for His own happiness but to have rested from them as in fact resting in Himself as He suffices for Himself and fulfils His own desire And even though from all eternity He rested in Himself yet the rest in Himself which He took after He had finished His works is that rest which belongs to the seventh day And this says Augustine is the meaning of God s resting from His works on that day general ad lit iv Reply Obj one God indeed worketh until now by preserving and providing for the creatures He has made but not by the making of new ones Reply Obj two Rest is here not opposed to labor or to movement but to the production of new creatures and to the desire tending to an external object Reply Obj three Even as God rests in Himself alone and is happy in the enjoyment of Himself so our own sole happiness lies in the enjoyment of God Thus also He makes us find rest in Himself both from His works and our own It is not then unreasonable to say that God rested in giving rest to us Still this explanation must not be set down as the only one and the other is the first and principal explanation THIRD ARTICLE I Q seventy three Art three Whether Blessing and Sanctifying Are Due to the Seventh Day Objection one It would seem that blessing and sanctifying are not due to the seventh day For it is usual to call a time blessed or holy for that some good thing has happened in it or some evil been avoided But whether God works or ceases from work nothing accrues to Him or is lost to Him Therefore no special blessing or sanctifying are due to the seventh day Obj two Further the Latin benedictio blessing is derived from bonitas goodness But it is the nature of good to spread and communicate itself as Dionysius says Div Nom iv The days therefore in which God produced creatures deserved a blessing rather than the day on which He ceased producing them Obj three Further over each creature a blessing was pronounced as upon each work it was said God saw that it was good Therefore it was not necessary that after all had been produced the seventh day should be blessed On the contrary It is written general two three God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because in it He had rested from all His work I answer that As said above A two God s rest on the seventh day is understood in two ways First in that He ceased from producing new works though He still preserves and provides for the creatures He has made Secondly in that after all His works He rested in Himself According to the first meaning then a blessing befits the seventh day since as we explained Q seventy two ad four the blessing referred to the increase by multiplication for which reason God said to the creatures which He blessed Increase and multiply Now this increase is effected through God s Providence over His creatures securing the generation of like from like And according to the second meaning it is right that the seventh day should have been sanctified since the special sanctification of every creature consists in resting in God For this reason things dedicated to God are said to be sanctified Reply Obj one The seventh day is said to be sanctified not because anything can accrue to God or be taken from Him but because something is added to creatures by their multiplying and by their resting in God Reply Obj two In the first six days creatures were produced in their first causes but after being thus produced they are multiplied and preserved and this work also belongs to the Divine goodness And the perfection of this goodness is made most clear by the knowledge that in it alone God finds His own rest and we may find ours in its fruition Reply Obj three The good mentioned in the works of each day belongs to the first institution of nature but the blessing attached to the seventh day to its propagation QUESTION seventy four ON ALL THE SEVEN DAYS IN COMMON In Three Articles We next consider all the seven days in common and there are three points of inquiry one As to the sufficiency of these days two Whether they are all one day or more than one three As to certain modes of speaking which Scripture uses in narrating the works of the six days FIRST ARTICLE I Q seventy four Art one Whether these days are sufficiently enumerated Objection one It would seem that these days are not sufficiently enumerated For the work of creation is no less distinct from the works of distinction and adornment than these two works are from one another But separate days are assigned to distinction and to adornment and therefore separate days should be assigned to creation Obj two Further air and fire are nobler elements than earth and water But one day is assigned to the distinction of water and another to the distinction of the land Therefore other days ought to be devoted to the distinction of fire and air Obj three Further fish differ from birds as much as birds differ from the beasts of the earth whereas man differs more from other animals than all animals whatsoever differ from each other But one day is devoted to the production of fishes and another to that of the beast of the earth Another day then ought to be assigned to the production of birds and another to that of man Obj four Further it would seem on the other hand that some of these days are superfluous Light for instance stands to the luminaries in the relation of accident to subject But the subject is produced at the same time as the accident proper to it The light and the luminaries therefore ought not to have been produced on different days Obj five Further these days are devoted to the first instituting of the world But as on the seventh day nothing was instituted that day ought not to be enumerated with the others I answer that The reason of the distinction of these days is made clear by what has been said above Q seventy A one namely that the parts of the world had first to be distinguished and then each part adorned and filled as it were by the beings that inhabit it Now the parts into which the corporeal creation is divided are three according to some holy writers these parts being the heaven or highest part the water or middle part and the earth or the lowest part Thus the Pythagoreans teach that perfection consists in three things the beginning the middle and the end The first part then is distinguished on the first day and adorned on the fourth the middle part distinguished on the middle day and adorned on the fifth and the third part distinguished on the third day and adorned on the sixth But Augustine while agreeing with the above writers as to the last three days differs as to the first three for according to him spiritual creatures are formed on the first day and corporeal on the two others the higher bodies being formed on the first these two days and the lower on the second Thus then the perfection of the Divine works corresponds to the perfection of the number six which is the sum of its aliquot parts one two three since one day is assigned to the forming of spiritual creatures two to that of corporeal creatures and three to the work of adornment Reply Obj one According to Augustine the work of creation belongs to the production of formless matter and of the formless spiritual nature both of which are outside of time as he himself says Confess xii twelve Thus then the creation of either is set down before there was any day But it may also be said following other holy writers that the works of distinction and adornment imply certain changes in the creature which are measurable by time whereas the work of creation lies only in the Divine act producing the substance of beings instantaneously For this reason therefore every work of distinction and adornment is said to take place in a day but creation in the beginning which denotes something indivisible Reply Obj two Fire and air as not distinctly known by the unlettered are not expressly named by Moses among the parts of the world but reckoned with the intermediate part or water especially as regards the lowest part of the air or with the heaven to which the higher region of air approaches as Augustine says general ad lit ii thirteen Reply Obj three The production of animals is recorded with reference to their adorning the various parts of the world and therefore the days of their production are separated or united according as the animals adorn the same parts of the world or different parts Reply Obj four The nature of light as existing in a subject was made on the first day and the making of the luminaries on the fourth day does not mean that their substance was produced anew but that they then received a form that they had not before as said above Q seventy A one ad two Reply Obj five According to Augustine general ad lit iv fifteen after all that has been recorded that is assigned to the six days something distinct is attributed to the seventh namely that on it God rested in Himself from His works and for this reason it was right that the seventh day should be mentioned after the six It may also be said with the other writers that the world entered on the seventh day upon a new state in that nothing new was to be added to it and that therefore the seventh day is mentioned after the six from its being devoted to cessation from work SECOND ARTICLE I Q seventy four Art two Whether All These Days Are One Day Objection one It would seem that all these days are one day For it is written general two four five These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord made the heaven and the earth and every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth Therefore the day in which God made the heaven and the earth and every plant of the field is one and the same day But He made the heaven and the earth on the first day or rather before there was any day but the plant of the field He made on the third day Therefore the first and third days are but one day and for a like reason all the rest Obj two Further it is said Ecclus eighteen one He that liveth for ever created all things together But this would not be the case if the days of these works were more than one Therefore they are not many but one only Obj three Further on the seventh day God ceased from all new works If then the seventh day is distinct from the other days it follows that He did not make that day which is not admissible Obj four Further the entire work ascribed to one day God perfected in an instant for with each work are the words God said and it was done If then He had kept back His next work to another day it would follow that for the remainder of a day He would have ceased from working and left it vacant which would be superfluous The day therefore of the preceding work is one with the day of the work that follows On the contrary It is written general one The evening and the morning were the second day the third day and so on But where there is a second and third there are more than one There was not therefore only one day I answer that On this question Augustine differs from other expositors His opinion is that all the days that are called seven are one day represented in a sevenfold aspect general ad lit iv twenty two De Civ Dei xi nine Ad Orosium xxvi while others consider there were seven distinct days not one only Now these two opinions taken as explaining the literal text of Genesis are certainly widely different For Augustine understands by the word day the knowledge in the mind of the angels and hence according to him the first day denotes their knowledge of the first of the Divine works the second day their knowledge of the second work and similarly with the rest Thus then each work is said to have been wrought in some one of these days inasmuch as God wrought nothing in the universe without impressing the knowledge thereof on the angelic mind which can know many things at the same time especially in the Word in Whom all angelic knowledge is perfected and terminated So the distinction of days denotes the natural order of the things known and not a succession in the knowledge acquired or in the things produced Moreover angelic knowledge is appropriately called day since light the cause of day is to be found in spiritual things as Augustine observes general ad lit iv twenty eight In the opinion of the others however the days signify a succession both in time and in the things produced If however these two explanations are looked at as referring to the mode of production they will be found not greatly to differ if the diversity of opinion existing on two points as already shown Q sixty seven A one Q sixty nine A one between Augustine and other writers is taken into account First because Augustine takes the earth and the water as first created to signify matter totally without form but the making of the firmament the gathering of the waters and the appearing of dry land to denote the impression of forms upon corporeal matter But other holy writers take the earth and the water as first created to signify the elements of the universe themselves existing under the proper forms and the works that follow to mean some sort of distinction in bodies previously existing as also has been shown Q sixty seven AA one four Q sixty nine A one Secondly some writers hold that plants and animals were produced actually in the work of the six days Augustine that they were produced potentially Now the opinion of Augustine that the works of the six days were simultaneous is consistent with either view of the mode of production For the other writers agree with him that in the first production of things matter existed under the substantial form of the elements and agree with him also that in the first instituting of the world animals and plants did not exist actually There remains however a difference as to four points since according to the latter there was a time after the production of creatures in which light did not exist the firmament had not been formed and the earth was still covered by the waters nor had the heavenly bodies been formed which is the fourth difference which are not consistent with Augustine s explanation In order therefore to be impartial we must meet the arguments of either side Reply Obj one On the day on which God created the heaven and the earth He created also every plant of the field not indeed actually but before it sprung up in the earth that is potentially And this work Augustine ascribes to the third day but other writers to the first instituting of the world Reply Obj two God created all things together so far as regards their substance in some measure formless But He did not create all things together so far as regards that formation of things which lies in distinction and adornment Hence the word creation is significant Reply Obj three On the seventh day God ceased from making new things but not from providing for their increase and to this latter work it belongs that the first day is succeeded by other days Reply Obj four All things were not distinguished and adorned together not from a want of power on God s part as requiring time in which to work but that due order might be observed in the instituting of the world Hence it was fitting that different days should be assigned to the different states of the world as each succeeding work added to the world a fresh state of perfection Reply Obj five According to Augustine the order of days refers to the natural order of the works attributed to the days THIRD ARTICLE I Q seventy four Art three Whether Scripture Uses Suitable Words to Express the Work of the Six Days Objection one It would seem the Scripture does not use suitable words to express the works of the six days For as light the firmament and other similar works were made by the Word of God so were the heaven and the earth For all things were made by Him John one three Therefore in the creation of heaven and earth as in the other works mention should have been made of the Word of God Obj two Further the water was created by God yet its creation is not mentioned Therefore the creation of the world is not sufficiently described Obj three Further it is said general one thirty one God saw all the things that He had made and they were very good It ought then to have been said of each work God saw that it was good The omission therefore of these words in the work of creation and in that of the second day is not fitting Obj four Further the Spirit of God is God Himself But it does not befit God to move and to occupy place Therefore the words The Spirit of God moved over the waters are unbecoming Obj five Further what is already made is not made over again Therefore to the words God said Let the firmament be made and it was so it is superfluous to add God made the firmament And the like is to be said of other works Obj six Further evening and morning do not sufficiently divide the day since the day has many parts Therefore the words The evening and morning were the second day or the third day are not suitable Obj seven Further first not one corresponds to second and third It should therefore have been said that The evening and the morning were the first day rather than one day Reply Obj one According to Augustine general ad lit i four the person of the Son is mentioned both in the first creation of the world and in its distinction and adornment but differently in either place For distinction and adornment belong to the work by which the world receives its form But as the giving form to a work of art is by means of the form of the art in the mind of the artist which may be called his intelligible word so the giving form to every creature is by the word of God and for this reason in the works of distinction and adornment the Word is mentioned But in creation the Son is mentioned as the beginning by the words In the beginning God created since by creation is understood the production of formless matter But according to those who hold that the elements were created from the first under their proper forms another explanation must be given and therefore Basil says Hom ii iii in Hexaem that the words God said signify a Divine command Such a command however could not have been given before creatures had been produced that could obey it Reply Obj two According to Augustine De Civ Dei ix thirty three by the heaven is understood the formless spiritual nature and by the earth the formless matter of all corporeal things and thus no creature is omitted But according to Basil Hom i in Hexaem the heaven and the earth as the two extremes are alone mentioned the intervening things being left to be understood since all these move heavenwards if light or earthwards if heavy And others say that under the word earth Scripture is accustomed to include all the four elements as Ps one hundred forty eight seventy eight after the words Praise the Lord from the earth is added fire hail snow and ice Reply Obj three In the account of the creation there is found something to correspond to the words God saw that it was good used in the work of distinction and adornment and this appears from the consideration that the Holy Spirit is Love Now there are two things says Augustine general ad lit i eight which came from God s love of His creatures their existence and their permanence That they might then exist and exist permanently the Spirit of God it is said moved over the waters that is to say over that formless matter signified by water even as the love of the artist moves over the materials of his art that out of them he may form his work And the words God saw that it was good signify that the things that He had made were to endure since they express a certain satisfaction taken by God in His works as of an artist in his art not as though He knew the creature otherwise or that the creature was pleasing to Him otherwise than before He made it Thus in either work of creation and of formation the Trinity of Persons is implied In creation the Person of the Father is indicated by God the Creator the Person of the Son by the beginning in which He created and the Person of the Holy Ghost by the Spirit that moved over the waters But in the formation the Person of the Father is indicated by God that speaks and the Person of the Son by the Word in which He speaks and the Person of the Holy Spirit by the satisfaction with which God saw that what was made was good And if the words God saw that it was good are not said of the work of the second day this is because the work of distinguishing the waters was only begun on that day but perfected on the third Hence these words that are said of the third day refer also to the second Or it may be that Scripture does not use these words of approval of the second day s work because this is concerned with the distinction of things not evident to the senses of mankind Or again because by the firmament is simply understood the cloudy region of the air which is not one of the permanent parts of the universe nor of the principal divisions of the world The above three reasons are given by Rabbi Moses Perplex ii and to these may be added a mystical one derived from numbers and assigned by some writers according to whom the work of the second day is not marked with approval because the second number is an imperfect number as receding from the perfection of unity Reply Obj four Rabbi Moses Perplex ii understands by the Spirit of the Lord the air or the wind as Plato also did and says that it is so called according to the custom of Scripture in which these things are throughout attributed to God But according to the holy writers the Spirit of the Lord signifies the Holy Ghost Who is said to move over the water that is to say over what Augustine holds to mean formless matter lest it should be supposed that God loved of necessity the works He was to produce as though He stood in need of them For love of that kind is subject to not superior to the object of love Moreover it is fittingly implied that the Spirit moved over that which was incomplete and unfinished since that movement is not one of place but of pre eminent power as Augustine says general ad lit i seven It is the opinion however of Basil Hom ii in Hexaem that the Spirit moved over the element of water fostering and quickening its nature and impressing vital power as the hen broods over her chickens For water has especially a life giving power since many animals are generated in water and the seed of all animals is liquid Also the life of the soul is given by the water of baptism according to John three five Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost he cannot enter into the kingdom of God Reply Obj five According to Augustine general ad lit i eight these three phrases denote the threefold being of creatures first their being in the Word denoted by the command Let be made secondly their being in the angelic mind signified by the words It was done thirdly their being in their proper nature by the words He made And because the formation of the angels is recorded on the first day it was not necessary there to add He made It may also be said following other writers that the words He said and Let be made denote God s command and the words It was done the fulfilment of that command But as it was necessary for the sake of those especially who have asserted that all visible things were made by the angels to mention how things were made it is added in order to remove that error that God Himself made them Hence in each work after the words It was done some act of God is expressed by some such words as He made or He divided or He called Reply Obj six According to Augustine general ad lit iv twenty two thirty by the evening and the morning are understood the evening and the morning knowledge of the angels which has been explained Q fifty eight A six seven But according to Basil Hom ii in Hexaem the entire period takes its name as is customary from its more important part the day An instance of this is found in the words of Jacob The days of my pilgrimage where night is not mentioned at all But the evening and the morning are mentioned as being the ends of the day since day begins with morning and ends with evening or because evening denotes the beginning of night and morning the beginning of day It seems fitting also that where the first distinction of creatures is described divisions of time should be denoted only by what marks their beginning And the reason for mentioning the evening first is that as the evening ends the day which begins with the light the termination of the light at evening precedes the termination of the darkness which ends with the morning But Chrysostom s explanation is that thereby it is intended to show that the natural day does not end with the evening but with the morning Hom v in general Reply Obj seven The words one day are used when day is first instituted to denote that one day is made up of twenty four hours Hence by mentioning one the measure of a natural day is fixed Another reason may be to signify that a day is completed by the return of the sun to the point from which it commenced its course And yet another because at the completion of a week of seven days the first day returns which is one with the eighth day The three reasons assigned above are those given by Basil Hom ii in Hexaem TREATISE ON MAN QQ seventy five one hundred two QUESTION seventy five OF MAN WHO IS COMPOSED OF A SPIRITUAL AND A CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE AND IN THE FIRST PLACE CONCERNING WHAT BELONGS TO THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL In Seven Articles Having treated of the spiritual and of the corporeal creature we now proceed to treat of man who is composed of a spiritual and corporeal substance We shall treat first of the nature of man and secondly of his origin Now the theologian considers the nature of man in relation to the soul but not in relation to the body except in so far as the body has relation to the soul Hence the first object of our consideration will be the soul And since Dionysius Ang Hier xi says that three things are to be found in spiritual substances essence power and operation we shall treat first of what belongs to the essence of the soul secondly of what belongs to its power thirdly of what belongs to its operation Concerning the first two points have to be considered the first is the nature of the soul considered in itself the second is the union of the soul with the body Under the first head there are seven points of inquiry one Whether the soul is a body two Whether the human soul is a subsistence three Whether the souls of brute animals are subsistent four Whether the soul is man or is man composed of soul and body five Whether the soul is composed of matter and form six Whether the soul is incorruptible seven Whether the soul is of the same species as an angel FIRST ARTICLE I Q seventy five Art one Whether the Soul Is a Body Objection one It would seem that the soul is a body For the soul is the moving principle of the body Nor does it move unless moved First because seemingly nothing can move unless it is itself moved since nothing gives what it has not for instance what is not hot does not give heat Secondly because if there be anything that moves and is not moved it must be the cause of eternal unchanging movement as we find proved Phys viii six and this does not appear to be the case in the movement of an animal which is caused by the soul Therefore the soul is a mover moved But every mover moved is a body Therefore the soul is a body Obj two Further all knowledge is caused by means of a likeness But there can be no likeness of a body to an incorporeal thing If therefore the soul were not a body it could not have knowledge of corporeal things Obj three Further between the mover and the moved there must be contact But contact is only between bodies Since therefore the soul moves the body it seems that the soul must be a body On the contrary Augustine says De Trin vi six that the soul is simple in comparison with the body inasmuch as it does not occupy space by its bulk I answer that To seek the nature of the soul we must premise that the soul is defined as the first principle of life of those things which live for we call living things animate i e having a soul and those things which have no life inanimate Now life is shown principally by two actions knowledge and movement The philosophers of old not being able to rise above their imagination supposed that the principle of these actions was something corporeal for they asserted that only bodies were real things and that what is not corporeal is nothing hence they maintained that the soul is something corporeal This opinion can be proved to be false in many ways but we shall make use of only one proof based on universal and certain principles which shows clearly that the soul is not a body It is manifest that not every principle of vital action is a soul for then the eye would be a soul as it is a principle of vision and the same might be applied to the other instruments of the soul but it is the first principle of life which we call the soul Now though a body may be a principle of life as the heart is a principle of life in an animal yet nothing corporeal can be the first principle of life For it is clear that to be a principle of life or to be a living thing does not belong to a body as such since if that were the case every body would be a living thing or a principle of life Therefore a body is competent to be a living thing or even a principle of life as such a body Now that it is actually such a body it owes to some principle which is called its act Therefore the soul which is the first principle of life is not a body but the act of a body thus heat which is the principle of calefaction is not a body but an act of a body Reply Obj one As everything which is in motion must be moved by something else a process which cannot be prolonged indefinitely we must allow that not every mover is moved For since to be moved is to pass from potentiality to actuality the mover gives what it has to the thing moved inasmuch as it causes it to be in act But as is shown in Phys viii six there is a mover which is altogether immovable and not moved either essentially or accidentally and such a mover can cause an invariable movement There is however another kind of mover which though not moved essentially is moved accidentally and for this reason it does not cause an invariable movement such a mover is the soul There is again another mover which is moved essentially namely the body And because the philosophers of old believed that nothing existed but bodies they maintained that every mover is moved and that the soul is moved directly and is a body Reply Obj two The likeness of a thing known is not of necessity actually in the nature of the knower but given a thing which knows potentially and afterwards knows actually the likeness of the thing known must be in the nature of the knower not actually but only potentially thus color is not actually in the pupil of the eye but only potentially Hence it is necessary not that the likeness of corporeal things should be actually in the nature of the soul but that there be a potentiality in the soul for such a likeness But the ancient philosophers omitted to distinguish between actuality and potentiality and so they held that the soul must be a body in order to have knowledge of a body and that it must be composed of the principles of which all bodies are formed in order to know all bodies Reply Obj three There are two kinds of contact of quantity and of power By the former a body can be touched only by a body by the latter a body can be touched by an incorporeal thing which moves that body SECOND ARTICLE I Q seventy five Art two Whether the Human Soul Is Something Subsistent Objection one It would seem that the human soul is not something subsistent For that which subsists is said to be this particular thing Now this particular thing is said not of the soul but of that which is composed of soul and body Therefore the soul is not something subsistent Obj two Further everything subsistent operates But the soul does not operate for as the Philosopher says De Anima i four to say that the soul feels or understands is like saying that the soul weaves or builds Therefore the soul is not subsistent Obj three Further if the soul were subsistent it would have some operation apart from the body But it has no operation apart from the body not even that of understanding for the act of understanding does not take place without a phantasm which cannot exist apart from the body Therefore the human soul is not something subsistent On the contrary Augustine says De Trin x seven Who understands that the nature of the soul is that of a substance and not that of a body will see that those who maintain the corporeal nature of the soul are led astray through associating with the soul those things without which they are unable to think of any nature i e imaginary pictures of corporeal things Therefore the nature of the human intellect is not only incorporeal but it is also a substance that is something subsistent I answer that It must necessarily be allowed that the principle of intellectual operation which we call the soul is a principle both incorporeal and subsistent For it is clear that by means of the intellect man can have knowledge of all corporeal things Now whatever knows certain things cannot have any of them in its own nature because that which is in it naturally would impede the knowledge of anything else Thus we observe that a sick man s tongue being vitiated by a feverish and bitter humor is insensible to anything sweet and everything seems bitter to it Therefore if the intellectual principle contained the nature of a body it would be unable to know all bodies Now every body has its own determinate nature Therefore it is impossible for the intellectual principle to be a body It is likewise impossible for it to understand by means of a bodily organ since the determinate nature of that organ would impede knowledge of all bodies as when a certain determinate color is not only in the pupil of the eye but also in a glass vase the liquid in the vase seems to be of that same color Therefore the intellectual principle which we call the mind or the intellect has an operation per se apart from the body Now only that which subsists can have an operation per se For nothing can operate but what is actual for which reason we do not say that heat imparts heat but that what is hot gives heat We must conclude therefore that the human soul which is called the intellect or the mind is something incorporeal and subsistent Reply Obj one This particular thing can be taken in two senses Firstly for anything subsistent secondly for that which subsists and is complete in a specific nature The former sense excludes the inherence of an accident or of a material form the latter excludes also the imperfection of the part so that a hand can be called this particular thing in the first sense but not in the second Therefore as the human soul is a part of human nature it can indeed be called this particular thing in the first sense as being something subsistent but not in the second for in this sense what is composed of body and soul is said to be this particular thing Reply Obj two Aristotle wrote those words as expressing not his own opinion but the opinion of those who said that to understand is to be moved as is clear from the context Or we may reply that to operate per se belongs to what exists per se But for a thing to exist per se it suffices sometimes that it be not inherent as an accident or a material form even though it be part of something Nevertheless that is rightly said to subsist per se which is neither inherent in the above sense nor part of anything else In this sense the eye or the hand cannot be said to subsist per se nor can it for that reason be said to operate per se Hence the operation of the parts is through each part attributed to the whole For we say that man sees with the eye and feels with the hand and not in the same sense as when we say that what is hot gives heat by its heat for heat strictly speaking does not give heat We may therefore say that the soul understands as the eye sees but it is more correct to say that man understands through the soul Reply Obj three The body is necessary for the action of the intellect not as its origin of action but on the part of the object for the phantasm is to the intellect what color is to the sight Neither does such a dependence on the body prove the intellect to be non subsistent otherwise it would follow that an animal is non subsistent since it requires external objects of the senses in order to perform its act of perception THIRD ARTICLE I Q seventy five Art three Whether the Souls of Brute Animals Are Subsistent Objection one It would seem that the souls of brute animals are subsistent For man is of the same genus as other animals and as we have just shown A two the soul of man is subsistent Therefore the souls of other animals are subsistent Obj two Further the relation of the sensitive faculty to sensible objects is like the relation of the intellectual faculty to intelligible objects But the intellect apart from the body apprehends intelligible objects Therefore the sensitive faculty apart from the body perceives sensible objects Therefore since the souls of brute animals are sensitive it follows that they are subsistent just as the human intellectual soul is subsistent Obj three Further the soul of brute animals moves the body But the body is not a mover but is moved Therefore the soul of brute animals has an operation apart from the body On the contrary Is what is written in the book De Eccl Dogm xvi xvii Man alone we believe to have a subsistent soul whereas the souls of animals are not subsistent I answer that The ancient philosophers made no distinction between sense and intellect and referred both to a corporeal principle as has been said A one Plato however drew a distinction between intellect and sense yet he referred both to an incorporeal principle maintaining that sensing just as understanding belongs to the soul as such From this it follows that even the souls of brute animals are subsistent But Aristotle held that of the operations of the soul understanding alone is performed without a corporeal organ On the other hand sensation and the consequent operations of the sensitive soul are evidently accompanied with change in the body thus in the act of vision the pupil of the eye is affected by a reflection of color and so with the other senses Hence it is clear that the sensitive soul has no per se operation of its own and that every operation of the sensitive soul belongs to the composite Wherefore we conclude that as the souls of brute animals have no per se operations they are not subsistent For the operation of anything follows the mode of its being Reply Obj one Although man is of the same genus as other animals he is of a different species Specific difference is derived from the difference of form nor does every difference of form necessarily imply a diversity of genus Reply Obj two The relation of the sensitive faculty to the sensible object is in one way the same as that of the intellectual faculty to the intelligible object in so far as each is in potentiality to its object But in another way their relations differ inasmuch as the impression of the object on the sense is accompanied with change in the body so that excessive strength of the sensible corrupts sense a thing that never occurs in the case of the intellect For an intellect that understands the highest of intelligible objects is more able afterwards to understand those that are lower If however in the process of intellectual operation the body is weary this result is accidental inasmuch as the intellect requires the operation of the sensitive powers in the production of the phantasms Reply Obj three Motive power is of two kinds One the appetitive power commands motion The operation of this power in the sensitive soul is not apart from the body for anger joy and passions of a like nature are accompanied by a change in the body The other motive power is that which executes motion in adapting the members for obeying the appetite and the act of this power does not consist in moving but in being moved Whence it is clear that to move is not an act of the sensitive soul without the body FOURTH ARTICLE I Q seventy five Art four Whether the Soul Is Man Objection one It would seem that the soul is man For it is written two Cor four sixteen Though our outward man is corrupted yet the inward man is renewed day by day But that which is within man is the soul Therefore the soul is the inward man Obj two Further the human soul is a substance But it is not a universal substance Therefore it is a particular substance Therefore it is a hypostasis or a person and it can only be a human person Therefore the soul is man for a human person is a man On the contrary Augustine De Civ Dei xix three commends Varro as holding that man is not a mere soul nor a mere body but both soul and body I answer that The assertion the soul is man can be taken in two senses First that man is a soul though this particular man Socrates for instance is not a soul but composed of soul and body I say this forasmuch as some held that the form alone belongs to the species while matter is part of the individual and not the species This cannot be true for to the nature of the species belongs what the definition signifies and in natural things the definition does not signify the form only but the form and the matter Hence in natural things the matter is part of the species not indeed signate matter which is the principle of individuality but the common matter For as it belongs to the notion of this particular man to be composed of this soul of this flesh and of these bones so it belongs to the notion of man to be composed of soul flesh and bones for whatever belongs in common to the substance of all the individuals contained under a given species must belong to the substance of the species It may also be understood in this sense that this soul is this man and this could be held if it were supposed that the operation of the sensitive soul were proper to it apart from the body because in that case all the operations which are attributed to man would belong to the soul only and whatever performs the operations proper to a thing is that thing wherefore that which performs the operations of a man is man But it has been shown above A three that sensation is not the operation of the soul only Since then sensation is an operation of man but not proper to him it is clear that man is not a soul only but something composed of soul and body Plato through supposing that sensation was proper to the soul could maintain man to be a soul making use of the body Reply Obj one According to the Philosopher Ethic ix eight a thing seems to be chiefly what is princip al in it thus what the governor of a state does the state is said to do In this way sometimes what is princip al in man is said to be man sometimes indeed the intellectual part which in accordance with truth is called the inward man and sometimes the sensitive part with the body is called man in the opinion of those whose observation does not go beyond the senses And this is called the outward man Reply Obj two Not every particular substance is a hypostasis or a person but that which has the complete nature of its species Hence a hand or a foot is not called a hypostasis or a person nor likewise is the soul alone so called since it is a part of the human species FIFTH ARTICLE I Q seventy five Art five Whether the Soul Is Composed of Matter and Form Objection one It would seem that the soul is composed of matter and form For potentiality is opposed to actuality Now whatsoever things are in actuality participate of the First Act which is God by participation of Whom all things are good are beings and are living things as is clear from the teaching of Dionysius Div Nom v Therefore whatsoever things are in potentiality participate of the first potentiality But the first potentiality is primary matter Therefore since the human soul is after a manner in potentiality which appears from the fact that sometimes a man is potentially understanding it seems that the human soul must participate of primary matter as part of itself Obj two Further wherever the properties of matter are found there matter is But the properties of matter are found in the soul namely to be a subject and to be changed for it is a subject to science and virtue and it changes from ignorance to knowledge and from vice to virtue Therefore matter is in the soul Obj three Further things which have no matter have no cause of their existence as the Philosopher says Metaph viii Did vii six But the soul has a cause of its existence since it is created by God Therefore the soul has matter Obj four Further what has no matter and is a form only is a pure act and is infinite But this belongs to God alone Therefore the soul has matter On the contrary Augustine general ad lit vii seven hundred eighty nine proves that the soul was made neither of corporeal matter nor of spiritual matter I answer that The soul has no matter We may consider this question in two ways First from the notion of a soul in general for it belongs to the notion of a soul to be the form of a body Now either it is a form by virtue of itself in its entirety or by virtue of some part of itself If by virtue of itself in its entirety then it is impossible that any part of it should be matter if by matter we understand something purely potential for a form as such is an act and that which is purely potentiality cannot be part of an act since potentiality is repugnant to actuality as being opposite thereto If however it be a form by virtue of a part of itself then we call that part the soul and that matter which it actualizes first we call the primary animate Secondly we may proceed from the specific notion of the human soul inasmuch as it is intellectual For it is clear that whatever is received into something is received according to the condition of the recipient Now a thing is known in as far as its form is in the knower But the intellectual soul knows a thing in its nature absolutely for instance it knows a stone absolutely as a stone and therefore the form of a stone absolutely as to its proper formal idea is in the intellectual soul Therefore the intellectual soul itself is an absolute form and not something composed of matter and form For if the intellectual soul were composed of matter and form the forms of things would be received into it as individuals and so it would only know the individual just as it happens with the sensitive powers which receive forms in a corporeal organ since matter is the principle by which forms are individualized It follows therefore that the intellectual soul and every intellectual substance which has knowledge of forms absolutely is exempt from composition of matter and form Reply Obj one The First Act is the universal principle of all acts because It is infinite virtually precontaining all things as Dionysius says Div Nom v Wherefore things participate of It not as a part of themselves but by diffusion of Its processions Now as potentiality is receptive of act it must be proportionate to act But the acts received which proceed from the First Infinite Act and are participations thereof are diverse so that there cannot be one potentiality which receives all acts as there is one act from which all participated acts are derived for then the receptive potentiality would equal the active potentiality of the First Act Now the receptive potentiality in the intellectual soul is other than the receptive potentiality of first matter as appears from the diversity of the things received by each For primary matter receives individual forms whereas the intelligence receives absolute forms Hence the existence of such a potentiality in the intellectual soul does not prove that the soul is composed of matter and form Reply Obj two To be a subject and to be changed belong to matter by reason of its being in potentiality As therefore the potentiality of the intelligence is one thing and the potentiality of primary matter another so in each is there a different reason of subjection and change For the intelligence is subject to knowledge and is changed from ignorance to knowledge by reason of its being in potentiality with regard to the intelligible species Reply Obj three The form causes matter to be and so does the agent wherefore the agent causes matter to be so far as it actualizes it by transmuting it to the act of a form A subsistent form however does not owe its existence to some formal principle nor has it a cause transmuting it from potentiality to act So after the words quoted above the Philosopher concludes that in things composed of matter and form there is no other cause but that which moves from potentiality to act while whatsoever things have no matter are simply beings at once The Leonine edition has simpliciter sunt quod vere entia aliquid The Parma edition of saint Thomas s Commentary on Aristotle has statim per se unum quiddam est et ens quiddam Reply Obj four Everything participated is compared to the participator as its act But whatever created form be supposed to subsist per se must have existence by participation for even life or anything of that sort is a participator of existence as Dionysius says Div Nom v Now participated existence is limited by the capacity of the participator so that God alone Who is His own existence is pure act and infinite But in intellectual substances there is composition of actuality and potentiality not indeed of matter and form but of form and participated existence Wherefore some say that they are composed of that whereby they are and that which they are for existence itself is that by which a thing is SIXTH ARTICLE I Q seventy five Art six Whether the Human Soul Is Incorruptible Objection one It would seem that the human soul is corruptible For those things that have a like beginning and process seemingly have a like end But the beginning by generation of men is like that of animals for they are made from the earth And the process of life is alike in both because all things breathe alike and man hath nothing more than the beast as it is written Eccles three nineteen Therefore as the same text concludes the death of man and beast is one and the condition of both is equal But the souls of brute animals are corruptible Therefore also the human soul is corruptible Obj two Further whatever is out of nothing can return to nothingness because the end should correspond to the beginning But as it is written Wis two two We are born of nothing which is true not only of the body but also of the soul Therefore as is concluded in the same passage After this we shall be as if we had not been even as to our soul Obj three Further nothing is without its own proper operation But the operation proper to the soul which is to understand through a phantasm cannot be without the body For the soul understands nothing without a phantasm and there is no phantasm without the body as the Philosopher says De Anima i one Therefore the soul cannot survive the dissolution of the body On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom iv that human souls owe to Divine goodness that they are intellectual and that they have an incorruptible substantial life I answer that We must assert that the intellectual principle which we call the human soul is incorruptible For a thing may be corrupted in two ways per se and accidentally Now it is impossible for any substance to be generated or corrupted accidentally that is by the generation or corruption of something else For generation and corruption belong to a thing just as existence belongs to it which is acquired by generation and lost by corruption Therefore whatever has existence per se cannot be generated or corrupted except per se while things which do not subsist such as accidents and material forms acquire existence or lose it through the generation or corruption of composite things Now it was shown above AA two three that the souls of brutes are not self subsistent whereas the human soul is so that the souls of brutes are corrupted when their bodies are corrupted while the human soul could not be corrupted unless it were corrupted per se This indeed is impossible not only as regards the human soul but also as regards anything subsistent that is a form alone For it is clear that what belongs to a thing by virtue of itself is inseparable from it but existence belongs to a form which is an act by virtue of itself Wherefore matter acquires actual existence as it acquires the form while it is corrupted so far as the form is separated from it But it is impossible for a form to be separated from itself and therefore it is impossible for a subsistent form to cease to exist Granted even that the soul is composed of matter and form as some pretend we should nevertheless have to maintain that it is incorruptible For corruption is found only where there is contrariety since generation and corruption are from contraries and into contraries Wherefore the heavenly bodies since they have no matter subject to contrariety are incorruptible Now there can be no contrariety in the intellectual soul for it receives according to the manner of its existence and those things which it receives are without contrariety for the notions even of contraries are not themselves contrary since contraries belong to the same knowledge Therefore it is impossible for the intellectual soul to be corruptible Moreover we may take a sign of this from the fact that everything naturally aspires to existence after its own manner Now in things that have knowledge desire ensues upon knowledge The senses indeed do not know existence except under the conditions of here and now whereas the intellect apprehends existence absolutely and for all time so that everything that has an intellect naturally desires always to exist But a natural desire cannot be in vain Therefore every intellectual substance is incorruptible Reply Obj one Solomon reasons thus in the person of the foolish as expressed in the words of Wisdom two Therefore the saying that man and animals have a like beginning in generation is true of the body for all animals alike are made of earth But it is not true of the soul For the souls of brutes are produced by some power of the body whereas the human soul is produced by God To signify this it is written as to other animals Let the earth bring forth the living soul general one twenty four while of man it is written general two seven that He breathed into his face the breath of life And so in the last chapter of Ecclesiastes twelve seven it is concluded Before the dust return into its earth from whence it was and the spirit return to God Who gave it Again the process of life is alike as to the body concerning which it is written Eccles three nineteen All things breathe alike and Wis two two The breath in our nostrils is smoke But the process is not alike of the soul for man is intelligent whereas animals are not Hence it is false to say Man has nothing more than beasts Thus death comes to both alike as to the body by not as to the soul Reply Obj two As a thing can be created by reason not of a passive potentiality but only of the active potentiality of the Creator Who can produce something out of nothing so when we say that a thing can be reduced to nothing we do not imply in the creature a potentiality to non existence but in the Creator the power of ceasing to sustain existence But a thing is said to be corruptible because there is in it a potentiality to non existence Reply Obj three To understand through a phantasm is the proper operation of the soul by virtue of its union with the body After separation from the body it will have another mode of understanding similar to other substances separated from bodies as will appear later on Q eighty nine A one SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q seventy five Art seven Whether the Soul Is of the Same Species As an Angel Objection one It would seem that the soul is of the same species as an angel For each thing is ordained to its proper end by the nature of its species whence is derived its inclination for that end But the end of the soul is the same as that of an angel namely eternal happiness Therefore they are of the same species Obj two Further the ultimate specific difference is the noblest because it completes the nature of the species But there is nothing nobler either in an angel or in the soul than their intellectual nature Therefore the soul and the angel agree in the ultimate specific difference therefore they belong to the same species Obj three Further it seems that the soul does not differ from an angel except in its union with the body But as the body is outside the essence of the soul it seems that it does not belong to its species Therefore the soul and angel are of the same species On the contrary Things which have different natural operations are of different species But the natural operations of the soul and of an angel are different since as Dionysius says Div Nom vii Angelic minds have simple and blessed intelligence not gathering their knowledge of Divine things from visible things Subsequently he says the contrary to this of the soul Therefore the soul and an angel are not of the same species I answer that Origen Peri Archon iii five held that human souls and angels are all of the same species and this because he supposed that in these substances the difference of degree was accidental as resulting from their free will as we have seen above Q forty seven A two But this cannot be for in incorporeal substances there cannot be diversity of number without diversity of species and inequality of nature because as they are not composed of matter and form but are subsistent forms it is clear that there is necessarily among them a diversity of species For a separate form cannot be understood otherwise than as one of a single species thus supposing a separate whiteness to exist it could only be one forasmuch as one whiteness does not differ from another except as in this or that subject But diversity of species is always accompanied with a diversity of nature thus in species of colors one is more perfect than another and the same applies to other species because differences which divide a genus are contrary to one another Contraries however are compared to one another as the perfect to the imperfect since the principle of contrariety is habit and privation thereof as is written Metaph x Did ix four The same would follow if the aforesaid substances were composed of matter and form For if the matter of one be distinct from the matter of another it follows that either the form is the principle of the distinction of matter that is to say that the matter is distinct on account of its relation to divers forms and even then there would result a difference of species and inequality of nature or else the matter is the principle of the distinction of forms But one matter cannot be distinct from another except by a distinction of quantity which has no place in these incorporeal substances such as an angel and the soul So that it is not possible for the angel and the soul to be of the same species How it is that there can be many souls of one species will be explained later Q seventy six A two ad one Reply Obj one This argument proceeds from the proximate and natural end Eternal happiness is the ultimate and supernatural end Reply Obj two The ultimate specific difference is the noblest because it is the most determinate in the same way as actuality is nobler than potentiality Thus however the intellectual faculty is not the noblest because it is indeterminate and common to many degrees of intellectuality as the sensible faculty is common to many degrees in the sensible nature Hence as all sensible things are not of one species so neither are all intellectual things of one species Reply Obj three The body is not of the essence of the soul but the soul by the nature of its essence can be united to the body so that properly speaking not the soul alone but the composite is the species And the very fact that the soul in a certain way requires the body for its operation proves that the soul is endowed with a grade of intellectuality inferior to that of an angel who is not united to a body

none	none	 OF THE UNION OF BODY AND SOUL In Eight Articles 
7956_245687_000003_000000	train-clean-360	We now consider the union of the soul with the body and concerning this there are eight points of inquiry 
7956_245687_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 one Whether the intellectual principle is united to the body as its form 
7956_245687_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Whether the intellectual principle is united to the body as its form 
7956_245687_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 two Whether the intellectual principle is multiplied numerically according to the number of bodies or is there one intelligence for all men 
7956_245687_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 three Whether in the body the form of which is an intellectual principle there is some other soul 
7956_245687_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 four Whether in the body there is any other substantial form 
7956_245687_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 five Of the qualities required in the body of which the intellectual principle is the form 
7956_245687_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 six Whether it be united to such a body by means of another body 
7956_245687_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 seven Whether by means of an accident 
none	none	eight Whether the soul is wholly in each part of the body FIRST ARTICLE I Q seventy six Art one Whether the Intellectual Principle Is United to the Body As Its Form 
7956_245687_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It seems that the intellectual principle is not united to the body as its form 
none	none	For the Philosopher says De Anima iii four that the intellect is separate and that it is not the act of any body 
7956_245687_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore it is not united to the body as its form 
none	none	Obj two Further every form is determined according to the nature of the matter of which it is the form otherwise no proportion would be required between matter and form Therefore if the intellect were united to the body as its form since every body has a determinate nature it would follow that the intellect has a determinate nature and thus it would not be capable of knowing all things as is clear from what has been said Q seventy five A two which is contrary to the nature of the intellect 
7956_245687_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the intellect is not united to the body as its form 
7956_245687_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the intellect is not united to the body as its form 
none	none	Obj three Further whatever receptive power is an act of a body receives a form materially and individually for what is received must be received according to the condition of the receiver 
7956_245687_000016_000001	train-clean-360	But the form of the thing understood is not received into the intellect materially and individually but rather immaterially and universally otherwise the intellect would not be capable of the knowledge of immaterial and universal objects but only of individuals like the senses 
none	none	Therefore the intellect is not united to the body as its form Obj four Further power and action have the same subject for the same subject is what can and does act But the intellectual action is not the action of a body as appears from above Q seventy five A two Therefore neither is the intellectual faculty a power of the body But virtue or power cannot be more abstract or more simple than the essence from which the faculty or power is derived Therefore neither is the substance of the intellect the form of a body Obj five Further whatever has per se existence is not united to the body as its form because a form is that by which a thing exists so that the very existence of a form does not belong to the form by itself But the intellectual principle has per se existence and is subsistent as was said above Q seventy five A two Therefore it is not united to the body as its form Obj six Further whatever exists in a thing by reason of its nature exists in it always 
7956_245687_000019_000001	train-clean-360	But to be united to matter belongs to the form by reason of its nature because form is the act of matter not by an accidental quality but by its own essence otherwise matter and form would not make a thing substantially one but only accidentally one Therefore a form cannot be without its own proper matter 
none	none	But the intellectual principle since it is incorruptible as was shown above Q seventy five A six remains separate from the body after the dissolution of the body 
7956_245687_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore the intellectual principle is not united to the body as its form 
none	none	On the contrary According to the Philosopher Metaph viii Did vii two difference is derived from the form 
7956_245687_000020_000001	train-clean-360	But the difference which constitutes man is rational which is applied to man on account of his intellectual principle 
7956_245687_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the intellectual principle is the form of man 
none	none	I answer that We must assert that the intellect which is the principle of intellectual operation is the form of the human body 
7956_245687_000021_000001	train-clean-360	For that whereby primarily anything acts is a form of the thing to which the act is to be attributed for instance that whereby a body is primarily healed is health and that whereby the soul knows primarily is knowledge hence health is a form of the body and knowledge is a form of the soul 
none	none	The reason is because nothing acts except so far as it is in act wherefore a thing acts by that whereby it is in act Now it is clear that the first thing by which the body lives is the soul And as life appears through various operations in different degrees of living things that whereby we primarily perform each of all these vital actions is the soul 
7956_245687_000021_000004	train-clean-360	For the soul is the primary principle of our nourishment sensation and local movement and likewise of our understanding 
7956_245687_000021_000005	train-clean-360	Therefore this principle by which we primarily understand whether it be called the intellect or the intellectual soul is the form of the body 
none	none	This is the demonstration used by Aristotle De Anima ii two 
7956_245687_000022_000000	train-clean-360	But if anyone says that the intellectual soul is not the form of the body he must first explain how it is that this action of understanding is the action of this particular man for each one is conscious that it is himself who understands 
none	none	Now an action may be attributed to anyone in three ways as is clear from the Philosopher Phys v one for a thing is said to move or act either by virtue of its whole self for instance as a physician heals or by virtue of a part as a man sees by his eye or through an accidental quality as when we say that something that is white builds because it is accidental to the builder to be white So when we say that Socrates or Plato understands it is clear that this is not attributed to him accidentally since it is ascribed to him as man which is predicated of him essentially 
7956_245687_000022_000003	train-clean-360	We must therefore say either that Socrates understands by virtue of his whole self as Plato maintained holding that man is an intellectual soul or that intelligence is a part of Socrates 
none	none	The first cannot stand as was shown above Q seventy five A four for this reason that it is one and the same man who is conscious both that he understands and that he senses 
7956_245687_000022_000005	train-clean-360	But one cannot sense without a body therefore the body must be some part of man 
none	none	It follows therefore that the intellect by which Socrates understands is a part of Socrates so that in some way it is united to the body of Socrates 
7956_245687_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The Commentator held that this union is through the intelligible species as having a double subject in the possible intellect and in the phantasms which are in the corporeal organs 
7956_245687_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Thus through the intelligible species the possible intellect is linked to the body of this or that particular man 
7956_245687_000023_000002	train-clean-360	But this link or union does not sufficiently explain the fact that the act of the intellect is the act of Socrates 
none	none	This can be clearly seen from comparison with the sensitive faculty from which Aristotle proceeds to consider things relating to the intellect For the relation of phantasms to the intellect is like the relation of colors to the sense of sight as he says De Anima iii fifty seven 
7956_245687_000023_000005	train-clean-360	Therefore as the species of colors are in the sight so are the species of phantasms in the possible intellect Now it is clear that because the colors the images of which are in the sight are on a wall the action of seeing is not attributed to the wall for we do not say that the wall sees but rather that it is seen 
none	none	Therefore from the fact that the species of phantasms are in the possible intellect it does not follow that Socrates in whom are the phantasms understands but that he or his phantasms are understood 
7956_245687_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Some however tried to maintain that the intellect is united to the body as its motor and hence that the intellect and body form one thing so that the act of the intellect could be attributed to the whole 
7956_245687_000024_000001	train-clean-360	This is however absurd for many reasons 
7956_245687_000024_000002	train-clean-360	First because the intellect does not move the body except through the appetite the movement of which presupposes the operation of the intellect 
7956_245687_000024_000003	train-clean-360	The reason therefore why Socrates understands is not because he is moved by his intellect but rather contrariwise he is moved by his intellect because he understands 
none	none	Secondly because since Socrates is an individual in a nature of one essence composed of matter and form if the intellect be not the form it follows that it must be outside the essence and then the intellect is the whole Socrates as a motor to the thing moved 
7956_245687_000024_000005	train-clean-360	Whereas the act of intellect remains in the agent and does not pass into something else as does the action of heating Therefore the action of understanding cannot be attributed to Socrates for the reason that he is moved by his intellect 
7956_245687_000024_000006	train-clean-360	Thirdly because the action of a motor is never attributed to the thing moved except as to an instrument as the action of a carpenter to a saw 
7956_245687_000024_000007	train-clean-360	Therefore if understanding is attributed to Socrates as the action of what moves him it follows that it is attributed to him as to an instrument 
none	none	This is contrary to the teaching of the Philosopher who holds that understanding is not possible through a corporeal instrument De Anima iii four Fourthly because although the action of a part be attributed to the whole as the action of the eye is attributed to a man yet it is never attributed to another part except perhaps indirectly for we do not say that the hand sees because the eye sees Therefore if the intellect and Socrates are united in the above manner the action of the intellect cannot be attributed to Socrates If however Socrates be a whole composed of a union of the intellect with whatever else belongs to Socrates and still the intellect be united to those other things only as a motor it follows that Socrates is not one absolutely and consequently neither a being absolutely for a thing is a being according as it is one 
7956_245687_000025_000000	train-clean-360	There remains therefore no other explanation than that given by Aristotle namely that this particular man understands because the intellectual principle is his form 
7956_245687_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Thus from the very operation of the intellect it is made clear that the intellectual principle is united to the body as its form 
none	none	The same can be clearly shown from the nature of the human species For the nature of each thing is shown by its operation 
7956_245687_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Now the proper operation of man as man is to understand because he thereby surpasses all other animals 
7956_245687_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Whence Aristotle concludes Ethic 
none	none	x seven that the ultimate happiness of man must consist in this operation as properly belonging to him 
7956_245687_000026_000004	train-clean-360	Man must therefore derive his species from that which is the principle of this operation 
none	none	But the species of anything is derived from its form 
7956_245687_000026_000006	train-clean-360	It follows therefore that the intellectual principle is the proper form of man 
none	none	But we must observe that the nobler a form is the more it rises above corporeal matter the less it is merged in matter and the more it excels matter by its power and its operation hence we find that the form of a mixed body has another operation not caused by its elemental qualities 
7956_245687_000027_000001	train-clean-360	And the higher we advance in the nobility of forms the more we find that the power of the form excels the elementary matter as the vegetative soul excels the form of the metal and the sensitive soul excels the vegetative soul 
7956_245687_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Now the human soul is the highest and noblest of forms 
none	none	Wherefore it excels corporeal matter in its power by the fact that it has an operation and a power in which corporeal matter has no share whatever 
7956_245687_000027_000004	train-clean-360	This power is called the intellect 
7956_245687_000028_000000	train-clean-360	It is well to remark that if anyone holds that the soul is composed of matter and form it would follow that in no way could the soul be the form of the body 
7956_245687_000028_000001	train-clean-360	For since the form is an act and matter is only in potentiality that which is composed of matter and form cannot be the form of another by virtue of itself as a whole 
none	none	But if it is a form by virtue of some part of itself then that part which is the form we call the soul and that of which it is the form we call the primary animate as was said above Q seventy five A five Reply Obj one As the Philosopher says Phys ii two the ultimate natural form to which the consideration of the natural philosopher is directed is indeed separate yet it exists in matter 
7956_245687_000029_000001	train-clean-360	He proves this from the fact that man and the sun generate man from matter It is separate indeed according to its intellectual power because the intellectual power does not belong to a corporeal organ as the power of seeing is the act of the eye for understanding is an act which cannot be performed by a corporeal organ like the act of seeing 
none	none	But it exists in matter so far as the soul itself to which this power belongs is the form of the body and the term of human generation And so the Philosopher says De Anima iii that the intellect is separate because it is not the faculty of a corporeal organ 
7956_245687_000030_000000	train-clean-360	From this it is clear how to answer the Second and Third objections since in order that man may be able to understand all things by means of his intellect and that his intellect may understand immaterial things and universals it is sufficient that the intellectual power be not the act of the body 
none	none	Reply Obj four The human soul by reason of its perfection is not a form merged in matter or entirely embraced by matter 
7956_245687_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore there is nothing to prevent some power thereof not being the act of the body although the soul is essentially the form of the body 
none	none	Reply Obj five The soul communicates that existence in which it subsists to the corporeal matter out of which and the intellectual soul there results unity of existence so that the existence of the whole composite is also the existence of the soul 
7956_245687_000032_000001	train-clean-360	This is not the case with other non subsistent forms 
7956_245687_000032_000002	train-clean-360	For this reason the human soul retains its own existence after the dissolution of the body whereas it is not so with other forms 
none	none	Reply Obj six To be united to the body belongs to the soul by reason of itself as it belongs to a light body by reason of itself to be raised up And as a light body remains light when removed from its proper place retaining meanwhile an aptitude and an inclination for its proper place so the human soul retains its proper existence when separated from the body having an aptitude and a natural inclination to be united to the body SECOND ARTICLE I Q seventy six Art two 
7956_245687_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Whether the Intellectual Principle Is Multiplied According to the Number of Bodies 
none	none	Objection one It would seem that the intellectual principle is not multiplied according to the number of bodies but that there is one intellect in all men 
7956_245687_000036_000001	train-clean-360	For an immaterial substance is not multiplied in number within one species 
none	none	But the human soul is an immaterial substance since it is not composed of matter and form as was shown above Q seventy five A five 
7956_245687_000036_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore there are not many human souls in one species 
7956_245687_000036_000004	train-clean-360	But all men are of one species 
7956_245687_000036_000005	train-clean-360	Therefore there is but one intellect in all men 
none	none	Obj two Further when the cause is removed the effect is also removed Therefore if human souls were multiplied according to the number of bodies it follows that the bodies being removed the number of souls would not remain but from all the souls there would be but a single remainder

none	none	Obj three Further if my intellect is distinct from your intellect my intellect is an individual and so is yours for individuals are things which differ in number but agree in one species 
7956_245687_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Now whatever is received into anything must be received according to the condition of the receiver 
7956_245687_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the species of things would be received individually into my intellect and also into yours which is contrary to the nature of the intellect which knows universals 
none	none	Obj four Further the thing understood is in the intellect which understands 
7956_245687_000039_000001	train-clean-360	If therefore my intellect is distinct from yours what is understood by me must be distinct from what is understood by you and consequently it will be reckoned as something individual and be only potentially something understood so that the common intention will have to be abstracted from both since from things diverse something intelligible common to them may be abstracted 
7956_245687_000039_000002	train-clean-360	But this is contrary to the nature of the intellect for then the intellect would seem not to be distinct from the imagination 
7956_245687_000039_000003	train-clean-360	It seems therefore to follow that there is one intellect in all men 
none	none	Obj five Further when the disciple receives knowledge from the master it cannot be said that the master s knowledge begets knowledge in the disciple because then also knowledge would be an active form such as heat is which is clearly false 
7956_245687_000040_000001	train-clean-360	It seems therefore that the same individual knowledge which is in the master is communicated to the disciple which cannot be unless there is one intellect in both 
7956_245687_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Seemingly therefore the intellect of the disciple and master is but one and consequently the same applies to all men 
none	none	Obj six Further Augustine De Quant Animae xxxii says If I were to say that there are many human souls I should laugh at myself But the soul seems to be one chiefly on account of the intellect Therefore there is one intellect of all men On the contrary The Philosopher says Phys ii three that the relation of universal causes to universals is like the relation of particular causes to individuals 
7956_245687_000042_000001	train-clean-360	But it is impossible that a soul one in species should belong to animals of different species Therefore it is impossible that one individual intellectual soul should belong to several individuals 
none	none	I answer that It is absolutely impossible for one intellect to belong to all men 
7956_245687_000043_000001	train-clean-360	This is clear if as Plato maintained man is the intellect itself 
7956_245687_000043_000002	train-clean-360	For it would follow that Socrates and Plato are one man and that they are not distinct from each other except by something outside the essence of each 
7956_245687_000043_000003	train-clean-360	The distinction between Socrates and Plato would be no other than that of one man with a tunic and another with a cloak which is quite absurd 
none	none	It is likewise clear that this is impossible if according to the opinion of Aristotle De Anima ii two it is supposed that the intellect is a part or a power of the soul which is the form of man For it is impossible for many distinct individuals to have one form as it is impossible for them to have one existence for the form is the principle of existence 
7956_245687_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Again this is clearly impossible whatever one may hold as to the manner of the union of the intellect to this or that man 
7956_245687_000045_000001	train-clean-360	For it is manifest that supposing there is one principal agent and two instruments we can say that there is one agent absolutely but several actions as when one man touches several things with his two hands there will be one who touches but two contacts 
7956_245687_000045_000002	train-clean-360	If on the contrary we suppose one instrument and several principal agents we might say that there are several agents but one act for example if there be many drawing a ship by means of a rope there will be many drawing but one pull 
7956_245687_000045_000003	train-clean-360	If however there is one principal agent and one instrument we say that there is one agent and one action as when the smith strikes with one hammer there is one striker and one stroke 
none	none	Now it is clear that no matter how the intellect is united or coupled to this or that man the intellect has the precedence of all the other things which appertain to man for the sensitive powers obey the intellect and are at its service 
7956_245687_000045_000005	train-clean-360	Therefore if we suppose two men to have several intellects and one sense for instance if two men had one eye there would be several seers but one sight 
7956_245687_000045_000006	train-clean-360	But if there is one intellect no matter how diverse may be all those things of which the intellect makes use as instruments in no way is it possible to say that Socrates and Plato are otherwise than one understanding man 
7956_245687_000045_000007	train-clean-360	And if to this we add that to understand which is the act of the intellect is not affected by any organ other than the intellect itself it will further follow that there is but one agent and one action that is to say that all men are but one understander and have but one act of understanding in regard that is of one intelligible object 
none	none	However it would be possible to distinguish my intellectual action from yours by the distinction of the phantasms that is to say were there one phantasm of a stone in me and another in you if the phantasm itself as it is one thing in me and another in you were a form of the possible intellect since the same agent according to divers forms produces divers actions as according to divers forms of things with regard to the same eye there are divers visions 
7956_245687_000046_000001	train-clean-360	But the phantasm itself is not a form of the possible intellect it is the intelligible species abstracted from the phantasm that is a form 
none	none	Now in one intellect from different phantasms of the same species only one intelligible species is abstracted as appears in one man in whom there may be different phantasms of a stone yet from all of them only one intelligible species of a stone is abstracted by which the intellect of that one man by one operation understands the nature of a stone notwithstanding the diversity of phantasms 
7956_245687_000046_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore if there were one intellect for all men the diversity of phantasms which are in this one and that one would not cause a diversity of intellectual operation in this man and that man 
7956_245687_000046_000004	train-clean-360	It follows therefore that it is altogether impossible and unreasonable to maintain that there exists one intellect for all men 
none	none	Reply Obj one Although the intellectual soul like an angel has no matter from which it is produced yet it is the form of a certain matter in which it is unlike an angel Therefore according to the division of matter there are many souls of one species while it is quite impossible for many angels to be of one species Reply Obj two Everything has unity in the same way that it has being consequently we must judge of the multiplicity of a thing as we judge of its being Now it is clear that the intellectual soul by virtue of its very being is united to the body as its form yet after the dissolution of the body the intellectual soul retains its own being In like manner the multiplicity of souls is in proportion to the multiplicity of the bodies yet after the dissolution of the bodies the souls retain their multiplied being Reply Obj three Individuality of the intelligent being or of the species whereby it understands does not exclude the understanding of universals otherwise since separate intellects are subsistent substances and consequently individual they could not understand universals 
7956_245687_000049_000001	train-clean-360	But the materiality of the knower and of the species whereby it knows impedes the knowledge of the universal 
none	none	For as every action is according to the mode of the form by which the agent acts as heating is according to the mode of the heat so knowledge is according to the mode of the species by which the knower knows Now it is clear that common nature becomes distinct and multiplied by reason of the individuating principles which come from the matter Therefore if the form which is the means of knowledge is material that is not abstracted from material conditions its likeness to the nature of a species or genus will be according to the distinction and multiplication of that nature by means of individuating principles so that knowledge of the nature of a thing in general will be impossible 
7956_245687_000049_000003	train-clean-360	But if the species be abstracted from the conditions of individual matter there will be a likeness of the nature without those things which make it distinct and multiplied thus there will be knowledge of the universal 
none	none	Nor does it matter as to this particular point whether there be one intellect or many because even if there were but one it would necessarily be an individual intellect and the species whereby it understands an individual species Reply Obj four Whether the intellect be one or many what is understood is one for what is understood is in the intellect not according to its own nature but according to its likeness for the stone is not in the soul but its likeness is as is said De Anima iii eight 
7956_245687_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Yet it is the stone which is understood not the likeness of the stone except by a reflection of the intellect on itself otherwise the objects of sciences would not be things but only intelligible species 
none	none	Now it happens that different things according to different forms are likened to the same thing 
7956_245687_000050_000003	train-clean-360	And since knowledge is begotten according to the assimilation of the knower to the thing known it follows that the same thing may happen to be known by several knowers as is apparent in regard to the senses for several see the same color according to different likenesses 
none	none	In the same way several intellects understand one object understood But there is this difference according to the opinion of Aristotle between the sense and the intelligence that a thing is perceived by the sense according to the disposition which it has outside the soul that is in its individuality whereas the nature of the thing understood is indeed outside the soul but the mode according to which it exists outside the soul is not the mode according to which it is understood 
7956_245687_000050_000006	train-clean-360	For the common nature is understood as apart from the individuating principles whereas such is not its mode of existence outside the soul 
7956_245687_000050_000007	train-clean-360	But according to the opinion of Plato the thing understood exists outside the soul in the same condition as those under which it is understood for he supposed that the natures of things exist separate from matter

7956_245687_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Whether Besides the Intellectual Soul There Are in Man Other Souls Essentially Different from One Another 
7956_245687_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that besides the intellectual soul there are in man other souls essentially different from one another such as the sensitive soul and the nutritive soul 
7956_245687_000055_000001	train-clean-360	For corruptible and incorruptible are not of the same substance 
none	none	But the intellectual soul is incorruptible whereas the other souls as the sensitive and the nutritive are corruptible as was shown above Q seventy five A six Therefore in man the essence of the intellectual soul the sensitive soul and the nutritive soul cannot be the same Obj two Further if it be said that the sensitive soul in man is incorruptible on the contrary corruptible and incorruptible differ generically says the Philosopher Metaph x Did ix ten 
7956_245687_000056_000001	train-clean-360	But the sensitive soul in the horse the lion and other brute animals is corruptible 
none	none	If therefore in man it be incorruptible the sensitive soul in man and brute animals will not be of the same genus Now an animal is so called from its having a sensitive soul and therefore animal will not be one genus common to man and other animals which is absurd Obj three Further the Philosopher says Metaph viii Did vii two that the genus is taken from the matter and difference from the form 
7956_245687_000057_000001	train-clean-360	But rational which is the difference constituting man is taken from the intellectual soul while he is called animal by reason of his having a body animated by a sensitive soul 
7956_245687_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the intellectual soul may be compared to the body animated by a sensitive soul as form to matter 
7956_245687_000057_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore in man the intellectual soul is not essentially the same as the sensitive soul but presupposes it as a material subject 
none	none	On the contrary It is said in the book De Ecclesiasticis Dogmatibus xv Nor do we say that there are two souls in one man as James and other Syrians write one animal by which the body is animated and which is mingled with the blood the other spiritual which obeys the reason but we say that it is one and the same soul in man that both gives life to the body by being united to it and orders itself by its own reasoning I answer that Plato held that there were several souls in one body distinct even as to organs to which souls he referred the different vital actions saying that the nutritive power is in the liver the concupiscible in the heart and the power of knowledge in the brain Which opinion is rejected by Aristotle De Anima ii two with regard to those parts of the soul which use corporeal organs for this reason that in those animals which continue to live when they have been divided in each part are observed the operations of the soul as sense and appetite 
7956_245687_000059_000001	train-clean-360	Now this would not be the case if the various principles of the soul s operations were essentially different and distributed in the various parts of the body 
7956_245687_000059_000002	train-clean-360	But with regard to the intellectual part he seems to leave it in doubt whether it be only logically distinct from the other parts of the soul or also locally 
none	none	The opinion of Plato might be maintained if as he held the soul was supposed to be united to the body not as its form but as its motor For it involves nothing unreasonable that the same movable thing be moved by several motors and still less if it be moved according to its various parts 
7956_245687_000060_000001	train-clean-360	If we suppose however that the soul is united to the body as its form it is quite impossible for several essentially different souls to be in one body 
7956_245687_000060_000002	train-clean-360	This can be made clear by three different reasons 
7956_245687_000061_000000	train-clean-360	In the first place an animal would not be absolutely one in which there were several souls 
none	none	For nothing is absolutely one except by one form by which a thing has existence because a thing has from the same source both existence and unity and therefore things which are denominated by various forms are not absolutely one as for instance a white man If therefore man were living by one form the vegetative soul and animal by another form the sensitive soul and man by another form the intellectual soul it would follow that man is not absolutely one Thus Aristotle argues Metaph viii Did vii six against Plato that if the idea of an animal is distinct from the idea of a biped then a biped animal is not absolutely one For this reason against those who hold that there are several souls in the body he asks De Anima i five what contains them that is what makes them one 
7956_245687_000061_000004	train-clean-360	It cannot be said that they are united by the one body because rather does the soul contain the body and make it one than the reverse 
7956_245687_000062_000000	train-clean-360	Secondly this is proved to be impossible by the manner in which one thing is predicated of another 
none	none	Those things which are derived from various forms are predicated of one another either accidentally if the forms are not ordered to one another as when we say that something white is sweet or essentially in the second manner of essential predication if the forms are ordered one to another the subject belonging to the definition of the predicate as a surface is presupposed to color so that if we say that a body with a surface is colored we have the second manner of essential predication Therefore if we have one form by which a thing is an animal and another form by which it is a man it follows either that one of these two things could not be predicated of the other except accidentally supposing these two forms not to be ordered to one another or that one would be predicated of the other according to the second manner of essential predication if one soul be presupposed to the other 
7956_245687_000062_000002	train-clean-360	But both of these consequences are clearly false because animal is predicated of man essentially and not accidentally and man is not part of the definition of an animal but the other way about Therefore of necessity by the same form a thing is animal and man otherwise man would not really be the thing which is an animal so that animal can be essentially predicated of man 
7956_245687_000063_000000	train-clean-360	Thirdly this is shown to be impossible by the fact that when one operation of the soul is intense it impedes another which could never be the case unless the principle of action were essentially one 
7956_245687_000064_000000	train-clean-360	We must therefore conclude that in man the sensitive soul the intellectual soul and the nutritive soul are numerically one soul This can easily be explained if we consider the differences of species and forms 
7956_245687_000064_000001	train-clean-360	For we observe that the species and forms of things differ from one another as the perfect and imperfect as in the order of things the animate are more perfect than the inanimate and animals more perfect than plants and man than brute animals and in each of these genera there are various degrees 
none	none	For this reason Aristotle Metaph viii Did vii three compares the species of things to numbers which differ in species by the addition or subtraction of unity And De Anima ii three he compares the various souls to the species of figures one of which contains another as a pentagon contains and exceeds a tetragon 
7956_245687_000064_000004	train-clean-360	Thus the intellectual soul contains virtually whatever belongs to the sensitive soul of brute animals and to the nutritive souls of plants 
7956_245687_000064_000005	train-clean-360	Therefore as a surface which is of a pentagonal shape is not tetragonal by one shape and pentagonal by another since a tetragonal shape would be superfluous as contained in the pentagonal so neither is Socrates a man by one soul and animal by another but by one and the same soul he is both animal and man 
none	none	Reply Obj one The sensitive soul is incorruptible not by reason of its being sensitive but by reason of its being intellectual 
7956_245687_000065_000001	train-clean-360	When therefore a soul is sensitive only it is corruptible but when with sensibility it has also intellectuality it is incorruptible 
7956_245687_000065_000002	train-clean-360	For although sensibility does not give incorruptibility yet it cannot deprive intellectuality of its incorruptibility 
none	none	Reply Obj two Not forms but composites are classified either generically or specifically 
7956_245687_000066_000001	train-clean-360	Now man is corruptible like other animals 
7956_245687_000066_000002	train-clean-360	And so the difference of corruptible and incorruptible which is on the part of the forms does not involve a generic difference between man and the other animals 
none	none	Reply Obj three The embryo has first of all a soul which is merely sensitive and when this is removed it is supplanted by a more perfect soul which is both sensitive and intellectual as will be shown further on Q one hundred eighteen A two ad two Reply Obj four We must not consider the diversity of natural things as proceeding from the various logical notions or intentions which flow from our manner of understanding because reason can apprehend one and the same thing in various ways 
7956_245687_000068_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore since as we have said the intellectual soul contains virtually what belongs to the sensitive soul and something more reason can consider separately what belongs to the power of the sensitive soul as something imperfect and material 
none	none	And because it observes that this is something common to man and to other animals it forms thence the notion of the genus while that wherein the intellectual soul exceeds the sensitive soul it takes as formal and perfecting thence it gathers the difference of man FOURTH ARTICLE I Q seventy six Art four Whether in Man There Is Another Form Besides the Intellectual Soul Objection one It would seem that in man there is another form besides the intellectual soul For the Philosopher says De Anima ii one that the soul is the act of a physical body which has life potentially Therefore the soul is to the body as a form of matter But the body has a substantial form by which it is a body Therefore some other substantial form in the body precedes the soul Obj two Further man moves himself as every animal does Now everything that moves itself is divided into two parts of which one moves and the other is moved as the Philosopher proves Phys viii five But the part which moves is the soul Therefore the other part must be such that it can be moved But primary matter cannot be moved Phys v one since it is a being only potentially indeed everything that is moved is a body Therefore in man and in every animal there must be another substantial form by which the body is constituted Obj three Further the order of forms depends on their relation to primary matter for before and after apply by comparison to some beginning Therefore if there were not in man some other substantial form besides the rational soul and if this were to inhere immediately to primary matter it would follow that it ranks among the most imperfect forms which inhere to matter immediately Obj four Further the human body is a mixed body Now mingling does not result from matter alone for then we should have mere corruption Therefore the forms of the elements must remain in a mixed body and these are substantial forms Therefore in the human body there are other substantial forms besides the intellectual soul On the contrary Of one thing there is but one substantial being But the substantial form gives substantial being Therefore of one thing there is but one substantial form But the soul is the substantial form of man Therefore it is impossible for there to be in man another substantial form besides the intellectual soul I answer that If we suppose that the intellectual soul is not united to the body as its form but only as its motor as the Platonists maintain it would necessarily follow that in man there is another substantial form by which the body is established in its being as movable by the soul If however the intellectual soul be united to the body as its substantial form as we have said above A one it is impossible for another substantial form besides the intellectual soul to be found in man In order to make this evident we must consider that the substantial form differs from the accidental form in this that the accidental form does not make a thing to be simply but to be such as heat does not make a thing to be simply but only to be hot Therefore by the coming of the accidental form a thing is not said to be made or generated simply but to be made such or to be in some particular condition and in like manner when an accidental form is removed a thing is said to be corrupted not simply but relatively Now the substantial form gives being simply therefore by its coming a thing is said to be generated simply and by its removal to be corrupted simply For this reason the old natural philosophers who held that primary matter was some actual being for instance fire or air or something of that sort maintained that nothing is generated simply or corrupted simply and stated that every becoming is nothing but an alteration as we read Phys i four Therefore if besides the intellectual soul there pre existed in matter another substantial form by which the subject of the soul were made an actual being it would follow that the soul does not give being simply and consequently that it is not the substantial form and so at the advent of the soul there would not be simple generation nor at its removal simple corruption all of which is clearly false Whence we must conclude that there is no other substantial form in man besides the intellectual soul and that the soul as it virtually contains the sensitive and nutritive souls so does it virtually contain all inferior forms and itself alone does whatever the imperfect forms do in other things The same is to be said of the sensitive soul in brute animals and of the nutritive soul in plants and universally of all more perfect forms with regard to the imperfect Reply Obj one Aristotle does not say that the soul is the act of a body only but the act of a physical organic body which has life potentially and that this potentiality does not reject the soul Whence it is clear that when the soul is called the act the soul itself is included as when we say that heat is the act of what is hot and light of what is lucid not as though lucid and light were two separate things but because a thing is made lucid by the light In like manner the soul is said to be the act of a body et cetera because by the soul it is a body and is organic and has life potentially Yet the first act is said to be in potentiality to the second act which is operation for such a potentiality does not reject that is does not exclude the soul Reply Obj two The soul does not move the body by its essence as the form of the body but by the motive power the act of which presupposes the body to be already actualized by the soul so that the soul by its motive power is the part which moves and the animate body is the part moved Reply Obj three We observe in matter various degrees of perfection as existence living sensing and understanding Now what is added is always more perfect Therefore that form which gives matter only the first degree of perfection is the most imperfect while that form which gives the first second and third degree and so on is the most perfect and yet it inheres to matter immediately Reply Obj four Avicenna held that the substantial forms of the elements remain entire in the mixed body and that the mixture is made by the contrary qualities of the elements being reduced to an average But this is impossible because the various forms of the elements must necessarily be in various parts of matter for the distinction of which we must suppose dimensions without which matter cannot be divisible Now matter subject to dimension is not to be found except in a body But various bodies cannot be in the same place Whence it follows that elements in the mixed body would be distinct as to situation And then there would not be a real mixture which is in respect of the whole but only a mixture apparent to sense by the juxtaposition of particles Averroes maintained that the forms of elements by reason of their imperfection are a medium between accidental and substantial forms and so can be more or less and therefore in the mixture they are modified and reduced to an average so that one form emerges from them But this is even still more impossible For the substantial being of each thing consists in something indivisible and every addition and subtraction varies the species as in numbers as stated in Metaph viii Did vii three and consequently it is impossible for any substantial form to receive more or less Nor is it less impossible for anything to be a medium between substance and accident Therefore we must say in accordance with the Philosopher De Gener i ten that the forms of the elements remain in the mixed body not actually but virtually For the proper qualities of the elements remain though modified and in them is the power of the elementary forms This quality of the mixture is the proper disposition for the substantial form of the mixed body for instance the form of a stone or of any sort of soul FIFTH ARTICLE I Q seventy six Art five Whether the Intellectual Soul Is Properly United to Such a Body Objection one It would seem that the intellectual soul is improperly united to such a body For matter must be proportionate to the form But the intellectual soul is incorruptible Therefore it is not properly united to a corruptible body Obj two Further the intellectual soul is a perfectly immaterial form a proof whereof is its operation in which corporeal matter does not share But the more subtle is the body the less has it of matter Therefore the soul should be united to a most subtle body to fire for instance and not to a mixed body still less to a terrestrial body Obj three Further since the form is the principle of the species one form cannot produce a variety of species But the intellectual soul is one form Therefore it should not be united to a body which is composed of parts belonging to various species Obj four Further what is susceptible of a more perfect form should itself be more perfect But the intellectual soul is the most perfect of souls Therefore since the bodies of other animals are naturally provided with a covering for instance with hair instead of clothes and hoofs instead of shoes and are moreover naturally provided with arms as claws teeth and horns it seems that the intellectual soul should not have been united to a body which is imperfect as being deprived of the above means of protection On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima ii one that the soul is the act of a physical organic body having life potentially I answer that Since the form is not for the matter but rather the matter for the form we must gather from the form the reason why the matter is such as it is and not conversely Now the intellectual soul as we have seen above Q fifty five A two in the order of nature holds the lowest place among intellectual substances inasmuch as it is not naturally gifted with the knowledge of truth as the angels are but has to gather knowledge from individual things by way of the senses as Dionysius says Div Nom vii But nature never fails in necessary things therefore the intellectual soul had to be endowed not only with the power of understanding but also with the power of feeling Now the action of the senses is not performed without a corporeal instrument Therefore it behooved the intellectual soul to be united to a body fitted to be a convenient organ of sense Now all the other senses are based on the sense of touch But the organ of touch requires to be a medium between contraries such as hot and cold wet and dry and the like of which the sense of touch has the perception thus it is in potentiality with regard to contraries and is able to perceive them Therefore the more the organ of touch is reduced to an equable complexion the more sensitive will be the touch But the intellectual soul has the power of sense in all its completeness because what belongs to the inferior nature pre exists more perfectly in the superior as Dionysius says Div Nom v Therefore the body to which the intellectual soul is united should be a mixed body above others reduced to the most equable complexion For this reason among animals man has the best sense of touch And among men those who have the best sense of touch have the best intelligence A sign of which is that we observe those who are refined in body are well endowed in mind as stated in De Anima ii nine Reply Obj one Perhaps someone might attempt to answer this by saying that before sin the human body was incorruptible This answer does not seem sufficient because before sin the human body was immortal not by nature but by a gift of Divine grace otherwise its immortality would not be forfeited through sin as neither was the immortality of the devil Therefore we answer otherwise by observing that in matter two conditions are to be found one which is chosen in order that the matter be suitable to the form the other which follows by force of the first disposition The artisan for instance for the form of the saw chooses iron adapted for cutting through hard material but that the teeth of the saw may become blunt and rusted follows by force of the matter itself So the intellectual soul requires a body of equable complexion which however is corruptible by force of its matter If however it be said that God could avoid this we answer that in the formation of natural things we do not consider what God might do but what is suitable to the nature of things as Augustine says general ad lit ii one God however provided in this case by applying a remedy against death in the gift of grace Reply Obj two A body is not necessary to the intellectual soul by reason of its intellectual operation considered as such but on account of the sensitive power which requires an organ of equable temperament Therefore the intellectual soul had to be united to such a body and not to a simple element or to a mixed body in which fire was in excess because otherwise there could not be an equability of temperament And this body of an equable temperament has a dignity of its own by reason of its being remote from contraries thereby resembling in a way a heavenly body Reply Obj three The parts of an animal for instance the eye hand flesh and bones and so forth do not make the species but the whole does and therefore properly speaking we cannot say that these are of different species but that they are of various dispositions This is suitable to the intellectual soul which although it be one in its essence yet on account of its perfection is manifold in power and therefore for its various operations it requires various dispositions in the parts of the body to which it is united For this reason we observe that there is a greater variety of parts in perfect than in imperfect animals and in these a greater variety than in plants Reply Obj four The intellectual soul as comprehending universals has a power extending to the infinite therefore it cannot be limited by nature to certain fixed natural notions or even to certain fixed means whether of defence or of clothing as is the case with other animals the souls of which are endowed with knowledge and power in regard to fixed particular things Instead of all these man has by nature his reason and his hands which are the organs of organs De Anima iii since by their means man can make for himself instruments of an infinite variety and for any number of purposes SIXTH ARTICLE I Q seventy six Art six Whether the Intellectual Soul Is United to the Body Through the Medium of Accidental Dispositions Objection one It would seem that the intellectual soul is united to the body through the medium of accidental dispositions For every form exists in its proper disposed matter But dispositions to a form are accidents Therefore we must presuppose accidents to be in matter before the substantial form and therefore before the soul since the soul is a substantial form Obj two Further various forms of one species require various parts of matter But various parts of matter are unintelligible without division in measurable quantities Therefore we must suppose dimensions in matter before the substantial forms which are many belonging to one species Obj three Further what is spiritual is connected with what is corporeal by virtual contact But the virtue of the soul is its power Therefore it seems that the soul is united to the body by means of a power which is an accident On the contrary Accident is posterior to substance both in the order of time and in the order of reason as the Philosopher says Metaph vii Did vi one Therefore it is unintelligible that any accidental form exist in matter before the soul which is the substantial form I answer that If the soul were united to the body merely as a motor there would be nothing to prevent the existence of certain dispositions mediating between the soul and the body on the contrary they would be necessary for on the part of the soul would be required the power to move the body and on the part of the body a certain aptitude to be moved by the soul If however the intellectual soul is united to the body as the substantial form as we have already said above A one it is impossible for any accidental disposition to come between the body and the soul or between any substantial form whatever and its matter The reason is because since matter is in potentiality to all manner of acts in a certain order what is absolutely first among the acts must be understood as being first in matter Now the first among all acts is existence Therefore it is impossible for matter to be apprehended as hot or as having quantity before it is actual But matter has actual existence by the substantial form which makes it to exist absolutely as we have said above A four Wherefore it is impossible for any accidental dispositions to pre exist in matter before the substantial form and consequently before the soul Reply Obj one As appears from what has been already said A four the more perfect form virtually contains whatever belongs to the inferior forms therefore while remaining one and the same it perfects matter according to the various degrees of perfection For the same essential form makes man an actual being a body a living being an animal and a man Now it is clear that to every genus follow its own proper accidents Therefore as matter is apprehended as perfected in its existence before it is understood as corporeal and so on so those accidents which belong to existence are understood to exist before corporeity and thus dispositions are understood in matter before the form not as regards all its effects but as regards the subsequent effect Reply Obj two Dimensions of quantity are accidents consequent to the corporeity which belongs to the whole matter Wherefore matter once understood as corporeal and measurable can be understood as distinct in its various parts and as receptive of different forms according to the further degrees of perfection For although it is essentially the same form which gives matter the various degrees of perfection as we have said ad one yet it is considered as different when brought under the observation of reason Reply Obj three A spiritual substance which is united to a body as its motor only is united thereto by power or virtue But the intellectual soul is united by its very being to the body as a form and yet it guides and moves the body by its power and virtue SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q seventy six Art seven Whether the Soul Is United to the Animal Body by Means of a Body Objection one It seems that the soul is united to the animal body by means of a body For Augustine says general ad lit vii nineteen that the soul administers the body by light that is by fire and by air which is most akin to a spirit But fire and air are bodies Therefore the soul is united to the human body by means of a body Obj two Further a link between two things seems to be that thing the removal of which involves the cessation of their union But when breathing ceases the soul is separated from the body Therefore the breath which is a subtle body is the means of union between soul and body Obj three Further things which are very distant from one another are not united except by something between them But the intellectual soul is very distant from the body both because it is incorporeal and because it is incorruptible Therefore it seems to be united to the body by means of an incorruptible body and such would be some heavenly light which would harmonize the elements and unite them together On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima ii one We need not ask if the soul and body are one as neither do we ask if wax and its shape are one But the shape is united to the wax without a body intervening Therefore also the soul is thus united to the body I answer that If the soul according to the Platonists were united to the body merely as a motor it would be right to say that some other bodies must intervene between the soul and body of man or any animal whatever for a motor naturally moves what is distant from it by means of something nearer If however the soul is united to the body as its form as we have said A one it is impossible for it to be united by means of another body The reason of this is that a thing is one according as it is a being Now the form through itself makes a thing to be actual since it is itself essentially an act nor does it give existence by means of something else Wherefore the unity of a thing composed of matter and form is by virtue of the form itself which by reason of its very nature is united to matter as its act Nor is there any other cause of union except the agent which causes matter to be in act as the Philosopher says Metaph viii Did vii six From this it is clear how false are the opinions of those who maintained the existence of some mediate bodies between the soul and body of man Of these certain Platonists said that the intellectual soul has an incorruptible body naturally united to it from which it is never separated and by means of which it is united to the corruptible body of man Others said that the soul is united to the body by means of a corporeal spirit Others said it is united to the body by means of light which they say is a body and of the nature of the fifth essence so that the vegetative soul would be united to the body by means of the light of the sidereal heaven the sensible soul by means of the light of the crystal heaven and the intellectual soul by means of the light of the empyrean heaven Now all this is fictitious and ridiculous for light is not a body and the fifth essence does not enter materially into the composition of a mixed body since it is unchangeable but only virtually and lastly because the soul is immediately united to the body as the form to matter Reply Obj one Augustine speaks there of the soul as it moves the body whence he uses the word administration It is true that it moves the grosser parts of the body by the more subtle parts And the first instrument of the motive power is a kind of spirit as the Philosopher says in De causa motus animalium De mot animal x Reply Obj two The union of soul and body ceases at the cessation of breath not because this is the means of union but because of the removal of that disposition by which the body is disposed for such a union Nevertheless the breath is a means of moving as the first instrument of motion Reply Obj three The soul is indeed very distant from the body if we consider the condition of each separately so that if each had a separate existence many means of connection would have to intervene But inasmuch as the soul is the form of the body it has not an existence apart from the existence of the body but by its own existence is united to the body immediately This is the case with every form which if considered as an act is very distant from matter which is a being only in potentiality EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q seventy six Art eight Whether the Soul Is in Each Part of the Body Objection one It would seem that the whole soul is not in each part of the body for the Philosopher says in De causa motus animalium De mot animal x It is not necessary for the soul to be in each part of the body it suffices that it be in some principle of the body causing the other parts to live for each part has a natural movement of its own Obj two Further the soul is in the body of which it is the act But it is the act of an organic body Therefore it exists only in an organic body But each part of the human body is not an organic body Therefore the whole soul is not in each part Obj three Further the Philosopher says De Anima ii one that the relation of a part of the soul to a part of the body such as the sight to the pupil of the eye is the same as the relation of the soul to the whole body of an animal If therefore the whole soul is in each part of the body it follows that each part of the body is an animal Obj four Further all the powers of the soul are rooted in the essence of the soul If therefore the whole soul be in each part of the body it follows that all the powers of the soul are in each part of the body thus the sight will be in the ear and hearing in the eye and this is absurd Obj five Further if the whole soul is in each part of the body each part of the body is immediately dependent on the soul Thus one part would not depend on another nor would one part be nobler than another which is clearly untrue Therefore the soul is not in each part of the body On the contrary Augustine says De Trin vi six that in each body the whole soul is in the whole body and in each part is entire I answer that As we have said if the soul were united to the body merely as its motor we might say that it is not in each part of the body but only in one part through which it would move the others But since the soul is united to the body as its form it must necessarily be in the whole body and in each part thereof For it is not an accidental form but the substantial form of the body Now the substantial form perfects not only the whole but each part of the whole For since a whole consists of parts a form of the whole which does not give existence to each of the parts of the body is a form consisting in composition and order such as the form of a house and such a form is accidental But the soul is a substantial form and therefore it must be the form and the act not only of the whole but also of each part Therefore on the withdrawal of the soul as we do not speak of an animal or a man unless equivocally as we speak of a painted animal or a stone animal so is it with the hand the eye the flesh and bones as the Philosopher says De Anima ii one A proof of which is that on the withdrawal of the soul no part of the body retains its proper action although that which retains its species retains the action of the species But act is in that which it actuates wherefore the soul must be in the whole body and in each part thereof That it is entire in each part thereof may be concluded from this that since a whole is that which is divided into parts there are three kinds of totality corresponding to three kinds of division There is a whole which is divided into parts of quantity as a whole line or a whole body There is also a whole which is divided into logical and essential parts as a thing defined is divided into the parts of a definition and a composite into matter and form There is further a third kind of whole which is potential divided into virtual parts The first kind of totality does not apply to forms except perhaps accidentally and then only to those forms which have an indifferent relationship to a quantitative whole and its parts as whiteness as far as its essence is concerned is equally disposed to be in the whole surface and in each part of the surface and therefore the surface being divided the whiteness is accidentally divided But a form which requires variety in the parts such as a soul and specially the soul of perfect animals is not equally related to the whole and the parts hence it is not divided accidentally when the whole is divided So therefore quantitative totality cannot be attributed to the soul either essentially or accidentally But the second kind of totality which depends on logical and essential perfection properly and essentially belongs to forms and likewise the virtual totality because a form is the principle of operation Therefore if it be asked whether the whole whiteness is in the whole surface and in each part thereof it is necessary to distinguish If we mean quantitative totality which whiteness has accidentally then the whole whiteness is not in each part of the surface The same is to be said of totality of power since the whiteness which is in the whole surface moves the sight more than the whiteness which is in a small part thereof But if we mean totality of species and essence then the whole whiteness is in each part of a surface Since however the soul has not quantitative totality neither essentially nor accidentally as we have seen it is enough to say that the whole soul is in each part of the body by totality of perfection and of essence but not by totality of power For it is not in each part of the body with regard to each of its powers but with regard to sight it is in the eye and with regard to hearing it is in the ear and so forth We must observe however that since the soul requires variety of parts its relation to the whole is not the same as its relation to the parts for to the whole it is compared primarily and essentially as to its proper and proportionate perfectible but to the parts secondarily inasmuch as they are ordained to the whole Reply Obj one The Philosopher is speaking there of the motive power of the soul Reply Obj two The soul is the act of an organic body as of its primary and proportionate perfectible Reply Obj three An animal is that which is composed of a soul and a whole body which is the soul s primary and proportionate perfectible Thus the soul is not in a part Whence it does not follow that a part of an animal is an animal Reply Obj four Some of the powers of the soul are in it according as it exceeds the entire capacity of the body namely the intellect and the will whence these powers are not said to be in any part of the body Other powers are common to the soul and body wherefore each of these powers need not be wherever the soul is but only in that part of the body which is adapted to the operation of such a power Reply Obj five One part of the body is said to be nobler than another on account of the various powers of which the parts of the body are the organs For that part which is the organ of a nobler power is a nobler part of the body as also is that part which serves the same power in a nobler manner 
7107-245689-0000	train-other-500	QUESTION seventy seven OF THOSE THINGS WHICH BELONG TO THE POWERS OF THE SOUL IN GENERAL In Eight Articles We proceed to consider those things which belong to the powers of the soul
7107-245689-0001	train-other-500	first in general secondly in particular Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry one Whether the essence of the soul is its power two
7107-245689-0002	train-other-500	Whether there is one power of the soul or several three How the powers of the soul are distinguished from one another four Of the orders of the powers one to another
7107-245689-0003	train-other-500	five Whether the powers of the soul are in it as in their subject six Whether the powers flow from the essence of the soul seven
none	none	 Whether one power rises from another eight Whether all the powers of the soul remain in the soul after death FIRST ARTICLE I Q seventy seven Art one Whether the Essence of the Soul Is Its Power Objection one It would seem that the essence of the soul is its power For Augustine says De Trin ix four 
7107-245689-0005	train-other-500	that mind knowledge and love are in the soul substantially or which is the same thing essentially
none	none	 and De Trin x eleven that memory understanding and will are one life one mind one essence Obj two 
7107-245689-0006	train-other-500	Further the soul is nobler than primary matter But primary matter is its own potentiality Much more therefore is the soul its own power
none	none	 Obj three 
7107-245689-0007	train-other-500	Further the substantial form is simpler than the accidental form a sign of which is that the substantial form is not intensified or relaxed but is indivisible But the accidental form is its own power
none	none	 Much more therefore is that substantial form which is the soul Obj four 
7107-245689-0008	train-other-500	Further we sense by the sensitive power and we understand by the intellectual power But that by which we first sense and understand is the soul according to the Philosopher
none	none	 De Anima ii two Therefore the soul is its own power Obj five 
7107-245689-0009	train-other-500	Further whatever does not belong to the essence is an accident Therefore if the power of the soul is something else besides the essence thereof it is an accident which is contrary to Augustine who says that the foregoing
none	none	 see Obj one 
7107-245689-0010	train-other-500	are not in the soul as in a subject as color or shape or any other quality or quantity are in a body for whatever is so does not exceed the subject in which it is
none	none	 Whereas the mind can love and know other things De Trin ix four Obj six Further a simple form cannot be a subject But the soul is a simple form since it is not composed of matter and form as we have said above Q seventy five A five 
7107-245689-0012	train-other-500	Therefore the power of the soul cannot be in it as in a subject
none	none	 Obj seven Further an accident is not the principle of a substantial difference But sensitive and rational are substantial differences and they are taken from sense and reason which are powers of the soul Therefore the powers of the soul are not accidents and so it would seem that the power of the soul is its own essence On the contrary Dionysius Coel Hier xi says that heavenly spirits are divided into essence power and operation Much more then in the soul is the essence distinct from the virtue or power I answer that It is impossible to admit that the power of the soul is its essence although some have maintained it For the present purpose this may be proved in two ways 
7107-245689-0013	train-other-500	First because since power and act divide being and every kind of being we must refer a power and its act to the same genus Therefore if the act be not in the genus of substance
7107-245689-0014	train-other-500	the power directed to that act cannot be in the genus of substance Now the operation of the soul is not in the genus of substance for this belongs to God alone whose operation is His own substance Wherefore
none	none	 the Divine power which is the principle of His operation 
7107-245689-0015	train-other-500	is the Divine Essence itself This cannot be true either of the soul
none	none	 or of any creature as we have said above when speaking of the angels Q fifty four A three Secondly this may be also shown to be impossible in the soul For the soul by its very essence is an act Therefore if the very essence of the soul were the immediate principle of operation 
7107-245689-0016	train-other-500	whatever has a soul would always have actual vital actions as that which has a soul is always an actually living thing For as a form the soul is not an act ordained to a further act
none	none	 but the ultimate term of generation Wherefore for it to be in potentiality to another act does not belong to it according to its essence as a form but according to its power So the soul itself as the subject of its power is called the first act with a further relation to the second act Now we observe that what has a soul is not always actual with respect to its vital operations whence also it is said in the definition of the soul that it is the act of a body having life potentially 
7107-245689-0017	train-other-500	which potentiality however does not exclude the soul Therefore it follows that the essence of the soul is not its power For nothing is in potentiality by reason of an act as act
none	none	 Reply Obj one 
7107-245689-0018	train-other-500	Augustine is speaking of the mind as it knows and loves itself Thus knowledge and love as referred to the soul as known and loved are substantially or essentially in the soul
7107-245689-0019	train-other-500	for the very substance or essence of the soul is known and loved In the same way are we to understand what he says in the other passage that those things are one life one mind one essence Or as some say
7107-245689-0020	train-other-500	this passage is true in the sense in which the potential whole is predicated of its parts being midway between the universal whole and the integral whole For the universal whole is in each part according to its entire essence and power
none	none	 as animal in a man and in a horse and therefore it is properly predicated of each part But the integral whole is not in each part neither according to its whole essence nor according to its whole power 
7107-245689-0021	train-other-500	Therefore in no way can it be predicated of each part yet in a way it is predicated though improperly of all the parts together as if we were to say that the wall roof
7107-245689-0022	train-other-500	and foundations are a house But the potential whole is in each part according to its whole essence not however according to its whole power
7107-245689-0023	train-other-500	Therefore in a way it can be predicated of each part but not so properly as the universal whole In this sense Augustine says that the memory understanding and the will are the one essence of the soul
none	none	 Reply Obj two The act to which primary matter is in potentiality is the substantial form Therefore the potentiality of matter is nothing else but its essence Reply Obj three Action belongs to the composite 
7107-245689-0024	train-other-500	as does existence for to act belongs to what exists Now the composite has substantial existence through the substantial form and it operates by the power which results from the substantial form
7107-245689-0025	train-other-500	Hence an active accidental form is to the substantial form of the agent for instance heat compared to the form of fire as the power of the soul is to the soul
none	none	 Reply Obj four 
7107-245689-0026	train-other-500	That the accidental form is a principle of action is due to the substantial form
none	none	 Therefore the substantial form is the first principle of action 
7107-245689-0027	train-other-500	but not the proximate principle In this sense the Philosopher says that the soul is that whereby we understand and sense
none	none	 Reply Obj five 
7107-245689-0028	train-other-500	If we take accident as meaning what is divided against substance then there can be no medium between substance and accident because they are divided by affirmation and negation that is
7107-245689-0029	train-other-500	according to existence in a subject and non existence in a subject In this sense as the power of the soul is not its essence it must be an accident
none	none	 and it belongs to the second species of accident that of quality But if we take accident as one of the five universals in this sense there is a medium between substance and accident For the substance is all that belongs to the essence of a thing 
7107-245689-0030	train-other-500	whereas whatever is beyond the essence of a thing cannot be called accident in this sense but only what is not caused by the essential principle of the species For the proper does not belong to the essence of a thing
7107-245689-0031	train-other-500	but is caused by the essential principles of the species wherefore it is a medium between the essence and accident thus understood
none	none	 In this sense the powers of the soul may be said to be a medium between substance and accident as being natural properties of the soul 
7107-245689-0032	train-other-500	When Augustine says that knowledge and love are not in the soul as accidents in a subject this must be understood in the sense given above inasmuch as they are compared to the soul not as loving and knowing
7107-245689-0033	train-other-500	but as loved and known His argument proceeds in this sense for if love were in the soul loved as in a subject it would follow that an accident transcends its subject since even other things are loved through the soul
none	none	 Reply Obj six Although the soul is not composed of matter and form yet it has an admixture of potentiality as we have said above Q seventy five A five ad four 
7107-245689-0035	train-other-500	and for this reason it can be the subject of an accident The statement quoted is verified in God Who is the Pure Act
none	none	 in treating of which subject Boethius employs that phrase De Trin i Reply Obj seven 
7107-245689-0036	train-other-500	Rational and sensitive as differences are not taken from the powers of sense and reason but from the sensitive and rational soul itself But because substantial forms which in themselves are unknown to us
7107-245689-0037	train-other-500	are known by their accidents
none	none	 nothing prevents us from sometimes substituting accidents for substantial differences SECOND ARTICLE I Q seventy seven Art two Whether There Are Several Powers of the Soul Objection one It would seem that there are not several powers of the soul For the intellectual soul approaches nearest to the likeness of God But in God there is one simple power and therefore also in the intellectual soul Obj two Further the higher a power is the more unified it is But the intellectual soul excels all other forms in power Therefore above all others it has one virtue or power Obj three Further to operate belongs to what is in act But by the one essence of the soul man has actual existence in the different degrees of perfection as we have seen above Q seventy six AA three four 
7107-245689-0039	train-other-500	Therefore by the one power of the soul he performs operations of various degrees On the contrary The Philosopher places several powers in the soul
none	none	 De Anima ii twenty three 
7107-245689-0040	train-other-500	I answer that Of necessity we must place several powers in the soul To make this evident we observe that as the Philosopher says
none	none	 De Coelo ii twelve 
7107-245689-0041	train-other-500	the lowest order of things cannot acquire perfect goodness but they acquire a certain imperfect goodness by few movements and those which belong to a higher order acquire perfect goodness by many movements
7107-245689-0042	train-other-500	and those yet higher acquire perfect goodness by few movements and the highest perfection is found in those things which acquire perfect goodness without any movement whatever
7107-245689-0043	train-other-500	Thus he is least of all disposed of health who can only acquire imperfect health by means of a few remedies better disposed is he who can acquire perfect health
7107-245689-0044	train-other-500	by means of many remedies and better still he who can by few remedies best of all is he who has perfect health without any remedies
none	none	 We conclude therefore that things which are below man acquire a certain limited goodness and so they have a few determinate operations and powers 
7107-245689-0045	train-other-500	But man can acquire universal and perfect goodness because he can acquire beatitude Yet he is in the last degree according to his nature of those to whom beatitude is possible
7107-245689-0046	train-other-500	therefore the human soul requires many and various operations and powers But to angels a smaller variety of powers is sufficient In God there is no power or action beyond His own Essence
7107-245689-0047	train-other-500	There is yet another reason why the human soul abounds in a variety of powers because it is on the confines of spiritual and corporeal creatures and therefore the powers of both meet together in the soul
none	none	 Reply Obj one 
7107-245689-0048	train-other-500	The intellectual soul approaches to the Divine likeness more than inferior creatures in being able to acquire perfect goodness although by many and various means and in this it falls short
7107-245689-0049	train-other-500	of more perfect creatures
none	none	 Reply Obj two A unified power is superior if it extends to equal things 
7107-245689-0050	train-other-500	but a multiform power is superior to it if it is over many things
none	none	 Reply Obj three 
7107-245689-0051	train-other-500	One thing has one substantial existence
none	none	 but may have several operations So there is one essence of the soul with several powers THIRD ARTICLE I Q seventy seven Art three Whether the Powers Are Distinguished by Their Acts and Objects Objection one It would seem that the powers of the soul are not distinguished by acts and objects 
7107-245689-0052	train-other-500	For nothing is determined to its species by what is subsequent and extrinsic to it But the act is subsequent to the power and the object is extrinsic to it
7107-245689-0053	train-other-500	Therefore the soul s powers are not specifically distinct by acts and objects
none	none	 Obj two 
7107-245689-0054	train-other-500	Further contraries are what differ most from each other Therefore if the powers are distinguished by their objects it follows that the same power could not have contrary objects
7107-245689-0055	train-other-500	This is clearly false in almost all the powers for the power of vision extends to white and black and the power to taste to sweet and bitter
none	none	 Obj three 
7107-245689-0056	train-other-500	Further if the cause be removed the effect is removed Hence if the difference of powers came from the difference of objects the same object would not come under different powers
7107-245689-0057	train-other-500	This is clearly false for the same thing is known by the cognitive power and desired by the appetitive
none	none	 Obj four Further that which of itself is the cause of anything is the cause thereof wherever it is But various objects which belong to various powers 
7107-245689-0058	train-other-500	belong also to some one power as sound and color belong to sight and hearing which are different powers yet they come under the one power of common sense
7107-245689-0059	train-other-500	Therefore the powers are not distinguished according to the difference of their objects On the contrary Things that are subsequent are distinguished by what precedes But the Philosopher says
none	none	 De Anima ii four that acts and operations precede the powers according to reason and these again are preceded by their opposites that is their objects Therefore the powers are distinguished according to their acts and objects 
7107-245689-0060	train-other-500	I answer that A power as such is directed to an act Wherefore we seek to know the nature of a power from the act to which it is directed
7107-245689-0061	train-other-500	and consequently the nature of a power is diversified as the nature of the act is diversified Now the nature of an act is diversified according to the various natures of the objects
none	none	 For every act is either of an active power or of a passive power Now the object is to the act of a passive power as the principle and moving cause for color is the principle of vision inasmuch as it moves the sight On the other hand to the act of an active power the object is a term and end as the object of the power of growth is perfect quantity 
7107-245689-0062	train-other-500	which is the end of growth Now from these two things an act receives its species namely from its principle or from its end or term for the act of heating differs from the act of cooling
none	none	 in this that the former proceeds from something hot which is the active principle to heat the latter from something cold which is the active principle to cold 
7107-245689-0063	train-other-500	Therefore the powers are of necessity distinguished by their acts and objects Nevertheless we must observe that things which are accidental do not change the species
7107-245689-0064	train-other-500	For since to be colored is accidental to an animal its species is not changed by a difference of color but by a difference in that which belongs to the nature of an animal
none	none	 that is to say by a difference in the sensitive soul 
7107-245689-0065	train-other-500	which is sometimes rational and sometimes otherwise Hence rational and irrational are differences dividing animal constituting its various species In like manner therefore
7107-245689-0066	train-other-500	not any variety of objects diversifies the powers of the soul but a difference in that to which the power of its very nature is directed
7107-245689-0067	train-other-500	Thus the senses of their very nature are directed to the passive quality which of itself is divided into color sound and the like and therefore there is one sensitive power with regard to color
7107-245689-0068	train-other-500	namely the sight and another with regard to sound namely hearing But it is accidental to a passive quality for instance to something colored to be a musician or a grammarian
none	none	 great or small a man or a stone Therefore by reason of such differences the powers of the soul are not distinct Reply Obj one 
7107-245689-0069	train-other-500	Act though subsequent in existence to power is nevertheless prior to it in intention and logically as the end is with regard to the agent And the object
none	none	 although extrinsic is nevertheless the principle or end of the action and those conditions which are intrinsic to a thing are proportionate to its principle and end Reply Obj two If any power were to have one of two contraries as such for its object the other contrary would belong to another power 
7107-245689-0070	train-other-500	But the power of the soul does not regard the nature of the contrary as such but rather the common aspect of both contraries as sight does not regard white as such but as color
7107-245689-0071	train-other-500	This is because of two contraries one in a manner includes the idea of the other since they are to one another as perfect and imperfect
none	none	 Reply Obj three 
7107-245689-0072	train-other-500	Nothing prevents things which coincide in subject from being considered under different aspects therefore they can belong to various powers of the soul
none	none	 Reply Obj four 
7107-245689-0073	train-other-500	The higher power of itself regards a more universal formality of the object than the lower power because the higher a power is to a greater number of things does it extend
7107-245689-0074	train-other-500	Therefore many things are combined in the one formality of the object which the higher power considers of itself while they differ in the formalities regarded by the lower powers of themselves
7107-245689-0075	train-other-500	Thus it is that various objects belong to various lower powers which objects however
none	none	 are subject to one higher power FOURTH ARTICLE I Q seventy seven Art four Whether Among the Powers of the Soul There Is Order Objection one It would seem that there is no order among the powers of the soul For in those things which come under one division 
7107-245689-0076	train-other-500	there is no before and after but all are naturally simultaneous But the powers of the soul are contradistinguished from one another Therefore there is no order among them
none	none	 Obj two 
7107-245689-0077	train-other-500	Further the powers of the soul are referred to their objects and to the soul itself On the part of the soul there is not order among them because the soul is one
none	none	 In like manner the objects are various and dissimilar as color and sound Therefore there is no order among the powers of the soul Obj three 
7107-245689-0078	train-other-500	Further where there is order among powers we find that the operation of one depends on the operation of another But the action of one power of the soul does not depend on that of another
none	none	 for sight can act independently of hearing and conversely Therefore there is no order among the powers of the soul On the contrary The Philosopher De Anima ii three compares the parts or powers of the soul to figures But figures have an order among themselves Therefore the powers of the soul have order I answer that Since the soul is one 
7107-245689-0079	train-other-500	and the powers are many and since a number of things that proceed from one must proceed in a certain order there must be some order among the powers of the soul Accordingly we may observe a triple order among them
none	none	 two of which correspond to the dependence of one power on another 
7107-245689-0080	train-other-500	while the third is taken from the order of the objects Now the dependence of one power on another can be taken in two ways according to the order of nature
7107-245689-0081	train-other-500	forasmuch as perfect things are by their nature prior to imperfect things and according to the order of generation and time forasmuch as from being imperfect a thing comes to be perfect
7107-245689-0082	train-other-500	Thus according to the first kind of order among the powers the intellectual powers are prior to the sensitive powers wherefore they direct them and command them
none	none	 Likewise the sensitive powers are prior in this order to the powers of the nutritive soul In the second kind of order it is the other way about 
7107-245689-0083	train-other-500	For the powers of the nutritive soul are prior by way of generation to the powers of the sensitive soul for which therefore they prepare the body The same is to be said of the sensitive powers with regard to the intellectual
7107-245689-0084	train-other-500	But in the third kind of order certain sensitive powers are ordered among themselves namely sight hearing and smelling For the visible naturally comes first
none	none	 since it is common to higher and lower bodies But sound is audible in the air which is naturally prior to the mingling of elements of which smell is the result Reply Obj one 
7107-245689-0085	train-other-500	The species of a given genus are to one another as before and after like numbers and figures if considered in their nature although they may be said to be simultaneous
none	none	 according as they receive the predication of the common genus Reply Obj two 
7107-245689-0086	train-other-500	This order among the powers of the soul is both on the part of the soul which
none	none	 though it be one according to its essence has a certain aptitude to various acts in a certain order and on the part of the objects and furthermore on the part of the acts as we have said above Reply Obj three 
7107-245689-0087	train-other-500	This argument is verified as regards those powers among which
none	none	 order of the third kind exists Those powers among which the two other kinds of order exist are such that the action of one depends on another FIFTH ARTICLE I Q seventy seven Art five Whether All the Powers of the Soul Are in the Soul As Their Subject Objection one 
7107-245689-0088	train-other-500	It would seem that all the powers of the soul are in the soul as their subject For as the powers of the body are to the body so are the powers of the soul to the soul
7107-245689-0089	train-other-500	But the body is the subject of the corporeal powers Therefore the soul is the subject of the powers of the soul
none	none	 Obj two 
7107-245689-0090	train-other-500	Further the operations of the powers of the soul are attributed to the body by reason of the soul
none	none	 because as the Philosopher says De Anima ii two The soul is that by which we sense and understand primarily But the natural principles of the operations of the soul are the powers Therefore the powers are primarily in the soul Obj three Further Augustine says general ad lit xii seven hundred twenty four that the soul senses certain things 
7107-245689-0091	train-other-500	not through the body in fact without the body as fear and such like and some things through the body But if the sensitive powers were not in the soul alone as their subject
7107-245689-0092	train-other-500	the soul could not sense anything without the body Therefore the soul is the subject of the sensitive powers
none	none	 and for a similar reason 
7107-245689-0093	train-other-500	of all the other powers On the contrary
none	none	 The Philosopher says De Somno et Vigilia i that sensation belongs neither to the soul nor to the body but to the composite Therefore the sensitive power is in the composite as its subject Therefore the soul alone is not the subject of all the powers 
7107-245689-0094	train-other-500	I answer that The subject of operative power is that which is able to operate for every accident denominates its proper subject Now the same is that which is able to operate
7107-245689-0095	train-other-500	and that which does operate Wherefore the subject of power is of necessity the subject of operation as again the Philosopher says in the beginning of
none	none	 De Somno et Vigilia Now it is clear from what we have said above Q seventy five AA two three Q seventy six A one ad one that some operations of the soul are performed without a corporeal organ as understanding and will Hence the powers of these operations are in the soul as their subject But some operations of the soul are performed by means of corporeal organs 
7107-245689-0096	train-other-500	as sight by the eye and hearing by the ear And so it is with all the other operations of the nutritive and sensitive parts
7107-245689-0097	train-other-500	Therefore the powers which are the principles of these operations have their subject in the composite and not in the soul alone
none	none	 Reply Obj one 
7107-245689-0098	train-other-500	All the powers are said to belong to the soul not as their subject but as their principle because it is by the soul that the composite has the power to perform such operations
none	none	 Reply Obj two All such powers are primarily in the soul as compared to the composite not as in their subject but as in their principle Reply Obj three 
7107-245689-0099	train-other-500	Plato s opinion was that sensation is an operation proper to the soul just as understanding is Now in many things relating to Philosophy Augustine makes use of the opinions of Plato
7107-245689-0100	train-other-500	not asserting them as true but relating them However as far as the present question is concerned when it is said that the soul senses some things with the body and some without the body
7107-245689-0101	train-other-500	this can be taken in two ways Firstly the words with the body or without the body may determine the act of sense in its mode of proceeding from the sentient
7107-245689-0102	train-other-500	Thus the soul senses nothing without the body because the action of sensation cannot proceed from the soul except by a corporeal organ Secondly
none	none	 they may be understood as determining the act of sense on the part of the object sensed Thus the soul senses some things with the body that is things existing in the body as when it feels a wound or something of that sort while it senses some things without the body that is which do not exist in the body but only in the apprehension of the soul as when it feels sad or joyful on hearing something SIXTH ARTICLE I Q seventy seven Art six Whether the Powers of the Soul Flow from Its Essence Objection one It would seem that the powers of the soul do not flow from its essence For different things do not proceed from one simple thing But the essence of the soul is one and simple 
7107-245689-0103	train-other-500	Since therefore the powers of the soul are many and various they cannot proceed from its essence
none	none	 Obj two Further that from which a thing proceeds is its cause But the essence of the soul cannot be said to be the cause of the powers as is clear if one considers the different kinds of causes Therefore the powers of the soul do not flow from its essence Obj three Further emanation involves some sort of movement But nothing is moved by itself as the Philosopher proves Phys vii twelve except perhaps by reason of a part of itself as an animal is said to be moved by itself because one part thereof moves and another is moved Neither is the soul moved as the Philosopher proves De Anima i four 
7107-245689-0104	train-other-500	Therefore the soul does not produce its powers within itself On the contrary The powers of the soul are its natural properties
none	none	 But the subject is the cause of its proper accidents whence also it is included in the definition of accident as is clear from Metaph vii Did vi four 
7107-245689-0105	train-other-500	Therefore the powers of the soul proceed from its essence as their cause I answer that The substantial and the accidental form partly agree and partly differ
7107-245689-0106	train-other-500	They agree in this that each is an act and that by each of them
none	none	 something is after a manner 
7107-245689-0107	train-other-500	actual They differ however in two respects
none	none	 First because the substantial form makes a thing to exist absolutely 
7107-245689-0108	train-other-500	and its subject is something purely potential But the accidental form does not make a thing to exist absolutely but to be such or so great or in some particular condition
none	none	 for its subject is an actual being Hence it is clear that actuality is observed in the substantial form prior to its being observed in the subject and since that which is first in a genus is the cause in that genus the substantial form causes existence in its subject On the other hand actuality is observed in the subject of the accidental form prior to its being observed in the accidental form 
7107-245689-0109	train-other-500	wherefore the actuality of the accidental form is caused by the actuality of the subject So the subject forasmuch as it is in potentiality is receptive of the accidental form
none	none	 but forasmuch as it is in act it produces it This I say of the proper and per se accident for with regard to the extraneous accident the subject is receptive only 
7107-245689-0110	train-other-500	the accident being caused by an extrinsic agent Secondly substantial and accidental forms differ because
7107-245689-0111	train-other-500	since that which is the less principal exists for the sake of that which is the more principal matter therefore exists on account of the substantial form
none	none	 while on the contrary the accidental form exists on account of the completeness of the subject Now it is clear from what has been said A five that either the subject of the soul s powers is the soul itself alone which can be the subject of an accident forasmuch as it has something of potentiality as we have said above A one ad six 
7107-245689-0113	train-other-500	or else this subject is the composite Now the composite is actual by the soul Whence it is clear that all the powers of the soul whether their subject be the soul alone or the composite
7107-245689-0114	train-other-500	flow from the essence of the soul as from their principle because it has already been said that the accident is caused by the subject according as it is actual and is received into it according as it is in potentiality
none	none	 Reply Obj one From one simple thing many things may proceed naturally 
7107-245689-0115	train-other-500	in a certain order or again if there be diversity of recipients Thus from the one essence of the soul many and various powers proceed both because order exists among these powers
7107-245689-0116	train-other-500	and also by reason of the diversity of the corporeal organs
none	none	 Reply Obj two The subject is both the final cause and in a way the active cause of its proper accident It is also as it were the material cause inasmuch as it is receptive of the accident 
7107-245689-0117	train-other-500	From this we may gather that the essence of the soul is the cause of all its powers
none	none	 as their end 
7107-245689-0118	train-other-500	and as their active principle and of some as receptive thereof
none	none	 Reply Obj three The emanation of proper accidents from their subject is not by way of transmutation but by a certain natural resultance thus one thing results naturally from another as color from light SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q seventy seven Art seven Whether One Power of the Soul Arises from Another Objection one It would seem that one power of the soul does not arise from another For if several things arise together 
7107-245689-0119	train-other-500	one of them does not arise from another But all the powers of the soul are created at the same time with the soul Therefore one of them does not arise from another
none	none	 Obj two Further the power of the soul arises from the soul as an accident from the subject But one power of the soul cannot be the subject of another because nothing is the accident of an accident 
7107-245689-0120	train-other-500	Therefore one power does not arise from another
none	none	 Obj three 
7107-245689-0121	train-other-500	Further one opposite does not arise from the other opposite but everything arises from that which is like it in species Now the powers of the soul are oppositely divided as various species
7107-245689-0122	train-other-500	Therefore one of them does not proceed from another On the contrary Powers are known by their actions But the action of one power is caused by the action of another power
none	none	 as the action of the imagination by the action of the senses Therefore one power of the soul is caused by another I answer that In those things which proceed from one according to a natural order as the first is the cause of all so that which is nearer to the first is in a way the cause of those which are more remote Now it has been shown above A four 
7107-245689-0123	train-other-500	that among the powers of the soul there are several kinds of order Therefore one power of the soul proceeds from the essence of the soul by the medium of another
none	none	 But since the essence of the soul is compared to the powers both as a principle active and final and as a receptive principle either separately by itself or together with the body and since the agent and the end are more perfect while the receptive principle as such is less perfect 
7107-245689-0124	train-other-500	it follows that those powers of the soul which precede the others
none	none	 in the order of perfection and nature 
7107-245689-0125	train-other-500	are the principles of the others after the manner of the end and active principle For we see that the senses are for the sake of the intelligence and not the other way about The senses moreover
7107-245689-0126	train-other-500	are a certain imperfect participation of the intelligence wherefore according to their natural origin they proceed from the intelligence as the imperfect from the perfect But considered as receptive principles
none	none	 the more perfect powers are principles with regard to the others thus the soul according as it has the sensitive power is considered as the subject 
7107-245689-0127	train-other-500	and as something material with regard to the intelligence On this account the more imperfect powers precede the others in the order of generation for the animal is generated before the man
none	none	 Reply Obj one 
7107-245689-0128	train-other-500	As the power of the soul flows from the essence not by a transmutation but by a certain natural resultance and is simultaneous with the soul so is it the case with one power as regards another
none	none	 Reply Obj two 
7107-245689-0129	train-other-500	An accident cannot of itself be the subject of an accident but one accident is received prior to another into substance as quantity prior to quality In this sense
7107-245689-0130	train-other-500	one accident is said to be the subject of another as surface is of color inasmuch as substance receives an accident through the means of another The same thing may be said of the powers of the soul
none	none	 Reply Obj three 
7107-245689-0131	train-other-500	The powers of the soul are opposed to one another as perfect and imperfect as also are the species of numbers and figures But this opposition does not prevent the origin of one from another
none	none	 because imperfect things naturally proceed from perfect things EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q seventy seven Art eight Whether All the Powers Remain in the Soul When Separated from the Body Objection one It would seem that all the powers of the soul remain in the soul separated from the body For we read in the book De Spiritu et Anima that the soul withdraws from the body taking with itself sense and imagination reason and intelligence concupiscibility and irascibility Obj two Further the powers of the soul are its natural properties But properties are always in that to which they belong and are never separated from it Therefore the powers of the soul are in it even after death Obj three 
7107-245689-0132	train-other-500	Further the powers even of the sensitive soul are not weakened when the body becomes weak
none	none	 because as the Philosopher says De Anima i four If an old man were given the eye of a young man he would see even as well as a young man But weakness is the road to corruption 
7107-245689-0133	train-other-500	Therefore the powers of the soul are not corrupted when the body is corrupted but remain in the separated soul
none	none	 Obj four Further memory is a power of the sensitive soul as the Philosopher proves De Memor et Remin 
7107-245689-0134	train-other-500	one But memory remains in the separated soul for it was said to the rich glutton whose soul was in hell Remember that thou didst receive good things during thy lifetime
none	none	 Luke sixteen twenty five Therefore memory remains in the separated soul and consequently the other powers of the sensitive part Obj five 
7107-245689-0135	train-other-500	Further joy and sorrow are in the concupiscible part which is a power of the sensitive soul
7107-245689-0136	train-other-500	But it is clear that separate souls grieve or rejoice at the pains or rewards which they receive Therefore the concupiscible power remains in the separate soul
none	none	 Obj six Further Augustine says general ad lit xii thirty two that as the soul when the body lies senseless yet not quite dead sees some things by imaginary vision so also when by death the soul is quite separate from the body 
7107-245689-0137	train-other-500	But the imagination is a power of the sensitive part Therefore the power of the sensitive part remains in the separate soul and consequently all the other powers On the contrary It is said
none	none	 De Eccl Dogm xix 
7107-245689-0138	train-other-500	that of two substances only does man consist the soul with its reason and the body with its senses Therefore the body being dead
7107-245689-0139	train-other-500	the sensitive powers do not remain I answer that As we have said already
none	none	 AA five six seven 
7107-245689-0140	train-other-500	all the powers of the soul belong to the soul alone as their principle But some powers belong to the soul alone as their subject as the intelligence and the will
7107-245689-0141	train-other-500	These powers must remain in the soul after the destruction of the body But other powers are subjected in the composite
none	none	 as all the powers of the sensitive and nutritive parts Now accidents cannot remain after the destruction of the subject Wherefore the composite being destroyed such powers do not remain actually 
7107-245689-0142	train-other-500	but they remain virtually in the soul as in their principle or root So it is false that as some say these powers remain in the soul even after the corruption of the body
7107-245689-0143	train-other-500	It is much more false that as they say also the acts of these powers remain in the separate soul because these powers have no act apart
none	none	 from the corporeal organ Reply Obj one 
7107-245689-0144	train-other-500	That book has no authority and so what is there written can be despised with the same facility as it was said although we may say that the soul takes with itself these powers
none	none	 not actually but virtually Reply Obj two These powers which we say do not actually remain in the separate soul are not the properties of the soul alone but of the composite Reply Obj three 
7107-245689-0145	train-other-500	These powers are said not to be weakened when the body becomes weak because the soul remains unchangeable and is the virtual principle of these powers
none	none	 Reply Obj four 
7107-245689-0146	train-other-500	The recollection spoken of there is to be taken in the same way as Augustine
none	none	 De Trin x eleven xiv seven 
7107-245689-0147	train-other-500	places memory in the mind not as a part of the sensitive soul

4915-245690-0000	train-other-500	QUESTION seventy eight OF THE SPECIFIC POWERS OF THE SOUL In Four Articles We next treat of the powers of the soul specifically The theologian however has only to inquire specifically concerning the intellectual and appetitive powers
4915-245690-0001	train-other-500	in which the virtues reside And since the knowledge of these powers depends to a certain extent on the other powers our consideration of the powers of the soul taken specifically will be divided into three parts
4915-245690-0002	train-other-500	first we shall consider those powers which are a preamble to the intellect secondly the intellectual powers thirdly the appetitive powers Under the first head there are four points of inquiry
4915-245690-0003	train-other-500	one The powers of the soul considered generally two The various species of the vegetative part three The exterior senses
none	none	 four The interior senses FIRST ARTICLE I Q seventy eight Art one Whether There Are to Be Distinguished Five Genera of Powers in the Soul Objection one It would seem that there are not to be distinguished five genera of powers in the soul namely vegetative sensitive appetitive locomotive and intellectual For the powers of the soul are called its parts 
4915-245690-0004	train-other-500	But only three parts of the soul are commonly assigned namely the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul Therefore there are only three genera of powers in the soul and not five
none	none	 Obj two 
4915-245690-0005	train-other-500	Further the powers of the soul are the principles of its vital operations Now in four ways is a thing said to live For the Philosopher says
none	none	 De Anima ii two 
4915-245690-0006	train-other-500	In several ways a thing is said to live and even if only one of these is present the thing is said to live as intellect and sense local movement and rest and lastly movement of decrease and increase due to nourishment
4915-245690-0007	train-other-500	Therefore there are only four genera of powers of the soul as the appetitive is excluded
none	none	 Obj three 
4915-245690-0008	train-other-500	Further a special kind of soul ought not to be assigned as regards what is common to all the powers Now desire is common to each power of the soul For sight desires an appropriate visible object whence we read
none	none	 Ecclus forty twenty two The eye desireth favor and beauty 
4915-245690-0009	train-other-500	but more than these green sown fields In the same way every other power desires its appropriate object Therefore the appetitive power should not be made a special genus of the powers of the soul
none	none	 Obj four 
4915-245690-0010	train-other-500	Further the moving principle in animals is sense intellect or appetite as the Philosopher says
none	none	 De Anima iii 
4915-245690-0011	train-other-500	ten Therefore the motive power should not be added to the above as a special genus of soul
none	none	 On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima ii three 
4915-245690-0012	train-other-500	The powers are the vegetative the sensitive the appetitive the locomotion and the intellectual I answer that There are five genera of powers of the soul as above numbered
4915-245690-0013	train-other-500	Of these three are called souls and four are called modes of living The reason of this diversity lies in the various souls being distinguished accordingly
none	none	 as the operation of the soul transcends the operation of the corporeal nature in various ways for the whole corporeal nature is subject to the soul 
4915-245690-0014	train-other-500	and is related to it as its matter and instrument
none	none	 There exists therefore an operation of the soul which so far exceeds the corporeal nature that it is not even performed by any corporeal organ 
4915-245690-0015	train-other-500	and such is the operation of the rational soul Below this there is another operation of the soul which is indeed performed
none	none	 through a corporeal organ but not through a corporeal quality 
4915-245690-0016	train-other-500	and this is the operation of the sensitive soul for though hot and cold wet and dry
none	none	 and other such corporeal qualities are required for the work of the senses 
4915-245690-0017	train-other-500	yet they are not required in such a way that the operation of the senses takes place by virtue of such qualities but only for the proper disposition of the organ The lowest of the operations of the soul
none	none	 is that which is performed by a corporeal organ and by virtue of a corporeal quality Yet this transcends the operation of the corporeal nature 
4915-245690-0018	train-other-500	because the movements of bodies are caused by an extrinsic principle while these operations are from an intrinsic principle for this is common to all the operations of the soul since every animate thing in some way moves itself
4915-245690-0019	train-other-500	Such is the operation of the vegetative soul for digestion and what follows is caused instrumentally by the action of heat
none	none	 as the Philosopher says De Anima ii four 
4915-245690-0020	train-other-500	Now the powers of the soul are distinguished generically by their objects For the higher a power is the more universal is the object to which it extends as we have said above
none	none	 Q seventy seven A three 
4915-245690-0021	train-other-500	ad four But the object of the soul s operation may be considered in a triple order For in the soul there is a power the object of which is only the body that is united to that soul
4915-245690-0022	train-other-500	the powers of this genus are called vegetative for the vegetative power acts only on the body to which the soul is united There is another genus in the powers of the soul which genus regards a more universal object
4915-245690-0023	train-other-500	namely every sensible body not only the body to which the soul is united And there is yet another genus in the powers of the soul which genus regards a still more universal object namely not only the sensible body
4915-245690-0024	train-other-500	but all being in universal Wherefore it is evident that the latter two genera of the soul s powers have an operation in regard not merely to that which is united to them but also to something extrinsic
4915-245690-0025	train-other-500	Now since whatever operates must in some way be united to the object about which it operates it follows of necessity that this something extrinsic which is the object of the soul s operation must be related to the soul in a twofold manner
4915-245690-0026	train-other-500	First inasmuch as this something extrinsic has a natural aptitude to be united to the soul and to be by its likeness in the soul In this way there are two kinds of powers namely the sensitive in regard to the less common object
4915-245690-0027	train-other-500	the sensible body and the intellectual in regard to the most common object universal being Secondly forasmuch as the soul itself has an inclination and tendency to the something extrinsic
4915-245690-0028	train-other-500	And in this way there are again two kinds of powers in the soul one the appetitive in respect of which the soul is referred to something extrinsic as to an end which is first in the intention the other the locomotive power
4915-245690-0029	train-other-500	in respect of which the soul is referred to something extrinsic as to the term of its operation and movement for every animal is moved for the purpose of realizing its desires and intentions
4915-245690-0030	train-other-500	The modes of living are distinguished according to the degrees of living things There are some living things in which there exists only vegetative power as the plants There are others in which with the vegetative there exists also the sensitive
4915-245690-0031	train-other-500	but not the locomotive power such as immovable animals as shellfish There are others which besides this have locomotive powers as perfect animals
none	none	 which require many things for their life and consequently movement to seek necessaries of life from a distance 
4915-245690-0032	train-other-500	And there are some living things which with these have intellectual power namely men But the appetitive power does not constitute a degree of living things because wherever there is sense there is also appetite
none	none	 De Anima ii three 
4915-245690-0033	train-other-500	Thus the first two objections are hereby solved
none	none	 Reply Obj three 
4915-245690-0034	train-other-500	The natural appetite is that inclination which each thing has of its own nature for something wherefore by its natural appetite each power desires something suitable to itself But the animal appetite
4915-245690-0035	train-other-500	results from the form apprehended this sort of appetite requires a special power of the soul mere apprehension does not suffice For a thing is desired as it exists in its own nature
4915-245690-0036	train-other-500	whereas in the apprehensive power it exists not according to its own nature but according to its likeness Whence it is clear that sight desires naturally a visible object for the purpose of its act only
4915-245690-0037	train-other-500	namely for the purpose of seeing but the animal by the appetitive power desires the thing seen not merely for the purpose of seeing it but also for other purposes But if the soul did not require things perceived by the senses
4915-245690-0038	train-other-500	except on account of the actions of the senses that is for the purpose of sensing them there would be no need for a special genus of appetitive powers since the natural appetite of the powers would suffice
none	none	 Reply Obj four 
4915-245690-0039	train-other-500	Although sense and appetite are principles of movement in perfect animals yet sense and appetite as such are not sufficient to cause movement unless another power be added to them
4915-245690-0040	train-other-500	for immovable animals have sense and appetite and yet they have not the power of motion Now this motive power is not only in the appetite and sense as commanding the movement but also in the parts of the body
none	none	 to make them obey the appetite of the soul which moves them 
4915-245690-0041	train-other-500	Of this we have a sign in the fact that when the members are deprived of their natural disposition
none	none	 they do not move in obedience to the appetite SECOND ARTICLE I Q seventy eight Art two Whether the Parts of the Vegetative Soul Are Fittingly Described As the Nutritive Augmentative and Generative Objection one It would seem that the parts of the vegetative soul 
4915-245690-0042	train-other-500	are not fittingly described namely the nutritive augmentative and generative For these are called natural forces But the powers of the soul are above the natural forces Therefore we should not class the above forces as powers of the soul
none	none	 Obj two 
4915-245690-0043	train-other-500	Further we should not assign a particular power of the soul to that which is common to living and non living things But generation is common to all things that can be generated and corrupted whether living or not living
4915-245690-0044	train-other-500	Therefore the generative force should not be classed as a power of the soul
none	none	 Obj three 
4915-245690-0045	train-other-500	Further the soul is more powerful than the body But the body by the same force gives species and quantity much more therefore does the soul Therefore the augmentative power of the soul is not distinct from the generative power
none	none	 Obj four 
4915-245690-0046	train-other-500	Further everything is preserved in being by that whereby it exists But the generative power is that whereby a living thing exists Therefore by the same power the living thing is preserved
none	none	 Now the nutritive force is directed to the preservation of the living thing De Anima ii four being a power which is capable of preserving whatever receives it Therefore we should not distinguish the nutritive power from the generative On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima ii twenty four that the operations of this soul are generation the use of food and cf De Anima iii nine growth I answer that The vegetative part has three powers For the vegetative part as we have said A one has for its object the body itself living by the soul for which body a triple operation of the soul is required One is whereby it acquires existence and to this is directed the generative power Another is whereby the living body acquires its due quantity to this is directed the augmentative power Another is whereby the body of a living thing is preserved in its existence and in its due quantity to this is directed the nutritive power We must however observe a difference among these powers The nutritive and the augmentative have their effect where they exist since the body itself united to the soul grows and is preserved by the augmentative and nutritive powers which exist in one and the same soul But the generative power has its effect not in one and the same body but in another for a thing cannot generate itself Therefore the generative power in a way approaches to the dignity of the sensitive soul which has an operation extending to extrinsic things although in a more excellent and more universal manner for that which is highest in an inferior nature approaches to that which is lowest in the higher nature as is made clear by Dionysius Div Nom vii Therefore of these three powers the generative has the greater finality nobility and perfection as the Philosopher says De Anima ii four for it belongs to a thing which is already perfect to produce another like unto itself And the generative power is served by the augmentative and nutritive powers and the augmentative power by the nutritive Reply Obj one Such forces are called natural both because they produce an effect like that of nature which also gives existence quantity and preservation although the above forces accomplish these things in a more perfect way and because those forces perform their actions instrumentally through the active and passive qualities which are the principles of natural actions Reply Obj two Generation of inanimate things is entirely from an extrinsic source whereas the generation of living things is in a higher way through something in the living thing itself which is the semen containing the principle productive of the body Therefore there must be in the living thing a power that prepares this semen and this is the generative power Reply Obj three Since the generation of living things is from a semen it is necessary that in the beginning an animal of small size be generated For this reason it must have a power in the soul whereby it is brought to its appropriate size But the inanimate body is generated from determinate matter by an extrinsic agent therefore it receives at once its nature and its quantity according to the condition of the matter Reply Obj four As we have said above A one the operation of the vegetative principle is performed by means of heat the property of which is to consume humidity Therefore in order to restore the humidity thus lost the nutritive power is required whereby the food is changed into the substance of the body This is also necessary for the action of the augmentative and generative powers THIRD ARTICLE I Q seventy eight Art three Whether the Five Exterior Senses Are Properly Distinguished Objection one It would seem inaccurate to distinguish five exterior senses For sense can know accidents But there are many kinds of accidents Therefore as powers are distinguished by their objects it seems that the senses are multiplied according to the number of the kinds of accidents Obj two Further magnitude and shape and other things which are called common sensibles are not sensibles by accident but are contradistinguished from them by the Philosopher De Anima ii six Now the diversity of objects as such diversifies the powers Since therefore magnitude and shape are further from color than sound is it seems that there is much more need for another sensitive power than can grasp magnitude or shape than for that which grasps color or sound Obj three Further one sense regards one contrariety as sight regards white and black But the sense of touch grasps several contraries such as hot or cold damp or dry and suchlike Therefore it is not a single sense but several Therefore there are more than five senses Obj four Further a species is not divided against its genus But taste is a kind of touch Therefore it should not be classed as a distinct sense of touch On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima iii one There is no other besides the five senses I answer that The reason of the distinction and number of the senses has been assigned by some to the organs in which one or other of the elements preponderate as water air or the like By others it has been assigned to the medium which is either in conjunction or extrinsic and is either water or air or such like Others have ascribed it to the various natures of the sensible qualities according as such quality belongs to a simple body or results from complexity But none of these explanations is apt For the powers are not for the organs but the organs for the powers wherefore there are not various powers for the reason that there are various organs on the contrary for this has nature provided a variety of organs that they might be adapted to various powers In the same way nature provided various mediums for the various senses according to the convenience of the acts of the powers And to be cognizant of the natures of sensible qualities does not pertain to the senses but to the intellect The reason of the number and distinction of the exterior senses must therefore be ascribed to that which belongs to the senses properly and per se Now sense is a passive power and is naturally immuted by the exterior sensible Wherefore the exterior cause of such immutation is what is per se perceived by the sense and according to the diversity of that exterior cause are the sensitive powers diversified Now immutation is of two kinds one natural the other spiritual Natural immutation takes place by the form of the immuter being received according to its natural existence into the thing immuted as heat is received into the thing heated Whereas spiritual immutation takes place by the form of the immuter being received according to a spiritual mode of existence into the thing immuted as the form of color is received into the pupil which does not thereby become colored Now for the operation of the senses a spiritual immutation is required whereby an intention of the sensible form is effected in the sensile organ Otherwise if a natural immutation alone sufficed for the sense s action all natural bodies would feel when they undergo alteration But in some senses we find spiritual immutation only as in sight while in others we find not only spiritual but also a natural immutation either on the part of the object only or likewise on the part of the organ On the part of the object we find natural immutation as to place in sound which is the object of hearing for sound is caused by percussion and commotion of air and we find natural immutation by alteration in odor which is the object of smelling for in order to exhale an odor a body must be in a measure affected by heat On the part of an organ natural immutation takes place in touch and taste for the hand that touches something hot becomes hot while the tongue is moistened by the humidity of the flavored morsel But the organs of smelling and hearing are not affected in their respective operations by any natural immutation unless indirectly Now the sight which is without natural immutation either in its organ or in its object is the most spiritual the most perfect and the most universal of all the senses After this comes the hearing and then the smell which require a natural immutation on the part of the object while local motion is more perfect than and naturally prior to the motion of alteration as the Philosopher proves Phys viii seven Touch and taste are the most material of all of the distinction of which we shall speak later on ad three four Hence it is that the three other senses are not exercised through a medium united to them to obviate any natural immutation in their organ as happens as regards these two senses Reply Obj one Not every accident has in itself a power of immutation but only qualities of the third species which are the principles of alteration therefore only suchlike qualities are the objects of the senses because the senses are affected by the same things whereby inanimate bodies are affected as stated in Phys vii two Reply Obj two Size shape and the like which are called common sensibles are midway between accidental sensibles and proper sensibles which are the objects of the senses For the proper sensibles first and of their very nature affect the senses since they are qualities that cause alteration But the common sensibles are all reducible to quantity As to size and number it is clear that they are species of quantity Shape is a quality about quantity since the notion of shape consists of fixing the bounds of magnitude Movement and rest are sensed according as the subject is affected in one or more ways in the magnitude of the subject or of its local distance as in the movement of growth or of locomotion or again according as it is affected in some sensible qualities as in the movement of alteration and thus to sense movement and rest is in a way to sense one thing and many Now quantity is the proximate subject of the qualities that cause alteration as surface is of color Therefore the common sensibles do not move the senses first and of their own nature but by reason of the sensible quality as the surface by reason of color Yet they are not accidental sensibles for they produce a certain variety in the immutation of the senses For sense is immuted differently by a large and by a small surface since whiteness itself is said to be great or small and therefore it is divided according to its proper subject Reply Obj three As the Philosopher seems to say De Anima ii eleven the sense of touch is generically one but is divided into several specific senses and for this reason it extends to various contrarieties which senses however are not separate from one another in their organ but are spread throughout the whole body so that their distinction is not evident But taste which perceives the sweet and the bitter accompanies touch in the tongue but not in the whole body so it is easily distinguished from touch We might also say that all those contrarieties agree each in some proximate genus and all in a common genus which is the common and formal object of touch Such common genus is however unnamed just as the proximate genus of hot and cold is unnamed Reply Obj four The sense of taste according to a saying of the Philosopher De Anima ii nine is a kind of touch existing in the tongue only It is not distinct from touch in general but only from the species of touch distributed in the body But if touch is one sense only on account of the common formality of its object we must say that taste is distinguished from touch by reason of a different formality of immutation For touch involves a natural and not only a spiritual immutation in its organ by reason of the quality which is its proper object But the organ of taste is not necessarily immuted by a natural immutation by reason of the quality which is its proper object so that the tongue itself becomes sweet and bitter but by reason of a quality which is a preamble to and on which is based the flavor which quality is moisture the object of touch FOURTH ARTICLE I Q seventy eight Art four Whether the Interior Senses Are Suitably Distinguished Objection one It would seem that the interior senses are not suitably distinguished For the common is not divided against the proper Therefore the common sense should not be numbered among the interior sensitive powers in addition to the proper exterior senses Obj two Further there is no need to assign an interior power of apprehension when the proper and exterior sense suffices But the proper and exterior senses suffice for us to judge of sensible things for each sense judges of its proper object In like manner they seem to suffice for the perception of their own actions for since the action of the sense is in a way between the power and its object it seems that sight must be much more able to perceive its own vision as being nearer to it than the color and in like manner with the other senses Therefore for this there is no need to assign an interior power called the common sense Obj three Further according to the Philosopher De Memor et Remin i the imagination and the memory are passions of the first sensitive But passion is not divided against its subject Therefore memory and imagination should not be assigned as powers distinct from the senses Obj four Further the intellect depends on the senses less than any power of the sensitive part But the intellect knows nothing but what it receives from the senses whence we read Poster i eight that those who lack one sense lack one kind of knowledge Therefore much less should we assign to the sensitive part a power which they call the estimative power for the perception of intentions which the sense does not perceive Obj five Further the action of the cogitative power which consists in comparing adding and dividing and the action of the reminiscence which consists in the use of a kind of syllogism for the sake of inquiry is not less distant from the actions of the estimative and memorative powers than the action of the estimative is from the action of the imagination Therefore either we must add the cognitive and reminiscitive to the estimative and memorative powers or the estimative and memorative powers should not be made distinct from the imagination Obj six Further Augustine general ad lit xii six seven twenty four describes three kinds of vision namely corporeal which is the action of the sense spiritual which is an action of the imagination or phantasy and intellectual which is an action of the intellect Therefore there is no interior power between the sense and intellect besides the imagination On the contrary Avicenna De Anima iv one assigns five interior sensitive powers namely common sense phantasy imagination and the estimative and memorative powers I answer that As nature does not fail in necessary things there must needs be as many actions of the sensitive soul as may suffice for the life of a perfect animal If any of these actions cannot be reduced to the same one principle they must be assigned to diverse powers since a power of the soul is nothing else than the proximate principle of the soul s operation Now we must observe that for the life of a perfect animal the animal should apprehend a thing not only at the actual time of sensation but also when it is absent Otherwise since animal motion and action follow apprehension an animal would not be moved to seek something absent the contrary of which we may observe specially in perfect animals which are moved by progression for they are moved towards something apprehended and absent Therefore an animal through the sensitive soul must not only receive the species of sensible things when it is actually affected by them but it must also retain and preserve them Now to receive and retain are in corporeal things reduced to diverse principles for moist things are apt to receive but retain with difficulty while it is the reverse with dry things Wherefore since the sensitive power is the act of a corporeal organ it follows that the power which receives the species of sensible things must be distinct from the power which preserves them Again we must observe that if an animal were moved by pleasing and disagreeable things only as affecting the sense there would be no need to suppose that an animal has a power besides the apprehension of those forms which the senses perceive and in which the animal takes pleasure or from which it shrinks with horror But the animal needs to seek or to avoid certain things not only because they are pleasing or otherwise to the senses but also on account of other advantages and uses or disadvantages just as the sheep runs away when it sees a wolf not on account of its color or shape but as a natural enemy and again a bird gathers together straws not because they are pleasant to the sense but because they are useful for building its nest Animals therefore need to perceive such intentions which the exterior sense does not perceive And some distinct principle is necessary for this since the perception of sensible forms comes by an immutation caused by the sensible which is not the case with the perception of those intentions Thus therefore for the reception of sensible forms the proper sense and the common sense are appointed and of their distinction we shall speak farther on ad one two But for the retention and preservation of these forms the phantasy or imagination is appointed which are the same for phantasy or imagination is as it were a storehouse of forms received through the senses Furthermore for the apprehension of intentions which are not received through the senses the estimative power is appointed and for the preservation thereof the memorative power which is a storehouse of such like intentions A sign of which we have in the fact that the principle of memory in animals is found in some such intention for instance that something is harmful or otherwise And the very formality of the past which memory observes is to be reckoned among these intentions Now we must observe that as to sensible forms there is no difference between man and other animals for they are similarly immuted by the extrinsic sensible But there is a difference as to the above intentions for other animals perceive these intentions only by some natural instinct while man perceives them by means of coalition of ideas Therefore the power by which in other animals is called the natural estimative in man is called the cogitative which by some sort of collation discovers these intentions Wherefore it is also called the particular reason to which medical men assign a certain particular organ namely the middle part of the head for it compares individual intentions just as the intellectual reason compares universal intentions As to the memorative power man has not only memory as other animals have in the sudden recollection of the past but also reminiscence by syllogistically as it were seeking for a recollection of the past by the application of individual intentions Avicenna however assigns between the estimative and the imaginative a fifth power which combines and divides imaginary forms as when from the imaginary form of gold and imaginary form of a mountain we compose the one form of a golden mountain which we have never seen But this operation is not to be found in animals other than man in whom the imaginative power suffices thereto To man also does Averroes attribute this action in his book De sensu et sensibilibus viii So there is no need to assign more than four interior powers of the sensitive part namely the common sense the imagination and the estimative and memorative powers Reply Obj one The interior sense is called common not by predication as if it were a genus but as the common root and principle of the exterior senses Reply Obj two The proper sense judges of the proper sensible by discerning it from other things which come under the same sense for instance by discerning white from black or green But neither sight nor taste can discern white from sweet because what discerns between two things must know both Wherefore the discerning judgment must be assigned to the common sense to which as to a common term all apprehensions of the senses must be referred and by which again all the intentions of the senses are perceived as when someone sees that he sees For this cannot be done by the proper sense which only knows the form of the sensible by which it is immuted in which immutation the action of sight is completed and from immutation follows another in the common sense which perceives the act of vision Reply Obj three As one power arises from the soul by means of another as we have seen above Q seventy seven A seven so also the soul is the subject of one power through another In this way the imagination and the memory are called passions of the first sensitive Reply Obj four Although the operation of the intellect has its origin in the senses yet in the thing apprehended through the senses the intellect knows many things which the senses cannot perceive In like manner does the estimative power though in a less perfect manner Reply Obj five The cogitative and memorative powers in man owe their excellence not to that which is proper to the sensitive part but to a certain affinity and proximity to the universal reason which so to speak overflows into them Therefore they are not distinct powers but the same yet more perfect than in other animals Reply Obj six Augustine calls that vision spiritual which is effected by the images of bodies in the absence of bodies Whence it is clear that it is common to all interior apprehensions

7982_245691_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the intellect is not a power of the soul but the essence of the soul 
7982_245691_000020_000001	train-clean-360	For the intellect seems to be the same as the mind 
none	none	Now the mind is not a power of the soul but the essence for Augustine says De Trin ix two Mind and spirit are not relative things but denominate the essence Therefore the intellect is the essence of the soul Obj two Further different genera of the soul s powers are not united in some one power but only in the essence of the soul Now the appetitive and the intellectual are different genera of the soul s powers as the Philosopher says De Anima ii three but they are united in the mind for Augustine De Trin x eleven places the intelligence and will in the mind 
7982_245691_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the mind and intellect of man is of the very essence of the soul and not a power thereof 
none	none	Obj three Further according to Gregory in a homily for the Ascension xxix in Ev man understands with the angels But angels are called minds and intellects Therefore the mind and intellect of man are not a power of the soul but the soul itself Obj four Further a substance is intellectual by the fact that it is immaterial 
7982_245691_000023_000001	train-clean-360	But the soul is immaterial through its essence 
7982_245691_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore it seems that the soul must be intellectual through its essence 
none	none	On the contrary The Philosopher assigns the intellectual faculty as a power of the soul De Anima ii three I answer that In accordance with what has been already shown Q fifty four A three Q seventy seven A one it is necessary to say that the intellect is a power of the soul and not the very essence of the soul For then alone the essence of that which operates is the immediate principle of operation when operation itself is its being for as power is to operation as its act so is the essence to being But in God alone His action of understanding is His very Being 
7982_245691_000025_000003	train-clean-360	Wherefore in God alone is His intellect His essence while in other intellectual creatures the intellect is a power 
none	none	Reply Obj one Sense is sometimes taken for the power and sometimes for the sensitive soul for the sensitive soul takes its name from its chief power which is sense And in like manner the intellectual soul is sometimes called intellect as from its chief power and thus we read De Anima i four that the intellect is a substance And in this sense also Augustine says that the mind is spirit and essence De Trin ix two xiv sixteen Reply Obj two The appetitive and intellectual powers are different genera of powers in the soul by reason of the different formalities of their objects But the appetitive power agrees partly with the intellectual power and partly with the sensitive in its mode of operation either through a corporeal organ or without it for appetite follows apprehension And in this way Augustine puts the will in the mind and the Philosopher in the reason De Anima iii nine Reply Obj three In the angels there is no other power besides the intellect and the will which follows the intellect

none	none	Reply Obj four The immateriality of the created intelligent substance is not its intellect and through its immateriality it has the power of intelligence Wherefore it follows not that the intellect is the substance of the soul but that it is its virtue and power SECOND ARTICLE I Q seventy nine Art two 
7982_245691_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Whether the Intellect Is a Passive Power 
none	none	Objection one It would seem that the intellect is not a passive power For everything is passive by its matter and acts by its form 
7982_245691_000032_000001	train-clean-360	But the intellectual power results from the immateriality of the intelligent substance 
7982_245691_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore it seems that the intellect is not a passive power 
none	none	Obj two Further the intellectual power is incorruptible as we have said above Q seventy nine A six But if the intellect is passive it is corruptible De Anima iii five 
7982_245691_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the intellectual power is not passive 
none	none	Obj three Further the agent is nobler than the patient as Augustine general ad lit xii sixteen and Aristotle De Anima iii five says 
7982_245691_000034_000002	train-clean-360	But all the powers of the vegetative part are active yet they are the lowest among the powers of the soul 
7982_245691_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Much more therefore all the intellectual powers which are the highest are active 
none	none	On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima iii four that to understand is in a way to be passive I answer that To be passive may be taken in three ways 
7982_245691_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Firstly in its most strict sense when from a thing is taken something which belongs to it by virtue either of its nature or of its proper inclination as when water loses coolness by heating and as when a man becomes ill or sad 
7982_245691_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Secondly less strictly a thing is said to be passive when something whether suitable or unsuitable is taken away from it 
none	none	And in this way not only he who is ill is said to be passive but also he who is healed not only he that is sad but also he that is joyful or whatever way he be altered or moved 
7982_245691_000036_000004	train-clean-360	Thirdly in a wide sense a thing is said to be passive from the very fact that what is in potentiality to something receives that to which it was in potentiality without being deprived of anything 
7982_245691_000036_000005	train-clean-360	And accordingly whatever passes from potentiality to act may be said to be passive even when it is perfected 
7982_245691_000036_000006	train-clean-360	And thus with us to understand is to be passive 
7982_245691_000036_000007	train-clean-360	This is clear from the following reason 
none	none	For the intellect as we have seen above Q seventy eight A one has an operation extending to universal being 
7982_245691_000036_000009	train-clean-360	We may therefore see whether the intellect be in act or potentiality by observing first of all the nature of the relation of the intellect to universal being 
7982_245691_000036_000010	train-clean-360	For we find an intellect whose relation to universal being is that of the act of all being and such is the Divine intellect which is the Essence of God in which originally and virtually all being pre exists as in its first cause 
7982_245691_000036_000011	train-clean-360	And therefore the Divine intellect is not in potentiality but is pure act 
7982_245691_000036_000012	train-clean-360	But no created intellect can be an act in relation to the whole universal being otherwise it would needs be an infinite being 
7982_245691_000036_000013	train-clean-360	Wherefore every created intellect is not the act of all things intelligible by reason of its very existence but is compared to these intelligible things as a potentiality to act 
7982_245691_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Now potentiality has a double relation to act 
none	none	There is a potentiality which is always perfected by its act as the matter of the heavenly bodies Q fifty eight A one 
7982_245691_000037_000003	train-clean-360	And there is another potentiality which is not always in act but proceeds from potentiality to act as we observe in things that are corrupted and generated 
7982_245691_000037_000004	train-clean-360	Wherefore the angelic intellect is always in act as regards those things which it can understand by reason of its proximity to the first intellect which is pure act as we have said above 
none	none	But the human intellect which is the lowest in the order of intelligence and most remote from the perfection of the Divine intellect is in potentiality with regard to things intelligible and is at first like a clean tablet on which nothing is written as the Philosopher says De Anima iii four 
7982_245691_000037_000006	train-clean-360	This is made clear from the fact that at first we are only in potentiality to understand and afterwards we are made to understand actually 
none	none	And so it is evident that with us to understand is in a way to be passive taking passion in the third sense 
7982_245691_000037_000008	train-clean-360	And consequently the intellect is a passive power 
none	none	Reply Obj one This objection is verified of passion in the first and second senses which belong to primary matter 
7982_245691_000038_000001	train-clean-360	But in the third sense passion is in anything which is reduced from potentiality to act 
none	none	Reply Obj two Passive intellect is the name given by some to the sensitive appetite in which are the passions of the soul which appetite is also called rational by participation because it obeys the reason Ethic i thirteen Others give the name of passive intellect to the cogitative power which is called the particular reason And in each case passive may be taken in the two first senses forasmuch as this so called intellect is the act of a corporeal organ But the intellect which is in potentiality to things intelligible and which for this reason Aristotle calls the possible intellect De Anima iii four is not passive except in the third sense for it is not an act of a corporeal organ 
7982_245691_000039_000004	train-clean-360	Hence it is incorruptible 
none	none	Reply Obj three The agent is nobler than the patient if the action and the passion are referred to the same thing but not always if they refer to different things 
7982_245691_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Now the intellect is a passive power in regard to the whole universal being while the vegetative power is active in regard to some particular thing namely the body as united to the soul 
none	none	Wherefore nothing prevents such a passive force being nobler than such an active one THIRD ARTICLE I Q seventy nine Art three Whether There Is an Active Intellect 
7982_245691_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that there is no active intellect 
7982_245691_000043_000001	train-clean-360	For as the senses are to things sensible so is our intellect to things intelligible 
7982_245691_000043_000002	train-clean-360	But because sense is in potentiality to things sensible the sense is not said to be active but only passive 
7982_245691_000043_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore since our intellect is in potentiality to things intelligible it seems that we cannot say that the intellect is active but only that it is passive 
none	none	Obj two Further if we say that also in the senses there is something active such as light on the contrary light is required for sight inasmuch as it makes the medium to be actually luminous for color of its own nature moves the luminous medium 
7982_245691_000044_000001	train-clean-360	But in the operation of the intellect there is no appointed medium that has to be brought into act 
7982_245691_000044_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore there is no necessity for an active intellect 
none	none	Obj three Further the likeness of the agent is received into the patient according to the nature of the patient 
7982_245691_000045_000001	train-clean-360	But the passive intellect is an immaterial power 
none	none	Therefore its immaterial nature suffices for forms to be received into it immaterially 
7982_245691_000045_000003	train-clean-360	Now a form is intelligible in act from the very fact that it is immaterial Therefore there is no need for an active intellect to make the species actually intelligible 
none	none	On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima iii five As in every nature so in the soul is there something by which it becomes all things and something by which it makes all things Therefore we must admit an active intellect I answer that According to the opinion of Plato there is no need for an active intellect in order to make things actually intelligible but perhaps in order to provide intellectual light to the intellect as will be explained farther on A four 
7982_245691_000047_000001	train-clean-360	For Plato supposed that the forms of natural things subsisted apart from matter and consequently that they are intelligible since a thing is actually intelligible from the very fact that it is immaterial 
none	none	And he called such forms species or ideas from a participation of which he said that even corporeal matter was formed in order that individuals might be naturally established in their proper genera and species and that our intellect was formed by such participation in order to have knowledge of the genera and species of things 
7982_245691_000047_000003	train-clean-360	But since Aristotle did not allow that forms of natural things exist apart from matter and as forms existing in matter are not actually intelligible it follows that the natures or forms of the sensible things which we understand are not actually intelligible 
7982_245691_000047_000004	train-clean-360	Now nothing is reduced from potentiality to act except by something in act as the senses as made actual by what is actually sensible 
7982_245691_000047_000005	train-clean-360	We must therefore assign on the part of the intellect some power to make things actually intelligible by abstraction of the species from material conditions 
none	none	And such is the necessity for an active intellect Reply Obj one Sensible things are found in act outside the soul and hence there is no need for an active sense 
7982_245691_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Wherefore it is clear that in the nutritive part all the powers are active whereas in the sensitive part all are passive but in the intellectual part there is something active and something passive 
none	none	Reply Obj two There are two opinions as to the effect of light 
7982_245691_000049_000001	train-clean-360	For some say that light is required for sight in order to make colors actually visible 
7982_245691_000049_000002	train-clean-360	And according to this the active intellect is required for understanding in like manner and for the same reason as light is required for seeing 
none	none	But in the opinion of others light is required for sight not for the colors to become actually visible but in order that the medium may become actually luminous as the Commentator says on De Anima ii And according to this Aristotle s comparison of the active intellect to light is verified in this that as it is required for understanding so is light required for seeing but not for the same reason Reply Obj three If the agent pre exist it may well happen that its likeness is received variously into various things on account of their dispositions 
7982_245691_000050_000001	train-clean-360	But if the agent does not pre exist the disposition of the recipient has nothing to do with the matter 
7982_245691_000050_000002	train-clean-360	Now the intelligible in act is not something existing in nature if we consider the nature of things sensible which do not subsist apart from matter 
none	none	And therefore in order to understand them the immaterial nature of the passive intellect would not suffice but for the presence of the active intellect which makes things actually intelligible by way of abstraction FOURTH ARTICLE I Q seventy nine Art four 
7982_245691_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Whether the Active Intellect Is Something in the Soul 
7982_245691_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the active intellect is not something in the soul 
7982_245691_000053_000001	train-clean-360	For the effect of the active intellect is to give light for the purpose of understanding 
none	none	But this is done by something higher than the soul according to John one nine He was the true light that enlighteneth every man coming into this world Therefore the active intellect is not something in the soul Obj two Further the Philosopher De Anima iii five says of the active intellect that it does not sometimes understand and sometimes not understand But our soul does not always understand sometimes it understands sometimes it does not understand 
7982_245691_000055_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the active intellect is not something in our soul 
7982_245691_000057_000004	train-clean-360	Therefore the active intellect is not something in our soul 
none	none	Obj three Further agent and patient suffice for action 
7982_245691_000055_000001	train-clean-360	If therefore the passive intellect which is a passive power is something belonging to the soul and also the active intellect which is an active power it follows that a man would always be able to understand when he wished which is clearly false 
none	none	Therefore the active intellect is not something in our soul Obj four Further the Philosopher De Anima iii five says that the active intellect is a substance in actual being But nothing can be in potentiality and in act with regard to the same thing 
7982_245691_000056_000001	train-clean-360	If therefore the passive intellect which is in potentiality to all things intelligible is something in the soul it seems impossible for the active intellect to be also something in our soul 
none	none	Obj five Further if the active intellect is something in the soul it must be a power 
7982_245691_000057_000001	train-clean-360	For it is neither a passion nor a habit since habits and passions are not in the nature of agents in regard to the passivity of the soul but rather passion is the very action of the passive power while habit is something which results from acts 
7982_245691_000057_000002	train-clean-360	But every power flows from the essence of the soul 
7982_245691_000057_000003	train-clean-360	It would therefore follow that the active intellect flows from the essence of the soul And thus it would not be in the soul by way of participation from some higher intellect which is unfitting 
none	none	Therefore the active intellect is not something in our soul On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima iii five that it is necessary for these differences namely the passive and active intellect to be in the soul I answer that The active intellect of which the Philosopher speaks is something in the soul 
7982_245691_000059_000001	train-clean-360	In order to make this evident we must observe that above the intellectual soul of man we must needs suppose a superior intellect from which the soul acquires the power of understanding 
7982_245691_000059_000002	train-clean-360	For what is such by participation and what is mobile and what is imperfect always requires the pre existence of something essentially such immovable and perfect 
7982_245691_000059_000003	train-clean-360	Now the human soul is called intellectual by reason of a participation in intellectual power a sign of which is that it is not wholly intellectual but only in part 
none	none	Moreover it reaches to the understanding of truth by arguing with a certain amount of reasoning and movement 
7982_245691_000059_000005	train-clean-360	Again it has an imperfect understanding both because it does not understand everything and because in those things which it does understand it passes from potentiality to act 
7982_245691_000059_000006	train-clean-360	Therefore there must needs be some higher intellect by which the soul is helped to understand 
7982_245691_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Wherefore some held that this intellect substantially separate is the active intellect which by lighting up the phantasms as it were makes them to be actually intelligible 
7982_245691_000060_000001	train-clean-360	But even supposing the existence of such a separate active intellect it would still be necessary to assign to the human soul some power participating in that superior intellect by which power the human soul makes things actually intelligible 
7982_245691_000060_000002	train-clean-360	Just as in other perfect natural things besides the universal active causes each one is endowed with its proper powers derived from those universal causes for the sun alone does not generate man but in man is the power of begetting man and in like manner with other perfect animals 
none	none	Now among these lower things nothing is more perfect than the human soul 
7982_245691_000060_000004	train-clean-360	Wherefore we must say that in the soul is some power derived from a higher intellect whereby it is able to light up the phantasms 
7982_245691_000060_000005	train-clean-360	And we know this by experience since we perceive that we abstract universal forms from their particular conditions which is to make them actually intelligible 
none	none	Now no action belongs to anything except through some principle formally inherent therein as we have said above of the passive intellect Q seventy six A one 
7982_245691_000060_000007	train-clean-360	Therefore the power which is the principle of this action must be something in the soul 
none	none	For this reason Aristotle De Anima iii five compared the active intellect to light which is something received into the air while Plato compared the separate intellect impressing the soul to the sun as Themistius says in his commentary on De Anima iii But the separate intellect according to the teaching of our faith is God Himself Who is the soul s Creator and only beatitude as will be shown later on Q ninety A three I II Q three A seven Wherefore the human soul derives its intellectual light from Him according to Ps four seven The light of Thy countenance O Lord is signed upon us Reply Obj one That true light enlightens as a universal cause from which the human soul derives a particular power as we have explained Reply Obj two The Philosopher says those words not of the active intellect but of the intellect in act of which he had already said Knowledge in act is the same as the thing Or if we refer those words to the active intellect then they are said because it is not owing to the active intellect that sometimes we do and sometimes we do not understand but to the intellect which is in potentiality Reply Obj three If the relation of the active intellect to the passive were that of the active object to a power as for instance of the visible in act to the sight it would follow that we could understand all things instantly since the active intellect is that which makes all things in act But now the active intellect is not an object rather is it that whereby the objects are made to be in act for which besides the presence of the active intellect we require the presence of phantasms the good disposition of the sensitive powers and practice in this sort of operation since through one thing understood other things come to be understood as from terms are made propositions and from first principles conclusions 
7982_245691_000063_000002	train-clean-360	From this point of view it matters not whether the active intellect is something belonging to the soul or something separate from the soul 
none	none	Reply Obj four The intellectual soul is indeed actually immaterial but it is in potentiality to determinate species 
7982_245691_000064_000001	train-clean-360	On the contrary phantasms are actual images of certain species but are immaterial in potentiality 
none	none	Wherefore nothing prevents one and the same soul inasmuch as it is actually immaterial having one power by which it makes things actually immaterial by abstraction from the conditions of individual matter which power is called the active intellect and another power receptive of such species which is called the passive intellect by reason of its being in potentiality to such species Reply Obj five Since the essence of the soul is immaterial created by the supreme intellect nothing prevents that power which it derives from the supreme intellect and whereby it abstracts from matter flowing from the essence of the soul in the same way as its other powers FIFTH ARTICLE I Q seventy nine Art five Whether the Active Intellect Is One in All 
7982_245691_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that there is one active intellect in all For what is separate from the body is not multiplied according to the number of bodies 
none	none	But the active intellect is separate as the Philosopher says De Anima iii five 
7982_245691_000068_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore it is not multiplied in the many human bodies but is one for all men 
none	none	Obj two Further the active intellect is the cause of the universal which is one in many 
7982_245691_000069_000001	train-clean-360	But that which is the cause of unity is still more itself one 
7982_245691_000069_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the active intellect is the same in all 
none	none	Obj three Further all men agree in the first intellectual concepts But to these they assent by the active intellect Therefore all agree in one active intellect On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima iii five that the active intellect is as a light But light is not the same in the various things enlightened 
7982_245691_000071_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the same active intellect is not in various men 
none	none	I answer that The truth about this question depends on what we have already said A four 
7982_245691_000072_000001	train-clean-360	For if the active intellect were not something belonging to the soul but were some separate substance there would be one active intellect for all men 
7982_245691_000072_000002	train-clean-360	And this is what they mean who hold that there is one active intellect for all 
none	none	But if the active intellect is something belonging to the soul as one of its powers we are bound to say that there are as many active intellects as there are souls which are multiplied according to the number of men as we have said above Q seventy six A two For it is impossible that one same power belong to various substances Reply Obj one The Philosopher proves that the active intellect is separate by the fact that the passive intellect is separate because as he says De Anima iii five the agent is more noble than the patient Now the passive intellect is said to be separate because it is not the act of any corporeal organ 
7982_245691_000073_000001	train-clean-360	And in the same sense the active intellect is also called separate but not as a separate substance 
none	none	Reply Obj two The active intellect is the cause of the universal by abstracting it from matter 
7982_245691_000074_000001	train-clean-360	But for this purpose it need not be the same intellect in all intelligent beings but it must be one in its relationship to all those things from which it abstracts the universal with respect to which things the universal is one 
7982_245691_000074_000002	train-clean-360	And this befits the active intellect inasmuch as it is immaterial 
none	none	Reply Obj three All things which are of one species enjoy in common the action which accompanies the nature of the species and consequently the power which is the principle of such action but not so as that power be identical in all 
7982_245691_000075_000001	train-clean-360	Now to know the first intelligible principles is the action belonging to the human species 
7982_245691_000075_000002	train-clean-360	Wherefore all men enjoy in common the power which is the principle of this action and this power is the active intellect 
7982_245691_000075_000003	train-clean-360	But there is no need for it to be identical in all 
7982_245691_000075_000004	train-clean-360	Yet it must be derived by all from one principle 
none	none	And thus the possession by all men in common of the first principles proves the unity of the separate intellect which Plato compares to the sun but not the unity of the active intellect which Aristotle compares to light SIXTH ARTICLE I Q seventy nine Art six 
7982_245691_000077_000000	train-clean-360	Whether Memory Is in the Intellectual Part of the Soul 
7982_245691_000078_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that memory is not in the intellectual part of the soul 
none	none	For Augustine says De Trin xii two hundred thirty eight that to the higher part of the soul belongs those things which are not common to man and beast But memory is common to man and beast for he says De Trin xii two three eight that beasts can sense corporeal things through the senses of the body and commit them to memory Therefore memory does not belong to the intellectual part of the soul Obj two Further memory is of the past 
7982_245691_000079_000001	train-clean-360	But the past is said of something with regard to a fixed time 
7982_245691_000079_000002	train-clean-360	Memory therefore knows a thing under a condition of a fixed time which involves knowledge under the conditions of here and now But this is not the province of the intellect but of the sense 
7982_245691_000079_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore memory is not in the intellectual part but only in the sensitive 
none	none	Obj three Further in the memory are preserved the species of those things of which we are not actually thinking 
7982_245691_000080_000001	train-clean-360	But this cannot happen in the intellect because the intellect is reduced to act by the fact that the intelligible species are received into it 
none	none	Now the intellect in act implies understanding in act and therefore the intellect actually understands all things of which it has the species Therefore the memory is not in the intellectual part On the contrary Augustine says De Trin x eleven that memory understanding and will are one mind I answer that Since it is of the nature of the memory to preserve the species of those things which are not actually apprehended we must first of all consider whether the intelligible species can thus be preserved in the intellect because Avicenna held that this was impossible 
7982_245691_000082_000001	train-clean-360	For he admitted that this could happen in the sensitive part as to some powers inasmuch as they are acts of corporeal organs in which certain species may be preserved apart from actual apprehension 
7982_245691_000082_000002	train-clean-360	But in the intellect which has no corporeal organ nothing but what is intelligible exists 
none	none	Wherefore every thing of which the likeness exists in the intellect must be actually understood 
7982_245691_000082_000004	train-clean-360	Thus therefore according to him as soon as we cease to understand something actually the species of that thing ceases to be in our intellect and if we wish to understand that thing anew we must turn to the active intellect which he held to be a separate substance in order that the intelligible species may thence flow again into our passive intellect 
7982_245691_000082_000005	train-clean-360	And from the practice and habit of turning to the active intellect there is formed according to him a certain aptitude in the passive intellect for turning to the active intellect which aptitude he calls the habit of knowledge 
7982_245691_000082_000006	train-clean-360	According therefore to this supposition nothing is preserved in the intellectual part that is not actually understood wherefore it would not be possible to admit memory in the intellectual part 
none	none	But this opinion is clearly opposed to the teaching of Aristotle For he says De Anima iii four that when the passive intellect is identified with each thing as knowing it it is said to be in act and that this happens when it can operate of itself 
7982_245691_000083_000001	train-clean-360	And even then it is in potentiality but not in the same way as before learning and discovering Now the passive intellect is said to be each thing inasmuch as it receives the intelligible species of each thing 
7982_245691_000083_000002	train-clean-360	To the fact therefore that it receives the species of intelligible things it owes its being able to operate when it wills but not so that it be always operating for even then is it in potentiality in a certain sense though otherwise than before the act of understanding namely in the sense that whoever has habitual knowledge is in potentiality to actual consideration 
7982_245691_000084_000000	train-clean-360	The foregoing opinion is also opposed to reason 
none	none	For what is received into something is received according to the conditions of the recipient 
7982_245691_000084_000002	train-clean-360	But the intellect is of a more stable nature and is more immovable than corporeal nature 
7982_245691_000084_000003	train-clean-360	If therefore corporeal matter holds the forms which it receives not only while it actually does something through them but also after ceasing to act through them much more cogent reason is there for the intellect to receive the species unchangeably and lastingly whether it receive them from things sensible or derive them from some superior intellect 
7982_245691_000084_000004	train-clean-360	Thus therefore if we take memory only for the power of retaining species we must say that it is in the intellectual part 
7982_245691_000084_000005	train-clean-360	But if in the notion of memory we include its object as something past then the memory is not in the intellectual but only in the sensitive part which apprehends individual things 
7982_245691_000084_000006	train-clean-360	For past as past since it signifies being under a condition of fixed time is something individual 
none	none	Reply Obj one Memory if considered as retentive of species is not common to us and other animals 
7982_245691_000085_000001	train-clean-360	For species are not retained in the sensitive part of the soul only but rather in the body and soul united since the memorative power is the act of some organ 
7982_245691_000085_000002	train-clean-360	But the intellect in itself is retentive of species without the association of any corporeal organ 
7326-245693-0049	train-other-500	Wherefore the Philosopher says
none	none	 De Anima iii four that the soul is the seat of the species not the whole soul but the intellect Reply Obj two The condition of past may be referred to two things namely to the object which is known and to the act of knowledge 
7982_245691_000086_000001	train-clean-360	These two are found together in the sensitive part which apprehends something from the fact of its being immuted by a present sensible wherefore at the same time an animal remembers to have sensed before in the past and to have sensed some past sensible thing 
7982_245691_000086_000002	train-clean-360	But as concerns the intellectual part the past is accidental and is not in itself a part of the object of the intellect 
7982_245691_000086_000003	train-clean-360	For the intellect understands man as man and to man as man it is accidental that he exist in the present past or future 
7982_245691_000086_000004	train-clean-360	But on the part of the act the condition of past even as such may be understood to be in the intellect as well as in the senses 
none	none	Because our soul s act of understanding is an individual act existing in this or that time inasmuch as a man is said to understand now or yesterday or tomorrow And this is not incompatible with the intellectual nature for such an act of understanding though something individual is yet an immaterial act as we have said above of the intellect Q seventy six A one and therefore as the intellect understands itself though it be itself an individual intellect so also it understands its act of understanding which is an individual act in the past present or future 
7982_245691_000086_000008	train-clean-360	In this way then the notion of memory in as far as it regards past events is preserved in the intellect forasmuch as it understands that it previously understood but not in the sense that it understands the past as something here and now 
none	none	Reply Obj three The intelligible species is sometimes in the intellect only in potentiality and then the intellect is said to be in potentiality 
7982_245691_000087_000001	train-clean-360	Sometimes the intelligible species is in the intellect as regards the ultimate completion of the act and then it understands in act 
7982_245691_000087_000002	train-clean-360	And sometimes the intelligible species is in a middle state between potentiality and act and then we have habitual knowledge 
none	none	In this way the intellect retains the species even when it does not understand in act SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q seventy nine Art seven Whether the Intellectual Memory Is a Power Distinct from the Intellect Objection one It would seem that the intellectual memory is distinct from the intellect For Augustine De Trin x eleven assigns to the soul memory understanding and will But it is clear that the memory is a distinct power from the will Therefore it is also distinct from the intellect Obj two Further the reason of distinction among the powers in the sensitive part is the same as in the intellectual part But memory in the sensitive part is distinct from sense as we have said Q seventy eight A four Therefore memory in the intellectual part is distinct from the intellect Obj three Further according to Augustine De Trin x eleven xi seven memory understanding and will are equal to one another and one flows from the other But this could not be if memory and intellect were the same power Therefore they are not the same power On the contrary From its nature the memory is the treasury or storehouse of species But the Philosopher De Anima iii attributes this to the intellect as we have said A six ad one Therefore the memory is not another power from the intellect I answer that As has been said above Q seventy seven A three the powers of the soul are distinguished by the different formal aspects of their objects since each power is defined in reference to that thing to which it is directed and which is its object It has also been said above Q fifty nine A four that if any power by its nature be directed to an object according to the common ratio of the object that power will not be differentiated according to the individual differences of that object just as the power of sight which regards its object under the common ratio of color is not differentiated by differences of black and white Now the intellect regards its object under the common ratio of being since the passive intellect is that in which all are in potentiality Wherefore the passive intellect is not differentiated by any difference of being Nevertheless there is a distinction between the power of the active intellect and of the passive intellect because as regards the same object the active power which makes the object to be in act must be distinct from the passive power which is moved by the object existing in act Thus the active power is compared to its object as a being in act is to a being in potentiality whereas the passive power on the contrary is compared to its object as being in potentiality is to a being in act Therefore there can be no other difference of powers in the intellect but that of passive and active Wherefore it is clear that memory is not a distinct power from the intellect for it belongs to the nature of a passive power to retain as well as to receive Reply Obj one Although it is said three Sent D one that memory intellect and will are three powers this is not in accordance with the meaning of Augustine who says expressly De Trin xiv that if we take memory intelligence and will as always present in the soul whether we actually attend to them or not they seem to pertain to the memory only And by intelligence I mean that by which we understand when actually thinking and by will I mean that love or affection which unites the child and its parent Wherefore it is clear that Augustine does not take the above three for three powers but by memory he understands the soul s habit of retention by intelligence the act of the intellect and by will the act of the will Reply Obj two Past and present may differentiate the sensitive powers but not the intellectual powers for the reason give above Reply Obj three Intelligence arises from memory as act from habit and in this way it is equal to it but not as a power to a power EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q seventy nine Art eight Whether the Reason Is Distinct from the Intellect Objection one It would seem that the reason is a distinct power from the intellect For it is stated in De Spiritu et Anima that when we wish to rise from lower things to higher first the sense comes to our aid then imagination then reason then the intellect Therefore the reason is distinct from the intellect as imagination is from sense Obj two Further Boethius says De Consol iv six that intellect is compared to reason as eternity to time But it does not belong to the same power to be in eternity and to be in time Therefore reason and intellect are not the same power Obj three Further man has intellect in common with the angels and sense in common with the brutes But reason which is proper to man whence he is called a rational animal is a power distinct from sense Therefore is it equally true to say that it is distinct from the intellect which properly belongs to the angel whence they are called intellectual On the contrary Augustine says general ad lit iii twenty that that in which man excels irrational animals is reason or mind or intelligence or whatever appropriate name we like to give it Therefore reason intellect and mind are one power I answer that Reason and intellect in man cannot be distinct powers We shall understand this clearly if we consider their respective actions For to understand is simply to apprehend intelligible truth and to reason is to advance from one thing understood to another so as to know an intelligible truth And therefore angels who according to their nature possess perfect knowledge of intelligible truth have no need to advance from one thing to another but apprehend the truth simply and without mental discussion as Dionysius says Div Nom vii But man arrives at the knowledge of intelligible truth by advancing from one thing to another and therefore he is called rational Reasoning therefore is compared to understanding as movement is to rest or acquisition to possession of which one belongs to the perfect the other to the imperfect And since movement always proceeds from something immovable and ends in something at rest hence it is that human reasoning by way of inquiry and discovery advances from certain things simply understood namely the first principles and again by way of judgment returns by analysis to first principles in the light of which it examines what it has found Now it is clear that rest and movement are not to be referred to different powers but to one and the same even in natural things since by the same nature a thing is moved towards a certain place and rests in that place Much more therefore by the same power do we understand and reason and so it is clear that in man reason and intellect are the same power Reply Obj one That enumeration is made according to the order of actions not according to the distinction of powers Moreover that book is not of great authority Reply Obj two The answer is clear from what we have said For eternity is compared to time as immovable to movable And thus Boethius compared the intellect to eternity and reason to time Reply Obj three Other animals are so much lower than man that they cannot attain to the knowledge of truth which reason seeks But man attains although imperfectly to the knowledge of intelligible truth which angels know Therefore in the angels the power of knowledge is not of a different genus from that which is in the human reason but is compared to it as the perfect to the imperfect NINTH ARTICLE I Q seventy nine Art nine Whether the Higher and Lower Reason Are Distinct Powers Objection one It would seem that the higher and lower reason are distinct powers For Augustine says De Trin xii forty seven that the image of the Trinity is in the higher part of the reason and not in the lower But the parts of the soul are its powers Therefore the higher and lower reason are two powers Obj two Further nothing flows from itself Now the lower reason flows from the higher and is ruled and directed by it Therefore the higher reason is another power from the lower Obj three Further the Philosopher says Ethic vi one that the scientific part of the soul by which the soul knows necessary things is another principle and another part from the opinionative and reasoning part by which it knows contingent things And he proves this from the principle that for those things which are generically different generically different parts of the soul are ordained Now contingent and necessary are generically different as corruptible and incorruptible Since therefore necessary is the same as eternal and temporal the same as contingent it seems that what the Philosopher calls the scientific part must be the same as the higher reason which according to Augustine De Trin xii seven is intent on the consideration and consultation of things eternal and that what the Philosopher calls the reasoning or opinionative part is the same as the lower reason which according to Augustine is intent on the disposal of temporal things Therefore the higher reason is another power than the lower Obj four Further Damascene says De Fide Orth ii that opinion rises from the imagination then the mind by judging of the truth or error of the opinion discovers the truth whence mens mind is derived from metiendo measuring And therefore the intellect regards those things which are already subject to judgment and true decision Therefore the opinionative power which is the lower reason is distinct from the mind and the intellect by which we may understand the higher reason On the contrary Augustine says De Trin xii four that the higher and lower reason are only distinct by their functions Therefore they are not two powers I answer that The higher and lower reason as they are understood by Augustine can in no way be two powers of the soul For he says that the higher reason is that which is intent on the contemplation and consultation of things eternal forasmuch as in contemplation it sees them in themselves and in consultation it takes its rules of action from them But he calls the lower reason that which is intent on the disposal of temporal things Now these two namely eternal and temporal are related to our knowledge in this way that one of them is the means of knowing the other For by way of discovery we come through knowledge of temporal things to that of things eternal according to the words of the Apostle Rom one twenty The invisible things of God are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made while by way of judgment from eternal things already known we judge of temporal things and according to laws of things eternal we dispose of temporal things But it may happen that the medium and what is attained thereby belong to different habits as the first indemonstrable principles belong to the habit of the intellect whereas the conclusions which we draw from them belong to the habit of science And so it happens that from the principles of geometry we draw a conclusion in another science for example perspective But the power of the reason is such that both medium and term belong to it For the act of the reason is as it were a movement from one thing to another But the same movable thing passes through the medium and reaches the end Wherefore the higher and lower reasons are one and the same power But according to Augustine they are distinguished by the functions of their actions and according to their various habits for wisdom is attributed to the higher reason science to the lower Reply Obj one We speak of parts in whatever way a thing is divided And so far as reason is divided according to its various acts the higher and lower reason are called parts but not because they are different powers Reply Obj two The lower reason is said to flow from the higher or to be ruled by it as far as the principles made use of by the lower reason are drawn from and directed by the principles of the higher reason Reply Obj three The scientific part of which the Philosopher speaks is not the same as the higher reason for necessary truths are found even among temporal things of which natural science and mathematics treat And the opinionative and ratiocinative part is more limited than the lower reason for it regards only things contingent Neither must we say without any qualification that a power by which the intellect knows necessary things is distinct from a power by which it knows contingent things because it knows both under the same objective aspect namely under the aspect of being and truth Wherefore it perfectly knows necessary things which have perfect being in truth since it penetrates to their very essence from which it demonstrates their proper accidents On the other hand it knows contingent things but imperfectly forasmuch as they have but imperfect being and truth Now perfect and imperfect in the action do not vary the power but they vary the actions as to the mode of acting and consequently the principles of the actions and the habits themselves And therefore the Philosopher postulates two lesser parts of the soul namely the scientific and the ratiocinative not because they are two powers but because they are distinct according to a different aptitude for receiving various habits concerning the variety of which he inquires For contingent and necessary though differing according to their proper genera nevertheless agree in the common aspect of being which the intellect considers and to which they are variously compared as perfect and imperfect Reply Obj four That distinction given by Damascene is according to the variety of acts not according to the variety of powers For opinion signifies an act of the intellect which leans to one side of a contradiction whilst in fear of the other While to judge or measure mensurare is an act of the intellect applying certain principles to examine propositions From this is taken the word mens mind Lastly to understand is to adhere to the formed judgment with approval TENTH ARTICLE I Q seventy nine Art ten Whether Intelligence Is a Power Distinct from Intellect Objection one It would seem that the intelligence is another power than the intellect For we read in De Spiritu et Anima that when we wish to rise from lower to higher things first the sense comes to our aid then imagination then reason then intellect and afterwards intelligence But imagination and sense are distinct powers Therefore also intellect and intelligence are distinct Obj two Further Boethius says De Consol v four that sense considers man in one way imagination in another reason in another intelligence in another But intellect is the same power as reason Therefore seemingly intelligence is a distinct power from intellect as reason is a distinct power from imagination or sense Obj three Further actions came before powers as the Philosopher says De Anima ii four But intelligence is an act separate from others attributed to the intellect For Damascene says De Fide Orth ii that the first movement is called intelligence but that intelligence which is about a certain thing is called intention that which remains and conforms the soul to that which is understood is called invention and invention when it remains in the same man examining and judging of itself is called phronesis that is wisdom and phronesis if dilated makes thought that is orderly internal speech from which they say comes speech expressed by the tongue Therefore it seems that intelligence is some special power On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima iii six that intelligence is of indivisible things in which there is nothing false But the knowledge of these things belongs to the intellect Therefore intelligence is not another power than the intellect I answer that This word intelligence properly signifies the intellect s very act which is to understand However in some works translated from the Arabic the separate substances which we call angels are called intelligences and perhaps for this reason that such substances are always actually understanding But in works translated from the Greek they are called intellects or minds Thus intelligence is not distinct from intellect as power is from power but as act is from power And such a division is recognized even by the philosophers For sometimes they assign four intellects namely the active and passive intellects the intellect in habit and the actual intellect Of which four the active and passive intellects are different powers just as in all things the active power is distinct from the passive But three of these are distinct as three states of the passive intellect which is sometimes in potentiality only and thus it is called passive sometimes it is in the first act which is knowledge and thus it is called intellect in habit and sometimes it is in the second act which is to consider and thus it is called intellect in act or actual intellect Reply Obj one If this authority is accepted intelligence there means the act of the intellect And thus it is divided against intellect as act against power Reply Obj two Boethius takes intelligence as meaning that act of the intellect which transcends the act of the reason Wherefore he also says that reason alone belongs to the human race as intelligence alone belongs to God for it belongs to God to understand all things without any investigation Reply Obj three All those acts which Damascene enumerates belong to one power namely the intellectual power For this power first of all only apprehends something and this act is called intelligence Secondly it directs what it apprehends to the knowledge of something else or to some operation and this is called intention And when it goes on in search of what it intends it is called invention When by reference to something known for certain it examines what it has found it is said to know or to be wise which belongs to phronesis or wisdom for it belongs to the wise man to judge as the Philosopher says Metaph i two And when once it has obtained something for certain as being fully examined it thinks about the means of making it known to others and this is the ordering of interior speech from which proceeds external speech For every difference of acts does not make the powers vary but only what cannot be reduced to the one same principle as we have said above Q seventy eight A four ELEVENTH ARTICLE I Q seventy nine Art eleven Whether the Speculative and Practical Intellects Are Distinct Powers Objection one It would seem that the speculative and practical intellects are distinct powers For the apprehensive and motive are different kinds of powers as is clear from De Anima ii three But the speculative intellect is merely an apprehensive power while the practical intellect is a motive power Therefore they are distinct powers Obj two Further the different nature of the object differentiates the power But the object of the speculative intellect is truth and of the practical is good which differ in nature Therefore the speculative and practical intellect are distinct powers Obj three Further in the intellectual part the practical intellect is compared to the speculative as the estimative is to the imaginative power in the sensitive part But the estimative differs from the imaginative as power form power as we have said above Q seventy eight A four Therefore also the speculative intellect differs from the practical On the contrary The speculative intellect by extension becomes practical De Anima iii ten But one power is not changed into another Therefore the speculative and practical intellects are not distinct powers I answer that The speculative and practical intellects are not distinct powers The reason of which is that as we have said above Q seventy seven A three what is accidental to the nature of the object of a power does not differentiate that power for it is accidental to a thing colored to be man or to be great or small hence all such things are apprehended by the same power of sight Now to a thing apprehended by the intellect it is accidental whether it be directed to operation or not and according to this the speculative and practical intellects differ For it is the speculative intellect which directs what it apprehends not to operation but to the consideration of truth while the practical intellect is that which directs what it apprehends to operation And this is what the Philosopher says De Anima iii ten that the speculative differs from the practical in its end Whence each is named from its end the one speculative the other practical i e operative Reply Obj one The practical intellect is a motive power not as executing movement but as directing towards it and this belongs to it according to its mode of apprehension Reply Obj two Truth and good include one another for truth is something good otherwise it would not be desirable and good is something true otherwise it would not be intelligible Therefore as the object of the appetite may be something true as having the aspect of good for example when some one desires to know the truth so the object of the practical intellect is good directed to the operation and under the aspect of truth For the practical intellect knows truth just as the speculative but it directs the known truth to operation Reply Obj three Many differences differentiate the sensitive powers which do not differentiate the intellectual powers as we have said above A seven ad two Q seventy seven A three ad four TWELFTH ARTICLE I Q seventy nine Art twelve Whether Synderesis Is a Special Power of the Soul Distinct from the Others Objection one It would seem that synderesis is a special power distinct from the others For those things which fall under one division seem to be of the same genus But in the gloss of Jerome on Ezech one six synderesis is divided against the irascible the concupiscible and the rational which are powers Therefore synderesis is a power Obj two Further opposite things are of the same genus But synderesis and sensuality seem to be opposed to one another because synderesis always incites to good while sensuality always incites to evil whence it is signified by the serpent as is clear from Augustine De Trin xii twelve thirteen It seems therefore that synderesis is a power just as sensuality is Obj three Further Augustine says De Lib Arb ii ten that in the natural power of judgment there are certain rules and seeds of virtue both true and unchangeable And this is what we call synderesis Since therefore the unchangeable rules which guide our judgment belong to the reason as to its higher part as Augustine says De Trin xii two it seems that synderesis is the same as reason and thus it is a power On the contrary According to the Philosopher Metaph viii two rational powers regard opposite things But synderesis does not regard opposites but inclines to good only Therefore synderesis is not a power For if it were a power it would be a rational power since it is not found in brute animals I answer that Synderesis is not a power but a habit though some held that it is a power higher than reason while others Cf Alexander of Hales Sum Theol II Q seventy three said that it is reason itself not as reason but as a nature In order to make this clear we must observe that as we have said above A eight man s act of reasoning since it is a kind of movement proceeds from the understanding of certain things namely those which are naturally known without any investigation on the part of reason as from an immovable principle and ends also at the understanding inasmuch as by means of those principles naturally known we judge of those things which we have discovered by reasoning Now it is clear that as the speculative reason argues about speculative things so that practical reason argues about practical things Therefore we must have bestowed on us by nature not only speculative principles but also practical principles Now the first speculative principles bestowed on us by nature do not belong to a special power but to a special habit which is called the understanding of principles as the Philosopher explains Ethic vi six Wherefore the first practical principles bestowed on us by nature do not belong to a special power but to a special natural habit which we call synderesis Whence synderesis is said to incite to good and to murmur at evil inasmuch as through first principles we proceed to discover and judge of what we have discovered It is therefore clear that synderesis is not a power but a natural habit Reply Obj one The division given by Jerome is taken from the variety of acts and not from the variety of powers and various acts can belong to one power Reply Obj two In like manner the opposition of sensuality to syneresis is an opposition of acts and not of the different species of one genus Reply Obj three Those unchangeable notions are the first practical principles concerning which no one errs and they are attributed to reason as to a power and to synderesis as to a habit Wherefore we judge naturally both by our reason and by synderesis THIRTEENTH ARTICLE I Q seventy nine Art thirteen Whether Conscience Be a Power Objection one It would seem that conscience is a power for Origen says Commentary on Rom two fifteen that conscience is a correcting and guiding spirit accompanying the soul by which it is led away from evil and made to cling to good But in the soul spirit designates a power either the mind itself according to the text Eph four thirteen Be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind or the imagination whence imaginary vision is called spiritual as Augustine says general ad lit xii seven hundred twenty four Therefore conscience is a power Obj two Further nothing is a subject of sin except a power of the soul But conscience is a subject of sin for it is said of some that their mind and conscience are defiled Titus one fifteen Therefore it seems that conscience is a power Obj three Further conscience must of necessity be either an act a habit or a power But it is not an act for thus it would not always exist in man Nor is it a habit for conscience is not one thing but many since we are directed in our actions by many habits of knowledge Therefore conscience is a power On the contrary Conscience can be laid aside But a power cannot be laid aside Therefore conscience is not a power I answer that Properly speaking conscience is not a power but an act This is evident both from the very name and from those things which in the common way of speaking are attributed to conscience For conscience according to the very nature of the word implies the relation of knowledge to something for conscience may be resolved into cum alio scientia i e knowledge applied to an individual case But the application of knowledge to something is done by some act Wherefore from this explanation of the name it is clear that conscience is an act The same is manifest from those things which are attributed to conscience For conscience is said to witness to bind or incite and also to accuse torment or rebuke And all these follow the application of knowledge or science to what we do which application is made in three ways One way in so far as we recognize that we have done or not done something Thy conscience knoweth that thou hast often spoken evil of others Eccles seven twenty three and according to this conscience is said to witness In another way so far as through the conscience we judge that something should be done or not done and in this sense conscience is said to incite or to bind In the third way so far as by conscience we judge that something done is well done or ill done and in this sense conscience is said to excuse accuse or torment Now it is clear that all these things follow the actual application of knowledge to what we do Wherefore properly speaking conscience denominates an act But since habit is a principle of act sometimes the name conscience is given to the first natural habit namely synderesis thus Jerome calls synderesis conscience Gloss Ezech one six Basil Hom in princ Proverb the natural power of judgment and Damascene De Fide Orth iv twenty two says that it is the law of our intellect For it is customary for causes and effects to be called after one another Reply Obj one Conscience is called a spirit so far as spirit is the same as mind because conscience is a certain pronouncement of the mind Reply Obj two The conscience is said to be defiled not as a subject but as the thing known is in knowledge so far as someone knows he is defiled Reply Obj three Although an act does not always remain in itself yet it always remains in its cause which is power and habit Now all the habits by which conscience is formed although many nevertheless have their efficacy from one first habit the habit of first principles which is called synderesis And for this special reason this habit is sometimes called conscience as we have said above QUESTION eighty OF THE APPETITIVE POWERS IN GENERAL In Two Articles Next we consider the appetitive powers concerning which there are four heads of consideration 
7326-245693-0000	train-other-500	first the appetitive powers in general second sensuality third the will fourth the free will Under the first there are two points of inquiry one
7326-245693-0001	train-other-500	Whether the appetite should be considered a special power of the soul two Whether the appetite should be divided into intellectual and sensitive as distinct powers FIRST ARTICLE
none	none	 I Q eighty Art one Whether the Appetite Is a Special Power of the Soul 
7326-245693-0002	train-other-500	Objection one It would seem that the appetite is not a special power of the soul For no power of the soul is to be assigned for those things which are common
7326-245693-0003	train-other-500	to animate and to inanimate things But appetite is common to animate and inanimate things since all desire good as the Philosopher says
none	none	 Ethic i one 
7326-245693-0004	train-other-500	Therefore the appetite is not a special power of the soul
none	none	 Obj two 
7326-245693-0005	train-other-500	Further powers are differentiated by their objects
none	none	 But what we desire is the same as what we know 
7326-245693-0006	train-other-500	Therefore the appetitive power is not distinct from the apprehensive power
none	none	 Obj three 
7326-245693-0007	train-other-500	Further the common is not divided from the proper But each power of the soul desires some particular desirable thing namely its own suitable object Therefore with regard to this object
7326-245693-0008	train-other-500	which is the desirable in general we should not assign some particular power distinct from the others called the appetitive power On the contrary The Philosopher distinguishes
none	none	 De Anima ii three the appetitive from the other powers Damascene also De Fide Orth ii twenty two 
7326-245693-0010	train-other-500	distinguishes the appetitive from the cognitive powers I answer that It is necessary to assign an appetitive power to the soul To make this evident
7326-245693-0011	train-other-500	we must observe that some inclination follows every form for example fire by its form is inclined to rise and to generate its like Now the form is found
7326-245693-0012	train-other-500	to have a more perfect existence in those things which participate knowledge
none	none	 than in those which lack knowledge 
7326-245693-0013	train-other-500	For in those which lack knowledge the form is found to determine each thing only to its own being that is to its nature Therefore this natural form is followed
7326-245693-0014	train-other-500	by a natural inclination which is called the natural appetite But in those things which have knowledge each one is determined to its own natural being by its natural form

7326-245693-0029	train-other-500	Whether the Sensitive and Intellectual Appetites Are Distinct Powers Objection one It would seem that the sensitive and intellectual appetites are not distinct powers
none	none	 For powers are not differentiated by accidental differences as we have seen above Q seventy seven A three 
7326-245693-0031	train-other-500	But it is accidental to the appetible object whether it be apprehended by the sense or by the intellect Therefore the sensitive and intellectual appetites are not distinct powers
none	none	 Obj two 
7326-245693-0032	train-other-500	Further intellectual knowledge is of universals
none	none	 and so it is 
7326-245693-0033	train-other-500	distinct from sensitive knowledge which is of individual things But there is no place for this distinction in the appetitive part for since the appetite
none	none	 is a movement of the soul to individual things 
7326-245693-0034	train-other-500	seemingly every act of the appetite regards an individual thing Therefore the intellectual appetite is not distinguished from the sensitive
none	none	 Obj three 
7326-245693-0035	train-other-500	Further as under the apprehensive power the appetitive is subordinate as a lower power so also is the motive power But the motive power
7326-245693-0036	train-other-500	which in man follows the intellect is not distinct from the motive power which in animals follows sense Therefore for a like reason neither is there distinction in the appetitive part
none	none	 On the contrary The Philosopher De Anima iii nine 
7326-245693-0038	train-other-500	distinguishes a double appetite and says
none	none	 De Anima iii eleven 
7326-245693-0039	train-other-500	that the higher appetite moves the lower I answer that We must needs say that the intellectual appetite is a distinct power from the sensitive appetite
7326-245693-0040	train-other-500	For the appetitive power is a passive power which is naturally moved by the thing apprehended wherefore the apprehended appetible is a mover which is not moved while the appetite
7326-245693-0041	train-other-500	is a mover moved as the Philosopher says in
none	none	 De Anima iii ten and Metaph xii Did xi seven Now things passive 
7326-245693-0042	train-other-500	and movable are differentiated according to the distinction of the corresponding active and motive principles because the motive must be proportionate to the movable and the active to the passive
7326-245693-0043	train-other-500	indeed the passive power itself has its very nature
none	none	 from its relation to its active principle 
7326-245693-0044	train-other-500	Therefore since what is apprehended by the intellect and what is apprehended by sense are generically different consequently the intellectual appetite
none	none	 is distinct from the sensitive Reply Obj one 
7326-245693-0045	train-other-500	It is not accidental to the thing desired to be apprehended by the sense or the intellect on the contrary this belongs to it by its nature
7326-245693-0046	train-other-500	for the appetible does not move the appetite except as it is apprehended Wherefore differences in the thing apprehended are of themselves differences of the appetible And so
7326-245693-0047	train-other-500	the appetitive powers are distinct according to the distinction of the things apprehended
none	none	 as their proper objects Reply Obj two 
7326-245693-0048	train-other-500	The intellectual appetite though it tends to individual things which exist outside the soul yet tends to them as standing under the universal as when it desires something because it is good

none	none	 which is not apprehended by sense such as knowledge virtue and suchlike QUESTION eighty one OF THE POWER OF SENSUALITY In Three Articles Next we have to consider the power of sensuality concerning which there are three points of inquiry one Whether sensuality is only an appetitive power two Whether it is divided into irascible and concupiscible as distinct powers three Whether the irascible and concupiscible powers obey reason FIRST ARTICLE I Q eighty one Art one Whether Sensuality Is Only Appetitive Objection one It would seem that sensuality is not only appetitive but also cognitive For Augustine says De Trin xii twelve that the sensual movement of the soul which is directed to the bodily senses is common to us and beasts But the bodily senses belong to the apprehensive powers Therefore sensuality is a cognitive power Obj two Further things which come under one division seem to be of one genus But Augustine De Trin xii twelve divides sensuality against the higher and lower reason which belong to knowledge Therefore sensuality also is apprehensive Obj three Further in man s temptations sensuality stands in the place of the serpent But in the temptation of our first parents the serpent presented himself as one giving information and proposing sin which belong to the cognitive power Therefore sensuality is a cognitive power On the contrary Sensuality is defined as the appetite of things belonging to the body I answer that The name sensuality seems to be taken from the sensual movement of which Augustine speaks De Trin xii twelve thirteen just as the name of a power is taken from its act for instance sight from seeing Now the sensual movement is an appetite following sensitive apprehension For the act of the apprehensive power is not so properly called a movement as the act of the appetite since the operation of the apprehensive power is completed in the very fact that the thing apprehended is in the one that apprehends while the operation of the appetitive power is completed in the fact that he who desires is borne towards the thing desirable Therefore the operation of the apprehensive power is likened to rest whereas the operation of the appetitive power is rather likened to movement Wherefore by sensual movement we understand the operation of the appetitive power so that sensuality is the name of the sensitive appetite Reply Obj one By saying that the sensual movement of the soul is directed to the bodily senses Augustine does not give us to understand that the bodily senses are included in sensuality but rather that the movement of sensuality is a certain inclination to the bodily senses since we desire things which are apprehended through the bodily senses And thus the bodily senses appertain to sensuality as a preamble Reply Obj two Sensuality is divided against higher and lower reason as having in common with them the act of movement for the apprehensive power to which belong the higher and lower reason is a motive power as is appetite to which appertains sensuality Reply Obj three The serpent not only showed and proposed sin but also incited to the commission of sin And in this sensuality is signified by the serpent SECOND ARTICLE I Q eighty one Art two Whether the Sensitive Appetite Is Divided into the Irascible and Concupiscible As Distinct Powers Objection one It would seem that the sensitive appetite is not divided into the irascible and concupiscible as distinct powers For the same power of the soul regards both sides of a contrariety as sight regards both black and white according to the Philosopher De Anima ii eleven But suitable and harmful are contraries Since then the concupiscible power regards what is suitable while the irascible is concerned with what is harmful it seems that irascible and concupiscible are the same power in the soul Obj two Further the sensitive appetite regards only what is suitable according to the senses But such is the object of the concupiscible power Therefore there is no sensitive appetite differing from the concupiscible Obj three Further hatred is in the irascible part for Jerome says on Matt thirteen thirty three We ought to have the hatred of vice in the irascible power But hatred is contrary to love and is in the concupiscible part Therefore the concupiscible and irascible are the same powers On the contrary Gregory of Nyssa Nemesius De Natura Hominis and Damascene De Fide Orth ii twelve assign two parts to the sensitive appetite the irascible and the concupiscible I answer that The sensitive appetite is one generic power and is called sensuality but it is divided into two powers which are species of the sensitive appetite the irascible and the concupiscible In order to make this clear we must observe that in natural corruptible things there is needed an inclination not only to the acquisition of what is suitable and to the avoiding of what is harmful but also to resistance against corruptive and contrary agencies which are a hindrance to the acquisition of what is suitable and are productive of harm For example fire has a natural inclination not only to rise from a lower position which is unsuitable to it towards a higher position which is suitable but also to resist whatever destroys or hinders its action Therefore since the sensitive appetite is an inclination following sensitive apprehension as natural appetite is an inclination following the natural form there must needs be in the sensitive part two appetitive powers one through which the soul is simply inclined to seek what is suitable according to the senses and to fly from what is hurtful and this is called the concupiscible and another whereby an animal resists these attacks that hinder what is suitable and inflict harm and this is called the irascible Whence we say that its object is something arduous because its tendency is to overcome and rise above obstacles Now these two are not to be reduced to one principle for sometimes the soul busies itself with unpleasant things against the inclination of the concupiscible appetite in order that following the impulse of the irascible appetite it may fight against obstacles Wherefore also the passions of the irascible appetite counteract the passions of the concupiscible appetite since the concupiscence on being aroused diminishes anger and anger being roused diminishes concupiscence in many cases This is clear also from the fact that the irascible is as it were the champion and defender of the concupiscible when it rises up against what hinders the acquisition of the suitable things which the concupiscible desires or against what inflicts harm from which the concupiscible flies And for this reason all the passions of the irascible appetite rise from the passions of the concupiscible appetite and terminate in them for instance anger rises from sadness and having wrought vengeance terminates in joy For this reason also the quarrels of animals are about things concupiscible namely food and sex as the Philosopher says De Animal Histor viii Reply Obj one The concupiscible power regards both what is suitable and what is unsuitable But the object of the irascible power is to resist the onslaught of the unsuitable Reply Obj two As in the apprehensive powers of the sensitive part there is an estimative power which perceives those things which do not impress the senses as we have said above Q seventy eight A two so also in the sensitive appetite there is a certain appetitive power which regards something as suitable not because it pleases the senses but because it is useful to the animal for self defense and this is the irascible power Reply Obj three Hatred belongs simply to the concupiscible appetite but by reason of the strife which arises from hatred it may belong to the irascible appetite THIRD ARTICLE I Q eighty one Art three Whether the irascible and concupiscible appetites obey reason Objection one It would seem that the irascible and concupiscible appetites do not obey reason For irascible and concupiscible are parts of sensuality But sensuality does not obey reason wherefore it is signified by the serpent as Augustine says De Trin xii twelve thirteen Therefore the irascible and concupiscible appetites do not obey reason Obj two Further what obeys a certain thing does not resist it But the irascible and concupiscible appetites resist reason according to the Apostle Rom seven twenty three I see another law in my members fighting against the law of my mind Therefore the irascible and concupiscible appetites do not obey reason Obj three Further as the appetitive power is inferior to the rational part of the soul so also is the sensitive power But the sensitive part of the soul does not obey reason for we neither hear nor see just when we wish Therefore in like manner neither do the powers of the sensitive appetite the irascible and concupiscible obey reason On the contrary Damascene says De Fide Orth ii twelve that the part of the soul which is obedient and amenable to reason is divided into concupiscence and anger I answer that In two ways the irascible and concupiscible powers obey the higher part in which are the intellect or reason and the will first as to reason secondly as to the will They obey the reason in their own acts because in other animals the sensitive appetite is naturally moved by the estimative power for instance a sheep esteeming the wolf as an enemy is afraid In man the estimative power as we have said above Q seventy eight A four is replaced by the cogitative power which is called by some the particular reason because it compares individual intentions Wherefore in man the sensitive appetite is naturally moved by this particular reason But this same particular reason is naturally guided and moved according to the universal reason wherefore in syllogistic matters particular conclusions are drawn from universal propositions Therefore it is clear that the universal reason directs the sensitive appetite which is divided into concupiscible and irascible and this appetite obeys it But because to draw particular conclusions from universal principles is not the work of the intellect as such but of the reason hence it is that the irascible and concupiscible are said to obey the reason rather than to obey the intellect Anyone can experience this in himself for by applying certain universal considerations anger or fear or the like may be modified or excited To the will also is the sensitive appetite subject in execution which is accomplished by the motive power For in other animals movement follows at once the concupiscible and irascible appetites for instance the sheep fearing the wolf flees at once because it has no superior counteracting appetite On the contrary man is not moved at once according to the irascible and concupiscible appetites but he awaits the command of the will which is the superior appetite For wherever there is order among a number of motive powers the second only moves by virtue of the first wherefore the lower appetite is not sufficient to cause movement unless the higher appetite consents And this is what the Philosopher says De Anima iii eleven that the higher appetite moves the lower appetite as the higher sphere moves the lower In this way therefore the irascible and concupiscible are subject to reason Reply Obj one Sensuality is signified by the serpent in what is proper to it as a sensitive power But the irascible and concupiscible powers denominate the sensitive appetite rather on the part of the act to which they are led by the reason as we have said Reply Obj two As the Philosopher says Polit i two We observe in an animal a despotic and a politic principle for the soul dominates the body by a despotic power but the intellect dominates the appetite by a politic and royal power For a power is called despotic whereby a man rules his slaves who have not the right to resist in any way the orders of the one that commands them since they have nothing of their own But that power is called politic and royal by which a man rules over free subjects who though subject to the government of the ruler have nevertheless something of their own by reason of which they can resist the orders of him who commands And so the soul is said to rule the body by a despotic power because the members of the body cannot in any way resist the sway of the soul but at the soul s command both hand and foot and whatever member is naturally moved by voluntary movement are moved at once But the intellect or reason is said to rule the irascible and concupiscible by a politic power because the sensitive appetite has something of its own by virtue whereof it can resist the commands of reason For the sensitive appetite is naturally moved not only by the estimative power in other animals and in man by the cogitative power which the universal reason guides but also by the imagination and sense Whence it is that we experience that the irascible and concupiscible powers do resist reason inasmuch as we sense or imagine something pleasant which reason forbids or unpleasant which reason commands And so from the fact that the irascible and concupiscible resist reason in something we must not conclude that they do not obey Reply Obj three The exterior senses require for action exterior sensible things whereby they are affected and the presence of which is not ruled by reason But the interior powers both appetitive and apprehensive do not require exterior things Therefore they are subject to the command of reason which can not only incite or modify the affections of the appetitive power but can also form the phantasms of the imagination QUESTION eighty two OF THE WILL In Five Articles 
8042-245695-0000	train-other-500	We next consider the will Under this head there are five points of inquiry one Whether the will desires something of necessity two
none	none	 Whether it desires everything of necessity 
8042-245695-0001	train-other-500	three Whether it is a higher power than the intellect four Whether the will moves the intellect five Whether the will is divided into irascible and concupiscible FIRST ARTICLE
none	none	 I Q eighty two Art one 
8042-245695-0002	train-other-500	Whether the Will Desires Something of Necessity Objection one It would seem that the will desires nothing of necessity For Augustine says
none	none	 De Civ Dei v ten 
8042-245695-0003	train-other-500	that it anything is necessary it is not voluntary But whatever the will desires is voluntary Therefore nothing that the will desires is desired of necessity
none	none	 Obj two 
8042-245695-0004	train-other-500	Further the rational powers according to the Philosopher
none	none	 Metaph viii two 
8042-245695-0005	train-other-500	extend to opposite things But the will is a rational power because as he says
none	none	 De Anima iii nine 
8042-245695-0006	train-other-500	the will is in the reason Therefore the will extends to opposite things and therefore it is determined to nothing of necessity
none	none	 Obj three Further by the will we are masters of our own actions But we are not masters of that which is of necessity Therefore the act of the will cannot be necessitated On the contrary Augustine says De Trin xiii four 
8042-245695-0007	train-other-500	that all desire happiness with one will Now if this were not necessary but contingent there would at least be a few exceptions Therefore the will desires something of necessity I answer that
8042-245695-0008	train-other-500	The word necessity is employed in many ways For that which must be is necessary Now that a thing must be may belong to it by an intrinsic principle either material as when we say that everything composed of contraries is of necessity corruptible
8042-245695-0009	train-other-500	or formal as when we say that it is necessary for the three angles of a triangle to be equal to two right angles And this is natural
none	none	 and absolute necessity In another way that a thing must be belongs to it by reason of something extrinsic which is either the end or the agent On the part of the end as when without it the end is not to be attained or so well attained for instance 
8042-245695-0010	train-other-500	food is said to be necessary for life and a horse is necessary for a journey This is called necessity of end and sometimes also utility On the part of the agent a thing must be when someone is forced by some agent so that he is not able to do the contrary
8042-245695-0011	train-other-500	This is called necessity of coercion Now this necessity of coercion is altogether repugnant to the will For we call that violent which is against the inclination of a thing But the very movement of the will is an inclination to something
none	none	 Therefore as a thing is called natural because it is according to the inclination of nature so a thing is called voluntary because it is according to the inclination of the will Therefore just as it is impossible for a thing to be at the same time violent and natural 
8042-245695-0012	train-other-500	so it is impossible for a thing to be absolutely coerced or violent and voluntary But necessity of end is not repugnant to the will when the end cannot be attained except in one way
8042-245695-0013	train-other-500	thus from the will to cross the sea arises in the will the necessity to wish for a ship In like manner neither is natural necessity repugnant to the will
none	none	 Indeed more than this for as the intellect of necessity adheres to the first principles 
8042-245695-0014	train-other-500	the will must of necessity adhere to the last end which is happiness since the end is in practical matters what the principle is in speculative matters
none	none	 For what befits a thing naturally and immovably must be the root and principle of all else appertaining thereto 
8042-245695-0015	train-other-500	since the nature of a thing is the first in everything
none	none	 and every movement arises from something immovable Reply Obj one The words of Augustine are to be understood of the necessity of coercion But natural necessity does not take away the liberty of the will as he says himself De Civ Dei v ten Reply Obj two The will so far as it desires a thing naturally corresponds rather to the intellect as regards natural principles than to the reason which extends to opposite things Wherefore in this respect it is rather an intellectual than a rational power Reply Obj three 
8042-245695-0016	train-other-500	We are masters of our own actions by reason of our being able to choose this or that But choice regards not the end but the means to the end as the Philosopher says
none	none	 Ethic iii nine Wherefore the desire of the ultimate end does not regard those actions of which we are masters SECOND ARTICLE I Q eighty two Art two 
8042-245695-0018	train-other-500	Whether the Will Desires of Necessity Whatever It Desires Objection one It would seem that the will desires all things of necessity whatever it desires For Dionysius says
none	none	 Div Nom iv that 
8042-245695-0019	train-other-500	evil is outside the scope of the will Therefore the will tends of necessity to the good which is proposed to it
none	none	 Obj two 
8042-245695-0020	train-other-500	Further the object of the will is compared to the will as the mover to the thing movable But the movement of the movable necessarily follows the mover Therefore it seems that the will s object moves it of necessity
none	none	 Obj three 
8042-245695-0021	train-other-500	Further as the thing apprehended by sense is the object of the sensitive appetite so the thing apprehended by the intellect is the object of the intellectual appetite which is called the will But what is apprehended by the sense moves the sensitive appetite of necessity for Augustine says
none	none	 general ad lit ix fourteen that animals are moved by things seen Therefore it seems that whatever is apprehended by the intellect moves the will of necessity On the contrary Augustine says Retract i nine that 
8042-245695-0022	train-other-500	it is the will by which we sin and live well and so the will extends to opposite things Therefore it does not desire of necessity all things whatsoever it desires I answer that The will does not desire of necessity whatsoever it desires
none	none	 In order to make this evident we must observe that as the intellect naturally and of necessity adheres to the first principles so the will adheres to the last end as we have said already A one 
8042-245695-0023	train-other-500	Now there are some things intelligible which have not a necessary connection with the first principles such as contingent propositions the denial of which does not involve a denial of the first principles And to such the intellect does not assent of necessity
8042-245695-0024	train-other-500	But there are some propositions which have a necessary connection with the first principles such as demonstrable conclusions a denial of which involves a denial of the first principles
none	none	 And to these the intellect assents of necessity when once it is aware of the necessary connection of these conclusions with the principles 
8042-245695-0025	train-other-500	but it does not assent of necessity until through the demonstration it recognizes the necessity of such connection It is the same with the will For there are certain individual goods which have not a necessary connection with happiness because without them a man can be happy and to such the will does not adhere of necessity
none	none	 But there are some things which have a necessary connection with happiness by means of which things man adheres to God in Whom alone true happiness consists 
8042-245695-0026	train-other-500	Nevertheless until through the certitude of the Divine Vision the necessity of such connection be shown the will does not adhere to God of necessity nor to those things which are of God But the will of the man who sees God in His essence of necessity adheres to God
8042-245695-0027	train-other-500	just as now we desire of necessity to be happy It is therefore clear that the will does not desire of necessity whatever it desires
none	none	 Reply Obj one The will can tend to nothing except under the aspect of good But because good is of many kinds for this reason the will is not of necessity determined to one Reply Obj two 
8042-245695-0028	train-other-500	The mover then of necessity causes movement in the thing movable when the power of the mover exceeds the thing movable
none	none	 so that its entire capacity is subject to the mover 
8042-245695-0029	train-other-500	But as the capacity of the will regards the universal and perfect good its capacity is not subjected to any individual good
none	none	 And therefore it is not of necessity moved by it Reply Obj three 
8042-245695-0030	train-other-500	The sensitive power does not compare different things with each other as reason does but it simply apprehends some one thing Therefore according to that one thing it moves the sensitive appetite in a determinate way But the reason is a power that compares several things together
8042-245695-0031	train-other-500	therefore from several things the intellectual appetite that is the will may be moved but not of necessity from one thing THIRD ARTICLE
none	none	 I Q eighty two Art three 
8042-245695-0032	train-other-500	Whether the Will Is a Higher Power Than the Intellect Objection one It would seem that the will is a higher power than the intellect For the object of the will is good and the end But the end is the first and highest cause
8042-245695-0033	train-other-500	Therefore the will is the first and highest power
none	none	 Obj two Further in the order of natural things we observe a progress from imperfect things to perfect And this also appears in the powers of the soul for sense precedes the intellect which is more noble 
8042-245695-0034	train-other-500	Now the act of the will in the natural order follows the act of the intellect
none	none	 Therefore the will is a more noble and perfect power than the intellect Obj three 
8042-245695-0035	train-other-500	Further habits are proportioned to their powers as perfections to what they make perfect But the habit which perfects the will namely charity is more noble than the habits which perfect the intellect for it is written
none	none	 one Cor thirteen two 
8042-245695-0036	train-other-500	If I should know all mysteries and if I should have all faith and have not charity I am nothing Therefore the will is a higher power than the intellect
none	none	 On the contrary The Philosopher holds the intellect to be the higher power than the intellect I answer that 
8042-245695-0037	train-other-500	The superiority of one thing over another can be considered in two ways absolutely and relatively Now
none	none	 a thing is considered to be such absolutely which is considered such in itself 
8042-245695-0038	train-other-500	but relatively as it is such with regard to something else If therefore the intellect and will be considered with regard to themselves then the intellect is the higher power And this is clear if we compare their respective objects to one another
none	none	 For the object of the intellect is more simple and more absolute than the object of the will 
8042-245695-0039	train-other-500	since the object of the intellect is the very idea of appetible good and the appetible good the idea of which is in the intellect is the object of the will Now the more simple and the more abstract a thing is the nobler and higher it is in itself
8042-245695-0040	train-other-500	and therefore the object of the intellect is higher than the object of the will Therefore since the proper nature of a power is in its order to its object it follows that the intellect in itself and absolutely is higher and nobler than the will
8042-245695-0041	train-other-500	But relatively and by comparison with something else we find that the will is sometimes higher than the intellect from the fact that the object of the will occurs in something higher than that in which occurs the object of the intellect
8042-245695-0042	train-other-500	Thus for instance I might say that hearing is relatively nobler than sight inasmuch as something in which there is sound is nobler than something in which there is color though color is nobler and simpler than sound For as we have said above
none	none	 Q sixteen A one Q twenty seven A four the action of the intellect consists in this that the idea of the thing understood is in the one who understands while the act of the will consists in this that the will is inclined to the thing itself as existing in itself And therefore the Philosopher says in Metaph vi Did v two that good and evil which are objects of the will are in things but truth and error which are objects of the intellect are in the mind 
8042-245695-0043	train-other-500	When therefore the thing in which there is good is nobler than the soul itself in which is the idea understood by comparison with such a thing the will is higher than the intellect But when the thing which is good is less noble than the soul then even in comparison with that thing the intellect is higher than the will
8042-245695-0044	train-other-500	Wherefore the love of God is better than the knowledge of God but on the contrary the knowledge of corporeal things is better than the love thereof Absolutely however the intellect is nobler than the will
none	none	 Reply Obj one 
8042-245695-0045	train-other-500	The aspect of causality is perceived by comparing one thing to another
none	none	 and in such a comparison the idea of good is found to be nobler but truth signifies something more absolute and extends to the idea of good itself wherefore even good is something true But again truth is something good forasmuch as the intellect is a thing and truth its end And among other ends this is the most excellent as also is the intellect among the other powers Reply Obj two 
8042-245695-0046	train-other-500	What precedes in order of generation and time is less perfect for in one and in the same thing potentiality precedes act and imperfection precedes perfection
none	none	 But what precedes absolutely and in the order of nature is more perfect for thus act precedes potentiality 
8042-245695-0047	train-other-500	And in this way the intellect precedes the will as the motive power precedes the thing movable and as the active precedes the passive for good which is understood moves the will
none	none	 Reply Obj three 
8042-245695-0048	train-other-500	This reason is verified of the will as compared with what is above the soul For charity is the virtue by which we love God FOURTH ARTICLE
none	none	 I Q eighty two Art four Whether the Will Moves the Intellect Objection one It would seem that the will does not move the intellect For what moves excels and precedes what is moved because what moves is an agent and the agent is nobler than the patient as Augustine says general ad lit xii sixteen and the Philosopher De Anima iii five But the intellect excels and precedes the will as we have said above A three Therefore the will does not move the intellect Obj two Further what moves is not moved by what is moved except perhaps accidentally But the intellect moves the will 
8042-245695-0049	train-other-500	because the good apprehended by the intellect moves without being moved whereas the appetite moves and is moved Therefore the intellect is not moved by the will
none	none	 Obj three 
8042-245695-0050	train-other-500	Further we can will nothing but what we understand If therefore in order to understand the will moves by willing to understand
none	none	 that act of the will must be preceded by another act of the intellect and this act of the intellect by another act of the will 
8042-245695-0051	train-other-500	and so on indefinitely which is impossible Therefore the will does not move the intellect On the contrary Damascene says
none	none	 De Fide Orth ii twenty six 
8042-245695-0052	train-other-500	It is in our power to learn an art or not as we list But a thing is in our power by the will and we learn art by the intellect Therefore the will moves the intellect I answer that A thing is said to move in two ways First as an end
none	none	 for instance when we say that the end moves the agent In this way the intellect moves the will because the good understood is the object of the will and moves it as an end 
8042-245695-0053	train-other-500	Secondly a thing is said to move as an agent as what alters moves what is altered and what impels moves what is impelled In this way the will moves the intellect and all the powers of the soul as Anselm says
none	none	 Eadmer De Similitudinibus The reason is because wherever we have order among a number of active powers 
8042-245695-0054	train-other-500	that power which regards the universal end moves the powers which regard particular ends And we may observe this both in nature and in things politic For the heaven which aims at the universal preservation of things subject to generation and corruption moves all inferior bodies
8042-245695-0055	train-other-500	each of which aims at the preservation of its own species or of the individual The king also who aims at the common good of the whole kingdom by his rule moves all the governors of cities each of whom rules over his own particular city
none	none	 Now the object of the will is good and the end in general and each power is directed to some suitable good proper to it as sight is directed to the perception of color 
8042-245695-0056	train-other-500	and the intellect to the knowledge of truth
none	none	 Therefore the will as agent moves all the powers of the soul to their respective acts except the natural powers of the vegetative part which are not subject to our will Reply Obj one The intellect may be considered in two ways as apprehensive of universal being and truth and as a thing and a particular power having a determinate act In like manner also the will may be considered in two ways according to the common nature of its object that is to say 
8042-245695-0057	train-other-500	as appetitive of universal good and as a determinate power of the soul having a determinate act If therefore the intellect and the will be compared with one another
none	none	 according to the universality of their respective objects then as we have said above A three the intellect is simply higher and nobler than the will If however we take the intellect as regards the common nature of its object and the will as a determinate power then again the intellect is higher and nobler than the will because under the notion of being and truth 
8042-245695-0058	train-other-500	is contained both the will itself and its act and its object Wherefore the intellect understands the will and its act and its object just as it understands other species of things as stone or wood which are contained in the common notion of being and truth
none	none	 But if we consider the will as regards the common nature of its object which is good and the intellect as a thing and a special power then the intellect itself and its act and its object which is truth each of which is some species of good are contained under the common notion of good And in this way the will is higher than the intellect and can move it 
8042-245695-0059	train-other-500	From this we can easily understand why these powers include one another in their acts because the intellect understands that the will wills and the will wills the intellect to understand In the same way good is contained in truth inasmuch as it is an understood truth and truth in good
8042-245695-0060	train-other-500	inasmuch as it is a desired good
none	none	 Reply Obj two The intellect moves the will in one sense and the will moves the intellect in another as we have said above Reply Obj three There is no need to go on indefinitely but we must stop at the intellect as preceding all the rest 
8042-245695-0061	train-other-500	For every movement of the will must be preceded by apprehension whereas every apprehension is not preceded by an act of the will but the principle of counselling and understanding is an intellectual principle higher than our intellect namely God
none	none	 as also Aristotle says Eth Eudemic vii fourteen 
8042-245695-0062	train-other-500	and in this way he explains that there is no need to proceed indefinitely FIFTH ARTICLE
none	none	 I Q eighty two Art five Whether We Should Distinguish Irascible and Concupiscible Parts in the Superior Appetite 
8042-245695-0063	train-other-500	Objection one It would seem that we ought to distinguish irascible and concupiscible parts in the superior appetite which is the will For the concupiscible power is so called from
none	none	 concupiscere to desire and the irascible part from irasci 
8042-245695-0064	train-other-500	to be angry But there is a concupiscence which cannot belong to the sensitive appetite but only to the intellectual which is the will as the concupiscence of wisdom of which it is said
none	none	 Wis 
8042-245695-0065	train-other-500	six twenty one The concupiscence of wisdom bringeth to the eternal kingdom There is also a certain anger which cannot belong to the sensitive appetite but only to the intellectual as when our anger is directed against vice
none	none	 Wherefore Jerome commenting on Matt thirteen thirty three warns us 
8042-245695-0066	train-other-500	to have the hatred of vice in the irascible part Therefore we should distinguish irascible and concupiscible parts of the intellectual soul as well as in the sensitive
none	none	 Obj two 
8042-245695-0067	train-other-500	Further as is commonly said charity is in the concupiscible and hope in the irascible part But they cannot be in the sensitive appetite because their objects are not sensible but intellectual Therefore we must assign an irascible and concupiscible power to the intellectual part
none	none	 Obj three Further it is said De Spiritu et Anima that the soul has these powers 
8042-245695-0068	train-other-500	namely the irascible concupiscible and rational before it is united to the body
none	none	 But no power of the sensitive part belongs to the soul alone but to the soul and body united as we have said above Q seventy eight AA five 
8042-245695-0069	train-other-500	eight Therefore the irascible and concupiscible powers are in the will which is the intellectual appetite
none	none	 On the contrary Gregory of Nyssa Nemesius De Nat Hom says that the irrational part of the soul is divided into the desiderative and irascible and Damascene says the same De Fide Orth ii twelve And the Philosopher says De Anima iii nine that the will is in reason while in the irrational part of the soul are concupiscence and anger or desire and animus 
8042-245695-0070	train-other-500	I answer that The irascible and concupiscible are not parts of the intellectual appetite which is called the will Because as was said above
none	none	 Q fifty nine A four Q seventy nine A seven a power which is directed to an object according to some common notion is not differentiated by special differences which are contained under that common notion For instance because sight regards the visible thing under the common notion of something colored 
8042-245695-0071	train-other-500	the visual power is not multiplied according to the different kinds of color but if there were a power regarding white as white and not as something colored it would be distinct from a power regarding black as black
8042-245695-0072	train-other-500	Now the sensitive appetite does not consider the common notion of good because neither do the senses apprehend the universal
none	none	 And therefore the parts of the sensitive appetite are differentiated by the different notions of particular good 
8042-245695-0073	train-other-500	for the concupiscible regards as proper to it the notion of good as something pleasant to the senses and suitable to nature whereas the irascible regards the notion of good as something that wards off and repels what is hurtful But the will regards good according to the common notion of good and therefore in the will
8042-245695-0074	train-other-500	which is the intellectual appetite there is no differentiation of appetitive powers so that there be in the intellectual appetite an irascible power distinct from a concupiscible power just as neither on the part of the intellect are the apprehensive powers multiplied although they are on the part of the senses
none	none	 Reply Obj one 
8042-245695-0075	train-other-500	Love concupiscence and the like can be understood in two ways Sometimes they are taken as passions arising that is with a certain commotion of the soul And thus they are commonly understood and in this sense they are only in the sensitive appetite They may however be taken in another way
none	none	 as far as they are simple affections without passion or commotion of the soul and thus they are acts of the will And in this sense too they are attributed to the angels and to God But if taken in this sense they do not belong to different powers but only to one power which is called the will Reply Obj two The will itself may be said to be irascible as far as it wills to repel evil not from any sudden movement of a passion but from a judgment of the reason And in the same way the will may be said to be concupiscible on account of its desire for good 
8042-245695-0076	train-other-500	And thus in the irascible and concupiscible are charity and hope that is in the will as ordered to such acts And in this way too we may understand the words quoted
none	none	 De Spiritu et Anima that the irascible and concupiscible powers are in the soul before it is united to the body as long as we understand priority of nature and not of time although there is no need to have faith in what that book says Whence the answer to the third objection is clear QUESTION eighty three OF FREE WILL In Four Articles We now inquire concerning free will Under this head there are four points of inquiry one Whether man has free will two What is free will a power an act or a habit three If it is a power is it appetitive or cognitive four If it is appetitive is it the same power as the will or distinct FIRST ARTICLE I Q eighty three Art one Whether Man Has Free Will Objection one It would seem that man has not free will For whoever has free will does what he wills But man does not what he wills for it is written Rom seven nineteen For the good which I will I do not but the evil which I will not that I do Therefore man has not free will Obj two Further whoever has free will has in his power to will or not to will to do or not to do But this is not in man s power for it is written Rom nine sixteen It is not of him that willeth namely to will nor of him that runneth namely to run Therefore man has not free will Obj three Further what is free is cause of itself as the Philosopher says Metaph i two Therefore what is moved by another is not free But God moves the will for it is written Prov twenty one one The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord whithersoever He will He shall turn it and Phil two thirteen It is God Who worketh in you both to will and to accomplish Therefore man has not free will Obj four Further whoever has free will is master of his own actions But man is not master of his own actions for it is written Jer ten twenty three The way of a man is not his neither is it in a man to walk Therefore man has not free will Obj five Further the Philosopher says Ethic iii five According as each one is such does the end seem to him But it is not in our power to be of one quality or another for this comes to us from nature Therefore it is natural to us to follow some particular end and therefore we are not free in so doing On the contrary It is written Ecclus fifteen fourteen God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel and the gloss adds That is of his free will I answer that Man has free will otherwise counsels exhortations commands prohibitions rewards and punishments would be in vain In order to make this evident we must observe that some things act without judgment as a stone moves downwards and in like manner all things which lack knowledge And some act from judgment but not a free judgment as brute animals For the sheep seeing the wolf judges it a thing to be shunned from a natural and not a free judgment because it judges not from reason but from natural instinct And the same thing is to be said of any judgment of brute animals But man acts from judgment because by his apprehensive power he judges that something should be avoided or sought But because this judgment in the case of some particular act is not from a natural instinct but from some act of comparison in the reason therefore he acts from free judgment and retains the power of being inclined to various things For reason in contingent matters may follow opposite courses as we see in dialectic syllogisms and rhetorical arguments Now particular operations are contingent and therefore in such matters the judgment of reason may follow opposite courses and is not determinate to one And forasmuch as man is rational is it necessary that man have a free will Reply Obj one As we have said above Q eighty one A three ad two the sensitive appetite though it obeys the reason yet in a given case can resist by desiring what the reason forbids This is therefore the good which man does not when he wishes namely not to desire against reason as Augustine says Reply Obj two Those words of the Apostle are not to be taken as though man does not wish or does not run of his free will but because the free will is not sufficient thereto unless it be moved and helped by God Reply Obj three Free will is the cause of its own movement because by his free will man moves himself to act But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause God therefore is the first cause Who moves causes both natural and voluntary And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them for He operates in each thing according to its own nature Reply Obj four Man s way is said not to be his in the execution of his choice wherein he may be impeded whether he will or not The choice itself however is in us but presupposes the help of God Reply Obj five Quality in man is of two kinds natural and adventitious Now the natural quality may be in the intellectual part or in the body and its powers From the very fact therefore that man is such by virtue of a natural quality which is in the intellectual part he naturally desires his last end which is happiness Which desire indeed is a natural desire and is not subject to free will as is clear from what we have said above Q eighty two AA one two But on the part of the body and its powers man may be such by virtue of a natural quality inasmuch as he is of such a temperament or disposition due to any impression whatever produced by corporeal causes which cannot affect the intellectual part since it is not the act of a corporeal organ And such as a man is by virtue of a corporeal quality such also does his end seem to him because from such a disposition a man is inclined to choose or reject something But these inclinations are subject to the judgment of reason which the lower appetite obeys as we have said Q eighty one A three Wherefore this is in no way prejudicial to free will The adventitious qualities are habits and passions by virtue of which a man is inclined to one thing rather than to another And yet even these inclinations are subject to the judgment of reason Such qualities too are subject to reason as it is in our power either to acquire them whether by causing them or disposing ourselves to them or to reject them And so there is nothing in this that is repugnant to free will SECOND ARTICLE I Q eighty three Art two Whether Free Will Is a Power Objection one It would seem that free will is not a power For free will is nothing but a free judgment But judgment denominates an act not a power Therefore free will is not a power Obj two Further free will is defined as the faculty of the will and reason But faculty denominates a facility of power which is due to a habit Therefore free will is a habit Moreover Bernard says De Gratia et Lib Arb twelve that free will is the soul s habit of disposing of itself Therefore it is not a power Obj three Further no natural power is forfeited through sin But free will is forfeited through sin for Augustine says that man by abusing free will loses both it and himself Therefore free will is not a power On the contrary Nothing but a power seemingly is the subject of a habit But free will is the subject of grace by the help of which it chooses what is good Therefore free will is a power I answer that Although free will Liberum arbitrium i e free judgment in its strict sense denotes an act in the common manner of speaking we call free will that which is the principle of the act by which man judges freely Now in us the principle of an act is both power and habit for we say that we know something both by knowledge and by the intellectual power Therefore free will must be either a power or a habit or a power with a habit That it is neither a habit nor a power together with a habit can be clearly proved in two ways First of all because if it is a habit it must be a natural habit for it is natural to man to have a free will But there is not natural habit in us with respect to those things which come under free will for we are naturally inclined to those things of which we have natural habits for instance to assent to first principles while those things to which we are naturally inclined are not subject to free will as we have said of the desire of happiness Q eighty two AA one two Wherefore it is against the very notion of free will that it should be a natural habit And that it should be a non natural habit is against its nature Therefore in no sense is it a habit Secondly this is clear because habits are defined as that by reason of which we are well or ill disposed with regard to actions and passions Ethic ii five for by temperance we are well disposed as regards concupiscences and by intemperance ill disposed and by knowledge we are well disposed to the act of the intellect when we know the truth and by the contrary ill disposed But the free will is indifferent to good and evil choice wherefore it is impossible for free will to be a habit Therefore it is a power Reply Obj one It is not unusual for a power to be named from its act And so from this act which is a free judgment is named the power which is the principle of this act Otherwise if free will denominated an act it would not always remain in man Reply Obj two Faculty sometimes denominates a power ready for operation and in this sense faculty is used in the definition of free will But Bernard takes habit not as divided against power but as signifying a certain aptitude by which a man has some sort of relation to an act And this may be both by a power and by a habit for by a power man is as it were empowered to do the action and by the habit he is apt to act well or ill Reply Obj three Man is said to have lost free will by falling into sin not as to natural liberty which is freedom from coercion but as regards freedom from fault and unhappiness Of this we shall treat later in the treatise on Morals in the second part of this work I II Q eighty five seqq Q one hundred nine THIRD ARTICLE I Q eighty three Art three Whether Free will Is an Appetitive Power Objection one It would seem that free will is not an appetitive but a cognitive power For Damascene De Fide Orth ii twenty seven says that free will straightway accompanies the rational nature But reason is a cognitive power Therefore free will is a cognitive power Obj two Further free will is so called as though it were a free judgment But to judge is an act of a cognitive power Therefore free will is a cognitive power Obj three Further the principal function of free will is to choose But choice seems to belong to knowledge because it implies a certain comparison of one thing to another which belongs to the cognitive power Therefore free will is a cognitive power On the contrary The Philosopher says Ethic iii three that choice is the desire of those things which are in us But desire is an act of the appetitive power therefore choice is also But free will is that by which we choose Therefore free will is an appetitive power I answer that The proper act of free will is choice for we say that we have a free will because we can take one thing while refusing another and this is to choose Therefore we must consider the nature of free will by considering the nature of choice Now two things concur in choice one on the part of the cognitive power the other on the part of the appetitive power On the part of the cognitive power counsel is required by which we judge one thing to be preferred to another and on the part of the appetitive power it is required that the appetite should accept the judgment of counsel Therefore Aristotle Ethic vi two leaves it in doubt whether choice belongs principally to the appetitive or the cognitive power since he says that choice is either an appetitive intellect or an intellectual appetite But Ethic iii three he inclines to its being an intellectual appetite when he describes choice as a desire proceeding from counsel And the reason of this is because the proper object of choice is the means to the end and this as such is in the nature of that good which is called useful wherefore since good as such is the object of the appetite it follows that choice is principally an act of the appetitive power And thus free will is an appetitive power Reply Obj one The appetitive powers accompany the apprehensive and in this sense Damascene says that free will straightway accompanies the rational power Reply Obj two Judgment as it were concludes and terminates counsel Now counsel is terminated first by the judgment of reason secondly by the acceptation of the appetite whence the Philosopher Ethic iii three says that having formed a judgment by counsel we desire in accordance with that counsel And in this sense choice itself is a judgment from which free will takes its name Reply Obj three This comparison which is implied in the choice belongs to the preceding counsel which is an act of reason For though the appetite does not make comparisons yet forasmuch as it is moved by the apprehensive power which does compare it has some likeness of comparison by choosing one in preference to another FOURTH ARTICLE I Q eighty three Art four Whether Free will Is a Power Distinct from the Will Objection one It would seem that free will is a power distinct from the will For Damascene says De Fide Orth ii twenty two that thelesis is one thing and boulesis another But thelesis is the will while boulesis seems to be the free will because boulesis according to him is will as concerning an object by way of comparison between two things Therefore it seems that free will is a distinct power from the will Obj two Further powers are known by their acts But choice which is the act of free will is distinct from the act of willing because the act of the will regards the end whereas choice regards the means to the end Ethic iii two Therefore free will is a distinct power from the will Obj three Further the will is the intellectual appetite But in the intellect there are two powers the active and the passive Therefore also on the part of the intellectual appetite there must be another power besides the will And this seemingly can only be free will Therefore free will is a distinct power from the will On the contrary Damascene says De Fide Orth iii fourteen free will is nothing else than the will I answer that The appetitive powers must be proportionate to the apprehensive powers as we have said above Q sixty four A two Now as on the part of the intellectual apprehension we have intellect and reason so on the part of the intellectual appetite we have will and free will which is nothing else but the power of choice And this is clear from their relations to their respective objects and acts For the act of understanding implies the simple acceptation of something whence we say that we understand first principles which are known of themselves without any comparison But to reason properly speaking is to come from one thing to the knowledge of another wherefore properly speaking we reason about conclusions which are known from the principles In like manner on the part of the appetite to will implies the simple appetite for something wherefore the will is said to regard the end which is desired for itself But to choose is to desire something for the sake of obtaining something else wherefore properly speaking it regards the means to the end Now in matters of knowledge the principles are related to the conclusion to which we assent on account of the principles just as in appetitive matters the end is related to the means which is desired on account of the end Wherefore it is evident that as the intellect is to reason so is the will to the power of choice which is free will But it has been shown above Q seventy nine A eight that it belongs to the same power both to understand and to reason even as it belongs to the same power to be at rest and to be in movement Wherefore it belongs also to the same power to will and to choose and on this account the will and the free will are not two powers but one Reply Obj one Boulesis is distinct from thelesis on account of a distinction not of powers but of acts Reply Obj two Choice and will that is the act of willing are different acts yet they belong to the same power as also to understand and to reason as we have said Reply Obj three The intellect is compared to the will as moving the will And therefore there is no need to distinguish in the will an active and a passive will QUESTION eighty four HOW THE SOUL WHILE UNITED TO THE BODY UNDERSTANDS CORPOREAL THINGS BENEATH IT In Eight Articles We now have to consider the acts of the soul in regard to the intellectual and the appetitive powers for the other powers of the soul do not come directly under the consideration of the theologian Furthermore the acts of the appetitive part of the soul come under the consideration of the science of morals wherefore we shall treat of them in the second part of this work to which the consideration of moral matters belongs But of the acts of the intellectual part we shall treat now In treating of these acts we shall proceed in the following order First we shall inquire how the soul understands when united to the body secondly how it understands when separated therefrom The former of these inquiries will be threefold one How the soul understands bodies which are beneath it two How it understands itself and things contained in itself three How it understands immaterial substances which are above it In treating of the knowledge of corporeal things there are three points to be considered one Through what does the soul know them two How and in what order does it know them three What does it know in them Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry one Whether the soul knows bodies through the intellect two Whether it understands them through its essence or through any species three If through some species whether the species of all things intelligible are naturally innate in the soul four Whether these species are derived by the soul from certain separate immaterial forms five Whether our soul sees in the eternal ideas all that it understands six Whether it acquires intellectual knowledge from the senses seven Whether the intellect can through the species of which it is possessed actually understand without turning to the phantasms eight Whether the judgment of the intellect is hindered by an obstacle in the sensitive powers FIRST ARTICLE I Q eighty four Art one Whether the Soul Knows Bodies Through the Intellect Objection one 
8632-245697-0000	train-other-500	It would seem that the soul does not know bodies through the intellect
none	none	 For Augustine says Soliloq ii four 
8632-245697-0001	train-other-500	that bodies cannot be understood by the intellect nor indeed anything corporeal
none	none	 unless it can be perceived by the senses He says also general ad lit xii twenty four that intellectual vision is of those things that are in the soul by their essence But such are not bodies 
8632-245697-0002	train-other-500	Therefore the soul cannot know bodies through the intellect
none	none	 Obj two 
8632-245697-0003	train-other-500	Further as sense is to the intelligible so is the intellect to the sensible But the soul can by no means through the senses understand spiritual things which are intelligible Therefore by no means can it through the intellect know bodies which are sensible
none	none	 Obj three 
8632-245697-0004	train-other-500	Further the intellect is concerned with things that are necessary and unchangeable But all bodies are mobile and changeable Therefore the soul cannot know bodies through the intellect On the contrary Science is in the intellect
8632-245697-0005	train-other-500	If therefore the intellect does not know bodies it follows that there is no science of bodies and thus perishes natural science which treats of mobile bodies I answer that It should be said in order to elucidate this question
8632-245697-0006	train-other-500	that the early philosophers who inquired into the natures of things thought there was nothing in the world save bodies And because they observed that all bodies are mobile and considered them to be ever in a state of flux
8632-245697-0007	train-other-500	they were of opinion that we can have no certain knowledge of the true nature of things For what is in a continual state of flux cannot be grasped with any degree of certitude for it passes away
8632-245697-0008	train-other-500	ere the mind can form a judgment thereon according to the saying of Heraclitus that it is not possible twice to touch a drop of water in a passing torrent
none	none	 as the Philosopher relates Metaph iv Did iii five 
8632-245697-0009	train-other-500	After these came Plato who wishing to save the certitude of our knowledge of truth through the intellect maintained that besides these things corporeal there is another genus of beings separate from matter and movement
none	none	 which beings he called species or ideas 
8632-245697-0010	train-other-500	by participation of which each one of these singular and sensible things is said to be either a man or a horse or the like Wherefore he said that sciences and definitions and whatever appertains to the act of the intellect
8632-245697-0011	train-other-500	are not referred to these sensible bodies but to those beings immaterial and separate so that according to this the soul does not understand these corporeal things but the separate species thereof Now this may be shown to be false for two reasons First
8632-245697-0012	train-other-500	because since those species are immaterial and immovable knowledge of movement and matter would be excluded from science which knowledge is proper to natural science and likewise all demonstration through moving and material causes
none	none	 Secondly because it seems ridiculous 
8632-245697-0013	train-other-500	when we seek for knowledge of things which are to us manifest to introduce other beings which cannot be the substance of those others since they differ from them essentially
none	none	 so that granted that we have a knowledge of those separate substances 
8632-245697-0014	train-other-500	we cannot for that reason claim to form a judgment concerning these sensible things Now it seems that Plato strayed from the truth because having observed that all knowledge takes place through some kind of similitude he thought that the form of the thing known must of necessity be in the knower
none	none	 in the same manner as in the thing known 
8632-245697-0015	train-other-500	Then he observed that the form of the thing understood is in the intellect under conditions of universality immateriality and immobility which is apparent from the very operation of the intellect whose act of understanding
8632-245697-0016	train-other-500	has a universal extension and is subject to a certain amount of necessity for the mode of action corresponds to the mode of the agent s form Wherefore he concluded that the things which we understand must have in themselves
8632-245697-0017	train-other-500	an existence under the same conditions of immateriality and immobility But there is no necessity for this For even in sensible things it is to be observed that the form is otherwise in one sensible than in another for instance
8632-245697-0018	train-other-500	whiteness may be of great intensity in one and of a less intensity in another in one we find whiteness with sweetness in another without sweetness In the same way the sensible form is conditioned differently in the thing which is external to the soul
8632-245697-0019	train-other-500	and in the senses which receive the forms of sensible things without receiving matter such as the color of gold without receiving gold So also the intellect according to its own mode receives under conditions of immateriality and immobility
8632-245697-0020	train-other-500	the species of material and mobile bodies for the received is in the receiver according to the mode of the receiver We must conclude therefore that through the intellect the soul knows bodies by a knowledge which is immaterial universal and necessary
none	none	 Reply Obj one 
8632-245697-0021	train-other-500	These words of Augustine are to be understood as referring to the medium of intellectual knowledge and not to its object For the intellect knows bodies by understanding them not indeed through bodies nor through material and corporeal species
8632-245697-0022	train-other-500	but through immaterial and intelligible species
none	none	 which can be in the soul by their own essence Reply Obj two As Augustine says De Civ Dei xxii twenty nine it is not correct to say that as the sense knows only bodies so the intellect knows only spiritual things for it follows that God and the angels would not know corporeal things The reason of this diversity 
8632-245697-0023	train-other-500	is that the lower power does not extend to those things that belong to the higher power whereas the higher power operates in a more excellent manner those things which belong to the lower power
none	none	 Reply Obj three 
8632-245697-0024	train-other-500	Every movement presupposes something immovable for when a change of quality occurs
none	none	 the substance remains unmoved and when there is a change of substantial form matter remains unmoved Moreover the various conditions of mutable things are themselves immovable for instance though Socrates be not always sitting yet it is an immovable truth that whenever he does sit he remains in one place For this reason there is nothing to hinder our having an immovable science of movable things SECOND ARTICLE I Q eighty four Art two Whether the Soul Understands Corporeal Things Through Its Essence Objection one It would seem that the soul understands corporeal things through its essence For Augustine says De Trin x five 
8632-245697-0025	train-other-500	that the soul collects and lays hold of the images of bodies which are formed in the soul and of the soul for in forming them it gives them something of its own substance But the soul understands bodies by images of bodies
8632-245697-0026	train-other-500	Therefore the soul knows bodies through its essence which it employs for the formation of such images and from which it forms them
none	none	 Obj two Further the Philosopher says De Anima iii eight that the soul after a fashion is everything 
8632-245697-0027	train-other-500	Since therefore like is known by like it seems that the soul knows corporeal things through itself
none	none	 Obj three 
8632-245697-0028	train-other-500	Further the soul is superior to corporeal creatures Now lower things are in higher things in a more eminent way than in themselves
none	none	 as Dionysius says Coel Hier xii Therefore all corporeal creatures 
8632-245697-0029	train-other-500	exist in a more excellent way in the soul than in themselves Therefore the soul can know corporeal creatures through its essence On the contrary Augustine says
none	none	 De Trin ix three 
8632-245697-0030	train-other-500	that the mind gathers knowledge of corporeal things through the bodily senses But the soul itself cannot be known through the bodily senses Therefore it does not know corporeal things through itself I answer that
8632-245697-0031	train-other-500	The ancient philosophers held that the soul knows bodies through its essence For it was universally admitted that like is known by like But they thought that the form of the thing known is in the knower in the same mode as in the thing known
8632-245697-0032	train-other-500	The Platonists however were of a contrary opinion For Plato having observed that the intellectual soul has an immaterial nature and an immaterial mode of knowledge held that the forms of things known subsist immaterially
8632-245697-0033	train-other-500	While the earlier natural philosophers observing that things known are corporeal and material held that things known must exist materially even in the soul that knows them And therefore in order to ascribe
none	none	 to the soul a knowledge of all things 
8632-245697-0034	train-other-500	they held that it has the same nature in common with all And because the nature of a result is determined by its principles they ascribed to the soul the nature of a principle so that those who thought fire to be the principle of all
8632-245697-0035	train-other-500	held that the soul had the nature of fire and in like manner as to air and water Lastly Empedocles who held the existence of our four material elements and two principles of movement
8632-245697-0036	train-other-500	said that the soul was composed of these Consequently since they held that things exist in the soul materially they maintained that all the soul s knowledge is material thus failing to discern intellect from sense But this opinion will not hold
8632-245697-0037	train-other-500	First because in the material principle of which they spoke the various results do not exist save in potentiality But a thing is not known according as it is in potentiality but only according as it is in act
none	none	 as is shown Metaph ix Did viii nine 
8632-245697-0038	train-other-500	wherefore neither is a power known except through its act It is therefore insufficient to ascribe to the soul the nature of the principles in order to explain the fact that it knows all
8632-245697-0039	train-other-500	unless we further admit in the soul natures and forms of each individual result for instance of bone flesh and the like thus does Aristotle argue against Empedocles
none	none	 De Anima i five 
8632-245697-0040	train-other-500	Secondly because if it were necessary for the thing known to exist materially in the knower there would be no reason why things which have a material existence outside the soul should be devoid of knowledge why for instance if by fire the soul knows fire
8632-245697-0041	train-other-500	that fire also which is outside the soul should not have knowledge of fire We must conclude therefore that material things known must needs exist in the knower not materially
none	none	 but immaterially 
8632-245697-0042	train-other-500	The reason of this is because the act of knowledge extends to things outside the knower for we know things even that are external to us Now by matter the form of a thing is determined to some one thing
8632-245697-0043	train-other-500	Wherefore it is clear that knowledge is in inverse ratio of materiality And consequently things that are not receptive of forms save materially have no power of knowledge whatever such as plants
none	none	 as the Philosopher says De Anima ii twelve But the more immaterially a thing receives the form of the thing known the more perfect is its knowledge Therefore the intellect which abstracts the species not only from matter but also from the individuating conditions of matter has more perfect knowledge than the senses which receive the form of the thing known without matter indeed but subject to material conditions 
8632-245697-0044	train-other-500	Moreover among the senses sight has the most perfect knowledge because it is the least material as we have remarked above
none	none	 Q seventy eight A three 
8632-245697-0045	train-other-500	while among intellects the more perfect is the more immaterial It is therefore clear from the foregoing that if there be an intellect which knows all things by its essence then its essence must needs have all things in itself immaterially
8632-245697-0046	train-other-500	thus the early philosophers held that the essence of the soul that it may know all things must be actually composed of the principles of all material things
8632-245697-0047	train-other-500	Now this is proper to God that His Essence comprise all things immaterially as effects pre exist virtually in their cause God alone therefore understands all things through His Essence but neither the human soul nor the angels can do so
none	none	 Reply Obj one 
8632-245697-0048	train-other-500	Augustine in that passage is speaking of an imaginary vision which takes place through the image of bodies To the formation of such images the soul gives part of its substance just as a subject is given in order to be informed by some form
8632-245697-0049	train-other-500	In this way the soul makes such images from itself not that the soul or some part of the soul be turned into this or that image but just as we say that a body is made into something colored because of its being informed with color That this is the sense
8632-245697-0050	train-other-500	is clear from what follows For he says that the soul keeps something namely not informed with such image which is able freely to judge of the species of these images and that this is the mind or intellect
8632-245697-0051	train-other-500	And he says that the part which is informed with these images namely the imagination is common to us and beasts
none	none	 Reply Obj two 
8632-245697-0052	train-other-500	Aristotle did not hold that the soul is actually composed of all things as did the earlier philosophers he said that the soul is all things after a fashion forasmuch as it is in potentiality to all through the senses to all things sensible

8632-245697-0054	train-other-500	Every creature has a finite and determinate essence Wherefore although the essence of the higher creature has a certain likeness to the lower creature forasmuch as they have something in common generically
none	none	 yet it has not a complete likeness thereof because it is determined to a certain species other than the species of the lower creature But the Divine Essence is a perfect likeness of all whatsoever may be found to exist in things created being the universal principle of all THIRD ARTICLE I Q eighty four Art three Whether the Soul Understands All Things Through Innate Species Objection one It would seem that the soul understands all things through innate species For Gregory says in a homily for the Ascension xxix in Ev that man has understanding in common with the angels But angels understand all things through innate species wherefore in the book De Causis 
8632-245697-0055	train-other-500	it is said that every intelligence is full of forms Therefore the soul also has innate species of things by means of which it understands corporeal things
none	none	 Obj two 
8632-245697-0056	train-other-500	Further the intellectual soul is more excellent than corporeal primary matter But primary matter was created by God under the forms to which it has potentiality Therefore
8632-245697-0057	train-other-500	much more is the intellectual soul created by God under intelligible species And so the soul understands corporeal things through innate species
none	none	 Obj three Further no one can answer the truth except concerning what he knows But even a person untaught and devoid of acquired knowledge answers the truth to every question if put to him in orderly fashion as we find related in the Meno xv seqq of Plato concerning a certain individual Therefore we have some knowledge of things even before we acquire knowledge which would not be the case unless we had innate species Therefore the soul understands corporeal things through innate species On the contrary 
8632-245697-0058	train-other-500	The Philosopher speaking of the intellect says
none	none	 De Anima iii four 
8632-245697-0059	train-other-500	that it is like a tablet on which nothing is written I answer that Since form is the principle of action a thing must be related to the form which is the principle of an action as it is to that action for instance
8632-245697-0060	train-other-500	if upward motion is from lightness then that which only potentially moves upwards must needs be only potentially light but that which actually moves upwards must needs be actually light
8632-245697-0061	train-other-500	Now we observe that man sometimes is only a potential knower both as to sense and as to intellect And he is reduced from such potentiality to act through the action of sensible objects on his senses
none	none	 to the act of sensation 
8632-245697-0062	train-other-500	by instruction or discovery to the act of understanding Wherefore we must say that the cognitive soul is in potentiality both to the images which are the principles of sensing and to those which are the principles of understanding For this reason Aristotle
none	none	 De Anima iii four held that the intellect by which the soul understands has no innate species 
8632-245697-0063	train-other-500	but is at first in potentiality to all such species
none	none	 But since that which has a form actually is sometimes unable to act according to that form on account of some hindrance 
8632-245697-0064	train-other-500	as a light thing may be hindered from moving upwards for this reason did Plato hold that naturally man s intellect is filled with all intelligible species but that by being united to the body it is hindered from the realization of its act
8632-245697-0065	train-other-500	But this seems to be unreasonable First because if the soul has a natural knowledge of all things it seems impossible for the soul so far to forget the existence of such knowledge as not to know itself to be possessed thereof
8632-245697-0066	train-other-500	for no man forgets what he knows naturally that for instance the whole is larger than the part and such like And especially unreasonable does this seem if we suppose that it is natural to the soul
none	none	 to be united to the body as we have established above Q seventy six A one 
8632-245697-0067	train-other-500	for it is unreasonable that the natural operation of a thing be totally hindered by that which belongs to it naturally Secondly
none	none	 the falseness of this opinion is clearly proved from the fact that if a sense be wanting 
8632-245697-0068	train-other-500	the knowledge of what is apprehended through that sense is wanting also for instance a man who is born blind can have no knowledge of colors
none	none	 This would not be the case if the soul had innate images of all intelligible things We must therefore conclude that the soul does not know corporeal things through innate species Reply Obj one Man indeed has intelligence in common with the angels but not in the same degree of perfection just as the lower grades of bodies which merely exist according to Gregory Homily on Ascension xxix In Ev have not the same degree of perfection as the higher bodies For the matter of the lower bodies is not totally completed by its form but is in potentiality to forms which it has not 
8632-245697-0069	train-other-500	whereas the matter of heavenly bodies is totally completed by its form

8632-245697-0072	train-other-500	it is in potentiality to others On the other hand the intellect does not receive substantial being through the intelligible species and therefore there is no comparison

8632-245697-0073	train-other-500	If questions be put in an orderly fashion they proceed from universal self evident principles to what is particular Now by such a process knowledge is produced in the mind of the learner Wherefore when he answers the truth to a subsequent question

8632-245697-0075	train-other-500	Objection one It would seem that the intelligible species are derived by the soul from some separate forms For whatever is such by participation is caused by what is such essentially for instance
8632-245697-0076	train-other-500	that which is on fire is reduced to fire as the cause thereof But the intellectual soul forasmuch as it is actually understanding participates the thing understood for in a way the intellect in act is the thing understood in act
8632-245697-0077	train-other-500	Therefore what in itself and in its essence is understood in act
none	none	 is the cause that the intellectual soul actually understands Now that which in its essence is actually understood is a form existing without matter 
8632-245697-0078	train-other-500	Therefore the intelligible species by which the soul understands are caused by some separate forms
none	none	 Obj two 
8632-245697-0079	train-other-500	Further the intelligible is to the intellect as the sensible is to the sense But the sensible species which are in the senses and by which we sense are caused by the sensible object which exists actually outside the soul Therefore the intelligible species by which our intellect understands
8632-245697-0080	train-other-500	are caused by some things actually intelligible existing outside the soul But these can be nothing else than forms separate from matter Therefore the intelligible forms of our intellect are derived from some separate substances
none	none	 Obj three 
8632-245697-0081	train-other-500	Further whatever is in potentiality is reduced to act by something actual If therefore our intellect previously in potentiality afterwards actually understands this must needs be caused by some intellect which is always in act
8632-245697-0082	train-other-500	But this is a separate intellect Therefore the intelligible species by which we actually understand are caused by some separate substances On the contrary If this were true we should not need the senses in order to understand
8632-245697-0083	train-other-500	And this is proved to be false especially from the fact that if a man be wanting in a sense he cannot have any knowledge of the sensibles corresponding to that sense I answer that
8632-245697-0084	train-other-500	Some have held that the intelligible species of our intellect are derived from certain separate forms or substances And this in two ways
none	none	 For Plato as we have said A 
8632-245697-0085	train-other-500	one held that the forms of sensible things subsist by themselves without matter for instance the form of a man which he called per se man
none	none	 and the form or idea of a horse which is called per se horse 
8632-245697-0086	train-other-500	and so forth He said therefore that these forms are participated both by our soul and by corporeal matter by our soul to the effect of knowledge thereof and by corporeal matter to the effect of existence so that
8632-245697-0087	train-other-500	just as corporeal matter by participating the idea of a stone becomes an individuating stone so our intellect by participating the idea of a stone is made to understand a stone Now participation
8632-245697-0088	train-other-500	of an idea takes place by some image of the idea in the participator just as a model is participated by a copy So just as he held that the sensible forms which are in corporeal matter are derived from the ideas as certain images thereof
8632-245697-0089	train-other-500	so he held that the intelligible species of our intellect are images of the ideas derived therefrom And for this reason
none	none	 as we have said above A one 
8632-245697-0090	train-other-500	he referred sciences and definitions to those ideas
none	none	 But since it is contrary to the nature of sensible things that their forms should subsist without matter as Aristotle proves in many ways Metaph vi Avicenna De Anima v setting this opinion aside 
8632-245697-0091	train-other-500	held that the intelligible species of all sensible things instead of subsisting in themselves without matter pre exist immaterially in the separate intellects from the first of which said he such species are derived by a second
8632-245697-0092	train-other-500	and so on to the last separate intellect which he called the active intelligence from which according to him intelligible species flow into our souls and sensible species into corporeal matter
8632-245697-0093	train-other-500	And so Avicenna agrees with Plato in this that the intelligible species of our intellect are derived from certain separate forms but these Plato held to subsist of themselves while Avicenna placed them in the active intelligence
8632-245697-0094	train-other-500	They differ too in this respect that Avicenna held that the intelligible species do not remain in our intellect after it has ceased actually to understand and that it needs to turn to the active intellect in order to receive them anew
8632-245697-0095	train-other-500	Consequently he does not hold that the soul has innate knowledge as Plato who held that the participated ideas remain immovably in the soul But in this opinion no sufficient reason can be assigned for the soul being united to the body
none	none	 For it cannot be said that the intellectual soul is united to the body for the sake of the body 
8632-245697-0096	train-other-500	for neither is form for the sake of matter nor is the mover for the sake of the moved but rather the reverse Especially does the body seem necessary to the intellectual soul for the latter s proper operation which is to understand since as to its being
8632-245697-0097	train-other-500	the soul does not depend on the body But if the soul by its very nature had an inborn aptitude for receiving intelligible species through the influence of only certain separate principles and were not to receive them from the senses
8632-245697-0098	train-other-500	it would not need the body in order to understand wherefore to no purpose would it be united to the body But if it be said that our soul needs the senses in order to understand through being in some way awakened by them to the consideration of those things
8632-245697-0099	train-other-500	the intelligible species of which it receives from the separate principles even this seems an insufficient explanation For this awakening does not seem necessary to the soul
none	none	 except in as far as it is overcome by sluggishness as the Platonists expressed it and by forgetfulness through its union with the body 
8632-245697-0100	train-other-500	and thus the senses would be of no use to the intellectual soul except for the purpose of removing the obstacle which the soul encounters through its union with the body Consequently the reason of the union of the soul with the body still remains to be sought
8632-245697-0101	train-other-500	And if it be said with Avicenna that the senses are necessary to the soul because by them it is aroused to turn to the active intelligence from which it receives the species neither is this a sufficient explanation
8632-245697-0102	train-other-500	Because if it is natural for the soul to understand through species derived from the active intelligence it follows that at times the soul of an individual wanting in one of the senses
none	none	 can turn to the active intelligence 
8632-245697-0103	train-other-500	either from the inclination of its very nature or through being roused by another sense to the effect of receiving the intelligible species of which the corresponding sensible species are wanting And thus a man born blind could have knowledge of colors which is clearly untrue
8632-245697-0104	train-other-500	We must therefore conclude that the intelligible species by which our soul understands are not derived from separate forms
none	none	 Reply Obj one 
8632-245697-0105	train-other-500	The intelligible species which are participated by our intellect are reduced as to their first cause to a first principle which is by its essence intelligible namely God But they proceed from that principle by means of the sensible forms and material things from which we gather knowledge
none	none	 as Dionysius says Div Nom vii Reply Obj two

four and not by a separate intelligence as proximate cause although perchance as remote cause FIFTH ARTICLE I Q eighty four Art five Whether the Intellectual Soul Knows Material Things in the Eternal Types Objection one It would seem that the intellectual soul does not know material things in the eternal types For that in which anything is known must itself be known more and previously But the intellectual soul of man in the present state of life does not know the eternal types for it does not know God in Whom the eternal types exist but is united to God as to the unknown as Dionysius says Myst Theolog i Therefore the soul does not know all in the eternal types Obj two Further it is written Rom one twenty that the invisible things of God are clearly seen by the things that are made But among the invisible things of God are the eternal types Therefore the eternal types are known through creatures and not the converse Obj three Further the eternal types are nothing else but ideas for Augustine says QQ eighty three qu forty six that ideas are permanent types existing in the Divine mind If therefore we say that the intellectual soul knows all things in the eternal types we come back to the opinion of Plato who said that all knowledge is derived from them On the contrary Augustine says Confess xii twenty five If we both see that what you say is true and if we both see that what I say is true where do we see this I pray Neither do I see it in you nor do you see it in me but we both see it in the unchangeable truth which is above our minds Now the unchangeable truth is contained in the eternal types Therefore the intellectual soul knows all true things in the eternal types I answer that As Augustine says De Doctr Christ ii eleven If those who are called philosophers said by chance anything that was true and consistent with our faith we must claim it from them as from unjust possessors For some of the doctrines of the heathens are spurious imitations or superstitious inventions which we must be careful to avoid when we renounce the society of the heathens Consequently whenever Augustine who was imbued with the doctrines of the Platonists found in their teaching anything consistent with faith he adopted it and those thing which he found contrary to faith he amended Now Plato held as we have said above A four that the forms of things subsist of themselves apart from matter and these he called ideas by participation of which he said that our intellect knows all things so that just as corporeal matter by participating the idea of a stone becomes a stone so our intellect by participating the same idea has knowledge of a stone But since it seems contrary to faith that forms of things themselves outside the things themselves and apart from matter as the Platonists held asserting that per se life or per se wisdom are creative substances as Dionysius relates Div Nom xi therefore Augustine QQ eighty three qu forty six for the ideas defended by Plato substituted the types of all creatures existing in the Divine mind according to which types all things are made in themselves and are known to the human soul When therefore the question is asked Does the human soul know all things in the eternal types we must reply that one thing is said to be known in another in two ways First as in an object itself known as one may see in a mirror the images of things reflected therein In this way the soul in the present state of life cannot see all things in the eternal types but the blessed who see God and all things in Him thus know all things in the eternal types Secondly one thing is said to be known in another as in a principle of knowledge thus we might say that we see in the sun what we see by the sun And thus we must needs say that the human soul knows all things in the eternal types since by participation of these types we know all things For the intellectual light itself which is in us is nothing else than a participated likeness of the uncreated light in which are contained the eternal types Whence it is written Ps four six seven Many say Who showeth us good things which question the Psalmist answers The light of Thy countenance O Lord is signed upon us as though he were to say By the seal of the Divine light in us all things are made known to us But since besides the intellectual light which is in us intelligible species which are derived from things are required in order for us to have knowledge of material things therefore this same knowledge is not due merely to a participation of the eternal types as the Platonists held maintaining that the mere participation of ideas sufficed for knowledge Wherefore Augustine says De Trin iv sixteen Although the philosophers prove by convincing arguments that all things occur in time according to the eternal types were they able to see in the eternal types or to find out from them how many kinds of animals there are and the origin of each Did they not seek for this information from the story of times and places But that Augustine did not understand all things to be known in their eternal types or in the unchangeable truth as though the eternal types themselves were seen is clear from what he says QQ eighty three qu forty six viz that not each and every rational soul can be said to be worthy of that vision namely of the eternal types but only those that are holy and pure such as the souls of the blessed From what has been said the objections are easily solved SIXTH ARTICLE I Q eighty four Art six Whether Intellectual Knowledge Is Derived from Sensible Things Objection one It would seem that intellectual knowledge is not derived from sensible things For Augustine says QQ eighty three qu nine that we cannot expect to learn the fulness of truth from the senses of the body This he proves in two ways First because whatever the bodily senses reach is continually being changed and what is never the same cannot be perceived Secondly because whatever we perceive by the body even when not present to the senses may be present to the imagination as when we are asleep or angry yet we cannot discern by the senses whether what we perceive be the sensible object or the deceptive image thereof Now nothing can be perceived which cannot be distinguished from its counterfeit And so he concludes that we cannot expect to learn the truth from the senses But intellectual knowledge apprehends the truth Therefore intellectual knowledge cannot be conveyed by the senses Obj two Further Augustine says general ad lit xii sixteen We must not think that the body can make any impression on the spirit as though the spirit were to supply the place of matter in regard to the body s action for that which acts is in every way more excellent than that which it acts on Whence he concludes that the body does not cause its image in the spirit but the spirit causes it in itself Therefore intellectual knowledge is not derived from sensible things Obj three Further an effect does not surpass the power of its cause But intellectual knowledge extends beyond sensible things for we understand some things which cannot be perceived by the senses Therefore intellectual knowledge is not derived from sensible things On the contrary The Philosopher says Metaph i one Poster ii fifteen that the principle of knowledge is in the senses I answer that On this point the philosophers held three opinions For Democritus held that all knowledge is caused by images issuing from the bodies we think of and entering into our souls as Augustine says in his letter to Dioscorus cxviii four And Aristotle says De Somn et Vigil that Democritus held that knowledge is caused by a discharge of images And the reason for this opinion was that both Democritus and the other early philosophers did not distinguish between intellect and sense as Aristotle relates De Anima iii three Consequently since the sense is affected by the sensible they thought that all our knowledge is affected by this mere impression brought about by sensible things Which impression Democritus held to be caused by a discharge of images Plato on the other hand held that the intellect is distinct from the senses and that it is an immaterial power not making use of a corporeal organ for its action And since the incorporeal cannot be affected by the corporeal he held that intellectual knowledge is not brought about by sensible things affecting the intellect but by separate intelligible forms being participated by the intellect as we have said above AA four five Moreover he held that sense is a power operating of itself Consequently neither is sense since it is a spiritual power affected by the sensible but the sensible organs are affected by the sensible the result being that the soul is in a way roused to form within itself the species of the sensible Augustine seems to touch on this opinion general ad lit xii twenty four where he says that the body feels not but the soul through the body which it makes use of as a kind of messenger for reproducing within itself what is announced from without Thus according to Plato neither does intellectual knowledge proceed from sensible knowledge nor sensible knowledge exclusively from sensible things but these rouse the sensible soul to the sentient act while the senses rouse the intellect to the act of understanding Aristotle chose a middle course For with Plato he agreed that intellect and sense are different But he held that the sense has not its proper operation without the cooperation of the body so that to feel is not an act of the soul alone but of the composite And he held the same in regard to all the operations of the sensitive part Since therefore it is not unreasonable that the sensible objects which are outside the soul should produce some effect in the composite Aristotle agreed with Democritus in this that the operations of the sensitive part are caused by the impression of the sensible on the sense not by a discharge as Democritus said but by some kind of operation For Democritus maintained that every operation is by way of a discharge of atoms as we gather from De Gener i eight But Aristotle held that the intellect has an operation which is independent of the body s cooperation Now nothing corporeal can make an impression on the incorporeal And therefore in order to cause the intellectual operation according to Aristotle the impression caused by the sensible does not suffice but something more noble is required for the agent is more noble than the patient as he says De Gener i five Not indeed in the sense that the intellectual operation is effected in us by the mere impression of some superior beings as Plato held but that the higher and more noble agent which he calls the active intellect of which we have spoken above Q seventy nine AA three four causes the phantasms received from the senses to be actually intelligible by a process of abstraction According to this opinion then on the part of the phantasms intellectual knowledge is caused by the senses But since the phantasms cannot of themselves affect the passive intellect and require to be made actually intelligible by the active intellect it cannot be said that sensible knowledge is the total and perfect cause of intellectual knowledge but rather that it is in a way the material cause Reply Obj one Those words of Augustine mean that we must not expect the entire truth from the senses For the light of the active intellect is needed through which we achieve the unchangeable truth of changeable things and discern things themselves from their likeness Reply Obj two In this passage Augustine speaks not of intellectual but of imaginary knowledge And since according to the opinion of Plato the imagination has an operation which belongs to the soul only Augustine in order to show that corporeal images are impressed on the imagination not by bodies but by the soul uses the same argument as Aristotle does in proving that the active intellect must be separate namely because the agent is more noble than the patient And without doubt according to the above opinion in the imagination there must needs be not only a passive but also an active power But if we hold according to the opinion of Aristotle that the action of the imagination is an action of the composite there is no difficulty because the sensible body is more noble than the organ of the animal in so far as it is compared to it as a being in act to a being in potentiality even as the object actually colored is compared to the pupil which is potentially colored It may however be said although the first impression of the imagination is through the agency of the sensible since fancy is movement produced in accordance with sensation De Anima iii three that nevertheless there is in man an operation which by synthesis and analysis forms images of various things even of things not perceived by the senses And Augustine s words may be taken in this sense Reply Obj three Sensitive knowledge is not the entire cause of intellectual knowledge And therefore it is not strange that intellectual knowledge should extend further than sensitive knowledge SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q eighty four Art seven Whether the Intellect Can Actually Understand Through the Intelligible Species of Which It Is Possessed Without Turning to the Phantasms Objection one It would seem that the intellect can actually understand through the intelligible species of which it is possessed without turning to the phantasms For the intellect is made actual by the intelligible species by which it is informed But if the intellect is in act it understands Therefore the intelligible species suffices for the intellect to understand actually without turning to the phantasms Obj two Further the imagination is more dependent on the senses than the intellect on the imagination But the imagination can actually imagine in the absence of the sensible Therefore much more can the intellect understand without turning to the phantasms Obj three There are no phantasms of incorporeal things for the imagination does not transcend time and space If therefore our intellect cannot understand anything actually without turning to the phantasms it follows that it cannot understand anything incorporeal Which is clearly false for we understand truth and God and the angels On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima iii seven that the soul understands nothing without a phantasm I answer that In the present state of life in which the soul is united to a passible body it is impossible for our intellect to understand anything actually except by turning to the phantasms First of all because the intellect being a power that does not make use of a corporeal organ would in no way be hindered in its act through the lesion of a corporeal organ if for its act there were not required the act of some power that does make use of a corporeal organ Now sense imagination and the other powers belonging to the sensitive part make use of a corporeal organ Wherefore it is clear that for the intellect to understand actually not only when it acquires fresh knowledge but also when it applies knowledge already acquired there is need for the act of the imagination and of the other powers For when the act of the imagination is hindered by a lesion of the corporeal organ for instance in a case of frenzy or when the act of the memory is hindered as in the case of lethargy we see that a man is hindered from actually understanding things of which he had a previous knowledge Secondly anyone can experience this of himself that when he tries to understand something he forms certain phantasms to serve him by way of examples in which as it were he examines what he is desirous of understanding For this reason it is that when we wish to help someone to understand something we lay examples before him from which he forms phantasms for the purpose of understanding Now the reason of this is that the power of knowledge is proportioned to the thing known Wherefore the proper object of the angelic intellect which is entirely separate from a body is an intelligible substance separate from a body Whereas the proper object of the human intellect which is united to a body is a quiddity or nature existing in corporeal matter and through such natures of visible things it rises to a certain knowledge of things invisible Now it belongs to such a nature to exist in an individual and this cannot be apart from corporeal matter for instance it belongs to the nature of a stone to be in an individual stone and to the nature of a horse to be in an individual horse and so forth Wherefore the nature of a stone or any material thing cannot be known completely and truly except in as much as it is known as existing in the individual Now we apprehend the individual through the senses and the imagination And therefore for the intellect to understand actually its proper object it must of necessity turn to the phantasms in order to perceive the universal nature existing in the individual But if the proper object of our intellect were a separate form or if as the Platonists say the natures of sensible things subsisted apart from the individual there would be no need for the intellect to turn to the phantasms whenever it understands Reply Obj one The species preserved in the passive intellect exist there habitually when it does not understand them actually as we have said above Q seventy nine A six Wherefore for us to understand actually the fact that the species are preserved does not suffice we need further to make use of them in a manner befitting the things of which they are the species which things are natures existing in individuals Reply Obj two Even the phantasm is the likeness of an individual thing wherefore the imagination does not need any further likeness of the individual whereas the intellect does Reply Obj three Incorporeal things of which there are no phantasms are known to us by comparison with sensible bodies of which there are phantasms Thus we understand truth by considering a thing of which we possess the truth and God as Dionysius says Div Nom i we know as cause by way of excess and by way of remotion Other incorporeal substances we know in the present state of life only by way of remotion or by some comparison to corporeal things And therefore when we understand something about these things we need to turn to phantasms of bodies although there are no phantasms of the things themselves EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q eighty four Art eight Whether the Judgment of the Intellect Is Hindered Through Suspension of the Sensitive Powers Objection one It would seem that the judgment of the intellect is not hindered by suspension of the sensitive powers For the superior does not depend on the inferior But the judgment of the intellect is higher than the senses Therefore the judgment of the intellect is not hindered through suspension of the senses Obj two Further to syllogize is an act of the intellect But during sleep the senses are suspended as is said in De Somn et Vigil i and yet it sometimes happens to us to syllogize while asleep Therefore the judgment of the intellect is not hindered through suspension of the senses On the contrary What a man does while asleep against the moral law is not imputed to him as a sin as Augustine says general ad lit xii fifteen But this would not be the case if man while asleep had free use of his reason and intellect Therefore the judgment of the intellect is hindered by suspension of the senses I answer that As we have said above A seven our intellect s proper and proportionate object is the nature of a sensible thing Now a perfect judgment concerning anything cannot be formed unless all that pertains to that thing s nature be known especially if that be ignored which is the term and end of judgment Now the Philosopher says De Coel iii that as the end of a practical science is action so the end of natural science is that which is perceived principally through the senses for the smith does not seek knowledge of a knife except for the purpose of action in order that he may produce a certain individual knife and in like manner the natural philosopher does not seek to know the nature of a stone and of a horse save for the purpose of knowing the essential properties of those things which he perceives with his senses Now it is clear that a smith cannot judge perfectly of a knife unless he knows the action of the knife and in like manner the natural philosopher cannot judge perfectly of natural things unless he knows sensible things But in the present state of life whatever we understand we know by comparison to natural sensible things Consequently it is not possible for our intellect to form a perfect judgment while the senses are suspended through which sensible things are known to us Reply Obj one Although the intellect is superior to the senses nevertheless in a manner it receives from the senses and its first and principal objects are founded in sensible things And therefore suspension of the senses necessarily involves a hindrance to the judgment of the intellect Reply Obj two The senses are suspended in the sleeper through certain evaporations and the escape of certain exhalations as we read in De Somn et Vigil iii And therefore according to the amount of such evaporation the senses are more or less suspended For when the amount is considerable not only are the senses suspended but also the imagination so that there are no phantasms thus does it happen especially when a man falls asleep after eating and drinking copiously If however the evaporation be somewhat less phantasms appear but distorted and without sequence thus it happens in a case of fever And if the evaporation be still more attenuated the phantasms will have a certain sequence thus especially does it happen towards the end of sleep in sober men and those who are gifted with a strong imagination If the evaporation be very slight not only does the imagination retain its freedom but also the common sense is partly freed so that sometimes while asleep a man may judge that what he sees is a dream discerning as it were between things and their images Nevertheless the common sense remains partly suspended and therefore although it discriminates some images from the reality yet is it always deceived in some particular Therefore while man is asleep according as sense and imagination are free so is the judgment of his intellect unfettered though not entirely Consequently if a man syllogizes while asleep when he wakes up he invariably recognizes a flaw in some respect QUESTION eighty five OF THE MODE AND ORDER OF UNDERSTANDING In Eight Articles We come now to consider the mode and order of understanding Under this head there are eight points of inquiry one Whether our intellect understands by abstracting the species from the phantasms two Whether the intelligible species abstracted from the phantasms are what our intellect understands or that whereby it understands three Whether our intellect naturally first understands the more universal four Whether our intellect can know many things at the same time five Whether our intellect understands by the process of composition and division six Whether the intellect can err seven Whether one intellect can understand better than another eight Whether our intellect understands the indivisible before the divisible FIRST ARTICLE I Q eighty five Art one Whether Our Intellect Understands Corporeal and Material Things by Abstraction from Phantasms Objection one It would seem that our intellect does not understand corporeal and material things by abstraction from the phantasms For the intellect is false if it understands an object otherwise than as it really is Now the forms of material things do not exist as abstracted from the particular things represented by the phantasms Therefore if we understand material things by abstraction of the species from the phantasm there will be error in the intellect Obj two Further material things are those natural things which include matter in their definition But nothing can be understood apart from that which enters into its definition Therefore material things cannot be understood apart from matter Now matter is the principle of individualization Therefore material things cannot be understood by abstraction of the universal from the particular which is the process whereby the intelligible species is abstracted from the phantasm Obj three Further the Philosopher says De Anima iii seven that the phantasm is to the intellectual soul what color is to the sight But seeing is not caused by abstraction of species from color but by color impressing itself on the sight Therefore neither does the act of understanding take place by abstraction of something from the phantasm but by the phantasm impressing itself on the intellect Obj four Further the Philosopher says De Anima iii five there are two things in the intellectual soul the passive intellect and the active intellect But it does not belong to the passive intellect to abstract the intelligible species from the phantasm but to receive them when abstracted Neither does it seem to be the function of the active intellect which is related to the phantasm as light is to color since light does not abstract anything from color but rather streams on to it Therefore in no way do we understand by abstraction from phantasms Obj five Further the Philosopher De Anima iii seven says that the intellect understands the species in the phantasm and not therefore by abstraction On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima iii four that things are intelligible in proportion as they are separate from matter Therefore material things must needs be understood according as they are abstracted from matter and from material images namely phantasms I answer that As stated above Q eighty four A seven the object of knowledge is proportionate to the power of knowledge Now there are three grades of the cognitive powers For one cognitive power namely the sense is the act of a corporeal organ And therefore the object of every sensitive power is a form as existing in corporeal matter And since such matter is the principle of individuality therefore every power of the sensitive part can only have knowledge of the individual There is another grade of cognitive power which is neither the act of a corporeal organ nor in any way connected with corporeal matter such is the angelic intellect the object of whose cognitive power is therefore a form existing apart from matter for though angels know material things yet they do not know them save in something immaterial namely either in themselves or in God But the human intellect holds a middle place for it is not the act of an organ yet it is a power of the soul which is the form of the body as is clear from what we have said above Q seventy six A one And therefore it is proper to it to know a form existing individually in corporeal matter but not as existing in this individual matter But to know what is in individual matter not as existing in such matter is to abstract the form from individual matter which is represented by the phantasms Therefore we must needs say that our intellect understands material things by abstracting from the phantasms and through material things thus considered we acquire some knowledge of immaterial things just as on the contrary angels know material things through the immaterial But Plato considering only the immateriality of the human intellect and not its being in a way united to the body held that the objects of the intellect are separate ideas and that we understand not by abstraction but by participating things abstract as stated above Q eighty four A one Reply Obj one Abstraction may occur in two ways First by way of composition and division thus we may understand that one thing does not exist in some other or that it is separate therefrom Secondly by way of simple and absolute consideration thus we understand one thing without considering the other Thus for the intellect to abstract one from another things which are not really abstract from one another does in the first mode of abstraction imply falsehood But in the second mode of abstraction for the intellect to abstract things which are not really abstract from one another does not involve falsehood as clearly appears in the case of the senses For if we understood or said that color is not in a colored body or that it is separate from it there would be error in this opinion or assertion But if we consider color and its properties without reference to the apple which is colored or if we express in word what we thus understand there is no error in such an opinion or assertion because an apple is not essential to color and therefore color can be understood independently of the apple Likewise the things which belong to the species of a material thing such as a stone or a man or a horse can be thought of apart from the individualizing principles which do not belong to the notion of the species This is what we mean by abstracting the universal from the particular or the intelligible species from the phantasm that is by considering the nature of the species apart from its individual qualities represented by the phantasms If therefore the intellect is said to be false when it understands a thing otherwise than as it is that is so if the word otherwise refers to the thing understood for the intellect is false when it understands a thing otherwise than as it is and so the intellect would be false if it abstracted the species of a stone from its matter in such a way as to regard the species as not existing in matter as Plato held But it is not so if the word otherwise be taken as referring to the one who understands For it is quite true that the mode of understanding in one who understands is not the same as the mode of a thing in existing since the thing understood is immaterially in the one who understands according to the mode of the intellect and not materially according to the mode of a material thing Reply Obj two Some have thought that the species of a natural thing is a form only and that matter is not part of the species If that were so matter would not enter into the definition of natural things Therefore it must be said otherwise that matter is twofold common and signate or individual common such as flesh and bone and individual as this flesh and these bones The intellect therefore abstracts the species of a natural thing from the individual sensible matter but not from the common sensible matter for example it abstracts the species of man from this flesh and these bones which do not belong to the species as such but to the individual Metaph vii Did vi ten and need not be considered in the species whereas the species of man cannot be abstracted by the intellect from flesh and bones Mathematical species however can be abstracted by the intellect from sensible matter not only from individual but also from common matter not from common intelligible matter but only from individual matter For sensible matter is corporeal matter as subject to sensible qualities such as being cold or hot hard or soft and the like while intelligible matter is substance as subject to quantity Now it is manifest that quantity is in substance before other sensible qualities are Hence quantities such as number dimension and figures which are the terminations of quantity can be considered apart from sensible qualities and this is to abstract them from sensible matter but they cannot be considered without understanding the substance which is subject to the quantity for that would be to abstract them from common intelligible matter Yet they can be considered apart from this or that substance for that is to abstract them from individual intelligible matter But some things can be abstracted even from common intelligible matter such as being unity power act and the like all these can exist without matter as is plain regarding immaterial things Because Plato failed to consider the twofold kind of abstraction as above explained ad one he held that all those things which we have stated to be abstracted by the intellect are abstract in reality Reply Obj three Colors as being in individual corporeal matter have the same mode of existence as the power of sight therefore they can impress their own image on the eye But phantasms since they are images of individuals and exist in corporeal organs have not the same mode of existence as the human intellect and therefore have not the power of themselves to make an impression on the passive intellect This is done by the power of the active intellect which by turning towards the phantasm produces in the passive intellect a certain likeness which represents as to its specific conditions only the thing reflected in the phantasm It is thus that the intelligible species is said to be abstracted from the phantasm not that the identical form which previously was in the phantasm is subsequently in the passive intellect as a body transferred from one place to another Reply Obj four Not only does the active intellect throw light on the phantasm it does more by its own power it abstracts the intelligible species from the phantasm It throws light on the phantasm because just as the sensitive part acquires a greater power by its conjunction with the intellectual part so by the power of the active intellect the phantasms are made more fit for the abstraction therefrom of intelligible intentions Furthermore the active intellect abstracts the intelligible species from the phantasm forasmuch as by the power of the active intellect we are able to disregard the conditions of individuality and to take into our consideration the specific nature the image of which informs the passive intellect Reply Obj five Our intellect both abstracts the intelligible species from the phantasms inasmuch as it considers the natures of things in universal and nevertheless understands these natures in the phantasms since it cannot understand even the things of which it abstracts the species without turning to the phantasms as we have said above Q eighty four A seven SECOND ARTICLE I Q eighty five Art two Whether the Intelligible Species Abstracted from the Phantasm Is Related to Our Intellect As That Which Is Understood Objection one It would seem that the intelligible species abstracted from the phantasm is related to our intellect as that which is understood For the understood in act is in the one who understands since the understood in act is the intellect itself in act But nothing of what is understood is in the intellect actually understanding save the abstracted intelligible species Therefore this species is what is actually understood Obj two Further what is actually understood must be in something else it would be nothing But it is not in something outside the soul for since what is outside the soul is material nothing therein can be actually understood Therefore what is actually understood is in the intellect Consequently it can be nothing else than the aforesaid intelligible species Obj three Further the Philosopher says one Peri Herm i that words are signs of the passions in the soul But words signify the things understood for we express by word what we understand Therefore these passions of the soul viz the intelligible species are what is actually understood On the contrary The intelligible species is to the intellect what the sensible image is to the sense But the sensible image is not what is perceived but rather that by which sense perceives Therefore the intelligible species is not what is actually understood but that by which the intellect understands I answer that Some have asserted that our intellectual faculties know only the impression made on them as for example that sense is cognizant only of the impression made on its own organ According to this theory the intellect understands only its own impression namely the intelligible species which it has received so that this species is what is understood This is however manifestly false for two reasons First because the things we understand are the objects of science therefore if what we understand is merely the intelligible species in the soul it would follow that every science would not be concerned with objects outside the soul but only with the intelligible species within the soul thus according to the teaching of the Platonists all science is about ideas which they held to be actually understood Q eighty four A one Secondly it is untrue because it would lead to the opinion of the ancients who maintained that whatever seems is true Aristotle Metaph iii five and that consequently contradictories are true simultaneously For if the faculty knows its own impression only it can judge of that only Now a thing seems according to the impression made on the cognitive faculty Consequently the cognitive faculty will always judge of its own impression as such and so every judgment will be true for instance if taste perceived only its own impression when anyone with a healthy taste perceives that honey is sweet he would judge truly and if anyone with a corrupt taste perceives that honey is bitter this would be equally true for each would judge according to the impression on his taste Thus every opinion would be equally true in fact every sort of apprehension Therefore it must be said that the intelligible species is related to the intellect as that by which it understands which is proved thus There is a twofold action Metaph ix Did viii eight one which remains in the agent for instance to see and to understand and another which passes into an external object for instance to heat and to cut and each of these actions proceeds in virtue of some form And as the form from which proceeds an act tending to something external is the likeness of the object of the action as heat in the heater is a likeness of the thing heated so the form from which proceeds an action remaining in the agent is the likeness of the object Hence that by which the sight sees is the likeness of the visible thing and the likeness of the thing understood that is the intelligible species is the form by which the intellect understands But since the intellect reflects upon itself by such reflection it understands both its own act of intelligence and the species by which it understands Thus the intelligible species is that which is understood secondarily but that which is primarily understood is the object of which the species is the likeness This also appears from the opinion of the ancient philosophers who said that like is known by like For they said that the soul knows the earth outside itself by the earth within itself and so of the rest If therefore we take the species of the earth instead of the earth according to Aristotle De Anima iii eight who says that a stone is not in the soul but only the likeness of the stone it follows that the soul knows external things by means of its intelligible species Reply Obj one The thing understood is in the intellect by its own likeness and it is in this sense that we say that the thing actually understood is the intellect in act because the likeness of the thing understood is the form of the intellect as the likeness of a sensible thing is the form of the sense in act Hence it does not follow that the intelligible species abstracted is what is actually understood but rather that it is the likeness thereof Reply Obj two In these words the thing actually understood there is a double implication the thing which is understood and the fact that it is understood In like manner the words abstract universal imply two things the nature of a thing and its abstraction or universality Therefore the nature itself to which it occurs to be understood abstracted or considered as universal is only in individuals but that it is understood abstracted or considered as universal is in the intellect We see something similar to this is in the senses For the sight sees the color of the apple apart from its smell If therefore it be asked where is the color which is seen apart from the smell it is quite clear that the color which is seen is only in the apple but that it be perceived apart from the smell this is owing to the sight forasmuch as the faculty of sight receives the likeness of color and not of smell In like manner humanity understood is only in this or that man but that humanity be apprehended without conditions of individuality that is that it be abstracted and consequently considered as universal occurs to humanity inasmuch as it is brought under the consideration of the intellect in which there is a likeness of the specific nature but not of the principles of individuality Reply Obj three There are two operations in the sensitive part One in regard of impression only and thus the operation of the senses takes place by the senses being impressed by the sensible The other is formation inasmuch as the imagination forms for itself an image of an absent thing or even of something never seen Both of these operations are found in the intellect For in the first place there is the passion of the passive intellect as informed by the intelligible species and then the passive intellect thus informed forms a definition or a division or a composition expressed by a word Wherefore the concept conveyed by a word is its definition and a proposition conveys the intellect s division or composition Words do not therefore signify the intelligible species themselves but that which the intellect forms for itself for the purpose of judging of external things THIRD ARTICLE I Q eighty five Art three Whether the More Universal Is First in Our Intellectual Cognition Objection one It would seem that the more universal is not first in our intellectual cognition For what is first and more known in its own nature is secondarily and less known in relation to ourselves But universals come first as regards their nature because that is first which does not involve the existence of its correlative Categor ix Therefore the universals are secondarily known as regards our intellect Obj two Further the composition precedes the simple in relation to us But universals are the more simple Therefore they are known secondarily by us Obj three Further the Philosopher says Phys i one that the object defined comes in our knowledge before the parts of its definition But the more universal is part of the definition of the less universal as animal is part of the definition of man Therefore the universals are secondarily known by us Obj four Further we know causes and principles by their effects But universals are principles Therefore universals are secondarily known by us On the contrary We must proceed from the universal to the singular and individual Phys i one I answer that In our knowledge there are two things to be considered First that intellectual knowledge in some degree arises from sensible knowledge and because sense has singular and individual things for its object and intellect has the universal for its object it follows that our knowledge of the former comes before our knowledge of the latter Secondly we must consider that our intellect proceeds from a state of potentiality to a state of actuality and every power thus proceeding from potentiality to actuality comes first to an incomplete act which is the medium between potentiality and actuality before accomplishing the perfect act The perfect act of the intellect is complete knowledge when the object is distinctly and determinately known whereas the incomplete act is imperfect knowledge when the object is known indistinctly and as it were confusedly A thing thus imperfectly known is known partly in act and partly in potentiality and hence the Philosopher says Phys i one that what is manifest and certain is known to us at first confusedly afterwards we know it by distinguishing its principles and elements Now it is evident that to know an object that comprises many things without proper knowledge of each thing contained in it is to know that thing confusedly In this way we can have knowledge not only of the universal whole which contains parts potentially but also of the integral whole for each whole can be known confusedly without its parts being known But to know distinctly what is contained in the universal whole is to know the less common as to animal indistinctly is to know it as animal whereas to know animal distinctly is know it as rational or irrational animal that is to know a man or a lion therefore our intellect knows animal before it knows man and the same reason holds in comparing any more universal idea with the less universal Moreover as sense like the intellect proceeds from potentiality to act the same order of knowledge appears in the senses For by sense we judge of the more common before the less common in reference both to place and time in reference to place when a thing is seen afar off it is seen to be a body before it is seen to be an animal and to be an animal before it is seen to be a man and to be a man before it seen to be Socrates or Plato and the same is true as regards time for a child can distinguish man from not man before he distinguishes this man from that and therefore children at first call men fathers and later on distinguish each one from the others Phys i one The reason of this is clear because he who knows a thing indistinctly is in a state of potentiality as regards its principle of distinction as he who knows genus is in a state of potentiality as regards difference Thus it is evident that indistinct knowledge is midway between potentiality and act We must therefore conclude that knowledge of the singular and individual is prior as regards us to the knowledge of the universal as sensible knowledge is prior to intellectual knowledge But in both sense and intellect the knowledge of the more common precedes the knowledge of the less common Reply Obj one The universal can be considered in two ways First the universal nature may be considered together with the intention of universality And since the intention of universality viz the relation of one and the same to many is due to intellectual abstraction the universal thus considered is a secondary consideration Hence it is said De Anima i one that the universal animal is either nothing or something secondary But according to Plato who held that universals are subsistent the universal considered thus would be prior to the particular for the latter according to him are mere participations of the subsistent universals which he called ideas Secondly the universal can be considered in the nature itself for instance animality or humanity as existing in the individual And thus we must distinguish two orders of nature one by way of generation and time and thus the imperfect and the potential come first In this way the more common comes first in the order of nature as appears clearly in the generation of man and animal for the animal is generated before man as the Philosopher says De Gener Animal ii three The other order is the order of perfection or of the intention of nature for instance act considered absolutely is naturally prior to potentiality and the perfect to the imperfect thus the less common comes naturally before the more common as man comes before animal For the intention of nature does not stop at the generation of animal but goes on to the generation of man Reply Obj two The more common universal may be compared to the less common as the whole and as the part As the whole considering that in the more universal is potentially contained not only the less universal but also other things as in animal is contained not only man but also horse As part considering that the less common contains in its idea not only the more common but also more as man contains not only animal but also rational Therefore animal in itself comes into our knowledge before man but man comes before animal considered as part of the same idea Reply Obj three A part can be known in two ways First absolutely considered in itself and thus nothing prevents the parts being known before the whole as stones are known before a house is known Secondly as belonging to a certain whole and thus we must needs know the whole before its parts For we know a house vaguely before we know its different parts So likewise principles of definition are known before the thing defined is known otherwise the thing defined would not be known at all But as parts of the definition they are known after For we know man vaguely as man before we know how to distinguish all that belongs to human nature Reply Obj four The universal as understood with the intention of universality is indeed in a way a principle of knowledge in so far as the intention of universality results from the mode of understanding by way of abstraction But what is a principle of knowledge is not of necessity a principle of existence as Plato thought since at times we know a cause through its effect and substance through accidents Wherefore the universal thus considered according to the opinion of Aristotle is neither a principle of existence nor a substance as he makes clear Metaph vii Did vi thirteen But if we consider the generic or specific nature itself as existing in the singular thus in a way it is in the nature of a formal principle in regard to the singulars for the singular is the result of matter while the idea of species is from the form But the generic nature is compared to the specific nature rather after the fashion of a material principle because the generic nature is taken from that which is material in a thing while the idea of species is taken from that which is formal thus the notion of animal is taken from the sensitive part whereas the notion of man is taken from the intellectual part Thus it is that the ultimate intention of nature is to the species and not to the individual or the genus because the form is the end of generation while matter is for the sake of the form Neither is it necessary that as regards us knowledge of any cause or principle should be secondary since at times through sensible causes we become acquainted with unknown effects and sometimes conversely FOURTH ARTICLE I Q eighty five Art four Whether We Can Understand Many Things at the Same Time Objection one It would seem that we can understand many things at the same time For intellect is above time whereas the succession of before and after belongs to time Therefore the intellect does not understand different things in succession but at the same time Obj two Further there is nothing to prevent different forms not opposed to each other from actually being in the same subject as for instance color and smell are in the apple But intelligible species are not opposed to each other Therefore there is nothing to prevent the same intellect being in act as regards different intelligible species and thus it can understand many things at the same time Obj three Further the intellect understands a whole at the same time such as a man or a house But a whole contains many parts Therefore the intellect understands many things at the same time Obj four Further we cannot know the difference between two things unless we know both at the same time De Anima iii two and the same is to be said of any other comparison But our intellect knows the difference and comparison between one thing and another Therefore it knows many things at the same time On the contrary It is said Topic ii ten that understanding is of one thing only knowledge is of many I answer that The intellect can indeed understand many things as one but not as many that is to say by one but not by many intelligible species For the mode of every action follows the form which is the principle of that action Therefore whatever things the intellect can understand under one species it can understand at the same time hence it is that God sees all things at the same time because He sees all in one that is in His Essence But whatever things the intellect understands under different species it does not understand at the same time The reason of this is that it is impossible for one and the same subject to be perfected at the same time by many forms of one genus and diverse species just as it is impossible for one and the same body at the same time to have different colors or different shapes Now all intelligible species belong to one genus because they are the perfections of one intellectual faculty although the things which the species represent belong to different genera Therefore it is impossible for one and the same intellect to be perfected at the same time by different intelligible species so as actually to understand different things Reply Obj one The intellect is above that time which is the measure of the movement of corporeal things But the multitude itself of intelligible species causes a certain vicissitude of intelligible operations according as one operation succeeds another And this vicissitude is called time by Augustine who says general ad lit viii twenty twenty two that God moves the spiritual creature through time Reply Obj two Not only is it impossible for opposite forms to exist at the same time in the same subject but neither can any forms belonging to the same genus although they be not opposed to one another as is clear from the examples of colors and shapes Reply Obj three Parts can be understood in two ways First in a confused way as existing in the whole and thus they are known through the one form of the whole and so are known together In another way they are known distinctly thus each is known by its species and so they are not understood at the same time Reply Obj four If the intellect sees the difference or comparison between one thing and another it knows both in relation to their difference or comparison just as we have said above ad three as it knows the parts in the whole FIFTH ARTICLE I Q eighty five Art five Whether Our Intellect Understands by Composition and Division Objection one It would seem that our intellect does not understand by composition and division For composition and division are only of many whereas the intellect cannot understand many things at the same time Therefore it cannot understand by composition and division Obj two Further every composition and division implies past present or future time But the intellect abstracts from time as also from other individual conditions Therefore the intellect does not understand by composition and division Obj three Further the intellect understands things by a process of assimilation to them But composition and division are not in things for nothing is in things but what is signified by the predicate and the subject and which is one and the same provided that the composition be true for man is truly what animal is Therefore the intellect does not act by composition and division On the contrary Words signify the conceptions of the intellect as the Philosopher says Peri Herm i But in words we find composition and division as appears in affirmative and negative propositions Therefore the intellect acts by composition and division I answer that The human intellect must of necessity understand by composition and division For since the intellect passes from potentiality to act it has a likeness to things which are generated which do not attain to perfection all at once but acquire it by degrees so likewise the human intellect does not acquire perfect knowledge by the first act of apprehension but it first apprehends something about its object such as its quiddity and this is its first and proper object and then it understands the properties accidents and the various relations of the essence Thus it necessarily compares one thing with another by composition or division and from one composition and division it proceeds to another which is the process of reasoning But the angelic and the Divine intellect like all incorruptible things have their perfection at once from the beginning Hence the angelic and the Divine intellect have the entire knowledge of a thing at once and perfectly and hence also in knowing the quiddity of a thing they know at once whatever we can know by composition division and reasoning Therefore the human intellect knows by composition division and reasoning But the Divine intellect and the angelic intellect know indeed composition division and reasoning not by the process itself but by understanding the simple essence Reply Obj one Composition and division of the intellect are made by differentiating and comparing Hence the intellect knows many things by composition and division as by knowing the difference and comparison of things Reply Obj two Although the intellect abstracts from the phantasms it does not understand actually without turning to the phantasms as we have said A one Q eighty four A seven And forasmuch as it turns to the phantasms composition and division of the intellect involve time Reply Obj three The likeness of a thing is received into the intellect according to the mode of the intellect not according to the mode of the thing Wherefore something on the part of the thing corresponds to the composition and division of the intellect but it does not exist in the same way in the intellect and in the thing For the proper object of the human intellect is the quiddity of a material thing which comes under the action of the senses and the imagination Now in a material thing there is a twofold composition First there is the composition of form with matter and to this corresponds that composition of the intellect whereby the universal whole is predicated of its part for the genus is derived from common matter while the difference that completes the species is derived from the form and the particular from individual matter The second comparison is of accident with subject and to this real composition corresponds that composition of the intellect whereby accident is predicated of subject as when we say the man is white Nevertheless composition of the intellect differs from composition of things for in the latter the things are diverse whereas composition of the intellect is a sign of the identity of the components For the above composition of the intellect does not imply that man and whiteness are identical but the assertion the man is white means that the man is something having whiteness and the subject which is a man is identified with a subject having whiteness It is the same with the composition of form and matter for animal signifies that which has a sensitive nature rational that which has an intellectual nature man that which has both and Socrates that which has all these things together with individual matter and according to this kind of identity our intellect predicates the composition of one thing with another SIXTH ARTICLE I Q eighty five Art six Whether the Intellect Can Be False Objection one It would seem that the intellect can be false for the Philosopher says Metaph vi Did v four that truth and falsehood are in the mind But the mind and intellect are the same as is shown above Q seventy nine A one Therefore falsehood may be in the mind Obj two Further opinion and reasoning belong to the intellect But falsehood exists in both Therefore falsehood can be in the intellect Obj three Further sin is in the intellectual faculty But sin involves falsehood for those err that work evil Prov fourteen twenty two Therefore falsehood can be in the intellect On the contrary Augustine says QQ eighty three qu thirty two that everyone who is deceived does not rightly understand that wherein he is deceived And the Philosopher says De Anima iii ten that the intellect is always true I answer that The Philosopher De Anima iii six compares intellect with sense on this point For sense is not deceived in its proper object as sight in regard to color unless accidentally through some hindrance occurring to the sensile organ for example the taste of a fever stricken person judges a sweet thing to be bitter through his tongue being vitiated by ill humors Sense however may be deceived as regards common sensible objects as size or figure when for example it judges the sun to be only a foot in diameter whereas in reality it exceeds the earth in size Much more is sense deceived concerning accidental sensible objects as when it judges that vinegar is honey by reason of the color being the same The reason of this is evident for every faculty as such is per se directed to its proper object and things of this kind are always the same Hence as long as the faculty exists its judgment concerning its own proper object does not fail Now the proper object of the intellect is the quiddity of a material thing and hence properly speaking the intellect is not at fault concerning this quiddity whereas it may go astray as regards the surroundings of the thing in its essence or quiddity in referring one thing to another as regards composition or division or also in the process of reasoning Therefore also in regard to those propositions which are understood the intellect cannot err as in the case of first principles from which arises infallible truth in the certitude of scientific conclusions The intellect however may be accidentally deceived in the quiddity of composite things not by the defect of its organ for the intellect is a faculty that is independent of an organ but on the part of the composition affecting the definition when for instance the definition of a thing is false in relation to something else as the definition of a circle applied to a triangle or when a definition is false in itself as involving the composition of things incompatible as for instance to describe anything as a rational winged animal Hence as regards simple objects not subject to composite definitions we cannot be deceived unless indeed we understand nothing whatever about them as is said Metaph ix Did viii ten Reply Obj one The Philosopher says that falsehood is in the intellect in regard to composition and division The same answer applies to the Second Objection concerning opinion and reasoning and to the Third Objection concerning the error of the sinner who errs in the practical judgment of the appetible object But in the absolute consideration of the quiddity of a thing and of those things which are known thereby the intellect is never deceived In this sense are to be understood the authorities quoted in proof of the opposite conclusion SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q eighty five Art seven Whether One Person Can Understand One and the Same Thing Better Than Another Can Objection one It would seem that one person cannot understand one and the same thing better than another can For Augustine says QQ eighty three qu thirty two Whoever understands a thing otherwise than as it is does not understand it at all Hence it is clear that there is a perfect understanding than which none other is more perfect and therefore there are not infinite degrees of understanding a thing nor can one person understand a thing better than another can Obj two Further the intellect is true in its act of understanding But truth being a certain equality between thought and thing is not subject to more or less for a thing cannot be said to be more or less equal Therefore a thing cannot be more or less understood Obj three Further the intellect is the most formal of all that is in man But different forms cause different species Therefore if one man understands better than another it would seem that they do not belong to the same species On the contrary Experience shows that some understand more profoundly than do others as one who carries a conclusion to its first principles and ultimate causes understands it better than the one who reduces it only to its proximate causes I answer that A thing being understood more by one than by another may be taken in two senses First so that the word more be taken as determining the act of understanding as regards the thing understood and thus one cannot understand the same thing more than another because to understand it otherwise than as it is either better or worse would entail being deceived and such a one would not understand it as Augustine argues QQ eighty three qu thirty two In another sense the word more can be taken as determining the act of understanding on the part of him who understands and so one may understand the same thing better than someone else through having a greater power of understanding just as a man may see a thing better with his bodily sight whose power is greater and whose sight is more perfect The same applies to the intellect in two ways First as regards the intellect itself which is more perfect For it is plain that the better the disposition of a body the better the soul allotted to it which clearly appears in things of different species and the reason thereof is that act and form are received into matter according to matter s capacity thus because some men have bodies of better disposition their souls have a greater power of understanding wherefore it is said De Anima ii nine that it is to be observed that those who have soft flesh are of apt mind Secondly this occurs in regard to the lower powers of which the intellect has need in its operation for those in whom the imaginative cogitative and memorative powers are of better disposition are better disposed to understand The reply to the First Objection is clear from the above likewise the reply to the Second for the truth of the intellect consists in the intellect understanding a thing as it is Reply Obj three The difference of form which is due only to the different disposition of matter causes not a specific but only a numerical difference for different individuals have different forms diversified according to the difference of matter EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q eighty five Art eight Whether the Intellect Understands the Indivisible Before the Divisible Objection one It would seem that the intellect understands the indivisible before the divisible For the Philosopher says Phys i one that we understand and know from the knowledge of principles and elements But principles are indivisible and elements are of divisible things Therefore the indivisible is known to us before the divisible Obj two Further the definition of a thing contains what is known previously for a definition proceeds from the first and more known as is said Topic vi four But the indivisible is part of the definition of the divisible as a point comes into the definition of a line for as Euclid says a line is length without breadth the extremities of which are points also unity comes into the definition of number for number is multitude measured by one as is said Metaph x Did ix six Therefore our intellect understands the indivisible before the divisible Obj three Further Like is known by like But the indivisible is more like to the intellect than is the divisible because the intellect is simple De Anima iii four Therefore our intellect first knows the indivisible On the contrary It is said De Anima iii six that the indivisible is expressed as a privation But privation is known secondarily Therefore likewise is the indivisible I answer that The object of our intellect in its present state is the quiddity of a material thing which it abstracts from the phantasms as above stated Q eighty four A seven And since that which is known first and of itself by our cognitive power is its proper object we must consider its relationship to that quiddity in order to discover in what order the indivisible is known Now the indivisible is threefold as is said De Anima iii six First the continuous is indivisible since actually it is undivided although potentially divisible and this indivisible is known to us before its division which is a division into parts because confused knowledge is prior to distinct knowledge as we have said above A three Secondly the indivisible is so called in relation to species as man s reason is something indivisible This way also the indivisible is understood before its division into logical parts as we have said above De Anima iii six and again before the intellect disposes and divides by affirmation and negation The reason of this is that both these kinds of indivisible are understood by the intellect of itself as being its proper object The third kind of indivisible is what is altogether indivisible as a point and unity which cannot be divided either actually or potentially And this indivisible is known secondarily through the privation of divisibility Wherefore a point is defined by way of privation as that which has no parts and in like manner the notion of one is that is indivisible as stated in Metaph x Did ix one And the reason of this is that this indivisible has a certain opposition to a corporeal being the quiddity of which is the primary and proper object of the intellect But if our intellect understood by participation of certain separate indivisible forms as the Platonists maintained it would follow that a like indivisible is understood primarily for according to the Platonists what is first is first participated by things Reply Obj one In the acquisition of knowledge principles and elements are not always known first for sometimes from sensible effects we arrive at the knowledge of principles and intelligible causes But in perfect knowledge the knowledge of effects always depends on the knowledge of principles and elements for as the Philosopher says in the same passage Then do we consider that we know when we can resolve principles into their causes Reply Obj two A point is not included in the definition of a line in general for it is manifest that in a line of indefinite length and in a circular line there is no point save potentially Euclid defines a finite straight line and therefore he mentions a point in the definition as the limit in the definition of that which is limited Unity is the measure of number wherefore it is included in the definition of a measured number But it is not included in the definition of the divisible but rather conversely Reply Obj three The likeness through which we understand is the species of the known in the knower therefore a thing is known first not on account of its natural likeness to the cognitive power but on account of the power s aptitude for the object otherwise sight would perceive hearing rather than color QUESTION eighty six WHAT OUR INTELLECT KNOWS IN MATERIAL THINGS In Four Articles We now have to consider what our intellect knows in material things Under this head there are four points of inquiry one Whether it knows singulars two Whether it knows the infinite three Whether it knows contingent things four Whether it knows future things FIRST ARTICLE I Q eighty six Art four Whether Our Intellect Knows Singulars Objection one It would seem that our intellect knows singulars For whoever knows composition knows the terms of composition But our intellect knows this composition Socrates is a man for it belongs to the intellect to form a proposition Therefore our intellect knows this singular Socrates Obj two Further the practical intellect directs to action But action has relation to singular things Therefore the intellect knows the singular Obj three Further our intellect understands itself But in itself it is a singular otherwise it would have no action of its own for actions belong to singulars Therefore our intellect knows singulars Obj four Further a superior power can do whatever is done by an inferior power But sense knows the singular Much more therefore can the intellect know it On the contrary The Philosopher says Phys i five that the universal is known by reason and the singular is known by sense I answer that Our intellect cannot know the singular in material things directly and primarily The reason of this is that the principle of singularity in material things is individual matter whereas our intellect as have said above Q eighty five A one understands by abstracting the intelligible species from such matter Now what is abstracted from individual matter is the universal Hence our intellect knows directly the universal only But indirectly and as it were by a kind of reflection it can know the singular because as we have said above Q eighty five A seven even after abstracting the intelligible species the intellect in order to understand needs to turn to the phantasms in which it understands the species as is said De Anima iii seven Therefore it understands the universal directly through the intelligible species and indirectly the singular represented by the phantasm And thus it forms the proposition Socrates is a man Wherefore the reply to the first objection is clear Reply Obj two The choice of a particular thing to be done is as the conclusion of a syllogism formed by the practical intellect as is said Ethic vii three But a singular proposition cannot be directly concluded from a universal proposition except through the medium of a singular proposition Therefore the universal principle of the practical intellect does not move save through the medium of the particular apprehension of the sensitive part as is said De Anima iii eleven Reply Obj three Intelligibility is incompatible with the singular not as such but as material for nothing can be understood otherwise than immaterially Therefore if there be an immaterial singular such as the intellect there is no reason why it should not be intelligible Reply Obj four The higher power can do what the lower power can but in a more eminent way Wherefore what the sense knows materially and concretely which is to know the singular directly the intellect knows immaterially and in the abstract which is to know the universal SECOND ARTICLE I Q eighty six Art two Whether Our Intellect Can Know the Infinite Objection one It would seem that our intellect can know the infinite For God excels all infinite things But our intellect can know God as we have said above Q twelve A one Much more therefore can our intellect know all other infinite things Obj two Further our intellect can naturally know genera and species But there is an infinity of species in some genera as in number proportion and figure Therefore our intellect can know the infinite Obj three Further if one body can coexist with another in the same place there is nothing to prevent an infinite number of bodies being in one place But one intelligible species can exist with another in the same intellect for many things can be habitually known at the same time Therefore our intellect can have an habitual knowledge of an infinite number of things Obj four Further as the intellect is not a corporeal faculty as we have said Q seventy six A one it appears to be an infinite power But an infinite power has a capacity for an infinite object Therefore our intellect can know the infinite On the contrary It is said Phys i four that the infinite considered as such is unknown I answer that Since a faculty and its object are proportional to each other the intellect must be related to the infinite as is its object which is the quiddity of a material thing Now in material things the infinite does not exist actually but only potentially in the sense of one succeeding another as is said Phys iii six Therefore infinity is potentially in our mind through its considering successively one thing after another because never does our intellect understand so many things that it cannot understand more On the other hand our intellect cannot understand the infinite either actually or habitually Not actually for our intellect cannot know actually at the same time except what it knows through one species But the infinite is not represented by one species for if it were it would be something whole and complete Consequently it cannot be understood except by a successive consideration of one part after another as is clear from its definition Phys iii six for the infinite is that from which however much we may take there always remains something to be taken Thus the infinite could not be known actually unless all its parts were counted which is impossible For the same reason we cannot have habitual knowledge of the infinite because in us habitual knowledge results from actual consideration since by understanding we acquire knowledge as is said Ethic ii one Wherefore it would not be possible for us to have a habit of an infinity of things distinctly known unless we had already considered the entire infinity thereof counting them according to the succession of our knowledge which is impossible And therefore neither actually nor habitually can our intellect know the infinite but only potentially as explained above Reply Obj one As we have said above Q seven A one God is called infinite because He is a form unlimited by matter whereas in material things the term infinite is applied to that which is deprived of any formal term And form being known in itself whereas matter cannot be known without form it follows that the material infinite is in itself unknowable But the formal infinite God is of Himself known but He is unknown to us by reason of our feeble intellect which in its present state has a natural aptitude for material objects only Therefore we cannot know God in our present life except through material effects In the future life this defect of intellect will be removed by the state of glory when we shall be able to see the Essence of God Himself but without being able to comprehend Him Reply Obj two The nature of our mind is to know species abstracted from phantasms therefore it cannot know actually or habitually species of numbers or figures that are not in the imagination except in a general way and in their universal principles and this is to know them potentially and confusedly Reply Obj three If two or more bodies were in the same place there would be no need for them to occupy the place successively in order for the things placed to be counted according to this succession of occupation On the other hand the intelligible species enter into our intellect successively since many things cannot be actually understood at the same time and therefore there must be a definite and not an infinite number of species in our intellect Reply Obj four As our intellect is infinite in power so does it know the infinite For its power is indeed infinite inasmuch as it is not terminated by corporeal matter Moreover it can know the universal which is abstracted from individual matter and which consequently is not limited to one individual but considered in itself extends to an infinite number of individuals THIRD ARTICLE I Q eighty six Art three Whether Our Intellect Can Know Contingent Things Objection one It would seem that the intellect cannot know contingent things because as the Philosopher says Ethic vi six the objects of understanding wisdom and knowledge are not contingent but necessary things Obj two Further as stated in Phys iv twelve what sometimes is and sometimes is not is measured by time Now the intellect abstracts from time and from other material conditions Therefore as it is proper to a contingent thing sometime to be and sometime not to be it seems that contingent things are not known by the intellect On the contrary All knowledge is in the intellect But some sciences are of the contingent things as the moral sciences the objects of which are human actions subject to free will and again the natural sciences in as far as they relate to things generated and corruptible Therefore the intellect knows contingent things I answer that Contingent things can be considered in two ways either as contingent or as containing some element of necessity since every contingent thing has in it something necessary for example that Socrates runs is in itself contingent but the relation of running to motion is necessary for it is necessary that Socrates move if he runs Now contingency arises from matter for contingency is a potentiality to be or not to be and potentiality belongs to matter whereas necessity results from form because whatever is consequent on form is of necessity in the subject But matter is the individualizing principle whereas the universal comes from the abstraction of the form from the particular matter Moreover it was laid down above A one that the intellect of itself and directly has the universal for its object while the object of sense is the singular which in a certain way is the indirect object of the intellect as we have said above A one Therefore the contingent considered as such is known directly by sense and indirectly by the intellect while the universal and necessary principles of contingent things are known only by the intellect Hence if we consider the objects of science in their universal principles then all science is of necessary things But if we consider the things themselves thus some sciences are of necessary things some of contingent things From which the replies to the objections are clear FOURTH ARTICLE I Q eighty six Art four Whether Our Intellect Can Know the Future Objection one It would seem that our intellect knows the future For our intellect knows by means of intelligible species abstracted from the here and now and related indifferently to all time But it can know the present Therefore it can know the future Obj two Further man while his senses are in suspense can know some future things as in sleep and in frenzy But the intellect is freer and more vigorous when removed from sense Therefore the intellect of its own nature can know the future Obj three The intellectual knowledge of man is superior to any knowledge of brutes But some animals know the future thus crows by their frequent cawing foretell rain Therefore much more can the intellect know the future On the contrary It is written Eccles eight six seven There is a great affliction for man because he is ignorant of things past and things to come he cannot know by any messenger I answer that We must apply the same distinction to future things as we applied above A three to contingent things For future things considered as subject to time are singular and the human intellect knows them by reflection only as stated above A one But the principles of future things may be universal and thus they may enter the domain of the intellect and become the objects of science Speaking however of the knowledge of the future in a general way we must observe that the future may be known in two ways either in itself or in its cause The future cannot be known in itself save by God alone to Whom even that is present which in the course of events is future forasmuch as from eternity His glance embraces the whole course of time as we have said above when treating of God s knowledge Q fourteen A thirteen But forasmuch as it exists in its cause the future can be known by us also And if indeed the cause be such as to have a necessary connection with its future result then the future is known with scientific certitude just as the astronomer foresees the future eclipse If however the cause be such as to produce a certain result more frequently than not then can the future be known more or less conjecturally according as its cause is more or less inclined to produce the effect Reply Obj one This argument considers that knowledge which is drawn from universal causal principles from these the future may be known according to the order of the effects to the cause Reply Obj two As Augustine says Confess xii general ad lit xii thirteen the soul has a certain power of forecasting so that by its very nature it can know the future hence when withdrawn from corporeal sense and as it were concentrated on itself it shares in the knowledge of the future Such an opinion would be reasonable if we were to admit that the soul receives knowledge by participating the ideas as the Platonists maintained because in that case the soul by its nature would know the universal causes of all effects and would only be impeded in its knowledge by the body and hence when withdrawn from the corporeal senses it would know the future But since it is connatural to our intellect to know things not thus but by receiving its knowledge from the senses it is not natural for the soul to know the future when withdrawn from the senses rather does it know the future by the impression of superior spiritual and corporeal causes of spiritual causes when by Divine power the human intellect is enlightened through the ministry of angels and the phantasms are directed to the knowledge of future events or by the influence of demons when the imagination is moved regarding the future known to the demons as explained above Q fifty seven A three The soul is naturally more inclined to receive these impressions of spiritual causes when it is withdrawn from the senses as it is then nearer to the spiritual world and freer from external distractions The same may also come from superior corporeal causes For it is clear that superior bodies influence inferior bodies Hence in consequence of the sensitive faculties being acts of corporeal organs the influence of the heavenly bodies causes the imagination to be affected and so as the heavenly bodies cause many future events the imagination receives certain images of some such events These images are perceived more at night and while we sleep than in the daytime and while we are awake because as stated in De Somn et Vigil ii De Divinat per somn ii impressions made by day are evanescent The night air is calmer when silence reigns hence bodily impressions are made in sleep when slight internal movements are felt more than in wakefulness and such movements produce in the imagination images from which the future may be foreseen Reply Obj three Brute animals have no power above the imagination wherewith to regulate it as man has his reason and therefore their imagination follows entirely the influence of the heavenly bodies Thus from such animals movements some future things such as rain and the like may be known rather than from human movements directed by reason Hence the Philosopher says De Somn et Vig that some who are most imprudent are most far seeing for their intelligence is not burdened with cares but is as it were barren and bare of all anxiety moving at the caprice of whatever is brought to bear on it QUESTION eighty seven HOW THE INTELLECTUAL SOUL KNOWS ITSELF AND ALL WITHIN ITSELF In Four Articles We have now to consider how the intellectual soul knows itself and all within itself Under this head there are four points of inquiry one Whether the soul knows itself by its own essence two Whether it knows its own habits three How does the intellect know its own act four How does it know the act of the will FIRST ARTICLE I Q eighty seven Art one Whether the Intellectual Soul Knows Itself by Its Essence Objection one It would seem that the intellectual soul knows itself by its own essence For Augustine says De Trin ix three that the mind knows itself because it is incorporeal Obj two Further both angels and human souls belong to the genus of intellectual substance But an angel understands itself by its own essence Therefore likewise does the human soul Obj three Further in things void of matter the intellect and that which is understood are the same De Anima iii four But the human mind is void of matter not being the act of a body as stated above Q seventy six A one Therefore the intellect and its object are the same in the human mind and therefore the human mind understands itself by its own essence On the contrary It is said De Anima iii four that the intellect understands itself in the same way as it understands other things But it understands other things not by their essence but by their similitudes Therefore it does not understand itself by its own essence I answer that Everything is knowable so far as it is in act and not so far as it is in potentiality Metaph ix Did viii nine for a thing is a being and is true and therefore knowable according as it is actual This is quite clear as regards sensible things for the eye does not see what is potentially but what is actually colored In like manner it is clear that the intellect so far as it knows material things does not know save what is in act and hence it does not know primary matter except as proportionate to form as is stated Phys i seven Consequently immaterial substances are intelligible by their own essence according as each one is actual by its own essence Therefore it is that the Essence of God the pure and perfect act is simply and perfectly in itself intelligible and hence God by His own Essence knows Himself and all other things also The angelic essence belongs indeed to the genus of intelligible things as act but not as a pure act nor as a complete act and hence the angel s act of intelligence is not completed by his essence For although an angel understands himself by his own essence still he cannot understand all other things by his own essence for he knows things other than himself by their likenesses Now the human intellect is only a potentiality in the genus of intelligible beings just as primary matter is a potentiality as regards sensible beings and hence it is called possible Possibilis elsewhere in this translation rendered passive Ed Therefore in its essence the human mind is potentially understanding Hence it has in itself the power to understand but not to be understood except as it is made actual For even the Platonists asserted that an order of intelligible beings existed above the order of intellects forasmuch as the intellect understands only by participation of the intelligible for they said that the participator is below what it participates If therefore the human intellect as the Platonists held became actual by participating separate intelligible forms it would understand itself by such participation of incorporeal beings But as in this life our intellect has material and sensible things for its proper natural object as stated above Q eighty four A seven it understands itself according as it is made actual by the species abstracted from sensible things through the light of the active intellect which not only actuates the intelligible things themselves but also by their instrumentality actuates the passive intellect Therefore the intellect knows itself not by its essence but by its act This happens in two ways In the first place singularly as when Socrates or Plato perceives that he has an intellectual soul because he perceives that he understands In the second place universally as when we consider the nature of the human mind from knowledge of the intellectual act It is true however that the judgment and force of this knowledge whereby we know the nature of the soul comes to us according to the derivation of our intellectual light from the Divine Truth which contains the types of all things as above stated Q eighty four A five Hence Augustine says De Trin ix six We gaze on the inviolable truth whence we can as perfectly as possible define not what each man s mind is but what it ought to be in the light of the eternal types There is however a difference between these two kinds of knowledge and it consists in this that the mere presence of the mind suffices for the first the mind itself being the principle of action whereby it perceives itself and hence it is said to know itself by its own presence But as regards the second kind of knowledge the mere presence of the mind does not suffice and there is further required a careful and subtle inquiry Hence many are ignorant of the soul s nature and many have erred about it So Augustine says De Trin x nine concerning such mental inquiry Let the mind strive not to see itself as if it were absent but to discern itself as present i e to know how it differs from other things which is to know its essence and nature Reply Obj one The mind knows itself by means of itself because at length it acquires knowledge of itself though led thereto by its own act because it is itself that it knows since it loves itself as he says in the same passage For a thing can be called self evident in two ways either because we can know it by nothing else except itself as first principles are called self evident or because it is not accidentally knowable as color is visible of itself whereas substance is visible by its accident Reply Obj two The essence of an angel is an act in the genus of intelligible things and therefore it is both intellect and the thing understood Hence an angel apprehends his own essence through itself not so the human mind which is either altogether in potentiality to intelligible things as is the passive intellect or is the act of intelligible things abstracted from the phantasms as is the active intellect Reply Obj three This saying of the Philosopher is universally true in every kind of intellect For as sense in act is the sensible in act by reason of the sensible likeness which is the form of sense in act so likewise the intellect in act is the object understood in act by reason of the likeness of the thing understood which is the form of the intellect in act So the human intellect which becomes actual by the species of the object understood is itself understood by the same species as by its own form Now to say that in things without matter the intellect and what is understood are the same is equal to saying that as regards things actually understood the intellect and what is understood are the same For a thing is actually understood in that it is immaterial But a distinction must be drawn since the essences of some things are immaterial as the separate substances called angels each of which is understood and understands whereas there are other things whose essences are not wholly immaterial but only the abstract likenesses thereof Hence the Commentator says De Anima iii that the proposition quoted is true only of separate substances because in a sense it is verified in their regard and not in regard of other substances as already stated Reply Obj two SECOND ARTICLE I Q eighty seven Art two Whether Our Intellect Knows the Habits of the Soul by Their Essence Objection one It would seem that our intellect knows the habits of the soul by their essence For Augustine says De Trin xiii one Faith is not seen in the heart wherein it abides as the soul of a man may be seen by another from the movement of the body but we know most certainly that it is there and conscience proclaims its existence and the same principle applies to the other habits of the soul Therefore the habits of the soul are not known by their acts but by themselves Obj two Further material things outside the soul are known by their likeness being present in the soul and are said therefore to be known by their likenesses But the soul s habits are present by their essence in the soul Therefore the habits of the soul are known by their essence Obj three Further whatever is the cause of a thing being such is still more so But habits and intelligible species cause things to be known by the soul Therefore they are still more known by the soul in themselves On the contrary Habits like powers are the principles of acts But as is said De Anima ii four acts and operations are logically prior to powers Therefore in the same way they are prior to habits and thus habits like the powers are known by their acts I answer that A habit is a kind of medium between mere power and mere act Now it has been said A one that nothing is known but as it is actual therefore so far as a habit fails in being a perfect act it falls short in being of itself knowable and can be known only by its act thus for example anyone knows he has a habit from the fact that he can produce the act proper to that habit or he may inquire into the nature and idea of the habit by considering the act The first kind of knowledge of the habit arises from its being present for the very fact of its presence causes the act whereby it is known The second kind of knowledge of the habit arises from a careful inquiry as is explained above of the mind A one Reply Obj one Although faith is not known by external movement of the body it is perceived by the subject wherein it resides by the interior act of the heart For no one knows that he has faith unless he knows that he believes Reply Obj two Habits are present in our intellect not as its object since in the present state of life our intellect s object is the nature of a material thing as stated above Q eighty four A seven but as that by which it understands Reply Obj three The axiom whatever is the cause of a thing being such is still more so is true of things that are of the same order for instance of the same kind of cause for example we may say that health is desirable on account of life and therefore life is more desirable still But if we take things of different orders the axiom is not true for we may say that health is caused by medicine but it does not follow that medicine is more desirable than health for health belongs to the order of final causes whereas medicine belongs to the order of efficient causes So of two things belonging essentially to the order of the objects of knowledge the one which is the cause of the other being known is the more known as principles are more known than conclusions But habit as such does not belong to the order of objects of knowledge nor are things known on account of the habit as on account of an object known but as on account of a disposition or form whereby the subject knows and therefore the argument does not prove THIRD ARTICLE I Q eighty seven Art three Whether Our Intellect Knows Its Own Act Objection one It would seem that our intellect does not know its own act For what is known is the object of the knowing faculty But the act differs from the object Therefore the intellect does not know its own act Obj two Further whatever is known is known by some act If then the intellect knows its own act it knows it by some act and again it knows that act by some other act this is to proceed indefinitely which seems impossible Obj three Further the intellect has the same relation to its act as sense has to its act But the proper sense does not feel its own act for this belongs to the common sense as stated De Anima iii two Therefore neither does the intellect understand its own act On the contrary Augustine says De Trin x eleven I understand that I understand I answer that As stated above AA one two a thing is intelligible according as it is in act Now the ultimate perfection of the intellect consists in its own operation for this is not an act tending to something else in which lies the perfection of the work accomplished as building is the perfection of the thing built but it remains in the agent as its perfection and act as is said Metaph ix Did viii eight Therefore the first thing understood of the intellect is its own act of understanding This occurs in different ways with different intellects For there is an intellect namely the Divine which is Its own act of intelligence so that in God the understanding of His intelligence and the understanding of His Essence are one and the same act because His Essence is His act of understanding But there is another intellect the angelic which is not its own act of understanding as we have said above Q seventy nine A one and yet the first object of that act is the angelic essence Wherefore although there is a logical distinction between the act whereby he understands that he understands and that whereby he understands his essence yet he understands both by one and the same act because to understand his own essence is the proper perfection of his essence and by one and the same act is a thing together with its perfection understood And there is yet another namely the human intellect which neither is its own act of understanding nor is its own essence the first object of its act of understanding for this object is the nature of a material thing And therefore that which is first known by the human intellect is an object of this kind and that which is known secondarily is the act by which that object is known and through the act the intellect itself is known the perfection of which is this act of understanding For this reason did the Philosopher assert that objects are known before acts and acts before powers De Anima ii four Reply Obj one The object of the intellect is something universal namely being and the true in which the act also of understanding is comprised Wherefore the intellect can understand its own act But not primarily since the first object of our intellect in this state of life is not every being and everything true but being and true as considered in material things as we have said above Q eighty four A seven from which it acquires knowledge of all other things Reply Obj two The intelligent act of the human intellect is not the act and perfection of the material nature understood as if the nature of the material thing and intelligent act could be understood by one act just as a thing and its perfection are understood by one act Hence the act whereby the intellect understands a stone is distinct from the act whereby it understands that it understands a stone and so on Nor is there any difficulty in the intellect being thus potentially infinite as explained above Q eighty six A two Reply Obj three The proper sense feels by reason of the immutation in the material organ caused by the external sensible A material object however cannot immute itself but one is immuted by another and therefore the act of the proper sense is perceived by the common sense The intellect on the contrary does not perform the act of understanding by the material immutation of an organ and so there is no comparison FOURTH ARTICLE I Q eighty seven Art four Whether the Intellect Understands the Act of the Will Objection one It would seem that the intellect does not understand the act of the will For nothing is known by the intellect unless it be in some way present in the intellect But the act of the will is not in the intellect since the will and the intellect are distinct Therefore the act of the will is not known by the intellect Obj two Further the act is specified by the object But the object of the will is not the same as the object of the intellect Therefore the act of the will is specifically distinct from the object of the intellect and therefore the act of the will is not known by the intellect Obj three Augustine Confess x seventeen says of the soul s affections that they are known neither by images as bodies are known nor by their presence like the arts but by certain notions Now it does not seem that there can be in the soul any other notions of things but either the essences of things known or the likenesses thereof Therefore it seems impossible for the intellect to known such affections of the soul as the acts of the will On the contrary Augustine says De Trin x eleven I understand that I will I answer that As stated above Q fifty nine A one the act of the will is nothing but an inclination consequent on the form understood just as the natural appetite is an inclination consequent on the natural form Now the inclination of a thing resides in it according to its mode of existence and hence the natural inclination resides in a natural thing naturally and the inclination called the sensible appetite is in the sensible thing sensibly and likewise the intelligible inclination which is the act of the will is in the intelligent subject intelligibly as in its principle and proper subject Hence the Philosopher expresses himself thus De Anima iii nine that the will is in the reason Now whatever is intelligibly in an intelligent subject is understood by that subject Therefore the act of the will is understood by the intellect both inasmuch as one knows that one wills and inasmuch as one knows the nature of this act and consequently the nature of its principle which is the habit or power Reply Obj one This argument would hold good if the will and the intellect were in different subjects as they are distinct powers for then whatever was in the will would not be in the intellect But as both are rooted in the same substance of the soul and since one is in a certain way the principle of the other consequently what is in the will is in a certain way also in the intellect Reply Obj two The good and the true which are the objects of the will and of the intellect differ logically but one is contained in the other as we have said above Q eighty two A four ad one Q sixteen A four ad one for the true is good and the good is true Therefore the objects of the will fall under the intellect and those of the intellect can fall under the will Reply Obj three The affections of the soul are in the intellect not by similitude only like bodies nor by being present in their subject as the arts but as the thing caused is in its principle which contains some notion of the thing caused And so Augustine says that the soul s affections are in the memory by certain notions QUESTION eighty eight HOW THE HUMAN SOUL KNOWS WHAT IS ABOVE ITSELF In Three Articles We must now consider how the human soul knows what is above itself viz immaterial substances Under this head there are three points of inquiry one Whether the human soul in the present state of life can understand the immaterial substances called angels in themselves two Whether it can arrive at the knowledge thereof by the knowledge of material things three Whether God is the first object of our knowledge FIRST ARTICLE I Q eighty eight Art one Whether the Human Soul in the Present State of Life Can Understand Immaterial Substances in Themselves Objection one It would seem that the human soul in the present state of life can understand immaterial substances in themselves For Augustine De Trin ix three says As the mind itself acquires the knowledge of corporeal things by means of the corporeal senses so it gains from itself the knowledge of incorporeal things But these are the immaterial substances Therefore the human mind understands immaterial substances Obj two Further like is known by like But the human mind is more akin to immaterial than to material things since its own nature is immaterial as is clear from what we have said above Q seventy six A one Since then our mind understands material things much more is it able to understand immaterial things Obj three Further the fact that objects which are in themselves most sensible are not most felt by us comes from sense being corrupted by their very excellence But the intellect is not subject to such a corrupting influence from its object as is stated De Anima iii four Therefore things which are in themselves in the highest degree of intelligibility are likewise to us most intelligible As material things however are intelligible only so far as we make them actually so by abstracting them from material conditions it is clear that those substances are more intelligible in themselves whose nature is immaterial Therefore they are much more known to us than are material things Obj four Further the Commentator says Metaph ii that nature would be frustrated in its end were we unable to understand abstract substances because it would have made what in itself is naturally intelligible not to be understood at all But in nature nothing is idle or purposeless Therefore immaterial substances can be understood by us Obj five Further as sense is to the sensible so is intellect to the intelligible But our sight can see all things corporeal whether superior and incorruptible or lower and corruptible Therefore our intellect can understand all intelligible substances even the superior and immaterial On the contrary It is written Wis nine sixteen The things that are in heaven who shall search out But these substances are said to be in heaven according to Matt eighteen ten Their angels in heaven et cetera Therefore immaterial substances cannot be known by human investigation I answer that In the opinion of Plato immaterial substances are not only understood by us but are the objects we understand first of all For Plato taught that immaterial subsisting forms which he called Ideas are the proper objects of our intellect and thus first and per se understood by us and further that material objects are known by the soul inasmuch as phantasy and sense are mixed up with the mind Hence the purer the intellect is so much the more clearly does it perceive the intelligible truth of immaterial things But in Aristotle s opinion which experience corroborates our intellect in its present state of life has a natural relationship to the natures of material things and therefore it can only understand by turning to the phantasms as we have said above Q eighty four A seven Thus it clearly appears that immaterial substances which do not fall under sense and imagination cannot first and per se be known by us according to the mode of knowledge which experience proves us to have Nevertheless Averroes Comment De Anima iii teaches that in this present life man can in the end arrive at the knowledge of separate substances by being coupled or united to some separate substance which he calls the active intellect and which being a separate substance itself can naturally understand separate substances Hence when it is perfectly united to us so that by its means we are able to understand perfectly we also shall be able to understand separate substances as in the present life through the medium of the passive intellect united to us we can understand material things Now he said that the active intellect is united to us thus For since we understand by means of both the active intellect and intelligible objects as for instance we understand conclusions by principles understood it is clear that the active intellect must be compared to the objects understood either as the principal agent is to the instrument or as form to matter For an action is ascribed to two principles in one of these two ways to a principal agent and to an instrument as cutting to the workman and the saw to a form and its subject as heating to heat and fire In both these ways the active intellect can be compared to the intelligible object as perfection is to the perfectible and as act is to potentiality Now a subject is made perfect and receives its perfection at one and the same time as the reception of what is actually visible synchronizes with the reception of light in the eye Therefore the passive intellect receives the intelligible object and the active intellect together and the more numerous the intelligible objects received so much the nearer do we come to the point of perfect union between ourselves and the active intellect so much so that when we understand all the intelligible objects the active intellect becomes one with us and by its instrumentality we can understand all things material and immaterial In this he makes the ultimate happiness of man to consist Nor as regards the present inquiry does it matter whether the passive intellect in that state of happiness understands separate substances by the instrumentality of the active intellect as he himself maintains or whether as he says Alexander holds the passive intellect can never understand separate substances because according to him it is corruptible but man understands separate substances by means of the active intellect This opinion however is untrue First because supposing the active intellect to be a separate substance we could not formally understand by its instrumentality for the medium of an agent s formal action consists in its form and act since every agent acts according to its actuality as was said of the passive intellect Q seventy A one Secondly this opinion is untrue because in the above explanation the active intellect supposing it to be a separate substance would not be joined to us in its substance but only in its light as participated in things understood and would not extend to the other acts of the active intellect so as to enable us to understand immaterial substances just as when we see colors set off by the sun we are not united to the substance of the sun so as to act like the sun but its light only is united to us that we may see the colors Thirdly this opinion is untrue because granted that as above explained the active intellect were united to us in substance still it is not said that it is wholly so united in regard to one intelligible object or two but rather in regard to all intelligible objects But all such objects together do not equal the force of the active intellect as it is a much greater thing to understand separate substances than to understand all material things Hence it clearly follows that the knowledge of all material things would not make the active intellect to be so united to us as to enable us by its instrumentality to understand separate substances Fourthly this opinion is untrue because it is hardly possible for anyone in this world to understand all material things and thus no one or very few could reach to perfect felicity which is against what the Philosopher says Ethic i nine that happiness is a kind of common good communicable to all capable of virtue Further it is unreasonable that only the few of any species attain to the end of the species Fifthly the Philosopher expressly says Ethic i ten that happiness is an operation according to perfect virtue and after enumerating many virtues in the tenth book he concludes Ethic i seven that ultimate happiness consisting in the knowledge of the highest things intelligible is attained through the virtue of wisdom which in the sixth chapter he had named as the chief of speculative sciences Hence Aristotle clearly places the ultimate felicity of man in the knowledge of separate substances obtainable by speculative science and not by being united to the active intellect as some imagined Sixthly as was shown above Q seventy nine A four the active intellect is not a separate substance but a faculty of the soul extending itself actively to the same objects to which the passive intellect extends receptively because as is stated De Anima iii five the passive intellect is all things potentially and the active intellect is all things in act Therefore both intellects according to the present state of life extend to material things only which are made actually intelligible by the active intellect and are received in the passive intellect Hence in the present state of life we cannot understand separate immaterial substances in themselves either by the passive or by the active intellect Reply Obj one Augustine may be taken to mean that the knowledge of incorporeal things in the mind can be gained by the mind itself This is so true that philosophers also say that the knowledge concerning the soul is a principle for the knowledge of separate substances For by knowing itself it attains to some knowledge of incorporeal substances such as is within its compass not that the knowledge of itself gives it a perfect and absolute knowledge of them Reply Obj two The likeness of nature is not a sufficient cause of knowledge otherwise what Empedocles said would be true that the soul needs to have the nature of all in order to know all But knowledge requires that the likeness of the thing known be in the knower as a kind of form thereof Now our passive intellect in the present state of life is such that it can be informed with similitudes abstracted from phantasms and therefore it knows material things rather than immaterial substances Reply Obj three There must needs be some proportion between the object and the faculty of knowledge such as of the active to the passive and of perfection to the perfectible Hence that sensible objects of great power are not grasped by the senses is due not merely to the fact that they corrupt the organ but also to their being improportionate to the sensitive power And thus it is that immaterial substances are improportionate to our intellect in our present state of life so that it cannot understand them Reply Obj four This argument of the Commentator fails in several ways First because if separate substances are not understood by us it does not follow that they are not understood by any intellect for they are understood by themselves and by one another Secondly to be understood by us is not the end of separate substances while only that is vain and purposeless which fails to attain its end It does not follow therefore that immaterial substances are purposeless even if they are not understood by us at all Reply Obj five Sense knows bodies whether superior or inferior in the same way that is by the sensible acting on the organ But we do not understand material and immaterial substances in the same way The former we understand by a process of abstraction which is impossible in the case of the latter for there are no phantasms of what is immaterial SECOND ARTICLE I Q eighty eight Art two Whether Our Intellect Can Understand Immaterial Substances Through Its Knowledge of Material Things Objection one It would seem that our intellect can know immaterial substances through the knowledge of material things For Dionysius says Coel Hier i that the human mind cannot be raised up to immaterial contemplation of the heavenly hierarchies unless it is led thereto by material guidance according to its own nature Therefore we can be led by material things to know immaterial substances Obj two Further science resides in the intellect But there are sciences and definitions of immaterial substances for Damascene defines an angel De Fide Orth ii three and we find angels treated of both in theology and philosophy Therefore immaterial substances can be understood by us Obj three Further the human soul belongs to the genus of immaterial substances But it can be understood by us through its act by which it understands material things Therefore also other material substances can be understood by us through their material effects Obj four Further the only cause which cannot be comprehended through its effects is that which is infinitely distant from them and this belongs to God alone Therefore other created immaterial substances can be understood by us through material things On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom i that intelligible things cannot be understood through sensible things nor composite things through simple nor incorporeal through corporeal I answer that Averroes says De Anima iii that a philosopher named Avempace Ibn Badja Arabian Philosopher ob eleven eighty three taught that by the understanding of natural substances we can be led according to true philosophical principles to the knowledge of immaterial substances For since the nature of our intellect is to abstract the quiddity of material things from matter anything material residing in that abstracted quiddity can again be made subject to abstraction and as the process of abstraction cannot go on forever it must arrive at length at some immaterial quiddity absolutely without matter and this would be the understanding of immaterial substance Now this opinion would be true were immaterial substances the forms and species of these material things as the Platonists supposed But supposing on the contrary that immaterial substances differ altogether from the quiddity of material things it follows that however much our intellect abstract the quiddity of material things from matter it could never arrive at anything akin to immaterial substance Therefore we are not able perfectly to understand immaterial substances through material substances Reply Obj one From material things we can rise to some kind of knowledge of immaterial things but not to the perfect knowledge thereof for there is no proper and adequate proportion between material and immaterial things and the likenesses drawn from material things for the understanding of immaterial things are very dissimilar therefrom as Dionysius says Coel Hier ii Reply Obj two Science treats of higher things principally by way of negation Thus Aristotle De Coel i three explains the heavenly bodies by denying to them inferior corporeal properties Hence it follows that much less can immaterial substances be known by us in such a way as to make us know their quiddity but we may have a scientific knowledge of them by way of negation and by their relation to material things Reply Obj three The human soul understands itself through its own act of understanding which is proper to it showing perfectly its power and nature But the power and nature of immaterial substances cannot be perfectly known through such act nor through any other material thing because there is no proportion between the latter and the power of the former Reply Obj four Created immaterial substances are not in the same natural genus as material substances for they do not agree in power or in matter but they belong to the same logical genus because even immaterial substances are in the predicament of substance as their essence is distinct from their existence But God has no connection with material things as regards either natural genus or logical genus because God is in no genus as stated above Q three A five Hence through the likeness derived from material things we can know something positive concerning the angels according to some common notion though not according to the specific nature whereas we cannot acquire any such knowledge at all about God THIRD ARTICLE I Q eighty eight Art three Whether God Is the First Object Known by the Human Mind Objection one It would seem that God is the first object known by the human mind For that object in which all others are known and by which we judge others is the first thing known to us as light is to the eye and first principles to the intellect But we know all things in the light of the first truth and thereby judge of all things as Augustine says De Trin xii two De Vera Relig xxxi Confess xii twenty five Therefore God is the first object known to us Obj two Further whatever causes a thing to be such is more so But God is the cause of all our knowledge for He is the true light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world John one nine Therefore God is our first and most known object Obj three Further what is first known in the image is the exemplar to which it is made But in our mind is the image of God as Augustine says De Trin xii forty seven Therefore God is the first object known to our mind On the contrary No man hath seen God at any time John one eighteen I answer that Since the human intellect in the present state of life cannot understand even immaterial created substances A one much less can it understand the essence of the uncreated substance Hence it must be said simply that God is not the first object of our knowledge Rather do we know God through creatures according to the Apostle Rom one twenty the invisible things of God are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made while the first object of our knowledge in this life is the quiddity of a material thing which is the proper object of our intellect as appears above in many passages Q eighty four A seven Q eighty five A eight Q eighty seven A two ad two Reply Obj one We see and judge of all things in the light of the first truth forasmuch as the light itself of our mind whether natural or gratuitous is nothing else than the impression of the first truth upon it as stated above Q twelve A two Hence as the light itself of our intellect is not the object it understands much less can it be said that God is the first object known by our intellect Reply Obj two The axiom Whatever causes a thing to be such is more so must be understood of things belonging to one and the same order as explained above Q eighty one A two ad three Other things than God are known because of God not as if He were the first known object but because He is the first cause of our faculty of knowledge Reply Obj three If there existed in our souls a perfect image of God as the Son is the perfect image of the Father our mind would know God at once But the image in our mind is imperfect hence the argument does not prove QUESTION eighty nine OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SEPARATED SOUL In Eight Articles We must now consider the knowledge of the separated soul Under this head there are eight points of inquiry one Whether the soul separated from the body can understand two Whether it understands separate substances three Whether it understands all natural things four Whether it understands individuals and singulars five Whether the habits of knowledge acquired in this life remain six Whether the soul can use the habit of knowledge here acquired seven Whether local distance impedes the separated soul s knowledge eight Whether souls separated from the body know what happens here FIRST ARTICLE I Q eighty nine Art one Whether the Separated Soul Can Understand Anything Objection one It would seem that the soul separated from the body can understand nothing at all For the Philosopher says De Anima i four that the understanding is corrupted together with its interior principle But by death all human interior principles are corrupted Therefore also the intellect itself is corrupted Obj two Further the human soul is hindered from understanding when the senses are tied and by a distracted imagination as explained above Q eighty four AA seventy eight But death destroys the senses and imagination as we have shown above Q seventy seven A eight Therefore after death the soul understands nothing Obj three Further if the separated soul can understand this must be by means of some species But it does not understand by means of innate species because it has none such being at first like a tablet on which nothing is written nor does it understand by species abstracted from things for it does not then possess organs of sense and imagination which are necessary for the abstraction of species nor does it understand by means of species formerly abstracted and retained in the soul for if that were so a child s soul would have no means of understanding at all nor does it understand by means of intelligible species divinely infused for such knowledge would not be natural such as we treat of now but the effect of grace Therefore the soul apart from the body understands nothing On the contrary The Philosopher says De Anima i one If the soul had no proper operation it could not be separated from the body But the soul is separated from the body therefore it has a proper operation and above all that which consists in intelligence Therefore the soul can understand when it is apart from the body I answer that The difficulty in solving this question arises from the fact that the soul united to the body can understand only by turning to the phantasms as experience shows Did this not proceed from the soul s very nature but accidentally through its being bound up with the body as the Platonists said the difficulty would vanish for in that case when the body was once removed the soul would at once return to its own nature and would understand intelligible things simply without turning to the phantasms as is exemplified in the case of other separate substances In that case however the union of soul and body would not be for the soul s good for evidently it would understand worse in the body than out of it but for the good of the body which would be unreasonable since matter exists on account of the form and not the form for the sake of matter But if we admit that the nature of the soul requires it to understand by turning to the phantasms it will seem since death does not change its nature that it can then naturally understand nothing as the phantasms are wanting to which it may turn To solve this difficulty we must consider that as nothing acts except so far as it is actual the mode of action in every agent follows from its mode of existence Now the soul has one mode of being when in the body and another when apart from it its nature remaining always the same but this does not mean that its union with the body is an accidental thing for on the contrary such union belongs to its very nature just as the nature of a light object is not changed when it is in its proper place which is natural to it and outside its proper place which is beside its nature The soul therefore when united to the body consistently with that mode of existence has a mode of understanding by turning to corporeal phantasms which are in corporeal organs but when it is separated from the body it has a mode of understanding by turning to simply intelligible objects as is proper to other separate substances Hence it is as natural for the soul to understand by turning to the phantasms as it is for it to be joined to the body but to be separated from the body is not in accordance with its nature and likewise to understand without turning to the phantasms is not natural to it and hence it is united to the body in order that it may have an existence and an operation suitable to its nature But here again a difficulty arises For since nature is always ordered to what is best and since it is better to understand by turning to simply intelligible objects than by turning to the phantasms God should have ordered the soul s nature so that the nobler way of understanding would have been natural to it and it would not have needed the body for that purpose In order to resolve this difficulty we must consider that while it is true that it is nobler in itself to understand by turning to something higher than to understand by turning to phantasms nevertheless such a mode of understanding was not so perfect as regards what was possible to the soul This will appear if we consider that every intellectual substance possesses intellective power by the influence of the Divine light which is one and simple in its first principle and the farther off intellectual creatures are from the first principle so much the more is the light divided and diversified as is the case with lines radiating from the centre of a circle Hence it is that God by His one Essence understands all things while the superior intellectual substances understand by means of a number of species which nevertheless are fewer and more universal and bestow a deeper comprehension of things because of the efficaciousness of the intellectual power of such natures whereas the inferior intellectual natures possess a greater number of species which are less universal and bestow a lower degree of comprehension in proportion as they recede from the intellectual power of the higher natures If therefore the inferior substances received species in the same degree of universality as the superior substances since they are not so strong in understanding the knowledge which they would derive through them would be imperfect and of a general and confused nature We can see this to a certain extent in man for those who are of weaker intellect fail to acquire perfect knowledge through the universal conceptions of those who have a better understanding unless things are explained to them singly and in detail Now it is clear that in the natural order human souls hold the lowest place among intellectual substances But the perfection of the universe required various grades of being If therefore God had willed souls to understand in the same way as separate substances it would follow that human knowledge so far from being perfect would be confused and general Therefore to make it possible for human souls to possess perfect and proper knowledge they were so made that their nature required them to be joined to bodies and thus to receive the proper and adequate knowledge of sensible things from the sensible things themselves thus we see in the case of uneducated men that they have to be taught by sensible examples It is clear then that it was for the soul s good that it was united to a body and that it understands by turning to the phantasms Nevertheless it is possible for it to exist apart from the body and also to understand in another way Reply Obj one The Philosopher s words carefully examined will show that he said this on the previous supposition that understanding is a movement of body and soul as united just as sensation is for he had not as yet explained the difference between intellect and sense We may also say that he is referring to the way of understanding by turning to phantasms This is also the meaning of the second objection Reply Obj three The separated soul does not understand by way of innate species nor by species abstracted then nor only by species retained and this the objection proves but the soul in that state understands by means of participated species arising from the influence of the Divine light shared by the soul as by other separate substances though in a lesser degree Hence as soon as it ceases to act by turning to corporeal phantasms the soul turns at once to the superior things nor is this way of knowledge unnatural for God is the author of the influx of both of the light of grace and of the light of nature SECOND ARTICLE I Q eighty nine Art two Whether the Separated Soul Understands Separate Substances Objection one It would seem that the separated soul does not understand separate substances For the soul is more perfect when joined to the body than when existing apart from it being an essential part of human nature and every part of a whole is more perfect when it exists in that whole But the soul in the body does not understand separate substances as shown above Q eighty eight A one Therefore much less is it able to do so when apart from the body Obj two Further whatever is known is known either by its presence or by its species But separate substances cannot be known to the soul by their presence for God alone can enter into the soul nor by means of species abstracted by the soul from an angel for an angel is more simple than a soul Therefore the separated soul cannot at all understand separate substances Obj three Further some philosophers said that the ultimate happiness of man consists in the knowledge of separate substances If therefore the separated soul can understand separate substances its happiness would be secured by its separation alone which cannot be reasonably be said On the contrary Souls apart from the body know other separated souls as we see in the case of the rich man in hell who saw Lazarus and Abraham Luke sixteen twenty three Therefore separated souls see the devils and the angels I answer that Augustine says De Trin ix three our mind acquires the knowledge of incorporeal things by itself i e by knowing itself Q eighty eight A one ad one Therefore from the knowledge which the separated soul has of itself we can judge how it knows other separate things Now it was said above A one that as long as it is united to the body the soul understands by turning to phantasms and therefore it does not understand itself save through becoming actually intelligent by means of ideas abstracted from phantasms for thus it understands itself through its own act as shown above Q eighty seven A one When however it is separated from the body it understands no longer by turning to phantasms but by turning to simply intelligible objects hence in that state it understands itself through itself Now every separate substance understands what is above itself and what is below itself according to the mode of its substance De Causis viii for a thing is understood according as it is in the one who understands while one thing is in another according to the nature of that in which it is And the mode of existence of a separated soul is inferior to that of an angel but is the same as that of other separated souls Therefore the soul apart from the body has perfect knowledge of other separated souls but it has an imperfect and defective knowledge of the angels so far as its natural knowledge is concerned But the knowledge of glory is otherwise Reply Obj one The separated soul is indeed less perfect considering its nature in which it communicates with the nature of the body but it has a greater freedom of intelligence since the weight and care of the body is a clog upon the clearness of its intelligence in the present life Reply Obj two The separated soul understands the angels by means of divinely impressed ideas which however fail to give perfect knowledge of them forasmuch as the nature of the soul is inferior to that of an angel Reply Obj three Man s ultimate happiness consists not in the knowledge of any separate substances but in the knowledge of God Who is seen only by grace The knowledge of other separate substances if perfectly understood gives great happiness not final and ultimate happiness But the separated soul does not understand them perfectly as was shown above in this article THIRD ARTICLE I Q eighty nine Art three Whether the Separated Soul Knows All Natural Things Objection one It would seem that the separated soul knows all natural things For the types of all natural things exist in separate substances Therefore as separated souls know separate substances they also know all natural things Obj two Further whoever understands the greater intelligible will be able much more to understand the lesser intelligible But the separated soul understands immaterial substances which are in the highest degree of intelligibility Therefore much more can it understand all natural things which are in a lower degree of intelligibility On the contrary The devils have greater natural knowledge than the separated soul yet they do not know all natural things but have to learn many things by long experience as Isidore says De Summo Bono i Therefore neither can the separated soul know all natural things I answer that As stated above A one the separated soul like the angels understands by means of species received from the influence of the Divine light Nevertheless as the soul by nature is inferior to an angel to whom this kind of knowledge is natural the soul apart from the body through such species does not receive perfect knowledge but only a general and confused kind of knowledge Separated souls therefore have the same relation through such species to imperfect and confused knowledge of natural things as the angels have to the perfect knowledge thereof Now angels through such species know all natural things perfectly because all that God has produced in the respective natures of natural things has been produced by Him in the angelic intelligence as Augustine says general ad lit ii eight Hence it follows that separated souls know all natural things not with a certain and proper knowledge but in a general and confused manner Reply Obj one Even an angel does not understand all natural things through his substance but through certain species as stated above Q eighty seven A one So it does not follow that the soul knows all natural things because it knows separate substances after a fashion Reply Obj two As the soul separated from the body does not perfectly understand separate substances so neither does it know all natural things perfectly but it knows them confusedly as above explained in this article Reply Obj three Isidore speaks of the knowledge of the future which neither angels nor demons nor separated souls know except so far as future things pre exist in their causes or are known by Divine revelation But we are here treating of the knowledge of natural things Reply Obj four Knowledge acquired here by study is proper and perfect the knowledge of which we speak is confused Hence it does not follow that to study in order to learn is useless FOURTH ARTICLE I Q eighty nine Art four Whether the Separated Soul Knows Singulars Objection one It would seem that the separated soul does not know singulars For no cognitive power besides the intellect remains in the separated soul as is clear from what has been said above Q seventy seven A eight But the intellect cannot know singulars as we have shown Q eighty six A one Therefore the separated soul cannot know singulars Obj two Further the knowledge of the singular is more determinate than knowledge of the universal But the separated soul has no determinate knowledge of the species of natural things therefore much less can it know singulars Obj three Further if it knew the singulars yet not by sense for the same reason it would know all singulars But it does not know all singulars Therefore it knows none On the contrary The rich man in hell said I have five brethren Luke sixteen twenty eight I answer that Separated souls know some singulars but not all not even all present singulars To understand this we must consider that there is a twofold way of knowing things one by means of abstraction from phantasms and in this way singulars cannot be directly known by the intellect but only indirectly as stated above Q eighty six A one The other way of understanding is by the infusion of species by God and in that way it is possible for the intellect to know singulars For as God knows all things universal and singular by His Essence as the cause of universal and individual principles Q fourteen A two so likewise separate substances can know singulars by species which are a kind of participated similitude of the Divine Essence There is a difference however between angels and separated souls in the fact that through these species the angels have a perfect and proper knowledge of things whereas separated souls have only a confused knowledge Hence the angels by reason of their perfect intellect through these species know not only the specific natures of things but also the singulars contained in those species whereas separated souls by these species know only those singulars to which they are determined by former knowledge in this life or by some affection or by natural aptitude or by the disposition of the Divine order because whatever is received into anything is conditioned according to the mode of the recipient Reply Obj one The intellect does not know the singular by way of abstraction neither does the separated soul know it thus but as explained above Reply Obj two The knowledge of the separated soul is confined to those species or individuals to which the soul has some kind of determinate relation as we have said Reply Obj three The separated soul has not the same relation to all singulars but one relation to some and another to others Therefore there is not the same reason why it should know all singulars FIFTH ARTICLE I Q eighty nine Art five Whether the Habit of Knowledge Here Acquired Remains in the Separated Soul Objection one It would seem that the habit of knowledge acquired in this life does not remain in the soul separated from the body for the Apostle says Knowledge shall be destroyed one Cor thirteen eight Obj two Further some in this world who are less good enjoy knowledge denied to others who are better If therefore the habit of knowledge remained in the soul after death it would follow that some who are less good would even in the future life excel some who are better which seems unreasonable Obj three Further separated souls will possess knowledge by influence of the Divine light Supposing therefore that knowledge here acquired remained in the separated soul it would follow that two forms of the same species would company exist in the same subject which cannot be Obj four Further the Philosopher says Praedic vi four five that a habit is a quality hard to remove yet sometimes knowledge is destroyed by sickness or the like But in this life there is no change so thorough as death Therefore it seems that the habit of knowledge is destroyed by death On the contrary Jerome says Ep liii ad Paulinum Let us learn on earth that kind of knowledge which will remain with us in heaven I answer that Some say that the habit of knowledge resides not in the intellect itself but in the sensitive powers namely the imaginative cogitative and memorative and that the intelligible species are not kept in the passive intellect If this were true it would follow that when the body is destroyed by death knowledge here acquired would also be entirely destroyed But since knowledge resides in the intellect which is the abode of species as the Philosopher says De Anima iii four the habit of knowledge here acquired must be partly in the aforesaid sensitive powers and partly in the intellect This can be seen by considering the very actions from which knowledge arises For habits are like the actions whereby they are acquired Ethic ii one Now the actions of the intellect by which knowledge is here acquired are performed by the mind turning to the phantasms in the aforesaid sensitive powers Hence through such acts the passive intellect acquires a certain facility in considering the species received and the aforesaid sensitive powers acquire a certain aptitude in seconding the action of the intellect when it turns to them to consider the intelligible object But as the intellectual act resides chiefly and formally in the intellect itself whilst it resides materially and dispositively in the inferior powers the same distinction is to be applied to habit Knowledge therefore acquired in the present life does not remain in the separated soul as regards what belongs to the sensitive powers but as regards what belongs to the intellect itself it must remain because as the Philosopher says De Long et Brev Vitae ii a form may be corrupted in two ways first directly when corrupted by its contrary as heat by cold and secondly indirectly when its subject is corrupted Now it is evident that human knowledge is not corrupted through corruption of the subject for the intellect is an incorruptible faculty as above stated Q seventy nine A two ad two Neither can the intelligible species in the passive intellect be corrupted by their contrary for there is no contrary to intelligible intentions above all as regards simple intelligence of what a thing is But contrariety may exist in the intellect as regards mental composition and division or also reasoning so far as what is false in statement or argument is contrary to truth And thus knowledge may be corrupted by its contrary when a false argument seduces anyone from the knowledge of truth For this reason the Philosopher in the above work mentions two ways in which knowledge is corrupted directly namely forgetfulness on the part of the memorative power and deception on the part of a false argument But these have no place in the separated soul Therefore we must conclude that the habit of knowledge so far as it is in the intellect remains in the separated soul Reply Obj one The Apostle is not speaking of knowledge as a habit but as to the act of knowing and hence he says in proof of the assertion quoted Now I know in part Reply Obj two As a less good man may exceed a better man in bodily stature so the same kind of man may have a habit of knowledge in the future life which a better man may not have Such knowledge however cannot be compared with the other prerogatives enjoyed by the better man Reply Obj three These two kinds of knowledge are not of the same species so there is no impossibility Reply Obj four This objection considers the corruption of knowledge on the part of the sensitive powers SIXTH ARTICLE I Q eighty nine Art six Whether the Act of Knowledge Acquired Here Remains in the Separated Soul Objection one It would seem that the act of knowledge here acquired does not remain in the separated soul For the Philosopher says De Anima i four that when the body is corrupted the soul neither remembers nor loves But to consider what is previously known is an act of memory Therefore the separated soul cannot retain an act of knowledge here acquired Obj two Further intelligible species cannot have greater power in the separated soul than they have in the soul united to the body But in this life we cannot understand by intelligible species without turning to phantasms as shown above Q eighty four A seven Therefore the separated soul cannot do so and thus it cannot understand at all by intelligible species acquired in this life Obj three Further the Philosopher says Ethic ii one that habits produce acts similar to those whereby they are acquired But the habit of knowledge is acquired here by acts of the intellect turning to phantasms therefore it cannot produce any other acts These acts however are not adapted to the separated soul Therefore the soul in the state of separation cannot produce any act of knowledge acquired in this life On the contrary It was said to Dives in hell Luke sixteen twenty five Remember thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime I answer that Action offers two things for our consideration its species and its mode Its species comes from the object whereto the faculty of knowledge is directed by the intelligible species which is the object s similitude whereas the mode is gathered from the power of the agent Thus that a person see a stone is due to the species of the stone in his eye but that he see it clearly is due to the eye s visual power Therefore as the intelligible species remain in the separated soul as stated above A five and since the state of the separated soul is not the same as it is in this life it follows that through the intelligible species acquired in this life the soul apart from the body can understand what it understood formerly but in a different way not by turning to phantasms but by a mode suited to a soul existing apart from the body Thus the act of knowledge here acquired remains in the separated soul but in a different way Reply Obj one The Philosopher speaks of remembrance according as memory belongs to the sensitive part but not as belonging in a way to the intellect as explained above Q seventy nine A six Reply Obj two The different mode of intelligence is produced by the different state of the intelligent soul not by diversity of species Reply Obj three The acts which produce a habit are like the acts caused by that habit in species but not in mode For example to do just things but not justly that is pleasurably causes the habit of political justice whereby we act pleasurably Cf Aristotle Ethic v eight Magn Moral i thirty four SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q eighty nine Art seven Whether Local Distance Impedes the Knowledge in the Separated Soul Objection one It would seem that local distance impedes the separated soul s knowledge For Augustine says De Cura pro Mort xiii that the souls of the dead are where they cannot know what is done here But they know what is done among themselves Therefore local distance impedes the knowledge in the separated soul Obj two Further Augustine says De Divin Daemon iii that the demons rapidity of movement enables them to tell things unknown to us But agility of movement would be useless in that respect unless their knowledge was impeded by local distance which therefore is a much greater hindrance to the knowledge of the separated soul whose nature is inferior to the demon s Obj three Further as there is distance of place so is there distance of time But distance of time impedes knowledge in the separated soul for the soul is ignorant of the future Therefore it seems that distance of place also impedes its knowledge On the contrary It is written Luke sixteen twenty three that Dives lifting up his eyes when he was in torment saw Abraham afar off Therefore local distance does not impede knowledge in the separated soul I answer that Some have held that the separated soul knows the singular by abstraction from the sensible If that were so it might be that local distance would impede its knowledge for either the sensible would need to act upon the soul or the soul upon the sensible and in either case a determinate distance would be necessary This is however impossible because abstraction of the species from the sensible is done through the senses and other sensible faculties which do not remain actually in the soul apart from the body But the soul when separated understands singulars by species derived from the Divine light which is indifferent to what is near or distant Hence knowledge in the separated soul is not hindered by local distance Reply Obj one Augustine says that the souls of the departed cannot see what is done here not because they are there as if impeded by local distance but for some other cause as we shall explain A eight Reply Obj two Augustine speaks there in accordance with the opinion that demons have bodies naturally united to them and so have sensitive powers which require local distance In the same book he expressly sets down this opinion though apparently rather by way of narration than of assertion as we may gather from De Civ Dei xxi ten Reply Obj three The future which is distant in time does not actually exist and therefore is not knowable in itself because so far as a thing falls short of being so far does it fall short of being knowable But what is locally distant exists actually and is knowable in itself Hence we cannot argue from distance of time to distance of place EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q eighty nine Art eight Whether Separated Souls Know What Takes Place on Earth Objection one It would seem that separated souls know what takes place on earth for otherwise they would have no care for it as they have according to what Dives said Luke sixteen twenty seven twenty eight I have five brethren he may testify unto them lest they also come into the place of torments Therefore separated souls know what passes on earth Obj two Further the dead often appear to the living asleep or awake and tell them of what takes place there as Samuel appeared to Saul one Kings twenty eight eleven But this could not be unless they knew what takes place here Therefore they know what takes place on earth Obj three Further separated souls know what happens among themselves If therefore they do not know what takes place among us it must be by reason of local distance which has been shown to be false A seven On the contrary It is written Job fourteen twenty one He will not understand whether his children come to honor or dishonor I answer that By natural knowledge of which we are treating now the souls of the dead do not know what passes on earth This follows from what has been laid down A four since the separated soul has knowledge of singulars by being in a way determined to them either by some vestige of previous knowledge or affection or by the Divine order Now the souls departed are in a state of separation from the living both by Divine order and by their mode of existence whilst they are joined to the world of incorporeal spiritual substances and hence they are ignorant of what goes on among us Whereof Gregory gives the reason thus The dead do not know how the living act for the life of the spirit is far from the life of the flesh and so as corporeal things differ from incorporeal in genus so they are distinct in knowledge Moral xii Augustine seems to say the same De Cura pro Mort xiii when he asserts that the souls of the dead have no concern in the affairs of the living Gregory and Augustine however seem to be divided in opinion as regards the souls of the blessed in heaven for Gregory continues the passage above quoted The case of the holy souls is different for since they see the light of Almighty God we cannot believe that external things are unknown to them But Augustine De Cura pro Mort xiii expressly says The dead even the saints do not know what is done by the living or by their own children as a gloss quotes on the text Abraham hath not known us Isa sixty three sixteen He confirms this opinion by saying that he was not visited nor consoled in sorrow by his mother as when she was alive and he could not think it possible that she was less kind when in a happier state and again by the fact that the Lord promised to king Josias that he should die lest he should see his people s afflictions four Kings twenty two twenty Yet Augustine says this in doubt and premises Let every one take as he pleases what I say Gregory on the other hand is positive since he says We cannot believe His opinion indeed seems to be the more probable one that the souls of the blessed who see God do know all that passes here For they are equal to the angels of whom Augustine says that they know what happens among those living on earth But as the souls of the blessed are most perfectly united to Divine justice they do not suffer from sorrow nor do they interfere in mundane affairs except in accordance with Divine justice Reply Obj one The souls of the departed may care for the living even if ignorant of their state just as we care for the dead by pouring forth prayer on their behalf though we are ignorant of their state Moreover the affairs of the living can be made known to them not immediately but the souls who pass hence thither or by angels and demons or even by the revelation of the Holy Ghost as Augustine says in the same book Reply Obj two That the dead appear to the living in any way whatever is either by the special dispensation of God in order that the souls of the dead may interfere in affairs of the living and this is to be accounted as miraculous Or else such apparitions occur through the instrumentality of bad or good angels without the knowledge of the departed as may likewise happen when the living appear without their own knowledge to others living as Augustine says in the same book And so it may be said of Samuel that he appeared through Divine revelation according to Ecclus forty six twenty three he slept and told the king the end of his life Or again this apparition was procured by the demons unless indeed the authority of Ecclesiasticus be set aside through not being received by the Jews as canonical Scripture Reply Obj three This kind of ignorance does not proceed from the obstacle of local distance but from the cause mentioned above QUESTION ninety OF THE FIRST PRODUCTION OF MAN S SOUL In Four Articles After the foregoing we must consider the first production of man concerning which there are four subjects of treatment one the production of man himself two the end of this production three the state and condition of the first man four the place of his abode Concerning the production of man there are three things to be considered one the production of man s soul two the production of man s body three the production of the woman Under the first head there are four points of inquiry one Whether man s soul was something made or was of the Divine substance two Whether if made it was created three Whether it was made by angelic instrumentality four Whether it was made before the body FIRST ARTICLE I Q ninety Art one Whether the Soul Was Made or Was of God s Substance Objection one It would seem that the soul was not made but was God s substance For it is written general two seven God formed man of the slime of the earth and breathed into his face the breath of life and man was made a living soul But he who breathes sends forth something of himself Therefore the soul whereby man lives is of the Divine substance Obj two Further as above explained Q seventy five A five the soul is a simple form But a form is an act Therefore the soul is a pure act which applies to God alone Therefore the soul is of God s substance Obj three Further things that exist and do not differ are the same But God and the mind exist and in no way differ for they could only be differentiated by certain differences and thus would be composite Therefore God and the human mind are the same On the contrary Augustine De Orig Animae iii fifteen mentions certain opinions which he calls exceedingly and evidently perverse and contrary to the Catholic Faith among which the first is the opinion that God made the soul not out of nothing but from Himself I answer that To say that the soul is of the Divine substance involves a manifest improbability For as is clear from what has been said Q seventy seven A two Q seventy nine A two Q eighty four A six the human soul is sometimes in a state of potentiality to the act of intelligence acquires its knowledge somehow from things and thus has various powers all of which are incompatible with the Divine Nature Which is a pure act receives nothing from any other and admits of no variety in itself as we have proved Q three AA one seven Q nine A one This error seems to have originated from two statements of the ancients For those who first began to observe the nature of things being unable to rise above their imagination supposed that nothing but bodies existed Therefore they said that God was a body which they considered to be the principle of other bodies And since they held that the soul was of the same nature as that body which they regarded as the first principle as is stated De Anima i two it followed that the soul was of the nature of God Himself According to this supposition also the Manichaeans thinking that God was corporeal light held that the soul was part of that light bound up with the body Then a further step in advance was made and some surmised the existence of something incorporeal not apart from the body but the form of a body so that Varro said God is a soul governing the world by movement and reason as Augustine relates De Civ Dei vii six The words as quoted are to be found iv thirty one So some supposed man s soul to be part of that one soul as man is a part of the whole world for they were unable to go so far as to understand the different degrees of spiritual substance except according to the distinction of bodies But all these theories are impossible as proved above Q three AA one eight and Q seventy five A one wherefore it is evidently false that the soul is of the substance of God Reply Obj one The term breathe is not to be taken in the material sense but as regards the act of God to breathe spirare is the same as to make a spirit Moreover in the material sense man by breathing does not send forth anything of his own substance but an extraneous thing Reply Obj two Although the soul is a simple form in its essence yet it is not its own existence but is a being by participation as above explained Q seventy five A five ad four Therefore it is not a pure act like God Reply Obj three That which differs properly speaking differs in something wherefore we seek for difference where we find also resemblance For this reason things which differ must in some way be compound since they differ in something and in something resemble each other In this sense although all that differ are diverse yet all things that are diverse do not differ For simple things are diverse yet do not differ from one another by differences which enter into their composition For instance a man and a horse differ by the difference of rational and irrational but we cannot say that these again differ by some further difference SECOND ARTICLE I Q ninety Art two Whether the Soul Was Produced by Creation Objection one It would seem that the soul was not produced by creation For that which has in itself something material is produced from matter But the soul is in part material since it is not a pure act Therefore the soul was made of matter and hence it was not created Obj two Further every actuality of matter is educed from the potentiality of that matter for since matter is in potentiality to act any act pre exists in matter potentially But the soul is the act of corporeal matter as is clear from its definition Therefore the soul is educed from the potentiality of matter Obj three Further the soul is a form Therefore if the soul is created all other forms also are created Thus no forms would come into existence by generation which is not true On the contrary It is written general one twenty seven God created man to His own image But man is like to God in his soul Therefore the soul was created I answer that The rational soul can be made only by creation which however is not true of other forms The reason is because since to be made is the way to existence a thing must be made in such a way as is suitable to its mode of existence Now that properly exists which itself has existence as it were subsisting in its own existence Wherefore only substances are properly and truly called beings whereas an accident has not existence but something is modified by it and so far is it called a being for instance whiteness is called a being because by it something is white Hence it is said Metaph vii Did vi one that an accident should be described as of something rather than as something The same is to be said of all non subsistent forms Therefore properly speaking it does not belong to any non existing form to be made but such are said to be made through the composite substances being made On the other hand the rational soul is a subsistent form as above explained Q seventy five A two Wherefore it is competent to be and to be made And since it cannot be made of pre existing matter whether corporeal which would render it a corporeal being or spiritual which would involve the transmutation of one spiritual substance into another we must conclude that it cannot exist except by creation Reply Obj one The soul s simple essence is as the material element while its participated existence is its formal element which participated existence necessarily company exists with the soul s essence because existence naturally follows the form The same reason holds if the soul is supposed to be composed of some spiritual matter as some maintain because the said matter is not in potentiality to another form as neither is the matter of a celestial body otherwise the soul would be corruptible Wherefore the soul cannot in any way be made of pre existent matter Reply Obj two The production of act from the potentiality of matter is nothing else but something becoming actually that previously was in potentiality But since the rational soul does not depend in its existence on corporeal matter and is subsistent and exceeds the capacity of corporeal matter as we have seen Q seventy five A two it is not educed from the potentiality of matter Reply Obj three As we have said there is no comparison between the rational soul and other forms THIRD ARTICLE I Q ninety Art three Whether the Rational Soul Is Produced by God Immediately Objection one It would seem that the rational soul is not immediately made by God but by the instrumentality of the angels For spiritual things have more order than corporeal things But inferior bodies are produced by means of the superior as Dionysius says Div Nom iv Therefore also the inferior spirits who are the rational souls are produced by means of the superior spirits the angels Obj two Further the end corresponds to the beginning of things for God is the beginning and end of all Therefore the issue of things from their beginning corresponds to the forwarding of them to their end But inferior things are forwarded by the higher as Dionysius says Eccl Hier v therefore also the inferior are produced into existence by the higher and souls by angels Obj three Further perfect is that which can produce its like as is stated Metaph v But spiritual substances are much more perfect than corporeal Therefore since bodies produce their like in their own species much more are angels able to produce something specifically inferior to themselves and such is the rational soul On the contrary It is written general two seven that God Himself breathed into the face of man the breath of life I answer that Some have held that angels acting by the power of God produce rational souls 
8742_245707_000035_000001	train-clean-360	But this is quite impossible 
none	none	and is against faith For it has been proved that the rational soul cannot be produced except by creation Now God alone can create for the first agent alone can act without presupposing the existence of anything while the second cause always presupposes something derived from the first cause as above explained Q seventy five A three and every agent that presupposes something to its act acts by making a change therein Therefore everything else acts by producing a change whereas God alone acts by creation Since therefore the rational soul cannot be produced by a change in matter it cannot be produced save immediately by God Thus the replies to the objections are clear For that bodies produce their like or something inferior to themselves and that the higher things lead forward the inferior all these things are effected through a certain transmutation FOURTH ARTICLE I Q ninety Art four Whether the Human Soul Was Produced Before the Body Objection one It would seem that the human soul was made before the body For the work of creation preceded the work of distinction and adornment as shown above Q sixty six A one Q seventy A one But the soul was made by creation whereas the body was made at the end of the work of adornment Therefore the soul of man was made before the body Obj two Further the rational soul has more in common with the angels than with the brute animals But angels were created before bodies or at least at the beginning with corporeal matter whereas the body of man was formed on the sixth day when also the animals were made Therefore the soul of man was created before the body Obj three Further the end is proportionate to the beginning But in the end the soul outlasts the body Therefore in the beginning it was created before the body On the contrary The proper act is produced in its proper potentiality Therefore since the soul is the proper act of the body the soul was produced in the body I answer that Origen Peri Archon i seventy eight held that not only the soul of the first man but also the souls of all men were created at the same time as the angels before their bodies because he thought that all spiritual substances whether souls or angels are equal in their natural condition and differ only by merit so that some of them namely the souls of men or of heavenly bodies are united to bodies while others remain in their different orders entirely free from matter Of this opinion we have already spoken Q forty seven A two and so we need say nothing about it here Augustine however general ad lit vii twenty four says that the soul of the first man was created at the same time as the angels before the body for another reason because he supposes that the body of man during the work of the six days was produced not actually but only as to some causal virtues which cannot be said of the soul because neither was it made of any pre existing corporeal or spiritual matter nor could it be produced from any created virtue Therefore it seems that the soul itself during the work of the six days when all things were made was created together with the angels and that afterwards by its own will was joined to the service of the body But he does not say this by way of assertion as his words prove For he says general ad lit vii twenty nine We may believe if neither Scripture nor reason forbid that man was made on the sixth day in the sense that his body was created as to its causal virtue in the elements of the world but that the soul was already created Now this could be upheld by those who hold that the soul has of itself a complete species and nature and that it is not united to the body as its form but as its administrator But if the soul is united to the body as its form and is naturally a part of human nature the above supposition is quite impossible For it is clear that God made the first things in their perfect natural state as their species required Now the soul as a part of human nature has its natural perfection only as united to the body Therefore it would have been unfitting for the soul to be created without the body Therefore if we admit the opinion of Augustine about the work of the six days Q seventy four A two we may say that the human soul preceded in the work of the six days by a certain generic similitude so far as it has intellectual nature in common with the angels but was itself created at the same time as the body According to the other saints both the body and soul of the first man were produced in the work of the six days Reply Obj one If the soul by its nature were a complete species so that it might be created as to itself this reason would prove that the soul was created by itself in the beginning But as the soul is naturally the form of the body it was necessarily created not separately but in the body Reply Obj two The same observation applies to the second objection For if the soul had a species of itself it would have something still more in common with the angels But as the form of the body it belongs to the animal genus as a formal principle Reply Obj three That the soul remains after the body is due to a defect of the body namely death Which defect was not due when the soul was first created QUESTION ninety one THE PRODUCTION OF THE FIRST MAN S BODY FOUR ARTICLES We have now to consider the production of the first man s body Under this head there are four points of inquiry one The matter from which it was produced two The author by whom it was produced three The disposition it received in its production four The mode and order of its production FIRST ARTICLE I Q ninety one Art one Whether the Body of the First Man Was Made of the Slime of the Earth Objection one It would seem that the body of the first man was not made of the slime of the earth For it is an act of greater power to make something out of nothing than out of something because not being is farther off from actual existence than being in potentiality But since man is the most honorable of God s lower creatures it was fitting that in the production of man s body the power of God should be most clearly shown Therefore it should not have been made of the slime of the earth but out of nothing Obj two Further the heavenly bodies are nobler than earthly bodies But the human body has the greatest nobility since it is perfected by the noblest form which is the rational soul Therefore it should not be made of an earthly body but of a heavenly body Obj three Further fire and air are nobler than earth and water as is clear from their subtlety Therefore since the human body is most noble it should rather have been made of fire and air than of the slime of the earth Obj four Further the human body is composed of the four elements Therefore it was not made of the slime of the earth but of the four elements On the contrary It is written general two seven God made man of the slime of the earth I answer that As God is perfect in His works He bestowed perfection on all of them according to their capacity God s works are perfect Deut thirty two four He Himself is simply perfect by the fact that all things are pre contained in Him not as component parts but as united in one simple whole as Dionysius says Div Nom v in the same way as various effects pre exist in their cause according to its one virtue This perfection is bestowed on the angels inasmuch as all things which are produced by God in nature through various forms come under their knowledge But on man this perfection is bestowed in an inferior way For he does not possess a natural knowledge of all natural things but is in a manner composed of all things since he has in himself a rational soul of the genus of spiritual substances and in likeness to the heavenly bodies he is removed from contraries by an equable temperament As to the elements he has them in their very substance yet in such a way that the higher elements fire and air predominate in him by their power for life is mostly found where there is heat which is from fire and where there is humor which is of the air But the inferior elements abound in man by their substance otherwise the mingling of elements would not be evenly balanced unless the inferior elements which have the less power predominated in quantity Therefore the body of man is said to have been formed from the slime of the earth because earth and water mingled are called slime and for this reason man is called a little world because all creatures of the world are in a way to be found in him Reply Obj one The power of the Divine Creator was manifested in man s body when its matter was produced by creation But it was fitting that the human body should be made of the four elements that man might have something in common with the inferior bodies as being something between spiritual and corporeal substances Reply Obj two Although the heavenly body is in itself nobler than the earthly body yet for the acts of the rational soul the heavenly body is less adapted For the rational soul receives the knowledge of truth in a certain way through the senses the organs of which cannot be formed of a heavenly body which is impassible Nor is it true that something of the fifth essence enters materially into the composition of the human body as some say who suppose that the soul is united to the body by means of light For first of all what they say is false that light is a body Secondly it is impossible for something to be taken from the fifth essence or from a heavenly body and to be mingled with the elements since a heavenly body is impassible wherefore it does not enter into the composition of mixed bodies except as in the effects of its power Reply Obj three If fire and air whose action is of greater power predominated also in quantity in the human body they would entirely draw the rest into themselves and there would be no equality in the mingling such as is required in the composition of man for the sense of touch which is the foundation of the other senses For the organ of any particular sense must not actually have the contraries of which that sense has the perception but only potentially either in such a way that it is entirely void of the whole genus of such contraries thus for instance the pupil of the eye is without color so as to be in potentiality as regards all colors which is not possible in the organ of touch since it is composed of the very elements the qualities of which are perceived by that sense or so that the organ is a medium between two contraries as much needs be the case with regard to touch for the medium is in potentiality to the extremes Reply Obj four In the slime of the earth are earth and water binding the earth together Of the other elements Scripture makes no mention because they are less in quantity in the human body as we have said and because also in the account of the Creation no mention is made of fire and air which are not perceived by senses of uncultured men such as those to whom the Scripture was immediately addressed SECOND ARTICLE I Q ninety one Art two Whether the Human Body Was Immediately Produced by God Objection one It would seem that the human body was not produced by God immediately For Augustine says De Trin iii four that corporeal things are disposed by God through the angels But the human body was made of corporeal matter as stated above A one Therefore it was produced by the instrumentality of the angels and not immediately by God Obj two Further whatever can be made by a created power is not necessarily produced immediately by God But the human body can be produced by the created power of a heavenly body for even certain animals are produced from putrefaction by the active power of a heavenly body and Albumazar says that man is not generated where heat and cold are extreme but only in temperate regions Therefore the human body was not necessarily produced immediately by God Obj three Further nothing is made of corporeal matter except by some material change But all corporeal change is caused by a movement of a heavenly body which is the first movement Therefore since the human body was produced from corporeal matter it seems that a heavenly body had part in its production Obj four Further Augustine says general ad lit vii twenty four that man s body was made during the work of the six days according to the causal virtues which God inserted in corporeal creatures and that afterwards it was actually produced But what pre exists in the corporeal creature by reason of causal virtues can be produced by some corporeal body Therefore the human body was produced by some created power and not immediately by God On the contrary It is written Ecclus seventeen one God created man out of the earth I answer that The first formation of the human body could not be by the instrumentality of any created power but was immediately from God Some indeed supposed that the forms which are in corporeal matter are derived from some immaterial forms but the Philosopher refutes this opinion Metaph vii for the reason that forms cannot be made in themselves but only in the composite as we have explained Q sixty five A four and because the agent must be like its effect it is not fitting that a pure form not existing in matter should produce a form which is in matter and which form is only made by the fact that the composite is made So a form which is in matter can only be the cause of another form that is in matter according as composite is made by composite Now God though He is absolutely immaterial can alone by His own power produce matter by creation wherefore He alone can produce a form in matter without the aid of any preceding material form For this reason the angels cannot transform a body except by making use of something in the nature of a seed as Augustine says De Trin iii nineteen Therefore as no pre existing body has been formed whereby another body of the same species could be generated the first human body was of necessity made immediately by God Reply Obj one Although the angels are the ministers of God as regards what He does in bodies yet God does something in bodies beyond the angels power as for instance raising the dead or giving sight to the blind and by this power He formed the body of the first man from the slime of the earth Nevertheless the angels could act as ministers in the formation of the body of the first man in the same way as they will do at the last resurrection by collecting the dust Reply Obj two Perfect animals produced from seed cannot be made by the sole power of a heavenly body as Avicenna imagined although the power of a heavenly body may assist by company operation in the work of natural generation as the Philosopher says Phys ii twenty six man and the sun beget man from matter For this reason a place of moderate temperature is required for the production of man and other animals But the power of heavenly bodies suffices for the production of some imperfect animals from properly disposed matter for it is clear that more conditions are required to produce a perfect than an imperfect thing Reply Obj three The movement of the heavens causes natural changes but not changes that surpass the order of nature and are caused by the Divine Power alone as for the dead to be raised to life or the blind to see like to which also is the making of man from the slime of the earth Reply Obj four An effect may be said to pre exist in the causal virtues of creatures in two ways First both in active and in passive potentiality so that not only can it be produced out of pre existing matter but also that some pre existing creature can produce it Secondly in passive potentiality only that is that out of pre existing matter it can be produced by God In this sense according to Augustine the human body pre existed in the previous work in their causal virtues THIRD ARTICLE I Q ninety one Art three Whether the Body of Man Was Given an Apt Disposition Objection one It would seem that the body of man was not given an apt disposition For since man is the noblest of animals his body ought to be the best disposed in what is proper to an animal that is in sense and movement But some animals have sharper senses and quicker movement than man thus dogs have a keener smell and birds a swifter flight Therefore man s body was not aptly disposed Obj two Further perfect is what lacks nothing But the human body lacks more than the body of other animals for these are provided with covering and natural arms of defense in which man is lacking Therefore the human body is very imperfectly disposed Obj three Further man is more distant from plants than he is from the brutes But plants are erect in stature while brutes are prone in stature Therefore man should not be of erect stature On the contrary It is written Eccles seven thirty God made man right I answer that All natural things were produced by the Divine art and so may be called God s works of art Now every artist intends to give to his work the best disposition not absolutely the best but the best as regards the proposed end and even if this entails some defect the artist cares not thus for instance when man makes himself a saw for the purpose of cutting he makes it of iron which is suitable for the object in view and he does not prefer to make it of glass though this be a more beautiful material because this very beauty would be an obstacle to the end he has in view Therefore God gave to each natural being the best disposition not absolutely so but in the view of its proper end This is what the Philosopher says Phys ii seven And because it is better so not absolutely but for each one s substance Now the proximate end of the human body is the rational soul and its operations since matter is for the sake of the form and instruments are for the action of the agent I say therefore that God fashioned the human body in that disposition which was best as most suited to such a form and to such operations If defect exists in the disposition of the human body it is well to observe that such defect arises as a necessary result of the matter from the conditions required in the body in order to make it suitably proportioned to the soul and its operations Reply Obj one The sense of touch which is the foundation of the other senses is more perfect in man than in any other animal and for this reason man must have the most equable temperament of all animals Moreover man excels all other animals in the interior sensitive powers as is clear from what we have said above Q seventy eight A four But by a kind of necessity man falls short of the other animals in some of the exterior senses thus of all animals he has the least sense of smell For man needs the largest brain as compared to the body both for his greater freedom of action in the interior powers required for the intellectual operations as we have seen above Q eighty four A seven and in order that the low temperature of the brain may modify the heat of the heart which has to be considerable in man for him to be able to stand erect So that size of the brain by reason of its humidity is an impediment to the smell which requires dryness In the same way we may suggest a reason why some animals have a keener sight and a more acute hearing than man namely on account of a hindrance to his senses arising necessarily from the perfect equability of his temperament The same reason suffices to explain why some animals are more rapid in movement than man since this excellence of speed is inconsistent with the equability of the human temperament Reply Obj two Horns and claws which are the weapons of some animals and toughness of hide and quantity of hair or feathers which are the clothing of animals are signs of an abundance of the earthly element which does not agree with the equability and softness of the human temperament Therefore such things do not suit the nature of man Instead of these he has reason and hands whereby he can make himself arms and clothes and other necessaries of life of infinite variety Wherefore the hand is called by Aristotle De Anima iii eight the organ of organs Moreover this was more becoming to the rational nature which is capable of conceiving an infinite number of things so as to make for itself an infinite number of instruments Reply Obj three An upright stature was becoming to man for four reasons First because the senses are given to man not only for the purpose of procuring the necessaries of life which they are bestowed on other animals but also for the purpose of knowledge Hence whereas the other animals take delight in the objects of the senses only as ordered to food and sex man alone takes pleasure in the beauty of sensible objects for its own sake Therefore as the senses are situated chiefly in the face other animals have the face turned to the ground as it were for the purpose of seeking food and procuring a livelihood whereas man has his face erect in order that by the senses and chiefly by sight which is more subtle and penetrates further into the differences of things he may freely survey the sensible objects around him both heavenly and earthly so as to gather intelligible truth from all things Secondly for the greater freedom of the acts of the interior powers the brain wherein these actions are in a way performed not being low down but lifted up above other parts of the body Thirdly because if man s stature were prone to the ground he would need to use his hands as fore feet and thus their utility for other purposes would cease Fourthly because if man s stature were prone to the ground and he used his hands as fore feet he would be obliged to take hold of his food with his mouth Thus he would have a protruding mouth with thick and hard lips and also a hard tongue so as to keep it from being hurt by exterior things as we see in other animals Moreover such an attitude would quite hinder speech which is reason s proper operation Nevertheless though of erect stature man is far above plants For man s superior part his head is turned towards the superior part of the world and his inferior part is turned towards the inferior world and therefore he is perfectly disposed as to the general situation of his body Plants have the superior part turned towards the lower world since their roots correspond to the mouth and their inferior part towards the upper world But brute animals have a middle disposition for the superior part of the animal is that by which it takes food and the inferior part that by which it rids itself of the surplus FOURTH ARTICLE I Q ninety one Art four Whether the Production of the Human Body Is Fittingly Described in Scripture Objection one It would seem that the production of the human body is not fittingly described in Scripture For as the human body was made by God so also were the other works of the six days But in the other works it is written God said Let it be made and it was made Therefore the same should have been said of man Obj two Further the human body was made by God immediately as explained above A two Therefore it was not fittingly said Let us make man Obj three Further the form of the human body is the soul itself which is the breath of life Therefore having said God made man of the slime of the earth he should not have added And He breathed into him the breath of life Obj four Further the soul which is the breath of life is in the whole body and chiefly in the heart Therefore it was not fittingly said He breathed into his face the breath of life Obj five Further the male and female sex belong to the body while the image of God belongs to the soul But the soul according to Augustine general ad lit vii twenty four was made before the body Therefore having said To His image He made them he should not have added male and female He created them On the contrary Is the authority of Scripture Reply Obj one As Augustine observes general ad lit vi twelve man surpasses other things not in the fact that God Himself made man as though He did not make other things since it is written Ps one hundred one twenty six The work of Thy hands is the heaven and elsewhere Ps ninety four five His hands laid down the dry land but in this that man is made to God s image Yet in describing man s production Scripture uses a special way of speaking to show that other things were made for man s sake For we are accustomed to do with more deliberation and care what we have chiefly in mind Reply Obj two We must not imagine that when God said Let us make man He spoke to the angels as some were perverse enough to think But by these words is signified the plurality of the Divine Person Whose image is more clearly expressed in man Reply Obj three Some have thought that man s body was formed first in priority of time and that afterwards the soul was infused into the formed body But it is inconsistent with the perfection of the production of things that God should have made either the body without the soul or the soul without the body since each is a part of human nature This is especially unfitting as regards the body for the body depends on the soul and not the soul on the body To remove the difficulty some have said that the words God made man must be understood of the production of the body with the soul and that the subsequent words and He breathed into his face the breath of life should be understood of the Holy Ghost as the Lord breathed on His Apostles saying Receive ye the Holy Ghost John twenty twenty two But this explanation as Augustine says De Civ Dei xiii twenty four is excluded by the very words of Scripture For we read farther on And man was made a living soul which words the Apostle one Cor fifteen forty five refers not to spiritual life but to animal life Therefore by breath of life we must understand the soul so that the words He breathed into his face the breath of life are a sort of exposition of what goes before for the soul is the form of the body Reply Obj four Since vital operations are more clearly seen in man s face on account of the senses which are there expressed therefore Scripture says that the breath of life was breathed into man s face Reply Obj five According to Augustine general ad lit iv thirty four the works of the six days were done all at one time wherefore according to him man s soul which he holds to have been made with the angels was not made before the sixth day but on the sixth day both the soul of the first man was made actually and his body in its causal elements But other doctors hold that on the sixth day both body and soul of man were actually made QUESTION ninety two 
8742_245707_000002_000000	train-clean-360	THE PRODUCTION OF THE WOMAN In Four Articles 
8742_245707_000003_000000	train-clean-360	We must next consider the production of the woman 
none	none	Under this head there are four points of inquiry
8742_245707_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 one Whether the woman should have been made in that first production of things 
8742_245707_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 two Whether the woman should have been made from man 
8742_245707_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 three Whether of man s rib 
none	none	four Whether the woman was made immediately by God FIRST ARTICLE I Q ninety two Art one 
8742_245707_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Whether the Woman Should Have Been Made in the First Production of Things 
8742_245707_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the woman should not have been made in the first production of things 
none	none	For the Philosopher says De Gener ii three that the female is a misbegotten male But nothing misbegotten or defective should have been in the first production of things Therefore woman should not have been made at that first production Obj two Further subjection and limitation were a result of sin for to the woman was it said after sin general three sixteen Thou shalt be under the man s power and Gregory says that Where there is no sin there is no inequality But woman is naturally of less strength and dignity than man for the agent is always more honorable than the patient as Augustine says general ad lit xii sixteen Therefore woman should not have been made in the first production of things before sin Obj three Further occasions of sin should be cut off 
8742_245707_000012_000001	train-clean-360	But God foresaw that the woman would be an occasion of sin to man 
none	none	Therefore He should not have made woman On the contrary It is written general two eighteen It is not good for man to be alone let us make him a helper like to himself I answer that It was necessary for woman to be made as the Scripture says as a helper to man not indeed as a helpmate in other works as some say since man can be more efficiently helped by another man in other works but as a helper in the work of generation This can be made clear if we observe the mode of generation carried out in various living things Some living things do not possess in themselves the power of generation but are generated by some other specific agent such as some plants and animals by the influence of the heavenly bodies from some fitting matter and not from seed others possess the active and passive generative power together as we see in plants which are generated from seed for the noblest vital function in plants is generation Wherefore we observe that in these the active power of generation invariably accompanies the passive power 
8742_245707_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Among perfect animals the active power of generation belongs to the male sex and the passive power to the female 
none	none	And as among animals there is a vital operation nobler than generation to which their life is principally directed therefore the male sex is not found in continual union with the female in perfect animals but only at the time of coition so that we may consider that by this means the male and female are one as in plants they are always united although in some cases one of them preponderates and in some the other 
8742_245707_000014_000005	train-clean-360	But man is yet further ordered to a still nobler vital action and that is intellectual operation Therefore there was greater reason for the distinction of these two forces in man so that the female should be produced separately from the male although they are carnally united for generation 
none	none	Therefore directly after the formation of woman it was said And they shall be two in one flesh general two twenty four Reply Obj one As regards the individual nature woman is defective and misbegotten for the active force in the male seed tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex while the production of woman comes from defect in the active force or from some material indisposition or even from some external influence such as that of a south wind which is moist as the Philosopher observes De Gener Animal iv two 
8742_245707_000015_000003	train-clean-360	On the other hand as regards human nature in general woman is not misbegotten but is included in nature s intention as directed to the work of generation 
8742_245707_000015_000004	train-clean-360	Now the general intention of nature depends on God Who is the universal Author of nature 
8742_245707_000015_000005	train-clean-360	Therefore in producing nature God formed not only the male but also the female 
none	none	Reply Obj two Subjection is twofold 
8742_245707_000016_000001	train-clean-360	One is servile by virtue of which a superior makes use of a subject for his own benefit and this kind of subjection began after sin 
8742_245707_000016_000002	train-clean-360	There is another kind of subjection which is called economic or civil whereby the superior makes use of his subjects for their own benefit and good and this kind of subjection existed even before sin 
none	none	For good order would have been wanting in the human family if some were not governed by others wiser than themselves So by such a kind of subjection woman is naturally subject to man because in man the discretion of reason predominates Nor is inequality among men excluded by the state of innocence as we shall prove Q ninety six A three Reply Obj three If God had deprived the world of all those things which proved an occasion of sin the universe would have been imperfect Nor was it fitting for the common good to be destroyed in order that individual evil might be avoided especially as God is so powerful that He can direct any evil to a good end SECOND ARTICLE I Q ninety two Art two Whether Woman Should Have Been Made from Man Objection one It would seem that woman should not have been made from man 
8742_245707_000020_000001	train-clean-360	For sex belongs both to man and animals 
8742_245707_000020_000002	train-clean-360	But in the other animals the female was not made from the male 
8742_245707_000020_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore neither should it have been so with man 
none	none	Obj two Further things of the same species are of the same matter But male and female are of the same species Therefore as man was made of the slime of the earth so woman should have been made of the same and not from man Obj three Further woman was made to be a helpmate to man in the work of generation But close relationship makes a person unfit for that office hence near relations are debarred from intermarriage as is written Lev eighteen six Therefore woman should not have been made from man On the contrary It is written Ecclus seventeen five He created of him that is out of man a helpmate like to himself that is woman I answer that When all things were first formed it was more suitable for the woman to be made from man than for the female to be from the male in other animals First in order thus to give the first man a certain dignity consisting in this that as God is the principle of the whole universe so the first man in likeness to God was the principle of the whole human race Wherefore Paul says that God made the whole human race from one Acts seventeen twenty six 
8742_245707_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Secondly that man might love woman all the more and cleave to her more closely knowing her to be fashioned from himself 
none	none	Hence it is written general two twenty three twenty four She was taken out of man wherefore a man shall leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife This was most necessary as regards the human race in which the male and female live together for life which is not the case with other animals Thirdly because as the Philosopher says Ethic viii twelve the human male and female are united not only for generation as with other animals but also for the purpose of domestic life in which each has his or her particular duty and in which the man is the head of the woman 
8742_245707_000024_000006	train-clean-360	Wherefore it was suitable for the woman to be made out of man as out of her principle 
8742_245707_000024_000007	train-clean-360	Fourthly there is a sacramental reason for this 
8742_245707_000024_000008	train-clean-360	For by this is signified that the Church takes her origin from Christ 
none	none	Wherefore the Apostle says Eph 
8742_245707_000024_000010	train-clean-360	five thirty two This is a great sacrament but I speak in Christ and in the Church 
none	none	Reply Obj one is clear from the foregoing Reply Obj two Matter is that from which something is made Now created nature has a determinate principle and since it is determined to one thing it has also a determinate mode of proceeding Wherefore from determinate matter it produces something in a determinate species 
8742_245707_000026_000003	train-clean-360	On the other hand the Divine Power being infinite can produce things of the same species out of any matter such as a man from the slime of the earth and a woman from out of man 
none	none	Reply Obj three A certain affinity arises from natural generation and this is an impediment to matrimony Woman however was not produced from man by natural generation but by the Divine Power alone Wherefore Eve is not called the daughter of Adam and so this argument does not prove THIRD ARTICLE I Q ninety two Art three Whether the Woman Was Fittingly Made from the Rib of Man 
8742_245707_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the woman should not have been formed from the rib of man 
none	none	For the rib was much smaller than the woman s body Now from a smaller thing a larger thing can be made only either by addition and then the woman ought to have been described as made out of that which was added rather than out of the rib itself or by rarefaction because as Augustine says general ad lit x A body cannot increase in bulk except by rarefaction But the woman s body is not more rarefied than man s at least not in the proportion of a rib to Eve s body Therefore Eve was not formed from a rib of Adam Obj two Further in those things which were first created there was nothing superfluous 
8742_245707_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore a rib of Adam belonged to the integrity of his body 
8742_245707_000031_000002	train-clean-360	So if a rib was removed his body remained imperfect which is unreasonable to suppose 
none	none	Obj three Further a rib cannot be removed from man without pain 
8742_245707_000032_000001	train-clean-360	But there was no pain before sin 
none	none	Therefore it was not right for a rib to be taken from the man that Eve might be made from it On the contrary It is written general two twenty two God built the rib which He took from Adam into a woman I answer that It was right for the woman to be made from a rib of man First to signify the social union of man and woman for the woman should neither use authority over man and so she was not made from his head nor was it right for her to be subject to man s contempt as his slave and so she was not made from his feet Secondly for the sacramental signification for from the side of Christ sleeping on the Cross the Sacraments flowed namely blood and water on which the Church was established Reply Obj one Some say that the woman s body was formed by a material increase without anything being added in the same way as our Lord multiplied the five loaves But this is quite impossible 
8742_245707_000035_000002	train-clean-360	For such an increase of matter would either be by a change of the very substance of the matter itself or by a change of its dimensions 
none	none	Not by change of the substance of the matter both because matter considered in itself is quite unchangeable since it has a potential existence and has nothing but the nature of a subject and because quantity and size are extraneous to the essence of matter itself 
8742_245707_000035_000004	train-clean-360	Wherefore multiplication of matter is quite unintelligible as long as the matter itself remains the same without anything added to it unless it receives greater dimensions 
none	none	This implies rarefaction which is for the same matter to receive greater dimensions as the Philosopher says Phys iv To say therefore that the same matter is enlarged without being rarefied is to combine contradictories viz the definition with the absence of the thing defined 
8742_245707_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Wherefore as no rarefaction is apparent in such multiplication of matter we must admit an addition of matter either by creation or which is more probable by conversion 
none	none	Hence Augustine says Tract xxiv in Joan that Christ filled five thousand men with five loaves in the same way as from a few seeds He produces the harvest of corn that is by transformation of the nourishment Nevertheless we say that the crowds were fed with five loaves or that woman was made from the rib because an addition was made to the already existing matter of the loaves and of the rib Reply Obj two The rib belonged to the integral perfection of Adam not as an individual but as the principle of the human race just as the semen belongs to the perfection of the begetter and is released by a natural and pleasurable operation

none	none	From this it is clear how to answer the third objection FOURTH ARTICLE I Q ninety two Art four Whether the Woman Was Formed Immediately by God 
8742_245707_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the woman was not formed immediately by God 
none	none	For no individual is produced immediately by God from another individual alike in species But the woman was made from a man who is of the same species 
8742_245707_000041_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore she was not made immediately by God 
none	none	Obj two Further Augustine De Trin iii four says that corporeal things are governed by God through the angels 
8742_245707_000042_000002	train-clean-360	But the woman s body was formed from corporeal matter 
none	none	Therefore it was made through the ministry of the angels and not immediately by God Obj three Further those things which pre exist in creatures as to their causal virtues are produced by the power of some creature and not immediately by God But the woman s body was produced in its causal virtues among the first created works as Augustine says general ad lit ix fifteen Therefore it was not produced immediately by God On the contrary Augustine says in the same work God alone to Whom all nature owes its existence could form or build up the woman from the man s rib I answer that As was said above A two ad two the natural generation of every species is from some determinate matter Now the matter whence man is naturally begotten is the human semen of man or woman Wherefore from any other matter an individual of the human species cannot naturally be generated 
8742_245707_000045_000003	train-clean-360	Now God alone the Author of nature can produce an effect into existence outside the ordinary course of nature 
none	none	Therefore God alone could produce either a man from the slime of the earth or a woman from the rib of man Reply Obj one This argument is verified when an individual is begotten by natural generation from that which is like it in the same species Reply Obj two As Augustine says general ad lit ix fifteen we do not know whether the angels were employed by God in the formation of the woman but it is certain that as the body of man was not formed by the angels from the slime of the earth so neither was the body of the woman formed by them from the man s rib Reply Obj three As Augustine says general ad lit ix eighteen The first creation of things did not demand that woman should be made thus it made it possible for her to be thus made Therefore the body of the woman did indeed pre exist in these causal virtues in the things first created not as regards active potentiality but as regards a potentiality passive in relation to the active potentiality of the Creator

8742_245708_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the image of God is not in man 
none	none	For it is written Isa forty eighteen To whom have you likened God or what image will you make for Him Obj two Further to be the image of God is the property of the First Begotten of Whom the Apostle says colonel one fifteen Who is the image of the invisible God the First Born of every creature Therefore the image of God is not to be found in man Obj three Further Hilary says De Synod Super i can Synod Ancyr that an image is of the same species as that which it represents and he also says that an image is the undivided and united likeness of one thing adequately representing another But there is no species common to both God and man nor can there be a comparison of equality between God and man Therefore there can be no image of God in man On the contrary It is written general one twenty six Let Us make man to Our own image and likeness I answer that As Augustine says QQ eighty three qu 
8742_245708_000022_000001	train-clean-360	seventy four Where an image exists there forthwith is likeness but where there is likeness there is not necessarily an image Hence it is clear that likeness is essential to an image and that an image adds something to likeness namely that it is copied from something else 
8742_245708_000022_000002	train-clean-360	For an image is so called because it is produced as an imitation of something else wherefore for instance an egg however much like and equal to another egg is not called an image of the other egg because it is not copied from it 
none	none	But equality does not belong to the essence of an image for as Augustine says QQ eighty three qu 
8742_245708_000023_000001	train-clean-360	seventy four Where there is an image there is not necessarily equality as we see in a person s image reflected in a glass 
8742_245708_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Yet this is of the essence of a perfect image for in a perfect image nothing is wanting that is to be found in that of which it is a copy 
8742_245708_000023_000003	train-clean-360	Now it is manifest that in man there is some likeness to God copied from God as from an exemplar yet this likeness is not one of equality for such an exemplar infinitely excels its copy Therefore there is in man a likeness to God not indeed a perfect likeness but imperfect 
8742_245708_000023_000004	train-clean-360	And Scripture implies the same when it says that man was made to God s likeness for the preposition to signifies a certain approach as of something at a distance 
none	none	Reply Obj one The Prophet speaks of bodily images made by man Therefore he says pointedly What image will you make for Him But God made a spiritual image to Himself in man Reply Obj two The First Born of creatures is the perfect Image of God reflecting perfectly that of which He is the Image and so He is said to be the Image and never to the image But man is said to be both image by reason of the likeness and to the image by reason of the imperfect likeness And since the perfect likeness to God cannot be except in an identical nature the Image of God exists in His first born Son as the image of the king is in his son who is of the same nature as himself whereas it exists in man as in an alien nature as the image of the king is in a silver coin as Augustine says explains in De decem Chordis Serm ix al xcvi De Tempore Reply Obj three As unity means absence of division a species is said to be the same as far as it is one 
8742_245708_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Now a thing is said to be one not only numerically specifically or generically but also according to a certain analogy or proportion 
none	none	In this sense a creature is one with God or like to Him but when Hilary says of a thing which adequately represents another this is to be understood of a perfect image SECOND ARTICLE I Q ninety three Art two Whether the Image of God Is to Be Found in Irrational Creatures 
8742_245708_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the image of God is to be found in irrational creatures 
none	none	For Dionysius says Div Nom ii Effects are contingent images of their causes But God is the cause not only of rational but also of irrational creatures Therefore the image of God is to be found in irrational creatures Obj two Further the more distinct a likeness is the nearer it approaches to the nature of an image But Dionysius says Div Nom iv that the solar ray has a very great similitude to the Divine goodness Therefore it is made to the image of God Obj three Further the more perfect anything is in goodness the more it is like God But the whole universe is more perfect in goodness than man for though each individual thing is good all things together are called very good general one thirty one 
8742_245708_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the whole universe is to the image of God and not only man 
none	none	Obj four Further Boethius De Consol iii says of God Holding the world in His mind and forming it into His image Therefore the whole world is to the image of God and not only the rational creature On the contrary Augustine says general ad lit vi twelve Man s excellence consists in the fact that God made him to His own image by giving him an intellectual soul which raises him above the beasts of the field Therefore things without intellect are not made to God s image I answer that Not every likeness not even what is copied from something else is sufficient to make an image for if the likeness be only generic or existing by virtue of some common accident this does not suffice for one thing to be the image of another 
8742_245708_000034_000001	train-clean-360	For instance a worm though from man it may originate cannot be called man s image merely because of the generic likeness 
8742_245708_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Nor if anything is made white like something else can we say that it is the image of that thing for whiteness is an accident belonging to many species 
8742_245708_000034_000003	train-clean-360	But the nature of an image requires likeness in species thus the image of the king exists in his son or at least in some specific accident and chiefly in the shape thus we speak of a man s image in copper Whence Hilary says pointedly that an image is of the same species 
8742_245708_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Now it is manifest that specific likeness follows the ultimate difference 
none	none	But some things are like to God first and most commonly because they exist secondly because they live and thirdly because they know or understand and these last as Augustine says QQ eighty three qu 
8742_245708_000035_000002	train-clean-360	fifty one approach so near to God in likeness that among all creatures nothing comes nearer to Him It is clear therefore that intellectual creatures alone properly speaking are made to God s image 
none	none	Reply Obj one Everything imperfect is a participation of what is perfect 
8742_245708_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore even what falls short of the nature of an image so far as it possesses any sort of likeness to God participates in some degree the nature of an image 
none	none	So Dionysius says that effects are contingent images of their causes that is as much as they happen contingit to be so but not absolutely Reply Obj two Dionysius compares the solar ray to Divine goodness as regards its causality not as regards its natural dignity which is involved in the idea of an image Reply Obj three The universe is more perfect in goodness than the intellectual creature as regards extension and diffusion but intensively and collectively the likeness to the Divine goodness is found rather in the intellectual creature which has a capacity for the highest good 
8742_245708_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Or else we may say that a part is not rightly divided against the whole but only against another part 
none	none	Wherefore when we say that the intellectual nature alone is to the image of God we do not mean that the universe in any part is not to God s image but that the other parts are excluded Reply Obj four Boethius here uses the word image to express the likeness which the product of an art bears to the artistic species in the mind of the artist 
8742_245708_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Thus every creature is an image of the exemplar type thereof in the Divine mind 
none	none	We are not however using the word image in this sense but as it implies a likeness in nature that is inasmuch as all things as being are like to the First Being as living like to the First Life and as intelligent like to the Supreme Wisdom THIRD ARTICLE I Q ninety three Art three Whether the Angels Are More to the Image of God Than Man Is 
8742_245708_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the angels are not more to the image of God than man is 
none	none	For Augustine says in a sermon de Imagine xliii de verbis Apost xxvii that God granted to no other creature besides man to be to His image Therefore it is not true to say that the angels are more than man to the image of God Obj two Further according to Augustine QQ eighty three qu 
8742_245708_000043_000001	train-clean-360	fifty one man is so much to God s image that God did not make any creature to be between Him and man and therefore nothing is more akin to Him But a creature is called God s image so far as it is akin to God 
none	none	Therefore the angels are not more to the image of God than man Obj three Further a creature is said to be to God s image so far as it is of an intellectual nature 
8742_245708_000044_000001	train-clean-360	But the intellectual nature does not admit of intensity or remissness for it is not an accidental thing since it is a substance 
none	none	Therefore the angels are not more to the image of God than man On the contrary Gregory says Hom in Evang xxxiv The angel is called a seal of resemblance Ezech twenty eight twelve because in him the resemblance of the Divine image is wrought with greater expression I answer that We may speak of God s image in two ways 
8742_245708_000046_000001	train-clean-360	First we may consider in it that in which the image chiefly consists that is the intellectual nature 
none	none	Thus the image of God is more perfect in the angels than in man because their intellectual nature is more perfect as is clear from what has been said Q fifty eight A three Q seventy nine A eight 
8742_245708_000046_000004	train-clean-360	Secondly we may consider the image of God in man as regards its accidental qualities so far as to observe in man a certain imitation of God consisting in the fact that man proceeds from man as God from God and also in the fact that the whole human soul is in the whole body and again in every part as God is in regard to the whole world 
none	none	In these and the like things the image of God is more perfect in man than it is in the angels 
8742_245708_000046_000006	train-clean-360	But these do not of themselves belong to the nature of the Divine image in man unless we presuppose the first likeness which is in the intellectual nature otherwise even brute animals would be to God s image 
8742_245708_000046_000007	train-clean-360	Therefore as in their intellectual nature the angels are more to the image of God than man is we must grant that absolutely speaking the angels are more to the image of God than man is but that in some respects man is more like to God 
none	none	Reply Obj one Augustine excludes the inferior creatures bereft of reason from the image of God but not the angels Reply Obj two As fire is said to be specifically the most subtle of bodies while nevertheless one kind of fire is more subtle than another so we say that nothing is more like to God than the human soul in its generic and intellectual nature because as Augustine had said previously things which have knowledge are so near to Him in likeness that of all creatures none are nearer Wherefore this does not mean that the angels are not more to God s image Reply Obj three When we say that substance does not admit of more or less we do not mean that one species of substance is not more perfect than another but that one and the same individual does not participate in its specific nature at one time more than at another nor do we mean that a species of substance is shared among different individuals in a greater or lesser degree FOURTH ARTICLE I Q ninety three Art four Whether the Image of God Is Found in Every Man 
8742_245708_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the image of God is not found in every man 
none	none	For the Apostle says that man is the image of God but woman is the image Vulg glory of man one Cor eleven seven 
8742_245708_000052_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore as woman is an individual of the human species it is clear that every individual is not an image of God 
none	none	Obj two Further the Apostle says Rom eight twenty nine Whom God foreknew He also predestined to be made conformable to the image of His Son But all men are not predestined 
8742_245708_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore all men have not the conformity of image 
none	none	Obj three Further likeness belongs to the nature of the image as above explained A one 
8742_245708_000054_000001	train-clean-360	But by sin man becomes unlike God 
none	none	Therefore he loses the image of God On the contrary It is written Ps thirty eight seven Surely man passeth as an image I answer that Since man is said to be the image of God by reason of his intellectual nature he is the most perfectly like God according to that in which he can best imitate God in his intellectual nature 
8742_245708_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Now the intellectual nature imitates God chiefly in this that God understands and loves Himself 
none	none	Wherefore we see that the image of God is in man in three ways 
8742_245708_000056_000003	train-clean-360	First inasmuch as man possesses a natural aptitude for understanding and loving God and this aptitude consists in the very nature of the mind which is common to all men 
8742_245708_000056_000004	train-clean-360	Secondly inasmuch as man actually and habitually knows and loves God though imperfectly and this image consists in the conformity of grace 
none	none	Thirdly inasmuch as man knows and loves God perfectly and this image consists in the likeness of glory Wherefore on the words The light of Thy countenance O Lord is signed upon us Ps four seven the gloss distinguishes a threefold image of creation of re creation and of likeness The first is found in all men the second only in the just the third only in the blessed Reply Obj one The image of God in its principal signification namely the intellectual nature is found both in man and in woman Hence after the words To the image of God He created him it is added Male and female He created them general one twenty seven Moreover it is said them in the plural as Augustine general ad lit iii twenty two remarks lest it should be thought that both sexes were united in one individual 
8742_245708_000057_000003	train-clean-360	But in a secondary sense the image of God is found in man and not in woman for man is the beginning and end of woman as God is the beginning and end of every creature 
8742_245708_000057_000004	train-clean-360	So when the Apostle had said that man is the image and glory of God but woman is the glory of man he adds his reason for saying this For man is not of woman but woman of man and man was not created for woman but woman for man 
none	none	Reply Obj two and three These reasons refer to the image consisting in the conformity of grace and glory FIFTH ARTICLE I Q ninety three Art five 
8742_245708_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Whether the Image of God Is in Man According to the Trinity of Persons 
8742_245708_000061_000000	train-clean-360	Objection one It would seem that the image of God does not exist in man as to the Trinity of Persons 
none	none	For Augustine says Fulgentius De Fide ad Petrum i One in essence is the Godhead of the Holy Trinity and one is the image to which man was made And Hilary De Trin v says Man is made to the image of that which is common in the Trinity Therefore the image of God in man is of the Divine Essence and not of the Trinity of Persons Obj two Further it is said De Eccl Dogmat that the image of God in man is to be referred to eternity Damascene also says De Fide Orth ii twelve that the image of God in man belongs to him as an intelligent being endowed with free will and self movement Gregory of Nyssa De Homin Opificio xvi also asserts that when Scripture says that man was made to the image of God it means that human nature was made a participator of all good for the Godhead is the fulness of goodness Now all these things belong more to the unity of the Essence than to the distinction of the Persons Therefore the image of God in man regards not the Trinity of Persons but the unity of the Essence Obj three Further an image leads to the knowledge of that of which it is the image Therefore if there is in man the image of God as to the Trinity of Persons since man can know himself by his natural reason it follows that by his natural knowledge man could know the Trinity of the Divine Persons which is untrue as was shown above Q thirty two A one Obj four Further the name of Image is not applicable to any of the Three Persons but only to the Son for Augustine says De Trin vi two that the Son alone is the image of the Father Therefore if in man there were an image of God as regards the Person this would not be an image of the Trinity but only of the Son On the contrary Hilary says De Trin iv The plurality of the Divine Persons is proved from the fact that man is said to have been made to the image of God I answer that as we have seen Q forty A two the distinction of the Divine Persons is only according to origin or rather relations of origin 
8742_245708_000066_000001	train-clean-360	Now the mode of origin is not the same in all things but in each thing is adapted to the nature thereof animated things being produced in one way and inanimate in another animals in one way and plants in another 
8742_245708_000066_000002	train-clean-360	Wherefore it is manifest that the distinction of the Divine Persons is suitable to the Divine Nature and therefore to be to the image of God by imitation of the Divine Nature does not exclude being to the same image by the representation of the Divine Persons but rather one follows from the other 
8742_245708_000066_000003	train-clean-360	We must therefore say that in man there exists the image of God both as regards the Divine Nature and as regards the Trinity of Persons for also in God Himself there is one Nature in Three Persons 
8742_245708_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Thus it is clear how to solve the first two objections 
none	none	Reply Obj three This argument would avail if the image of God in man represented God in a perfect manner But as Augustine says De Trin xv six there is a great difference between the trinity within ourselves and the Divine Trinity Therefore as he there says We see rather than believe the trinity which is in ourselves whereas we believe rather than see that God is Trinity Reply Obj four Some have said that in man there is an image of the Son only Augustine rejects this opinion De Trin xii fifty six 
8742_245708_000069_000002	train-clean-360	First because as the Son is like to the Father by a likeness of essence it would follow of necessity if man were made in likeness to the Son that he is made to the likeness of the Father 
none	none	Secondly because if man were made only to the image of the Son the Father would not have said Let Us make man to Our own image and likeness but to Thy image When therefore it is written He made him to the image of God the sense is not that the Father made man to the image of the Son only Who is God as some explained it but that the Divine Trinity made man to Its image that is of the whole Trinity When it is said that God made man to His image this can be understood in two ways first so that this preposition to points to the term of the making and then the sense is Let Us make man in such a way that Our image may be in him Secondly this preposition to may point to the exemplar cause as when we say This book is made like to that one Thus the image of God is the very Essence of God Which is incorrectly called an image forasmuch as image is put for the exemplar Or as some say the Divine Essence is called an image because thereby one Person imitates another SIXTH ARTICLE I Q ninety three Art six Whether the Image of God Is in Man As Regards the Mind Only Objection one It would seem that the image of God is not only in man s mind For the Apostle says one Cor eleven seven that the man is the image of God But man is not only mind Therefore the image of God is to be observed not only in his mind Obj two Further it is written general one twenty seven God created man to His own image to the image of God He created him male and female He created them But the distinction of male and female is in the body Therefore the image of God is also in the body and not only in the mind Obj three Further an image seems to apply principally to the shape of a thing But shape belongs to the body Therefore the image of God is to be seen in man s body also and not in his mind Obj four Further according to Augustine general ad lit xii seven hundred twenty four there is a threefold vision in us corporeal spiritual or imaginary and intellectual Therefore if in the intellectual vision that belongs to the mind there exists in us a trinity by reason of which we are made to the image of God for the like reason there must be another trinity in the others On the contrary The Apostle says Eph four twenty three twenty four Be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man Whence we are given to understand that our renewal which consists in putting on the new man belongs to the mind Now he says colonel three ten Putting on the new man him who is renewed unto knowledge of God according to the image of Him that created him where the renewal which consists in putting on the new man is ascribed to the image of God Therefore to be to the image of God belongs to the mind only I answer that While in all creatures there is some kind of likeness to God in the rational creature alone we find a likeness of image as we have explained above AA twelve whereas in other creatures we find a likeness by way of a trace Now the intellect or mind is that whereby the rational creature excels other creatures wherefore this image of God is not found even in the rational creature except in the mind while in the other parts which the rational creature may happen to possess we find the likeness of a trace as in other creatures to which in reference to such parts the rational creature can be likened We may easily understand the reason of this if we consider the way in which a trace and the way in which an image represents anything An image represents something by likeness in species as we have said while a trace represents something by way of an effect which represents the cause in such a way as not to attain to the likeness of species For imprints which are left by the movements of animals are called traces so also ashes are a trace of fire and desolation of the land a trace of a hostile army Therefore we may observe this difference between rational creatures and others both as to the representation of the likeness of the Divine Nature in creatures and as to the representation in them of the uncreated Trinity For as to the likeness of the Divine Nature rational creatures seem to attain after a fashion to the representation of the species inasmuch as they imitate God not only in being and life but also in intelligence as above explained A two whereas other creatures do not understand although we observe in them a certain trace of the Intellect that created them if we consider their disposition Likewise as the uncreated Trinity is distinguished by the procession of the Word from the Speaker and of Love from both of these as we have seen Q twenty eight A three so we may say that in rational creatures wherein we find a procession of the word in the intellect and a procession of the love in the will there exists an image of the uncreated Trinity by a certain representation of the species In other creatures however we do not find the principle of the word and the word and love but we do see in them a certain trace of the existence of these in the Cause that produced them For in the fact that a creature has a modified and finite nature proves that it proceeds from a principle while its species points to the mental word of the maker just as the shape of a house points to the idea of the architect and order points to the maker s love by reason of which he directs the effect to a good end as also the use of the house points to the will of the architect So we find in man a likeness to God by way of an image in his mind but in the other parts of his being by way of a trace Reply Obj one Man is called to the image of God not that he is essentially an image but that the image of God is impressed on his mind as a coin is an image of the king as having the image of the king Wherefore there is no need to consider the image of God as existing in every part of man Reply Obj two As Augustine says De Trin xii five some have thought that the image of God was not in man individually but severally They held that the man represents the Person of the Father those born of man denote the person of the Son and that the woman is a third person in likeness to the Holy Ghost since she so proceeded from man as not to be his son or daughter All of this is manifestly absurd first because it would follow that the Holy Ghost is the principle of the Son as the woman is the principle of the man s offspring secondly because one man would be only the image of one Person thirdly because in that case Scripture should not have mentioned the image of God in man until after the birth of the offspring Therefore we must understand that when Scripture had said to the image of God He created him it added male and female He created them not to imply that the image of God came through the distinction of sex but that the image of God belongs to both sexes since it is in the mind wherein there is no sexual distinction Wherefore the Apostle colonel three ten after saying According to the image of Him that created him added Where there is neither male nor female these words are in reality from Gal three twenty eight Vulg neither Gentile nor Jew Reply Obj three Although the image of God in man is not to be found in his bodily shape yet because the body of man alone among terrestrial animals is not inclined prone to the ground but is adapted to look upward to heaven for this reason we may rightly say that it is made to God s image and likeness rather than the bodies of other animals as Augustine remarks QQ eighty three qu fifty one But this is not to be understood as though the image of God were in man s body but in the sense that the very shape of the human body represents the image of God in the soul by way of a trace Reply Obj four Both in the corporeal and in the imaginary vision we may find a trinity as Augustine says De Trin xi two For in corporeal vision there is first the species of the exterior body secondly the act of vision which occurs by the impression on the sight of a certain likeness of the said species thirdly the intention of the will applying the sight to see and to rest on what is seen Likewise in the imaginary vision we find first the species kept in the memory secondly the vision itself which is caused by the penetrative power of the soul that is the faculty of imagination informed by the species and thirdly we find the intention of the will joining both together But each of these trinities falls short of the Divine image For the species of the external body is extrinsic to the essence of the soul while the species in the memory though not extrinsic to the soul is adventitious to it and thus in both cases the species falls short of representing the connaturality and company eternity of the Divine Persons The corporeal vision too does not proceed only from the species of the external body but from this and at the same time from the sense of the seer in like manner imaginary vision is not from the species only which is preserved in the memory but also from the imagination For these reasons the procession of the Son from the Father alone is not suitably represented Lastly the intention of the will joining the two together does not proceed from them either in corporeal or spiritual vision Wherefore the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son is not thus properly represented SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q ninety three Art seven Whether the Image of God Is to Be Found in the Acts of the Soul Objection one It would seem that the image of God is not found in the acts of the soul For Augustine says De Civ Dei xi twenty six that man was made to God s image inasmuch as we exist and know that we exist and love this existence and knowledge But to exist does not signify an act Therefore the image of God is not to be found in the soul s acts Obj two Further Augustine De Trin ix four assigns God s image in the soul to these three things mind knowledge and love But mind does not signify an act but rather the power or the essence of the intellectual soul Therefore the image of God does not extend to the acts of the soul Obj three Further Augustine De Trin x eleven assigns the image of the Trinity in the soul to memory understanding and will But these three are natural powers of the soul as the Master of the Sentences says one Sent D iii Therefore the image of God is in the powers and does not extend to the acts of the soul Obj four Further the image of the Trinity always remains in the soul But an act does not always remain Therefore the image of God does not extend to the acts On the contrary Augustine De Trin xi two seqq assigns the trinity in the lower part of the soul in relation to the actual vision whether sensible or imaginative Therefore also the trinity in the mind by reason of which man is like to God s image must be referred to actual vision I answer that As above explained A two a certain representation of the species belongs to the nature of an image Hence if the image of the Divine Trinity is to be found in the soul we must look for it where the soul approaches the nearest to a representation of the species of the Divine Persons Now the Divine Persons are distinct from each other by reason of the procession of the Word from the Speaker and the procession of Love connecting Both But in our soul word cannot exist without actual thought as Augustine says De Trin xiv seven Therefore first and chiefly the image of the Trinity is to be found in the acts of the soul that is inasmuch as from the knowledge which we possess by actual thought we form an internal word and thence break forth into love But since the principles of acts are the habits and powers and everything exists virtually in its principle therefore secondarily and consequently the image of the Trinity may be considered as existing in the powers and still more in the habits forasmuch as the acts virtually exist therein Reply Obj one Our being bears the image of God so far as it is proper to us and excels that of the other animals that is to say in so far as we are endowed with a mind Therefore this trinity is the same as that which Augustine mentions De Trin ix four and which consists in mind knowledge and love Reply Obj two Augustine observed this trinity first as existing in the mind But because the mind though it knows itself entirely in a certain degree yet also in a way does not know itself namely as being distinct from others and thus also it searches itself as Augustine subsequently proves De Trin x thirty four therefore as though knowledge were not in equal proportion to mind he takes three things in the soul which are proper to the mind namely memory understanding and will which everyone is conscious of possessing and assigns the image of the Trinity pre eminently to these three as though the first assignation were in part deficient Reply Obj three As Augustine proves De Trin xiv seven we may be said to understand will and to love certain things both when we actually consider them and when we do not think of them When they are not under our actual consideration they are objects of our memory only which in his opinion is nothing else than habitual retention of knowledge and love Cf Q seventy nine A seven ad one But since as he says a word cannot be there without actual thought for we think everything that we say even if we speak with that interior word belonging to no nation s tongue this image chiefly consists in these three things memory understanding and will And by understanding I mean here that whereby we understand with actual thought and by will love or dilection I mean that which unites this child with its parent From which it is clear that he places the image of the Divine Trinity more in actual understanding and will than in these as existing in the habitual retention of the memory although even thus the image of the Trinity exists in the soul in a certain degree as he says in the same place Thus it is clear that memory understanding and will are not three powers as stated in the Sentences Reply Obj four Someone might answer by referring to Augustine s statement De Trin xiv six that the mind ever remembers itself ever understands itself ever loves itself which some take to mean that the soul ever actually understands and loves itself But he excludes this interpretation by adding that it does not always think of itself as actually distinct from other things Thus it is clear that the soul always understands and loves itself not actually but habitually though we might say that by perceiving its own act it understands itself whenever it understands anything But since it is not always actually understanding as in the case of sleep we must say that these acts although not always actually existing yet ever exist in their principles the habits and powers Wherefore Augustine says De Trin xiv four If the rational soul is made to the image of God in the sense that it can make use of reason and intellect to understand and consider God then the image of God was in the soul from the beginning of its existence EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q ninety three Art eight Whether the Image of the Divine Trinity Is in the Soul Only by Comparison with God As Its Object Objection one It would seem that the image of the Divine Trinity is in the soul not only by comparison with God as its object For the image of the Divine Trinity is to be found in the soul as shown above A seven according as the word in us proceeds from the speaker and love from both But this is to be found in us as regards any object Therefore the image of the Divine Trinity is in our mind as regards any object Obj two Further Augustine says De Trin xii four that when we seek trinity in the soul we seek it in the whole of the soul without separating the process of reasoning in temporal matters from the consideration of things eternal Therefore the image of the Trinity is to be found in the soul even as regards temporal objects Obj three Further it is by grace that we can know and love God If therefore the image of the Trinity is found in the soul by reason of the memory understanding and will or love of God this image is not in man by nature but by grace and thus is not common to all Obj four Further the saints in heaven are most perfectly conformed to the image of God by the beatific vision wherefore it is written two Cor three eighteen We are transformed into the same image from glory to glory But temporal things are known by the beatific vision Therefore the image of God exists in us even according to temporal things On the contrary Augustine says De Trin xiv twelve The image of God exists in the mind not because it has a remembrance of itself loves itself and understands itself but because it can also remember understand and love God by Whom it was made Much less therefore is the image of God in the soul in respect of other objects I answer that As above explained AA two seven image means a likeness which in some degree however small attains to a representation of the species Wherefore we need to seek in the image of the Divine Trinity in the soul some kind of representation of species of the Divine Persons so far as this is possible to a creature Now the Divine Persons as above stated AA six seven are distinguished from each other according to the procession of the word from the speaker and the procession of love from both Moreover the Word of God is born of God by the knowledge of Himself and Love proceeds from God according as He loves Himself But it is clear that diversity of objects diversifies the species of word and love for in the human mind the species of a stone is specifically different from that of a horse which also the love regarding each of them is specifically different Hence we refer the Divine image in man to the verbal concept born of the knowledge of God and to the love derived therefrom Thus the image of God is found in the soul according as the soul turns to God or possesses a nature that enables it to turn to God Now the mind may turn towards an object in two ways directly and immediately or indirectly and mediately as for instance when anyone sees a man reflected in a looking glass he may be said to be turned towards that man So Augustine says De Trin xiv eight that the mind remembers itself understands itself and loves itself If we perceive this we perceive a trinity not indeed God but nevertheless rightly called the image of God But this is due to the fact not that the mind reflects on itself absolutely but that thereby it can furthermore turn to God as appears from the authority quoted above Arg On the contrary Reply Obj one For the notion of an image it is not enough that something proceed from another but it is also necessary to observe what proceeds and whence it proceeds namely that what is Word of God proceeds from knowledge of God Reply Obj two In all the soul we may see a kind of trinity not however as though besides the action of temporal things and the contemplation of eternal things any third thing should be required to make up the trinity as he adds in the same passage But in that part of the reason which is concerned with temporal things although a trinity may be found yet the image of God is not to be seen there as he says farther on forasmuch as this knowledge of temporal things is adventitious to the soul Moreover even the habits whereby temporal things are known are not always present but sometimes they are actually present and sometimes present only in memory even after they begin to exist in the soul Such is clearly the case with faith which comes to us temporally for this present life while in the future life faith will no longer exist but only the remembrance of faith Reply Obj three The meritorious knowledge and love of God can be in us only by grace Yet there is a certain natural knowledge and love as seen above Q twelve A twelve Q fifty six A three Q sixty A five This too is natural that the mind in order to understand God can make use of reason in which sense we have already said that the image of God abides ever in the soul whether this image of God be so obsolete as it were clouded as almost to amount to nothing as in those who have not the use of reason or obscured and disfigured as in sinners or clear and beautiful as in the just as Augustine says De Trin xiv six Reply Obj four By the vision of glory temporal things will be seen in God Himself and such a vision of things temporal will belong to the image of God This is what Augustine means De Trin xiv six when he says that in that nature to which the mind will blissfully adhere whatever it sees it will see as unchangeable for in the Uncreated Word are the types of all creatures NINTH ARTICLE I Q ninety three Art nine Whether Likeness Is Properly Distinguished from Image Objection one It would seem that likeness is not properly distinguished from image For genus is not properly distinguished from species Now likeness is to image as genus to species because where there is image forthwith there is likeness but not conversely as Augustine says QQ eighty three qu seventy four Therefore likeness is not properly to be distinguished from image Obj two Further the nature of the image consists not only in the representation of the Divine Persons but also in the representation of the Divine Essence to which representation belong immortality and indivisibility So it is not true to say that the likeness is in the essence because it is immortal and indivisible whereas the image is in other things Sent ii D xvi Obj three Further the image of God in man is threefold the image of nature of grace and of glory as above explained A four But innocence and righteousness belong to grace Therefore it is incorrectly said Sent ii D xvi that the image is taken from the memory the understanding and the will while the likeness is from innocence and righteousness Obj four Further knowledge of truth belongs to the intellect and love of virtue to the will which two things are parts of the image Therefore it is incorrect to say Sent ii D xvi that the image consists in the knowledge of truth and the likeness in the love of virtue On the contrary Augustine says QQ eighty three qu fifty one Some consider that these two were mentioned not without reason namely image and likeness since if they meant the same one would have sufficed I answer that Likeness is a kind of unity for oneness in quality causes likeness as the Philosopher says Metaph v Did iv fifteen Now since one is a transcendental it is both common to all and adapted to each single thing just as the good and the true Wherefore as the good can be compared to each individual thing both as its preamble and as subsequent to it as signifying some perfection in it so also in the same way there exists a kind of comparison between likeness and image For the good is a preamble to man inasmuch as man is an individual good and again the good is subsequent to man inasmuch as we may say of a certain man that he is good by reason of his perfect virtue In like manner likeness may be considered in the light of a preamble to image inasmuch as it is something more general than image as we have said above A one and again it may be considered as subsequent to image inasmuch as it signifies a certain perfection of image For we say that an image is like or unlike what it represents according as the representation is perfect or imperfect Thus likeness may be distinguished from image in two ways first as its preamble and existing in more things and in this sense likeness regards things which are more common than the intellectual properties wherein the image is properly to be seen In this sense it is stated QQ eighty three qu fifty one that the spirit namely the mind without doubt was made to the image of God But the other parts of man belonging to the soul s inferior faculties or even to the body are in the opinion of some made to God s likeness In this sense he says De Quant Animae ii that the likeness of God is found in the soul s incorruptibility for corruptible and incorruptible are differences of universal beings But likeness may be considered in another way as signifying the expression and perfection of the image In this sense Damascene says De Fide Orth ii twelve that the image implies an intelligent being endowed with free will and self movement whereas likeness implies a likeness of power as far as this may be possible in man In the same sense likeness is said to belong to the love of virtue for there is no virtue without love of virtue Reply Obj one Likeness is not distinct from image in the general notion of likeness for thus it is included in image but so far as any likeness falls short of image or again as it perfects the idea of image Reply Obj two The soul s essence belongs to the image as representing the Divine Essence in those things which belong to the intellectual nature but not in those conditions subsequent to general notions of being such as simplicity and indissolubility Reply Obj three Even certain virtues are natural to the soul at least in their seeds by reason of which we may say that a natural likeness exists in the soul Nor it is unfitting to us the term image from one point of view and from another the term likeness Reply Obj four Love of the word which is knowledge loved belongs to the nature of image but love of virtue belongs to likeness as virtue itself belongs to likeness QUESTION ninety four OF THE STATE AND CONDITION OF THE FIRST MAN AS REGARDS HIS INTELLECT In Four Articles We next consider the state or condition of the first man first as regards his soul secondly as regards his body Concerning the first there are two things to be considered one The condition of man as to his intellect two the condition of man as to his will Under the first head there are four points of inquiry one Whether the first man saw the Essence of God two Whether he could see the separate substances that is the angels three Whether he possessed all knowledge four Whether he could err or be deceived FIRST ARTICLE I Q ninety four Art one Whether the First Man Saw God Through His Essence Objection one It would seem that the first man saw God through His Essence For man s happiness consists in the vision of the Divine Essence But the first man while established in paradise led a life of happiness in the enjoyment of all things as Damascene says De Fide Orth ii eleven And Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv ten If man was gifted with the same tastes as now how happy must he have been in paradise that place of ineffable happiness Therefore the first man in paradise saw God through His Essence Obj two Further Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv loc cit that the first man lacked nothing which his good will might obtain But our good will can obtain nothing better than the vision of the Divine Essence Therefore man saw God through His Essence Obj three Further the vision of God in His Essence is whereby God is seen without a medium or enigma But man in the state of innocence saw God immediately as the Master of the Sentences asserts Sent iv D i He also saw without an enigma for an enigma implies obscurity as Augustine says De Trin xv nine Now obscurity resulted from sin Therefore man in the primitive state saw God through His Essence On the contrary The Apostle says one Cor fifteen forty six That was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural But to see God through His Essence is most spiritual Therefore the first man in the primitive state of his natural life did not see God through His Essence I answer that The first man did not see God through His Essence if we consider the ordinary state of that life unless perhaps it be said that he saw God in a vision when God cast a deep sleep upon Adam general two twenty one The reason is because since in the Divine Essence is beatitude itself the intellect of a man who sees the Divine Essence has the same relation to God as a man has to beatitude Now it is clear that man cannot willingly be turned away from beatitude since naturally and necessarily he desires it and shuns unhappiness Wherefore no one who sees the Essence of God can willingly turn away from God which means to sin Hence all who see God through His Essence are so firmly established in the love of God that for eternity they can never sin Therefore as Adam did sin it is clear that he did not see God through His Essence Nevertheless he knew God with a more perfect knowledge than we do now Thus in a sense his knowledge was midway between our knowledge in the present state and the knowledge we shall have in heaven when we see God through His Essence To make this clear we must consider that the vision of God through His Essence is contradistinguished from the vision of God through His creatures Now the higher the creature is and the more like it is to God the more clearly is God seen in it for instance a man is seen more clearly through a mirror in which his image is the more clearly expressed Thus God is seen in a much more perfect manner through His intelligible effects than through those which are only sensible or corporeal But in his present state man is impeded as regards the full and clear consideration of intelligible creatures because he is distracted by and occupied with sensible things Now it is written Eccles seven thirty God made man right And man was made right by God in this sense that in him the lower powers were subjected to the higher and the higher nature was made so as not to be impeded by the lower Wherefore the first man was not impeded by exterior things from a clear and steady contemplation of the intelligible effects which he perceived by the radiation of the first truth whether by a natural or by a gratuitous knowledge Hence Augustine says general ad lit xi thirty three that perhaps God used to speak to the first man as He speaks to the angels by shedding on his mind a ray of the unchangeable truth yet without bestowing on him the experience of which the angels are capable in the participation of the Divine Essence Therefore through these intelligible effects of God man knew God then more clearly than we know Him now Reply Obj one Man was happy in paradise but not with that perfect happiness to which he was destined which consists in the vision of the Divine Essence He was however endowed with a life of happiness in a certain measure as Augustine says general ad lit xi eighteen so far as he was gifted with natural integrity and perfection Reply Obj two A good will is a well ordered will but the will of the first man would have been ill ordered had he wished to have while in the state of merit what had been promised to him as a reward Reply Obj three A medium of knowledge is twofold one through which and at the same time in which something is seen as for example a man is seen through a mirror and is seen with the mirror another kind of medium is that whereby we attain to the knowledge of something unknown such as the medium in a demonstration God was seen without this second kind of medium but not without the first kind For there was no need for the first man to attain to the knowledge of God by demonstration drawn from an effect such as we need since he knew God simultaneously in His effects especially in the intelligible effects according to His capacity Again we must remark that the obscurity which is implied in the word enigma may be of two kinds first so far as every creature is something obscure when compared with the immensity of the Divine light and thus Adam saw God in an enigma because he saw Him in a created effect secondly we may take obscurity as an effect of sin so far as man is impeded in the consideration of intelligible things by being preoccupied with sensible things in which sense Adam did not see God in an enigma SECOND ARTICLE I Q ninety four Art two Whether Adam in the State of Innocence Saw the Angels Through Their Essence Objection one It would seem that Adam in the state of innocence saw the angels through their essence For Gregory says Dialog iv one In paradise man was accustomed to enjoy the words of God and by purity of heart and loftiness of vision to have the company of the good angels Obj two Further the soul in the present state is impeded from the knowledge of separate substances by union with a corruptible body which is a load upon the soul as is written Wis nine fifteen Wherefore the separate soul can see separate substances as above explained Q eighty nine A two But the body of the first man was not a load upon his soul for the latter was not corruptible Therefore he was able to see separate substances Obj three Further one separate substance knows another separate substance by knowing itself De Causis xiii But the soul of the first man knew itself Therefore it knew separate substances On the contrary The soul of Adam was of the same nature as ours But our souls cannot now understand separate substances Therefore neither could Adam s soul I answer that The state of the human soul may be distinguished in two ways First from a diversity of mode in its natural existence and in this point the state of the separate soul is distinguished from the state of the soul joined to the body Secondly the state of the soul is distinguished in relation to integrity and corruption the state of natural existence remaining the same and thus the state of innocence is distinct from the state of man after sin For man s soul in the state of innocence was adapted to perfect and govern the body wherefore the first man is said to have been made into a living soul that is a soul giving life to the body namely animal life But he was endowed with integrity as to this life in that the body was entirely subject to the soul hindering it in no way as we have said above A one Now it is clear from what has been already said Q eighty four A seven Q eighty five A one Q eighty nine A one that since the soul is adapted to perfect and govern the body as regards animal life it is fitting that it should have that mode of understanding which is by turning to phantasms Wherefore this mode of understanding was becoming to the soul of the first man also Now in virtue of this mode of understanding there are three degrees of movement in the soul as Dionysius says Div Nom iv The first is by the soul passing from exterior things to concentrate its powers on itself the second is by the soul ascending so as to be associated with the united superior powers namely the angels the third is when the soul is led on yet further to the supreme good that is to God In virtue of the first movement of the soul from exterior things to itself the soul s knowledge is perfected This is because the intellectual operation of the soul has a natural order to external things as we have said above Q eighty seven A three and so by the knowledge thereof our intellectual operation can be known perfectly as an act through its object And through the intellectual operation itself the human intellect can be known perfectly as a power through its proper act But in the second movement we do not find perfect knowledge Because since the angel does not understand by turning to phantasms but by a far more excellent process as we have said above Q fifty five A two the above mentioned mode of knowledge by which the soul knows itself is not sufficient to lead it to the knowledge of an angel Much less does the third movement lead to perfect knowledge for even the angels themselves by the fact that they know themselves are not able to arrive at the knowledge of the Divine Substance by reason of its surpassing excellence Therefore the soul of the first man could not see the angels in their essence Nevertheless he had a more excellent mode of knowledge regarding the angels than we possess because his knowledge of intelligible things within him was more certain and fixed than our knowledge And it was on account of this excellence of knowledge that Gregory says that he enjoyed the company of the angelic spirits This makes clear the reply to the first objection Reply Obj two That the soul of the first man fell short of the knowledge regarding separate substances was not owing to the fact that the body was a load upon it but to the fact that its connatural object fell short of the excellence of separate substances We in our present state fall short on account of both these reasons Reply Obj three The soul of the first man was not able to arrive at knowledge of separate substances by means of its self knowledge as we have shown above for even each separate substance knows others in its own measure THIRD ARTICLE I Q ninety four Art three Whether the First Man Knew All Things Objection one It would seem that the first man did not know all things For if he had such knowledge it would be either by acquired species or by connatural species or by infused species Not however by acquired species for this kind of knowledge is acquired by experience as stated in Metaph i one and the first man had not then gained experience of all things Nor through connatural species because he was of the same nature as we are and our soul as Aristotle says De Anima iii four is like a clean tablet on which nothing is written And if his knowledge came by infused species it would have been of a different kind from ours which we acquire from things themselves Obj two Further individuals of the same species have the same way of arriving at perfection Now other men have not from the beginning knowledge of all things but they acquire it in the course of time according to their capacity Therefore neither did Adam know all things when he was first created Obj three Further the present state of life is given to man in order that his soul may advance in knowledge and merit indeed the soul seems to be united to the body for that purpose Now man would have advanced in merit in that state of life therefore also in knowledge Therefore he was not endowed with knowledge of all things On the contrary Man named the animals general two twenty But names should be adapted to the nature of things Therefore Adam knew the animals natures and in like manner he was possessed of the knowledge of all other things I answer that In the natural order perfection comes before imperfection as act precedes potentiality for whatever is in potentiality is made actual only by something actual And since God created things not only for their own existence but also that they might be the principles of other things so creatures were produced in their perfect state to be the principles as regards others Now man can be the principle of another man not only by generation of the body but also by instruction and government Hence as the first man was produced in his perfect state as regards his body for the work of generation so also was his soul established in a perfect state to instruct and govern others Now no one can instruct others unless he has knowledge and so the first man was established by God in such a manner as to have knowledge of all those things for which man has a natural aptitude And such are whatever are virtually contained in the first self evident principles that is whatever truths man is naturally able to know Moreover in order to direct his own life and that of others man needs to know not only those things which can be naturally known but also things surpassing natural knowledge because the life of man is directed to a supernatural end just as it is necessary for us to know the truths of faith in order to direct our own lives Wherefore the first man was endowed with such a knowledge of these supernatural truths as was necessary for the direction of human life in that state But those things which cannot be known by merely human effort and which are not necessary for the direction of human life were not known by the first man such as the thoughts of men future contingent events and some individual facts as for instance the number of pebbles in a stream and the like Reply Obj one The first man had knowledge of all things by divinely infused species Yet his knowledge was not different from ours as the eyes which Christ gave to the man born blind were not different from those given by nature Reply Obj two To Adam as being the first man was due a degree of perfection which was not due to other men as is clear from what is above explained Reply Obj three Adam would have advanced in natural knowledge not in the number of things known but in the manner of knowing because what he knew speculatively he would subsequently have known by experience But as regards supernatural knowledge he would also have advanced as regards the number of things known by further revelation as the angels advance by further enlightenment Moreover there is no comparison between advance in knowledge and advance in merit since one man cannot be a principle of merit to another although he can be to another a principle of knowledge FOURTH ARTICLE I Q ninety four Art four Whether Man in His First State Could Be Deceived Objection one It would seem that man in his primitive state could have been deceived For the Apostle says one Tim two fourteen that the woman being seduced was in the transgression Obj two Further the Master says Sent ii D xxi that the woman was not frightened at the serpent speaking because she thought that he had received the faculty of speech from God But this was untrue Therefore before sin the woman was deceived Obj three Further it is natural that the farther off anything is from us the smaller it seems to be Now the nature of the eyes is not changed by sin Therefore this would have been the case in the state of innocence Wherefore man would have been deceived in the size of what he saw just as he is deceived now Obj four Further Augustine says general ad lit xii two that in sleep the soul adheres to the images of things as if they were the things themselves But in the state of innocence man would have eaten and consequently have slept and dreamed Therefore he would have been deceived adhering to images as to realities Obj five Further the first man would have been ignorant of other men s thoughts and of future contingent events as stated above A three So if anyone had told him what was false about these things he would have been deceived On the contrary Augustine says De Lib Arb iii eighteen To regard what is true as false is not natural to man as created but is a punishment of man condemned I answer that in the opinion of some deception may mean two things namely any slight surmise in which one adheres to what is false as though it were true but without the assent of belief or it may mean a firm belief Thus before sin Adam could not be deceived in either of these ways as regards those things to which his knowledge extended but as regards things to which his knowledge did not extend he might have been deceived if we take deception in the wide sense of the term for any surmise without assent of belief This opinion was held with the idea that it is not derogatory to man to entertain a false opinion in such matters and that provided he does not assent rashly he is not to be blamed Such an opinion however is not fitting as regards the integrity of the primitive state of life because as Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv ten in that state of life sin was avoided without struggle and while it remained so no evil could exist Now it is clear that as truth is the good of the intellect so falsehood is its evil as the Philosopher says Ethic vi two So that as long as the state of innocence continued it was impossible for the human intellect to assent to falsehood as if it were truth For as some perfections such as clarity were lacking in the bodily members of the first man though no evil could be therein so there could be in his intellect the absence of some knowledge but no false opinion This is clear also from the very rectitude of the primitive state by virtue of which while the soul remained subject to God the lower faculties in man were subject to the higher and were no impediment to their action And from what has preceded Q eighty five A six it is clear that as regards its proper object the intellect is ever true and hence it is never deceived of itself but whatever deception occurs must be ascribed to some lower faculty such as the imagination or the like Hence we see that when the natural power of judgment is free we are not deceived by such images but only when it is not free as is the case in sleep Therefore it is clear that the rectitude of the primitive state was incompatible with deception of the intellect Reply Obj one Though the woman was deceived before she sinned in deed still it was not till she had already sinned by interior pride For Augustine says general ad lit xi thirty that the woman could not have believed the words of the serpent had she not already acquiesced in the love of her own power and in a presumption of self conceit Reply Obj two The woman thought that the serpent had received this faculty not as acting in accordance with nature but by virtue of some supernatural operation We need not however follow the Master of the Sentences in this point Reply Obj three Were anything presented to the imagination or sense of the first man not in accordance with the nature of things he would not have been deceived for his reason would have enabled him to judge the truth Reply Obj four A man is not accountable for what occurs during sleep as he has not then the use of his reason wherein consists man s proper action Reply Obj five If anyone had said something untrue as regards future contingencies or as regards secret thoughts man in the primitive state would not have believed it was so but he might have believed that such a thing was possible which would not have been to entertain a false opinion It might also be said that he would have been divinely guided from above so as not to be deceived in a matter to which his knowledge did not extend If any object as some do that he was not guided when tempted though he was then most in need of guidance we reply that man had already sinned in his heart and that he failed to have recourse to the Divine aid QUESTION ninety five OF THINGS PERTAINING TO THE FIRST MAN S WILL NAMELY GRACE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS In Four Articles We next consider what belongs to the will of the first man concerning which there are two points of treatment one the grace and righteousness of the first man two the use of righteousness as regards his dominion over other things Under the first head there are four points of inquiry one Whether the first man was created in grace two Whether in the state of innocence he had passions of the soul three Whether he had all virtues four Whether what he did would have been as meritorious as now FIRST ARTICLE I Q ninety five Art one Whether the First Man Was Created in Grace Objection one It would seem that the first man was not created in grace For the Apostle distinguishing between Adam and Christ says one Cor fifteen forty five The first Adam was made into a living soul the last Adam into a quickening spirit But the spirit is quickened by grace Therefore Christ alone was made in grace Obj two Further Augustine says QQ Vet et Nov Test qu one hundred twenty three Work of an anonymous author among the supposititious works of saint Augustine that Adam did not possess the Holy Ghost But whoever possesses grace has the Holy Ghost Therefore Adam was not created in grace Obj three Further Augustine says De Correp et Grat x that God so ordered the life of the angels and men as to show first what they could do by free will then what they could do by His grace and by the discernment of righteousness God thus first created men and angels in the state of natural free will only and afterwards bestowed grace on them Obj four Further the Master says Sent ii D xxiv When man was created he was given sufficient help to stand but not sufficient to advance But whoever has grace can advance by merit Therefore the first man was not created in grace Obj five Further the reception of grace requires the consent of the recipient since thereby a kind of spiritual marriage takes place between God and the soul But consent presupposes existence Therefore man did not receive grace in the first moment of his creation Obj six Further nature is more distant from grace than grace is from glory which is but grace consummated But in man grace precedes glory Therefore much more did nature precede grace On the contrary Man and angel are both ordained to grace But the angels were created in grace for Augustine says De Civ Dei xii nine God at the same time fashioned their nature and endowed them with grace Therefore man also was created in grace I answer that Some say that man was not created in grace but that it was bestowed on him subsequently before sin and many authorities of the Saints declare that man possessed grace in the state of innocence But the very rectitude of the primitive state wherewith man was endowed by God seems to require that as others say he was created in grace according to Eccles seven thirty God made man right For this rectitude consisted in his reason being subject to God the lower powers to reason and the body to the soul and the first subjection was the cause of both the second and the third since while reason was subject to God the lower powers remained subject to reason as Augustine says Cf De Civ Dei xiii thirteen De Pecc Merit et Remiss i sixteen Now it is clear that such a subjection of the body to the soul and of the lower powers to reason was not from nature otherwise it would have remained after sin since even in the demons the natural gifts remained after sin as Dionysius declared Div Nom iv Hence it is clear that also the primitive subjection by virtue of which reason was subject to God was not a merely natural gift but a supernatural endowment of grace for it is not possible that the effect should be of greater efficiency than the cause Hence Augustine says De Civ Dei xiii thirteen that as soon as they disobeyed the Divine command and forfeited Divine grace they were ashamed of their nakedness for they felt the impulse of disobedience in the flesh as though it were a punishment corresponding to their own disobedience Hence if the loss of grace dissolved the obedience of the flesh to the soul we may gather that the inferior powers were subjected to the soul through grace existing therein Reply Obj one The Apostle in these words means to show that there is a spiritual body if there is an animal body inasmuch as the spiritual life of the body began in Christ who is the firstborn of the dead as the body s animal life began in Adam From the Apostle s words therefore we cannot gather that Adam had no spiritual life in his soul but that he had not spiritual life as regards the body Reply Obj two As Augustine says in the same passage it is not disputed that Adam like other just souls was in some degree gifted with the Holy Ghost but he did not possess the Holy Ghost as the faithful possess Him now who are admitted to eternal happiness directly after death Reply Obj three This passage from Augustine does not assert that angels or men were created with natural free will before they possessed grace but that God shows first what their free will could do before being confirmed in grace and what they acquired afterwards by being so confirmed Reply Obj four The Master here speaks according to the opinion of those who held that man was not created in grace but only in a state of nature We may also say that though man was created in grace yet it was not by virtue of the nature wherein he was created that he could advance by merit but by virtue of the grace which was added Reply Obj five As the motion of the will is not continuous there is nothing against the first man having consented to grace even in the first moment of his existence Reply Obj six We merit glory by an act of grace but we do not merit grace by an act of nature hence the comparison fails SECOND ARTICLE I Q ninety five Art two Whether Passions Existed in the Soul of the First Man Objection one It would seem that the first man s soul had no passions For by the passions of the soul the flesh lusteth against the spirit Gal five seven But this did not happen in the state of innocence Therefore in the state of innocence there were no passions of the soul Obj two Further Adam s soul was nobler than his body But his body was impassible Therefore no passions were in his soul Obj three Further the passions of the soul are restrained by the moral virtues But in Adam the moral virtues were perfect Therefore the passions were entirely excluded from him On the contrary Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv ten that in our first parents there was undisturbed love of God and other passions of the soul I answer that The passions of the soul are in the sensual appetite the object of which is good and evil Wherefore some passions of the soul are directed to what is good as love and joy others to what is evil as fear and sorrow And since in the primitive state evil was neither present nor imminent nor was any good wanting which a good will could desire to have then as Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv ten therefore Adam had no passion with evil as its object such as fear sorrow and the like neither had he passions in respect of good not possessed but to be possessed then as burning concupiscence But those passions which regard present good as joy and love or which regard future good to be had at the proper time as desire and hope that casteth not down existed in the state of innocence otherwise however than as they exist in ourselves For our sensual appetite wherein the passions reside is not entirely subject to reason hence at times our passions forestall and hinder reason s judgment at other times they follow reason s judgment accordingly as the sensual appetite obeys reason to some extent But in the state of innocence the inferior appetite was wholly subject to reason so that in that state the passions of the soul existed only as consequent upon the judgment of reason Reply Obj one The flesh lusts against the spirit by the rebellion of the passions against reason which could not occur in the state of innocence Reply Obj two The human body was impassible in the state of innocence as regards the passions which alter the disposition of nature as will be explained later on Q ninety seven A two likewise the soul was impassible as regards the passions which impede the free use of reason Reply Obj three Perfection of moral virtue does not wholly take away the passions but regulates them for the temperate man desires as he ought to desire and what he ought to desire as stated in Ethic iii eleven THIRD ARTICLE I Q ninety five Art three Whether Adam Had All the Virtues Objection one It would seem that Adam had not all the virtues For some virtues are directed to curb passions thus immoderate concupiscence is restrained by temperance and immoderate fear by fortitude But in the state of innocence no immoderation existed in the passions Therefore neither did these virtues then exist Obj two Further some virtues are concerned with the passions which have evil as their object as meekness with anger fortitude with fear But these passions did not exist in the state of innocence as stated above A two Therefore neither did those virtues exist then Obj three Further penance is a virtue that regards sin committed Mercy too is a virtue concerned with unhappiness But in the state of innocence neither sin nor unhappiness existed Therefore neither did those virtues exist Obj four Further perseverance is a virtue But Adam possessed it not as proved by his subsequent sin Therefore he possessed not every virtue Obj five Further faith is a virtue But it did not exist in the state of innocence for it implies an obscurity of knowledge which seems to be incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state On the contrary Augustine says in a homily Serm contra Judaeos The prince of sin overcame Adam who was made from the slime of the earth to the image of God adorned with modesty restrained by temperance refulgent with brightness I answer that in the state of innocence man in a certain sense possessed all the virtues and this can be proved from what precedes For it was shown above A one that such was the rectitude of the primitive state that reason was subject to God and the lower powers to reason Now the virtues are nothing but those perfections whereby reason is directed to God and the inferior powers regulated according to the dictate of reason as will be explained in the Treatise on the Virtues I II Q sixty three A two Wherefore the rectitude of the primitive state required that man should in a sense possess every virtue It must however be noted that some virtues of their very nature do not involve imperfection such as charity and justice and these virtues did exist in the primitive state absolutely both in habit and in act But other virtues are of such a nature as to imply imperfection either in their act or on the part of the matter If such imperfection be consistent with the perfection of the primitive state such virtues necessarily existed in that state as faith which is of things not seen and hope which is of things not yet possessed For the perfection of that state did not extend to the vision of the Divine Essence and the possession of God with the enjoyment of final beatitude Hence faith and hope could exist in the primitive state both as to habit and as to act But any virtue which implies imperfection incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state could exist in that state as a habit but not as to the act for instance penance which is sorrow for sin committed and mercy which is sorrow for others unhappiness because sorrow guilt and unhappiness are incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state Wherefore such virtues existed as habits in the first man but not as to their acts for he was so disposed that he would repent if there had been a sin to repent for and had he seen unhappiness in his neighbor he would have done his best to remedy it This is in accordance with what the Philosopher says Shame which regards what is ill done may be found in a virtuous man but only conditionally as being so disposed that he would be ashamed if he did wrong Ethic iv nine Reply Obj one It is accidental to temperance and fortitude to subdue superabundant passion in so far as they are in a subject which happens to have superabundant passions and yet those virtues are per se competent to moderate the passions Reply Obj two Passions which have evil for their object were incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state if that evil be in the one affected by the passion such as fear and sorrow But passions which relate to evil in another are not incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state for in that state man could hate the demons malice as he could love God s goodness Thus the virtues which relate to such passions could exist in the primitive state in habit and in act Virtues however relating to passions which regard evil in the same subject if relating to such passions only could not exist in the primitive state in act but only in habit as we have said above of penance and of mercy But other virtues there are which have relation not to such passions only but to others such as temperance which relates not only to sorrow but also to joy and fortitude which relates not only to fear but also to daring and hope Thus the act of temperance could exist in the primitive state so far as it moderates pleasure and in like manner fortitude as moderating daring and hope but not as moderating sorrow and fear Reply Obj three appears from what has been said above Reply Obj four Perseverance may be taken in two ways in one sense as a particular virtue signifying a habit whereby a man makes a choice of persevering in good in that sense Adam possessed perseverance In another sense it is taken as a circumstance of virtue signifying a certain uninterrupted continuation of virtue in which sense Adam did not possess perseverance Reply Obj five appears from what has been said above FOURTH ARTICLE I Q ninety five Art four Whether the Actions of the First Man Were Less Meritorious Than Ours Are Objection one It would seem that the actions of the first man were less meritorious than ours are For grace is given to us through the mercy of God Who succors most those who are most in need Now we are more in need of grace than was man in the state of innocence Therefore grace is more copiously poured out upon us and since grace is the source of merit our actions are more meritorious Obj two Further struggle and difficulty are required for merit for it is written two Tim two five He is not crowned except he strive lawfully and the Philosopher says Ethic ii three The object of virtue is the difficult and the good But there is more strife and difficulty now Therefore there is greater efficacy for merit Obj three Further the Master says Sent ii D xxiv that man would not have merited in resisting temptation whereas he does merit now when he resists Therefore our actions are more meritorious than in the primitive state On the contrary if such were the case man would be better off after sinning I answer that Merit as regards degree may be gauged in two ways First in its root which is grace and charity Merit thus measured corresponds in degree to the essential reward which consists in the enjoyment of God for the greater the charity whence our actions proceed the more perfectly shall we enjoy God Secondly the degree of merit is measured by the degree of the action itself This degree is of two kinds absolute and proportional The widow who put two mites into the treasury performed a deed of absolutely less degree than the others who put great sums therein But in proportionate degree the widow gave more as Our Lord said because she gave more in proportion to her means In each of these cases the degree of merit corresponds to the accidental reward which consists in rejoicing for created good We conclude therefore that in the state of innocence man s works were more meritorious than after sin was committed if we consider the degree of merit on the part of grace which would have been more copious as meeting with no obstacle in human nature and in like manner if we consider the absolute degree of the work done because as man would have had greater virtue he would have performed greater works But if we consider the proportionate degree a greater reason for merit exists after sin on account of man s weakness because a small deed is more beyond the capacity of one who works with difficulty than a great deed is beyond one who performs it easily Reply Obj one After sin man requires grace for more things than before sin but he does not need grace more forasmuch as man even before sin required grace to obtain eternal life which is the chief reason for the need of grace But after sin man required grace also for the remission of sin and for the support of his weakness Reply Obj two Difficulty and struggle belong to the degree of merit according to the proportionate degree of the work done as above explained It is also a sign of the will s promptitude striving after what is difficult to itself and the promptitude of the will is caused by the intensity of charity Yet it may happen that a person performs an easy deed with as prompt a will as another performs an arduous deed because he is ready to do even what may be difficult to him But the actual difficulty by its penal character enables the deed to satisfy for sin Reply Obj three The first man would not have gained merit in resisting temptation according to the opinion of those who say that he did not possess grace even as now there is no merit to those who have not grace But in this point there is a difference inasmuch as in the primitive state there was no interior impulse to evil as in our present state Hence man was more able then than now to resist temptation even without grace QUESTION ninety six OF THE MASTERSHIP BELONGING TO MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE In Four Articles We next consider the mastership which belonged to man in the state of innocence Under this head there are four points of inquiry one Whether man in the state of innocence was master over the animals two Whether he was master over all creatures three Whether in the state of innocence all men were equal four Whether in that state man would have been master over men FIRST ARTICLE I Q ninety six Art one Whether Adam in the State of Innocence Had Mastership Over the Animals Objection one It would seem that in the state of innocence Adam had no mastership over the animals For Augustine says general ad lit ix fourteen that the animals were brought to Adam under the direction of the angels to receive their names from him But the angels need not have intervened thus if man himself were master over the animals Therefore in the state of innocence man had no mastership of the animals Obj two Further it is unfitting that elements hostile to one another should be brought under the mastership of one But many animals are hostile to one another as the sheep and the wolf Therefore all animals were not brought under the mastership of man Obj three Further Jerome says The words quoted are not in saint Jerome s works saint Thomas may have had in mind Bede Hexaem as quoted in the Glossa ordinaria on general one twenty six God gave man mastership over the animals although before sin he had no need of them for God foresaw that after sin animals would become useful to man Therefore at least before sin it was unfitting for man to make use of his mastership Obj four Further it is proper to a master to command But a command is not given rightly save to a rational being Therefore man had no mastership over the irrational animals On the contrary It is written general one twenty six Let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea and the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth Vulg and the whole earth I answer that As above stated Q ninety five A one for his disobedience to God man was punished by the disobedience of those creatures which should be subject to him Therefore in the state of innocence before man had disobeyed nothing disobeyed him that was naturally subject to him Now all animals are naturally subject to man This can be proved in three ways First from the order observed by nature for just as in the generation of things we perceive a certain order of procession of the perfect from the imperfect thus matter is for the sake of form and the imperfect form for the sake of the perfect so also is there order in the use of natural things thus the imperfect are for the use of the perfect as the plants make use of the earth for their nourishment and animals make use of plants and man makes use of both plants and animals Therefore it is in keeping with the order of nature that man should be master over animals Hence the Philosopher says Polit i five that the hunting of wild animals is just and natural because man thereby exercises a natural right Secondly this is proved by the order of Divine Providence which always governs inferior things by the superior Wherefore as man being made to the image of God is above other animals these are rightly subject to his government Thirdly this is proved from a property of man and of other animals For we see in the latter a certain participated prudence of natural instinct in regard to certain particular acts whereas man possesses a universal prudence as regards all practical matters Now whatever is participated is subject to what is essential and universal Therefore the subjection of other animals to man is proved to be natural Reply Obj one A higher power can do many things that an inferior power cannot do to those which are subject to them Now an angel is naturally higher than man Therefore certain things in regard to animals could be done by angels which could not be done by man for instance the rapid gathering together of all the animals Reply Obj two In the opinion of some those animals which now are fierce and kill others would in that state have been tame not only in regard to man but also in regard to other animals But this is quite unreasonable For the nature of animals was not changed by man s sin as if those whose nature now it is to devour the flesh of others would then have lived on herbs as the lion and falcon Nor does Bede s gloss on general one thirty say that trees and herbs were given as food to all animals and birds but to some Thus there would have been a natural antipathy between some animals They would not however on this account have been excepted from the mastership of man as neither at present are they for that reason excepted from the mastership of God Whose Providence has ordained all this Of this Providence man would have been the executor as appears even now in regard to domestic animals since fowls are given by men as food to the trained falcon Reply Obj three In the state of innocence man would not have had any bodily need of animals neither for clothing since then they were naked and not ashamed there being no inordinate motions of concupiscence nor for food since they fed on the trees of paradise nor to carry him about his body being strong enough for that purpose But man needed animals in order to have experimental knowledge of their natures This is signified by the fact that God led the animals to man that he might give them names expressive of their respective natures Reply Obj four All animals by their natural instinct have a certain participation of prudence and reason which accounts for the fact that cranes follow their leader and bees obey their queen So all animals would have obeyed man of their own accord as in the present state some domestic animals obey him SECOND ARTICLE I Q ninety six Art two Whether Man Had Mastership Over All Other Creatures Objection one It would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have had mastership over all other creatures For an angel naturally has a greater power than man But as Augustine says De Trin iii eight corporeal matter would not have obeyed even the holy angels Much less therefore would it have obeyed man in the state of innocence Obj two Further the only powers of the soul existing in plants are nutritive augmentative and generative Now these do not naturally obey reason as we can see in the case of any one man Therefore since it is by his reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems that in the state of innocence man had no dominion over plants Obj three Further whosoever is master of a thing can change it But man could not have changed the course of the heavenly bodies for this belongs to God alone as Dionysius says Ep ad Polycarp vii Therefore man had no dominion over them On the contrary It is written general one twenty six That he may have dominion over every creature I answer that Man in a certain sense contains all things and so according as he is master of what is within himself in the same way he can have mastership over other things Now we may consider four things in man his reason which makes him like to the angels his sensitive powers whereby he is like the animals his natural forces which liken him to the plants and the body itself wherein he is like to inanimate things Now in man reason has the position of a master and not of a subject Wherefore man had no mastership over the angels in the primitive state so when we read all creatures we must understand the creatures which are not made to God s image Over the sensitive powers as the irascible and concupiscible which obey reason in some degree the soul has mastership by commanding So in the state of innocence man had mastership over the animals by commanding them But of the natural powers and the body itself man is master not by commanding but by using them Thus also in the state of innocence man s mastership over plants and inanimate things consisted not in commanding or in changing them but in making use of them without hindrance The answers to the objections appear from the above THIRD ARTICLE I Q ninety six Art three Whether Men Were Equal in the State of Innocence Objection one It would seem that in the state of innocence all would have been equal For Gregory says Moral xxi Where there is no sin there is no inequality But in the state of innocence there was no sin Therefore all were equal Obj two Further likeness and equality are the basis of mutual love according to Ecclus thirteen nineteen Every beast loveth its like so also every man him that is nearest to himself Now in that state there was among men an abundance of love which is the bond of peace Therefore all were equal in the state of innocence Obj three Further the cause ceasing the effect also ceases But the cause of present inequality among men seems to arise on the part of God from the fact that He rewards some and punishes others and on the part of nature from the fact that some through a defect of nature are born weak and deficient others strong and perfect which would not have been the case in the primitive state Therefore et cetera On the contrary It is written Rom thirteen one The things which are of God are well ordered Vulg Those that are are ordained of God But order chiefly consists in inequality for Augustine says De Civ Dei xix thirteen Order disposes things equal and unequal in their proper place Therefore in the primitive state which was most proper and orderly inequality would have existed I answer that We must needs admit that in the primitive state there would have been some inequality at least as regards sex because generation depends upon diversity of sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been born of others nor would sexual union have been sterile Moreover as regards the soul there would have been inequality as to righteousness and knowledge For man worked not of necessity but of his own free will by virtue of which man can apply himself more or less to action desire or knowledge hence some would have made a greater advance in virtue and knowledge than others There might also have been bodily disparity For the human body was not entirely exempt from the laws of nature so as not to receive from exterior sources more or less advantage and help since indeed it was dependent on food wherewith to sustain life So we may say that according to the climate or the movement of the stars some would have been born more robust in body than others and also greater and more beautiful and all ways better disposed so that however in those who were thus surpassed there would have been no defect or fault either in soul or body Reply Obj one By those words Gregory means to exclude such inequality as exists between virtue and vice the result of which is that some are placed in subjection to others as a penalty Reply Obj two Equality is the cause of equality in mutual love Yet between those who are unequal there can be a greater love than between equals although there be not an equal response for a father naturally loves his son more than a brother loves his brother although the son does not love his father as much as he is loved by him Reply Obj three The cause of inequality could be on the part of God not indeed that He would punish some and reward others but that He would exalt some above others so that the beauty of order would the more shine forth among men Inequality might also arise on the part of nature as above described without any defect of nature FOURTH ARTICLE I Q ninety six Art four Whether in the State of Innocence Man Would Have Been Master Over Man Objection one It would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have been master over man For Augustine says De Civ Dei xix fifteen God willed that man who was endowed with reason and made to His image should rule over none but irrational creatures not over men but over cattle Obj two Further what came into the world as a penalty for sin would not have existed in the state of innocence But man was made subject to man as a penalty for after sin it was said to the woman general three sixteen Thou shalt be under thy husband s power Therefore in the state of innocence man would not have been subject to man Obj three Further subjection is opposed to liberty But liberty is one of the chief blessings and would not have been lacking in the state of innocence where nothing was wanting that man s good will could desire as Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv ten Therefore man would not have been master over man in the state of innocence On the contrary The condition of man in the state of innocence was not more exalted than the condition of the angels But among the angels some rule over others and so one order is called that of Dominations Therefore it was not beneath the dignity of the state of innocence that one man should be subject to another I answer that Mastership has a twofold meaning First as opposed to slavery in which sense a master means one to whom another is subject as a slave In another sense mastership is referred in a general sense to any kind of subject and in this sense even he who has the office of governing and directing free men can be called a master In the state of innocence man could have been a master of men not in the former but in the latter sense This distinction is founded on the reason that a slave differs from a free man in that the latter has the disposal of himself as is stated in the beginning of the Metaphysics whereas a slave is ordered to another So that one man is master of another as his slave when he refers the one whose master he is to his own namely the master s use And since every man s proper good is desirable to himself and consequently it is a grievous matter to anyone to yield to another what ought to be one s own therefore such dominion implies of necessity a pain inflicted on the subject and consequently in the state of innocence such a mastership could not have existed between man and man But a man is the master of a free subject by directing him either towards his proper welfare or to the common good Such a kind of mastership would have existed in the state of innocence between man and man for two reasons First because man is naturally a social being and so in the state of innocence he would have led a social life Now a social life cannot exist among a number of people unless under the presidency of one to look after the common good for many as such seek many things whereas one attends only to one Wherefore the Philosopher says in the beginning of the Politics that wherever many things are directed to one we shall always find one at the head directing them Secondly if one man surpassed another in knowledge and virtue this would not have been fitting unless these gifts conduced to the benefit of others according to one Pet four ten As every man hath received grace ministering the same one to another Wherefore Augustine says De Civ Dei xix fourteen Just men command not by the love of domineering but by the service of counsel and De Civ Dei xix fifteen The natural order of things requires this and thus did God make man From this appear the replies to the objections which are founded on the first mentioned mode of mastership QUESTION ninety seven OF THE PRESERVATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE In Four Articles We next consider what belongs to the bodily state of the first man first as regards the preservation of the individual secondly as regards the preservation of the species Under the first head there are four points of inquiry one Whether man in the state of innocence was immortal two Whether he was impassible three Whether he stood in need of food four Whether he would have obtained immortality by the tree of life FIRST ARTICLE I Q ninety seven Art one Whether in the State of Innocence Man Would Have Been Immortal Objection one It would seem that in the state of innocence man was not immortal For the term mortal belongs to the definition of man But if you take away the definition you take away the thing defined Therefore as long as man was man he could not be immortal Obj two Further corruptible and incorruptible are generically distinct as the Philosopher says Metaph x Did ix ten But there can be no passing from one genus to another Therefore if the first man was incorruptible man could not be corruptible in the present state Obj three Further if man were immortal in the state of innocence this would have been due either to nature or to grace Not to nature for since nature does not change within the same species he would also have been immortal now Likewise neither would this be owing to grace for the first man recovered grace by repentance according to Wis ten two He brought him out of his sins Hence he would have regained his immortality which is clearly not the case Therefore man was not immortal in the state of innocence Obj four Further immortality is promised to man as a reward according to Apoc twenty one four Death shall be no more But man was not created in the state of reward but that he might deserve the reward Therefore man was not immortal in the state of innocence On the contrary It is written Rom five twelve By sin death came into the world Therefore man was immortal before sin I answer that A thing may be incorruptible in three ways First on the part of matter that is to say either because it possesses no matter like an angel or because it possesses matter that is in potentiality to one form only like the heavenly bodies Such things as these are incorruptible by their very nature Secondly a thing is incorruptible in its form inasmuch as being by nature corruptible yet it has an inherent disposition which preserves it wholly from corruption and this is called incorruptibility of glory because as Augustine says Ep ad Dioscor God made man s soul of such a powerful nature that from its fulness of beatitude there redounds to the body a fulness of health with the vigor of incorruption Thirdly a thing may be incorruptible on the part of its efficient cause in this sense man was incorruptible and immortal in the state of innocence For as Augustine says QQ Vet et Nov Test qu nineteen Work of an anonymous author among the supposititious works of saint Augustine God made man immortal as long as he did not sin so that he might achieve for himself life or death For man s body was indissoluble not by reason of any intrinsic vigor of immortality but by reason of a supernatural force given by God to the soul whereby it was enabled to preserve the body from all corruption so long as it remained itself subject to God This entirely agrees with reason for since the rational soul surpasses the capacity of corporeal matter as above explained Q seventy six A one it was most properly endowed at the beginning with the power of preserving the body in a manner surpassing the capacity of corporeal matter Reply Obj one and two These objections are founded on natural incorruptibility and immortality Reply Obj three This power of preserving the body was not natural to the soul but was the gift of grace And though man recovered grace as regards remission of guilt and the merit of glory yet he did not recover immortality the loss of which was an effect of sin for this was reserved for Christ to accomplish by Whom the defect of nature was to be restored into something better as we shall explain further on III Q fourteen A four ad one Reply Obj four The promised reward of the immortality of glory differs from the immortality which was bestowed on man in the state of innocence SECOND ARTICLE I Q ninety seven Art two Whether in the State of Innocence Man Would Have Been Passible Objection one It would seem that in the state of innocence man was passible For sensation is a kind of passion But in the state of innocence man would have been sensitive Therefore he would have been passible Obj two Further sleep is a kind of passion Now man slept in the state of innocence according to general two twenty one God cast a deep sleep upon Adam Therefore he would have been passible Obj three Further the same passage goes on to say that He took a rib out of Adam Therefore he was passible even to the degree of the cutting out of part of his body Obj four Further man s body was soft But a soft body is naturally passible as regards a hard body therefore if a hard body had come in contact with the soft body of the first man the latter would have suffered from the impact Therefore the first man was passible On the contrary Had man been passible he would have been also corruptible because as the Philosopher says Top vi three Excessive suffering wastes the very substance I answer that Passion may be taken in two senses First in its proper sense and thus a thing is said to suffer when changed from its natural disposition For passion is the effect of action and in nature contraries are mutually active or passive according as one thing changes another from its natural disposition Secondly passion can be taken in a general sense for any kind of change even if belonging to the perfecting process of nature Thus understanding and sensation are said to be passions In this second sense man was passible in the state of innocence and was passive both in soul and body In the first sense man was impassible both in soul and body as he was likewise immortal for he could curb his passion as he could avoid death so long as he refrained from sin Thus it is clear how to reply to the first two objections since sensation and sleep do not remove from man his natural disposition but are ordered to his natural welfare Reply Obj three As already explained Q ninety two A three ad two the rib was in Adam as the principle of the human race as the semen in man who is a principle through generation Hence as man does not suffer any natural deterioration by seminal issue so neither did he through the separation of the rib Reply Obj four Man s body in the state of innocence could be preserved from suffering injury from a hard body partly by the use of his reason whereby he could avoid what was harmful and partly also by Divine Providence so preserving him that nothing of a harmful nature could come upon him unawares THIRD ARTICLE I Q ninety seven Art three Whether in the State of Innocence Man Had Need of Food Objection one It would seem that in the state of innocence man did not require food For food is necessary for man to restore what he has lost But Adam s body suffered no loss as being incorruptible Therefore he had no need of food Obj two Further food is needed for nourishment But nourishment involves passibility Since then man s body was impassible it does not appear how food could be needful to him Obj three Further we need food for the preservation of life But Adam could preserve his life otherwise for had he not sinned he would not have died Therefore he did not require food Obj four Further the consumption of food involves voiding of the surplus which seems unsuitable to the state of innocence Therefore it seems that man did not take food in the primitive state On the contrary It is written general two sixteen Of every tree in paradise ye shall Vulg thou shalt eat I answer that In the state of innocence man had an animal life requiring food but after the resurrection he will have a spiritual life needing no food In order to make this clear we must observe that the rational soul is both soul and spirit It is called a soul by reason of what it possesses in common with other souls that is as giving life to the body whence it is written general two seven Man was made into a living soul that is a soul giving life to the body But the soul is called a spirit according to what properly belongs to itself and not to other souls as possessing an intellectual immaterial power Thus in the primitive state the rational soul communicated to the body what belonged to itself as a soul and so the body was called animal From anima a soul Cf one Cor fifteen forty four seqq through having its life from the soul Now the first principle of life in these inferior creatures as the Philosopher says De Anima ii four is the vegetative soul the operations of which are the use of food generation and growth Wherefore such operations befitted man in the state of innocence But in the final state after the resurrection the soul will to a certain extent communicate to the body what properly belongs to itself as a spirit immortality to everyone impassibility glory and power to the good whose bodies will be called spiritual So after the resurrection man will not require food whereas he required it in the state of innocence Reply Obj one As Augustine says QQ Vet et Nov Test qu nineteen Works of an anonymous author among the supposititious works of saint Augustine How could man have an immortal body which was sustained by food Since an immortal being needs neither food nor drink For we have explained A one that the immortality of the primitive state was based on a supernatural force in the soul and not on any intrinsic disposition of the body so that by the action of heat the body might lose part of its humid qualities and to prevent the entire consumption of the humor man was obliged to take food Reply Obj two A certain passion and alteration attends nutriment on the part of the food changed into the substance of the thing nourished So we cannot thence conclude that man s body was passible but that the food taken was passible although this kind of passion conduced to the perfection of the nature Reply Obj three If man had not taken food he would have sinned as he also sinned by taking the forbidden fruit For he was told at the same time to abstain from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and to eat of every other tree of Paradise Reply Obj four Some say that in the state of innocence man would not have taken more than necessary food so that there would have been nothing superfluous which however is unreasonable to suppose as implying that there would have been no faecal matter Wherefore there was need for voiding the surplus yet so disposed by God as to be decorous and suitable to the state FOURTH ARTICLE I Q ninety seven Art four Whether in the State of Innocence Man Would Have Acquired Immortality by the Tree of Life Objection one It would seem that the tree of life could not be the cause of immortality For nothing can act beyond its own species as an effect does not exceed its cause But the tree of life was corruptible otherwise it could not be taken as food since food is changed into the substance of the thing nourished Therefore the tree of life could not give incorruptibility or immortality Obj two Further effects caused by the forces of plants and other natural agencies are natural If therefore the tree of life caused immortality this would have been natural immortality Obj three Further this would seem to be reduced to the ancient fable that the gods by eating a certain food became immortal which the Philosopher ridicules Metaph iii Did ii four On the contrary It is written general three twenty two Lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take of the tree of life and eat and live for ever Further Augustine says QQ Vet et Nov Test qu nineteen Work of an anonymous author among the supposititious works of saint Augustine A taste of the tree of life warded off corruption of the body and even after sin man would have remained immortal had he been allowed to eat of the tree of life I answer that The tree of life in a certain degree was the cause of immortality but not absolutely To understand this we must observe that in the primitive state man possessed for the preservation of life two remedies against two defects One of these defects was the lost of humidity by the action of natural heat which acts as the soul s instrument as a remedy against such loss man was provided with food taken from the other trees of paradise as now we are provided with the food which we take for the same purpose The second defect as the Philosopher says De Gener i five arises from the fact that the humor which is caused from extraneous sources being added to the humor already existing lessens the specific active power as water added to wine takes at first the taste of wine then as more water is added the strength of the wine is diminished till the wine becomes watery In like manner we may observe that at first the active force of the species is so strong that it is able to transform so much of the food as is required to replace the lost tissue as well as what suffices for growth later on however the assimilated food does not suffice for growth but only replaces what is lost Last of all in old age it does not suffice even for this purpose whereupon the body declines and finally dies from natural causes Against this defect man was provided with a remedy in the tree of life for its effect was to strengthen the force of the species against the weakness resulting from the admixture of extraneous nutriment Wherefore Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv twenty six Man had food to appease his hunger drink to slake his thirst and the tree of life to banish the breaking up of old age and QQ Vet et Nov Test qu nineteen Work of an anonymous author among the supposititious works of saint Augustine The tree of life like a drug warded off all bodily corruption Yet it did not absolutely cause immortality for neither was the soul s intrinsic power of preserving the body due to the tree of life nor was it of such efficiency as to give the body a disposition to immortality whereby it might become indissoluble which is clear from the fact that every bodily power is finite so the power of the tree of life could not go so far as to give the body the prerogative of living for an infinite time but only for a definite time For it is manifest that the greater a force is the more durable is its effect therefore since the power of the tree of life was finite man s life was to be preserved for a definite time by partaking of it once and when that time had elapsed man was to be either transferred to a spiritual life or had need to eat once more of the tree of life From this the replies to the objections clearly appear For the first proves that the tree of life did not absolutely cause immortality while the others show that it caused incorruption by warding off corruption according to the explanation above given QUESTION ninety eight OF THE PRESERVATION OF THE SPECIES In Two Articles We next consider what belongs to the preservation of the species and first of generation secondly of the state of the offspring Under the first head there are two points of inquiry one Whether in the state of innocence there would have been generation two Whether generation would have been through coition FIRST ARTICLE Q ninety eight Art one Whether in the State of Innocence Generation Existed Objection one It would seem there would have been no generation in the state of innocence For as stated in Phys v five corruption is contrary to generation But contraries affect the same subject also there would have been no corruption in the state of innocence Therefore neither would there have been generation Obj two Further the object of generation is the preservation in the species of that which is corruptible in the individual Wherefore there is no generation in those individual things which last for ever But in the state of innocence man would have lived for ever Therefore in the state of innocence there would have been no generation Obj three Further by generation man is multiplied But the multiplication of masters requires the division of property to avoid confusion of mastership Therefore since man was made master of the animals it would have been necessary to make a division of rights when the human race increased by generation This is against the natural law according to which all things are in common as Isidore says Etym v four Therefore there would have been no generation in the state of innocence On the contrary It is written general one twenty eight Increase and multiply and fill the earth But this increase could not come about save by generation since the original number of mankind was two only Therefore there would have been generation in the state of innocence I answer that In the state of innocence there would have been generation of offspring for the multiplication of the human race otherwise man s sin would have been very necessary for such a great blessing to be its result We must therefore observe that man by his nature is established as it were midway between corruptible and incorruptible creatures his soul being naturally incorruptible while his body is naturally corruptible We must also observe that nature s purpose appears to be different as regards corruptible and incorruptible things For that seems to be the direct purpose of nature which is invariable and perpetual while what is only for a time is seemingly not the chief purpose of nature but as it were subordinate to something else otherwise when it ceased to exist nature s purpose would become void Therefore since in things corruptible none is everlasting and permanent except the species it follows that the chief purpose of nature is the good of the species for the preservation of which natural generation is ordained On the other hand incorruptible substances survive not only in the species but also in the individual wherefore even the individuals are included in the chief purpose of nature Hence it belongs to man to beget offspring on the part of the naturally corruptible body But on the part of the soul which is incorruptible it is fitting that the multitude of individuals should be the direct purpose of nature or rather of the Author of nature Who alone is the Creator of the human soul Wherefore to provide for the multiplication of the human race He established the begetting of offspring even in the state of innocence Reply Obj one In the state of innocence the human body was in itself corruptible but it could be preserved from corruption by the soul Therefore since generation belongs to things corruptible man was not to be deprived thereof Reply Obj two Although generation in the state of innocence might not have been required for the preservation of the species yet it would have been required for the multiplication of the individual Reply Obj three In our present state a division of possessions is necessary on account of the multiplicity of masters inasmuch as community of possession is a source of strife as the Philosopher says Politic ii five In the state of innocence however the will of men would have been so ordered that without any danger of strife they would have used in common according to each one s need those things of which they were masters a state of things to be observed even now among many good men SECOND ARTICLE I Q ninety eight Art two Whether in the State of Innocence There Would Have Been Generation by Coition Objection one It would seem that generation by coition would not have existed in the state of innocence For as Damascene says De Fide Orth ii eleven iv twenty five the first man in the terrestrial Paradise was like an angel But in the future state of the resurrection when men will be like the angels they shall neither marry nor be married as is written Matt twenty two thirty Therefore neither in paradise would there have been generation by coition Obj two Further our first parents were created at the age of perfect development Therefore if generation by coition had existed before sin they would have had intercourse while still in paradise which was not the case according to Scripture general four one Obj three Further in carnal intercourse more than at any other time man becomes like the beasts on account of the vehement delight which he takes therein whence contingency is praiseworthy whereby man refrains from such pleasures But man is compared to beasts by reason of sin according to Ps forty eight thirteen Man when he was in honor did not understand he is compared to senseless beasts and is become like to them Therefore before sin there would have been no such intercourse of man and woman Obj four Further in the state of innocence there would have been no corruption But virginal integrity is corrupted by intercourse Therefore there would have been no such thing in the state of innocence On the contrary God made man and woman before sin general one two But nothing is void in God s works Therefore even if man had not sinned there would have been such intercourse to which the distinction of sex is ordained Moreover we are told that woman was made to be a help to man general two eighteen twenty But she is not fitted to help man except in generation because another man would have proved a more effective help in anything else Therefore there would have been such generation also in the state of innocence I answer that Some of the earlier doctors considering the nature of concupiscence as regards generation in our present state concluded that in the state of innocence generation would not have been effected in the same way Thus Gregory of Nyssa says De Hom Opif xvii that in paradise the human race would have been multiplied by some other means as the angels were multiplied without coition by the operation of the Divine Power He adds that God made man male and female before sin because He foreknew the mode of generation which would take place after sin which He foresaw But this is unreasonable For what is natural to man was neither acquired nor forfeited by sin Now it is clear that generation by coition is natural to man by reason of his animal life which he possessed even before sin as above explained Q ninety seven A three just as it is natural to other perfect animals as the corporeal members make it clear So we cannot allow that these members would not have had a natural use as other members had before sin Thus as regards generation by coition there are in the present state of life two things to be considered One which comes from nature is the union of man and woman for in every act of generation there is an active and a passive principle Wherefore since wherever there is distinction of sex the active principle is male and the passive is female the order of nature demands that for the purpose of generation there should be concurrence of male and female The second thing to be observed is a certain deformity of excessive concupiscence which in the state of innocence would not have existed when the lower powers were entirely subject to reason Wherefore Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv twenty six We must be far from supposing that offspring could not be begotten without concupiscence All the bodily members would have been equally moved by the will without ardent or wanton incentive with calmness of soul and body Reply Obj one In paradise man would have been like an angel in his spirituality of mind yet with an animal life in his body After the resurrection man will be like an angel spiritualized in soul and body Wherefore there is no parallel Reply Obj two As Augustine says general ad lit ix four our first parents did not come together in paradise because on account of sin they were ejected from paradise shortly after the creation of the woman or because having received the general Divine command relative to generation they awaited the special command relative to time Reply Obj three Beasts are without reason In this way man becomes as it were like them in coition because he cannot moderate concupiscence In the state of innocence nothing of this kind would have happened that was not regulated by reason not because delight of sense was less as some say rather indeed would sensible delight have been the greater in proportion to the greater purity of nature and the greater sensibility of the body but because the force of concupiscence would not have so inordinately thrown itself into such pleasure being curbed by reason whose place it is not to lessen sensual pleasure but to prevent the force of concupiscence from cleaving to it immoderately By immoderately I mean going beyond the bounds of reason as a sober person does not take less pleasure in food taken in moderation than the glutton but his concupiscence lingers less in such pleasures This is what Augustine means by the words quoted which do not exclude intensity of pleasure from the state of innocence but ardor of desire and restlessness of the mind Therefore continence would not have been praiseworthy in the state of innocence whereas it is praiseworthy in our present state not because it removes fecundity but because it excludes inordinate desire In that state fecundity would have been without lust Reply Obj four As Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv twenty six In that state intercourse would have been without prejudice to virginal integrity this would have remained intact as it does in the menses And just as in giving birth the mother was then relieved not by groans of pain but by the instigations of maturity so in conceiving the union was one not of lustful desire but of deliberate action QUESTION ninety nine OF THE CONDITION OF THE OFFSPRING AS TO THE BODY In Two Articles We must now consider the condition of the offspring first as regards the body secondly as regards virtue thirdly in knowledge Under the first head there are two points of inquiry one Whether in the state of innocence children would have had full powers of the body immediately after birth two Whether all infants would have been of the male sex FIRST ARTICLE I Q ninety nine Art one Whether in the State of Innocence Children Would Have Had Perfect Strength of Body As to the Use of Its Members Immediately After Birth Objection one It would seem that in the state of innocence children would have had perfect strength of the body as to the use of its members immediately after birth For Augustine says De Pecc Merit et Remiss i thirty eight This weakness of the body befits their weakness of mind But in the state of innocence there would have been no weakness of mind Therefore neither would there have been weakness of body in infants Obj two Further some animals at birth have sufficient strength to use their members But man is nobler than other animals Therefore much more is it natural to man to have strength to use his members at birth and thus it appears to be a punishment of sin that he has not that strength Obj three Further inability to secure a proffered pleasure causes affliction But if children had not full strength in the use of their limbs they would often have been unable to procure something pleasurable offered to them and so they would have been afflicted which was not possible before sin Therefore in the state of innocence children would not have been deprived of the use of their limbs Obj four Further the weakness of old age seems to correspond to that of infancy But in the state of innocence there would have been no weakness of old age Therefore neither would there have been such weakness in infancy On the contrary Everything generated is first imperfect But in the state of innocence children would have been begotten by generation Therefore from the first they would have been imperfect in bodily size and power I answer that By faith alone do we hold truths which are above nature and what we believe rests on authority Wherefore in making any assertion we must be guided by the nature of things except in those things which are above nature and are made known to us by Divine authority Now it is clear that it is as natural as it is befitting to the principles of human nature that children should not have sufficient strength for the use of their limbs immediately after birth Because in proportion to other animals man has naturally a larger brain Wherefore it is natural on account of the considerable humidity of the brain in children that the nerves which are instruments of movement should not be apt for moving the limbs On the other hand no Catholic doubts it possible for a child to have by Divine power the use of its limbs immediately after birth Now we have it on the authority of Scripture that God made man right Eccles seven thirty which rightness as Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv eleven consists in the perfect subjection of the body to the soul As therefore in the primitive state it was impossible to find in the human limbs anything repugnant to man s well ordered will so was it impossible for those limbs to fail in executing the will s commands Now the human will is well ordered when it tends to acts which are befitting to man But the same acts are not befitting to man at every season of life We must therefore conclude that children would not have had sufficient strength for the use of their limbs for the purpose of performing every kind of act but only for the acts befitting the state of infancy such as suckling and the like Reply Obj one Augustine is speaking of the weakness which we observe in children even as regards those acts which befit the state of infancy as is clear from his preceding remark that even when close to the breast and longing for it they are more apt to cry than to suckle Reply Obj two The fact that some animals have the use of their limbs immediately after birth is due not to their superiority since more perfect animals are not so endowed but to the dryness of the brain and to the operations proper to such animals being imperfect so that a small amount of strength suffices them Reply Obj three is clear from what we have said above We may add that they would have desired nothing except with an ordinate will and only what was befitting to their state of life Reply Obj four In the state of innocence man would have been born yet not subject to corruption Therefore in that state there could have been certain infantile defects which result from birth but not senile defects leading to corruption SECOND ARTICLE I Q ninety nine Art two Whether in the Primitive State Women Would Have Been Born Objection one It would seem that in the primitive state woman would not have been born For the Philosopher says De Gener Animal ii three that woman is a misbegotten male as though she were a product outside the purpose of nature But in that state nothing would have been unnatural in human generation Therefore in that state women would not have been born Obj two Further every agent produces its like unless prevented by insufficient power or ineptness of matter thus a small fire cannot burn green wood But in generation the active force is in the male Since therefore in the state of innocence man s active force was not subject to defect nor was there inept matter on the part of the woman it seems that males would always have been born Obj three Further in the state of innocence generation is ordered to the multiplication of the human race But the race would have been sufficiently multiplied by the first man and woman from the fact that they would have lived for ever Therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be born On the contrary Nature s process in generation would have been in harmony with the manner in which it was established by God But God established male and female in human nature as it is written general one two Therefore also in the state of innocence male and female would have been born I answer that Nothing belonging to the completeness of human nature would have been lacking in the state of innocence And as different grades belong to the perfection of the universe so also diversity of sex belongs to the perfection of human nature Therefore in the state of innocence both sexes would have been begotten Reply Obj one Woman is said to be a misbegotten male as being a product outside the purpose of nature considered in the individual case but not against the purpose of universal nature as above explained Q ninety two A one ad two Reply Obj two The generation of woman is not occasioned either by a defect of the active force or by inept matter as the objection proposes but sometimes by an extrinsic accidental cause thus the Philosopher says De Animal Histor vi nineteen The northern wind favors the generation of males and the southern wind that of females sometimes also by some impression in the soul of the parents which may easily have some effect on the body of the child Especially was this the case in the state of innocence when the body was more subject to the soul so that by the mere will of the parent the sex of the offspring might be diversified Reply Obj three The offspring would have been begotten to an animal life as to the use of food and generation Hence it was fitting that all should generate and not only the first parents From this it seems to follow that males and females would have been in equal number QUESTION one hundred OF THE CONDITION OF THE OFFSPRING AS REGARDS RIGHTEOUSNESS In Two Articles We now have to consider the condition of the offspring as to righteousness Under this head there are two points of inquiry one Whether men would have been born in a state of righteousness two Whether they would have been born confirmed in righteousness FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred Art one Whether Men Would Have Been Born in a State of Righteousness Objection one It would seem that in the state of innocence men would not have been born in a state of righteousness For Hugh of saint Victor says De Sacram i Before sin the first man would have begotten children sinless but not heirs to their father s righteousness Obj two Further righteousness is effected by grace as the Apostle says Rom five sixteen twenty one Now grace is not transfused from one to another for thus it would be natural but is infused by God alone Therefore children would not have been born righteous Obj three Further righteousness is in the soul But the soul is not transmitted from the parent Therefore neither would righteousness have been transmitted from parents to the children On the contrary Anselm says De Concep Virg x As long as man did not sin he would have begotten children endowed with righteousness together with the rational soul I answer that Man naturally begets a specific likeness to himself Hence whatever accidental qualities result from the nature of the species must be alike in parent and child unless nature fails in its operation which would not have occurred in the state of innocence But individual accidents do not necessarily exist alike in parent and child Now original righteousness in which the first man was created was an accident pertaining to the nature of the species not as caused by the principles of the species but as a gift conferred by God on the entire human nature This is clear from the fact that opposites are of the same genus and original sin which is opposed to original righteousness is called the sin of nature wherefore it is transmitted from the parent to the offspring and for this reason also the children would have been assimilated to their parents as regards original righteousness Reply Obj one These words of Hugh are to be understood as referring not to the habit of righteousness but to the execution of the act thereof Reply Obj two Some say that children would have been born not with the righteousness of grace which is the principle of merit but with original righteousness But since the root of original righteousness which conferred righteousness on the first man when he was made consists in the supernatural subjection of the reason to God which subjection results from sanctifying grace as above explained Q ninety five A one we must conclude that if children were born in original righteousness they would also have been born in grace thus we have said above that the first man was created in grace Q ninety five A one This grace however would not have been natural for it would not have been transfused by virtue of the semen but would have been conferred on man immediately on his receiving a rational soul In the same way the rational soul which is not transmitted by the parent is infused by God as soon as the human body is apt to receive it From this the reply to the third objection is clear SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred Art two Whether in the State of Innocence Children Would Have Been Born Confirmed in Righteousness Objection one It would seem that in the state of innocence children would have been born confirmed in righteousness For Gregory says Moral iv on the words of Job three thirteen For now I should have been asleep et cetera If no sinful corruption had infected our first parent he would not have begotten children of hell no children would have been born of him but such as were destined to be saved by the Redeemer Therefore all would have been born confirmed in righteousness Obj two Further Anselm says Cur Deus Homo i eighteen If our first parents had lived so as not to yield to temptation they would have been confirmed in grace so that with their offspring they would have been unable to sin any more Therefore the children would have been born confirmed in righteousness Obj three Further good is stronger than evil But by the sin of the first man there resulted in those born of him the necessity of sin Therefore if the first man had persevered in righteousness his descendants would have derived from him the necessity of preserving righteousness Obj four Further the angels who remained faithful to God while the others sinned were at once confirmed in grace so as to be unable henceforth to sin In like manner therefore man would have been confirmed in grace if he had persevered But he would have begotten children like himself Therefore they also would have been born confirmed in righteousness On the contrary Augustine says De Civ Dei xiv ten Happy would have been the whole human race if neither they that is our first parents had committed any evil to be transmitted to their descendants nor any of their race had committed any sin for which they would have been condemned From which words we gather that even if our first parents had not sinned any of their descendants might have done evil and therefore they would not have been born confirmed in righteousness I answer that It does not seem possible that in the state of innocence children would have been born confirmed in righteousness For it is clear that at their birth they would not have had greater perfection than their parents at the time of begetting Now the parents as long as they begot children would not have been confirmed in righteousness For the rational creature is confirmed in righteousness through the beatitude given by the clear vision of God and when once it has seen God it cannot but cleave to Him Who is the essence of goodness wherefrom no one can turn away since nothing is desired or loved but under the aspect of good I say this according to the general law for it may be otherwise in the case of special privilege such as we believe was granted to the Virgin Mother of God And as soon as Adam had attained to that happy state of seeing God in His Essence he would have become spiritual in soul and body and his animal life would have ceased wherein alone there is generation Hence it is clear that children would not have been born confirmed in righteousness Reply Obj one If Adam had not sinned he would not have begotten children of hell in the sense that they would contract from him sin which is the cause of hell yet by sinning of their own free will they could have become children of hell If however they did not become children of hell by falling into sin this would not have been owing to their being confirmed in righteousness but to Divine Providence preserving them free from sin Reply Obj two Anselm does not say this by way of assertion but only as an opinion which is clear from his mode of expression as follows It seems that if they had lived et cetera Reply Obj three This argument is not conclusive though Anselm seems to have been influenced by it as appears from his words above quoted For the necessity of sin incurred by the descendants would not have been such that they could not return to righteousness which is the case only with the damned Wherefore neither would the parents have transmitted to their descendants the necessity of not sinning which is only in the blessed Reply Obj four There is no comparison between man and the angels for man s free will is changeable both before and after choice whereas the angel s is not changeable as we have said above in treating of the angels Q sixty four A two QUESTION one hundred one OF THE CONDITION OF THE OFFSPRING AS REGARDS KNOWLEDGE In Two Articles We next consider the condition of the offspring as to knowledge Under this head there are two points of inquiry one Whether in the state of innocence children would have been born with perfect knowledge two Whether they would have had perfect use of reason at the moment of birth FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred one Art one Whether in the State of Innocence Children Would Have Been Born with Perfect Knowledge Objection one It would seem that in the state of innocence children would have been born with perfect knowledge For Adam would have begotten children like himself But Adam was gifted with perfect knowledge Q ninety four A three Therefore children would have been born of him with perfect knowledge Obj two Further ignorance is a result of sin as Bede says Cf I II Q eighty five A three But ignorance is privation of knowledge Therefore before sin children would have had perfect knowledge as soon as they were born Obj three Further children would have been gifted with righteousness from birth But knowledge is required for righteousness since it directs our actions Therefore they would also have been gifted with knowledge On the contrary The human soul is naturally like a blank tablet on which nothing is written as the Philosopher says De Anima iii four But the nature of the soul is the same now as it would have been in the state of innocence Therefore the souls of children would have been without knowledge at birth I answer that As above stated Q ninety nine A one as regards belief in matters which are above nature we rely on authority alone and so when authority is wanting we must be guided by the ordinary course of nature Now it is natural for man to acquire knowledge through the senses as above explained Q fifty five A two Q eighty four A six and for this reason is the soul united to the body that it needs it for its proper operation and this would not be so if the soul were endowed at birth with knowledge not acquired through the sensitive powers We must conclude then that in the state of innocence children would not have been born with perfect knowledge but in course of time they would have acquired knowledge without difficulty by discovery or learning Reply Obj one The perfection of knowledge was an individual accident of our first parent so far as he was established as the father and instructor of the whole human race Therefore he begot children like himself not in that respect but only in those accidents which were natural or conferred gratuitously on the whole nature Reply Obj two Ignorance is privation of knowledge due at some particular time and this would not have been in children from their birth for they would have possessed the knowledge due to them at that time Hence no ignorance would have been in them but only nescience in regard to certain matters Such nescience was even in the holy angels according to Dionysius Coel Hier vii Reply Obj three Children would have had sufficient knowledge to direct them to deeds of righteousness in which men are guided by universal principles of right and this knowledge of theirs would have been much more complete than what we have now by nature as likewise their knowledge of other universal principles SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred one Art two Whether Children Would Have Had Perfect Use of Reason at Birth Objection one It would seem that children would have had perfect use of reason at birth For that children have not perfect use of reason in our present state is due to the soul being weighed down by the body which was not the case in paradise because as it is written The corruptible body is a load upon the soul Wis nine fifteen Therefore before sin and the corruption which resulted therefrom children would have had the perfect use of reason at birth Obj two Further some animals at birth have the use of their natural powers as the lamb at once flees from the wolf Much more therefore would men in the state of innocence have had perfect use of reason at birth On the contrary In all things produced by generation nature proceeds from the imperfect to the perfect Therefore children would not have had the perfect use of reason from the very outset I answer that As above stated Q eighty four A seven the use of reason depends in a certain manner on the use of the sensitive powers wherefore while the senses are tired and the interior sensitive powers hampered man has not the perfect use of reason as we see in those who are asleep or delirious Now the sensitive powers are situate in corporeal organs and therefore so long as the latter are hindered the action of the former is of necessity hindered also and likewise consequently the use of reason Now children are hindered in the use of these powers on account of the humidity of the brain wherefore they have perfect use neither of these powers nor of reason Therefore in the state of innocence children would not have had the perfect use of reason which they would have enjoyed later on in life Yet they would have had a more perfect use than they have now as to matters regarding that particular state as explained above regarding the use of their limbs Q ninety nine A one Reply Obj one The corruptible body is a load upon the soul because it hinders the use of reason even in those matters which belong to man at all ages Reply Obj two Even other animals have not at birth such a perfect use of their natural powers as they have later on This is clear from the fact that birds teach their young to fly and the like may be observed in other animals Moreover a special impediment exists in man from the humidity of the brain as we have said above Q ninety nine A one QUESTION one hundred two OF MAN S ABODE WHICH IS PARADISE In Four Articles We next consider man s abode which is paradise Under this head there are four points of inquiry one Whether paradise is a corporeal place two Whether it is a place apt for human habitation three For what purpose was man placed in paradise four Whether he should have been created in paradise FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred two Art one Whether Paradise Is a Corporeal Place Objection one It would seem that paradise is not a corporeal place For Bede Strabus Gloss on general two eight says that paradise reaches to the lunar circle But no earthly place answers that description both because it is contrary to the nature of the earth to be raised up so high and because beneath the moon is the region of fire which would consume the earth Therefore paradise is not a corporeal place Obj two Further Scripture mentions four rivers as rising in paradise general two ten But the rivers there mentioned have visible sources elsewhere as is clear from the Philosopher Meteor i Therefore paradise is not a corporeal place Obj three Further although men have explored the entire habitable world yet none have made mention of the place of paradise Therefore apparently it is not a corporeal place Obj four Further the tree of life is described as growing in paradise But the tree of life is a spiritual thing for it is written of Wisdom that She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her Prov three eighteen Therefore paradise also is not a corporeal but a spiritual place Obj five Further if paradise be a corporeal place the trees also of paradise must be corporeal But it seems they were not for corporeal trees were produced on the third day while the planting of the trees of paradise is recorded after the work of the six days Therefore paradise was not a corporeal place On the contrary Augustine says general ad lit viii one Three general opinions prevail about paradise Some understand a place merely corporeal others a place entirely spiritual while others whose opinion I confess pleases me hold that paradise was both corporeal and spiritual I answer that As Augustine says De Civ Dei xiii twenty one Nothing prevents us from holding within proper limits a spiritual paradise so long as we believe in the truth of the events narrated as having there occurred For whatever Scripture tells us about paradise is set down as matter of history and wherever Scripture makes use of this method we must hold to the historical truth of the narrative as a foundation of whatever spiritual explanation we may offer And so paradise as Isidore says Etym xiv three is a place situated in the east its name being the Greek for garden It was fitting that it should be in the east for it is to be believed that it was situated in the most excellent part of the earth Now the east is the right hand on the heavens as the Philosopher explains De Coel ii two and the right hand is nobler than the left hence it was fitting that God should place the earthly paradise in the east Reply Obj one Bede s assertion is untrue if taken in its obvious sense It may however be explained to mean that paradise reaches to the moon not literally but figuratively because as Isidore says Etym xiv three the atmosphere there is a continually even temperature and in this respect it is like the heavenly bodies which are devoid of opposing elements Mention however is made of the moon rather than of other bodies because of all the heavenly bodies the moon is nearest to us and is moreover the most akin to the earth hence it is observed to be overshadowed by clouds so as to be almost obscured Others say that paradise reached to the moon that is to the middle space of the air where rain and wind and the like arise because the moon is said to have influence on such changes But in this sense it would not be a fit place for human dwelling through being uneven in temperature and not attuned to the human temperament as is the lower atmosphere in the neighborhood of the earth Reply Obj two Augustine says general ad lit viii seven It is probable that man has no idea where paradise was and that the rivers whose sources are said to be known flowed for some distance underground and then sprang up elsewhere For who is not aware that such is the case with some other streams Reply Obj three The situation of paradise is shut off from the habitable world by mountains or seas or some torrid region which cannot be crossed and so people who have written about topography make no mention of it Reply Obj four The tree of life is a material tree and so called because its fruit was endowed with a life preserving power as above stated Q ninety seven A four Yet it had a spiritual signification as the rock in the desert was of a material nature and yet signified Christ In like manner the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a material tree so called in view of future events because after eating of it man was to learn by experience of the consequent punishment the difference between the good of obedience and the evil of rebellion It may also be said to signify spiritually the free will as some say Reply Obj five According to Augustine general ad lit v five viii three the plants were not actually produced on the third day but in their seminal virtues whereas after the work of the six days the plants both of paradise and others were actually produced According to other holy writers we ought to say that all the plants were actually produced on the third day including the trees of paradise and what is said of the trees of paradise being planted after the work of the six days is to be understood they say by way of recapitulation Whence our text reads The Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning general two eight SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred two Art two Whether Paradise Was a Place Adapted to Be the Abode of Man Objection one It would seem that paradise was not a place adapted to be the abode of man For man and angels are similarly ordered to beatitude But the angels from the very beginning of their existence were made to dwell in the abode of the blessed that is the empyrean heaven Therefore the place of man s habitation should have been there also Obj two Further if some definite place were required for man s abode this would be required on the part either of the soul or of the body If on the part of the soul the place would be in heaven which is adapted to the nature of the soul since the desire of heaven is implanted in all On the part of the body there was no need for any other place than the one provided for other animals Therefore paradise was not at all adapted to be the abode of man Obj three Further a place which contains nothing is useless But after sin paradise was not occupied by man Therefore if it were adapted as a dwelling place for man it seems that God made paradise to no purpose Obj four Further since man is of an even temperament a fitting place for him should be of even temperature But paradise was not of an even temperature for it is said to have been on the equator a situation of extreme heat since twice in the year the sun passes vertically over the heads of its inhabitants Therefore paradise was not a fit dwelling place for man On the contrary Damascene says De Fide Orth ii eleven Paradise was a divinely ordered region and worthy of him who was made to God s image I answer that As above stated Q ninety seven A one Man was incorruptible and immortal not because his body had a disposition to incorruptibility but because in his soul there was a power preserving the body from corruption Now the human body may be corrupted from within or from without From within the body is corrupted by the consumption of the humors and by old age as above explained Q ninety seven A four and man was able to ward off such corruption by food Among those things which corrupt the body from without the chief seems to be an atmosphere of unequal temperature and to such corruption a remedy is found in an atmosphere of equable nature In paradise both conditions were found because as Damascene says De Fide Orth ii eleven Paradise was permeated with the all pervading brightness of a temperate pure and exquisite atmosphere and decked with ever flowering plants Whence it is clear that paradise was most fit to be a dwelling place for man and in keeping with his original state of immortality Reply Obj one The empyrean heaven is the highest of corporeal places and is outside the region of change By the first of these two conditions it is a fitting abode for the angelic nature for as Augustine says De Trin ii God rules corporeal creatures through spiritual creatures Hence it is fitting that the spiritual nature should be established above the entire corporeal nature as presiding over it By the second condition it is a fitting abode for the state of beatitude which is endowed with the highest degree of stability Thus the abode of beatitude was suited to the very nature of the angel therefore he was created there But it is not suited to man s nature since man is not set as a ruler over the entire corporeal creation it is a fitting abode for man in regard only to his beatitude Wherefore he was not placed from the beginning in the empyrean heaven but was destined to be transferred thither in the state of his final beatitude Reply Obj two It is ridiculous to assert that any particular place is natural to the soul or to any spiritual substances though some particular place may have a certain fitness in regard to spiritual substances For the earthly paradise was a place adapted to man as regards both his body and his soul that is inasmuch as in his soul was the force which preserved the human body from corruption This could not be said of the other animals Therefore as Damascene says De Fide Orth ii eleven No irrational animal inhabited paradise although by a certain dispensation the animals were brought thither by God to Adam and the serpent was able to trespass therein by the complicity of the devil Reply Obj three Paradise did not become useless through being unoccupied by man after sin just as immortality was not conferred on man in vain though he was to lose it For thereby we learn God s kindness to man and what man lost by sin Moreover some say that Enoch and Elias still dwell in that paradise Reply Obj four Those who say that paradise was on the equinoctial line are of opinion that such a situation is most temperate on account of the unvarying equality of day and night that it is never too cold there because the sun is never too far off and never too hot because although the sun passes over the heads of the inhabitants it does not remain long in that position However Aristotle distinctly says Meteor ii five that such a region is uninhabitable on account of the heat This seems to be more probable because even those regions where the sun does not pass vertically overhead are extremely hot on account of the mere proximity of the sun But whatever be the truth of the matter we must hold that paradise was situated in a most temperate situation whether on the equator or elsewhere THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred two Art three Whether Man Was Placed in Paradise to Dress It and Keep It Objection one It would seem that man was not placed in paradise to dress and keep it For what was brought on him as a punishment of sin would not have existed in paradise in the state of innocence But the cultivation of the soil was a punishment of sin general three seventeen Therefore man was not placed in paradise to dress and keep it Obj two Further there is no need of a keeper when there is no fear of trespass with violence But in paradise there was no fear of trespass with violence Therefore there was no need for man to keep paradise Obj three Further if man was placed in paradise to dress and keep it man would apparently have been made for the sake of paradise and not contrariwise which seems to be false Therefore man was not place in paradise to dress and keep it On the contrary It is written general two fifteen The Lord God took man and placed in the paradise of pleasure to dress and keep it I answer that As Augustine says general ad lit viii ten these words in Genesis may be understood in two ways First in the sense that God placed man in paradise that He might Himself work in man and keep him by sanctifying him for if this work cease man at once relapses into darkness as the air grows dark when the light ceases to shine and by keeping man from all corruption and evil Secondly that man might dress and keep paradise which dressing would not have involved labor as it did after sin but would have been pleasant on account of man s practical knowledge of the powers of nature Nor would man have kept paradise against a trespasser but he would have striven to keep paradise for himself lest he should lose it by sin All of which was for man s good wherefore paradise was ordered to man s benefit and not conversely Whence the Replies to the Objections are made clear FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred two Art four Whether Man Was Created in Paradise Objection one It would seem that man was created in paradise For the angel was created in his dwelling place namely the empyrean heaven But before sin paradise was a fitting abode for man Therefore it seems that man was created in paradise Obj two Further other animals remain in the place where they are produced as the fish in the water and walking animals on the earth from which they were made Now man would have remained in paradise after he was created Q ninety seven A four Therefore he was created in paradise Obj three Further woman was made in paradise But man is greater than woman Therefore much more should man have been made in paradise On the contrary It is written general two fifteen God took man and placed him in paradise I answer that Paradise was a fitting abode for man as regards the incorruptibility of the primitive state Now this incorruptibility was man s not by nature but by a supernatural gift of God Therefore that this might be attributed to God and not to human nature God made man outside of paradise and afterwards placed him there to live there during the whole of his animal life and having attained to the spiritual life to be transferred thence to heaven Reply Obj one The empyrean heaven was a fitting abode for the angels as regards their nature and therefore they were created there In the same way I reply to the second objection for those places befit those animals in their nature Reply Obj three Woman was made in paradise not by reason of her own dignity but on account of the dignity of the principle from which her body was formed For the same reason the children would have been born in paradise where their parents were already TREATISE ON THE CONSERVATION AND GOVERNMENT OF CREATURES QQ one hundred three one hundred nineteen QUESTION one hundred three OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THINGS IN GENERAL In Eight Articles Having considered the creation of things and their distinction we now consider in the third place the government thereof and one the government of things in general two in particular the effects of this government Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry one Whether the world is governed by someone two What is the end of this government three Whether the world is governed by one four Of the effects of this government five Whether all things are subject to Divine government six Whether all things are immediately governed by God seven Whether the Divine government is frustrated in anything eight Whether anything is contrary to the Divine Providence FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred three Art one Whether the World Is Governed by Anyone Objection one It would seem that the world is not governed by anyone For it belongs to those things to be governed which move or work for an end But natural things which make up the greater part of the world do not move or work for an end for they have no knowledge of their end Therefore the world is not governed Obj two Further those things are governed which are moved towards an object But the world does not appear to be so directed but has stability in itself Therefore it is not governed Obj three Further what is necessarily determined by its own nature to one particular thing does not require any external principle of government But the principal parts of the world are by a certain necessity determined to something particular in their actions and movements Therefore the world does not require to be governed On the contrary It is written Wis fourteen three But Thou O Father governest all things by Thy Providence And Boethius says De Consol iii Thou Who governest this universe by mandate eternal I answer that Certain ancient philosophers denied the government of the world saying that all things happened by chance But such an opinion can be refuted as impossible in two ways First by observation of things themselves for we observe that in nature things happen always or nearly always for the best which would not be the case unless some sort of providence directed nature towards good as an end which is to govern Wherefore the unfailing order we observe in things is a sign of their being governed for instance if we enter a well ordered house we gather therefrom the intention of him that put it in order as Tullius says De Nat Deorum ii quoting Aristotle Cleanthes Secondly this is clear from a consideration of Divine goodness which as we have said above Q forty four A four Q sixty five A two was the cause of the production of things in existence For as it belongs to the best to produce the best it is not fitting that the supreme goodness of God should produce things without giving them their perfection Now a thing s ultimate perfection consists in the attainment of its end Therefore it belongs to the Divine goodness as it brought things into existence so to lead them to their end and this is to govern Reply Obj one A thing moves or operates for an end in two ways First in moving itself to the end as man and other rational creatures and such things have knowledge of their end and of the means to the end Secondly a thing is said to move or operate for an end as though moved or directed by another thereto as an arrow directed to the target by the archer who knows the end unknown to the arrow Wherefore as the movement of the arrow towards a definite end shows clearly that it is directed by someone with knowledge so the unvarying course of natural things which are without knowledge shows clearly that the world is governed by some reason Reply Obj two In all created things there is a stable element at least primary matter and something belonging to movement if under movement we include operation And things need governing as to both because even that which is stable since it is created from nothing would return to nothingness were it not sustained by a governing hand as will be explained later Q one hundred four A one Reply Obj three The natural necessity inherent in those beings which are determined to a particular thing is a kind of impression from God directing them to their end as the necessity whereby an arrow is moved so as to fly towards a certain point is an impression from the archer and not from the arrow But there is a difference inasmuch as that which creatures receive from God is their nature while that which natural things receive from man in addition to their nature is somewhat violent Wherefore as the violent necessity in the movement of the arrow shows the action of the archer so the natural necessity of things shows the government of Divine Providence SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred three Art two Whether the End of the Government of the World Is Something Outside the World Objection one It would seem that the end of the government of the world is not something existing outside the world For the end of the government of a thing is that whereto the thing governed is brought But that whereto a thing is brought is some good in the thing itself thus a sick man is brought back to health which is something good in him Therefore the end of government of things is some good not outside but within the things themselves Obj two Further the Philosopher says Ethic i one Some ends are an operation some are a work i e produced by an operation But nothing can be produced by the whole universe outside itself and operation exists in the agent Therefore nothing extrinsic can be the end of the government of things Obj three Further the good of the multitude seems to consist in order and peace which is the tranquillity of order as Augustine says De Civ Dei xix thirteen But the world is composed of a multitude of things Therefore the end of the government of the world is the peaceful order in things themselves Therefore the end of the government of the world is not an extrinsic good On the contrary It is written Prov sixteen four The Lord hath made all things for Himself But God is outside the entire order of the universe Therefore the end of all things is something extrinsic to them I answer that As the end of a thing corresponds to its beginning it is not possible to be ignorant of the end of things if we know their beginning Therefore since the beginning of all things is something outside the universe namely God it is clear from what has been expounded above Q forty four AA one two that we must conclude that the end of all things is some extrinsic good This can be proved by reason For it is clear that good has the nature of an end wherefore a particular end of anything consists in some particular good while the universal end of all things is the Universal Good Which is good of Itself by virtue of Its Essence Which is the very essence of goodness whereas a particular good is good by participation Now it is manifest that in the whole created universe there is not a good which is not such by participation Wherefore that good which is the end of the whole universe must be a good outside the universe Reply Obj one We may acquire some good in many ways first as a form existing in us such as health or knowledge secondly as something done by us as a builder attains his end by building a house thirdly as something good possessed or acquired by us as the buyer of a field attains his end when he enters into possession Wherefore nothing prevents something outside the universe being the good to which it is directed Reply Obj two The Philosopher is speaking of the ends of various arts for the end of some arts consists in the operation itself as the end of a harpist is to play the harp whereas the end of other arts consists in something produced as the end of a builder is not the act of building but the house he builds Now it may happen that something extrinsic is the end not only as made but also as possessed or acquired or even as represented as if we were to say that Hercules is the end of the statue made to represent him Therefore we may say that some good outside the whole universe is the end of the government of the universe as something possessed and represented for each thing tends to a participation thereof and to an assimilation thereto as far as is possible Reply Obj three A good existing in the universe namely the order of the universe is an end thereof this however is not its ultimate end but is ordered to the extrinsic good as to the end thus the order in an army is ordered to the general as stated in Metaph xii Did xi ten THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred three Art three Whether the World Is Governed by One Objection one It would seem that the world is not governed by one For we judge the cause by the effect Now we see in the government of the universe that things are not moved and do not operate uniformly but some contingently and some of necessity in variously different ways Therefore the world is not governed by one Obj two Further things which are governed by one do not act against each other except by the incapacity or unskillfulness of the ruler which cannot apply to God But created things agree not together and act against each other as is evident in the case of contraries Therefore the world is not governed by one Obj three Further in nature we always find what is the better But it is better that two should be together than one Eccles four nine Therefore the world is not governed by one but by many On the contrary We confess our belief in one God and one Lord according to the words of the Apostle one Cor eight six To us there is but one God the Father and one Lord and both of these pertain to government For to the Lord belongs dominion over subjects and the name of God is taken from Providence as stated above Q thirteen A eight Therefore the world is governed by one I answer that We must of necessity say that the world is governed by one For since the end of the government of the world is that which is essentially good which is the greatest good the government of the world must be the best kind of government Now the best government is the government by one The reason of this is that government is nothing but the directing of the things governed to the end which consists in some good But unity belongs to the idea of goodness as Boethius proves De Consol iii eleven from this that as all things desire good so do they desire unity without which they would cease to exist For a thing so far exists as it is one Whence we observe that things resist division as far as they can and the dissolution of a thing arises from defect therein Therefore the intention of a ruler over a multitude is unity or peace Now the proper cause of unity is one For it is clear that several cannot be the cause of unity or concord except so far as they are united Furthermore what is one in itself is a more apt and a better cause of unity than several things united Therefore a multitude is better governed by one than by several From this it follows that the government of the world being the best form of government must be by one This is expressed by the Philosopher Metaph xii Did xi ten Things refuse to be ill governed and multiplicity of authorities is a bad thing therefore there should be one ruler Reply Obj one Movement is the act of a thing moved caused by the mover Wherefore dissimilarity of movements is caused by diversity of things moved which diversity is essential to the perfection of the universe Q forty seven AA twelve Q forty eight A two and not by a diversity of governors Reply Obj two Although contraries do not agree with each other in their proximate ends nevertheless they agree in the ultimate end so far as they are included in the one order of the universe Reply Obj three If we consider individual goods then two are better than one But if we consider the essential good then no addition is possible FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred three Art four Whether the Effect of Government Is One or Many Objection one It would seem that there is but one effect of the government of the world and not many For the effect of government is that which is caused in the things governed This is one namely the good which consists in order as may be seen in the example of an army Therefore the government of the world has but one effect Obj two Further from one there naturally proceeds but one But the world is governed by one as we have proved A three Therefore also the effect of this government is but one Obj three Further if the effect of government is not one by reason of the unity of the Governor it must be many by reason of the many things governed But these are too numerous to be counted Therefore we cannot assign any definite number to the effects of government On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom xii God contains all and fills all by His providence and perfect goodness But government belongs to providence Therefore there are certain definite effects of the Divine government I answer that The effect of any action may be judged from its end because it is by action that the attainment of the end is effected Now the end of the government of the world is the essential good to the participation and similarity of which all things tend Consequently the effect of the government of the world may be taken in three ways First on the part of the end itself and in this way there is but one effect that is assimilation to the supreme good Secondly the effect of the government of the world may be considered on the part of those things by means of which the creature is made like to God Thus there are in general two effects of the government For the creature is assimilated to God in two things first with regard to this that God is good and so the creature becomes like Him by being good and secondly with regard to this that God is the cause of goodness in others and so the creature becomes like God by moving others to be good Wherefore there are two effects of government the preservation of things in their goodness and the moving of things to good Thirdly we may consider in the individual the effects of the government of the world and in this way they are without number Reply Obj one The order of the universe includes both the preservation of things created by God and their movement As regards these two things we find order among them inasmuch as one is better than another and one is moved by another From what has been said above we can gather the replies to the other two objections FIFTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred three Art five Whether All Things Are Subject to the Divine Government Objection one It would seem that not all things are subject to the Divine government For it is written Eccles nine eleven I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong nor bread to the wise nor riches to the learned nor favor to the skillful but time and chance in all But things subject to the Divine government are not ruled by chance Therefore those things which are under the sun are not subject to the Divine government Obj two Further the Apostle says one Cor nine nine God hath no care for oxen But he that governs has care for the things he governs Therefore all things are not subject to the Divine government Obj three Further what can govern itself needs not to be governed by another But the rational creature can govern itself since it is master of its own act and acts of itself and is not made to act by another which seems proper to things which are governed Therefore all things are not subject to the Divine government On the contrary Augustine says De Civ Dei v eleven Not only heaven and earth not only man and angel even the bowels of the lowest animal even the wing of the bird the flower of the plant the leaf of the tree hath God endowed with every fitting detail of their nature Therefore all things are subject to His government I answer that For the same reason is God the ruler of things as He is their cause because the same gives existence as gives perfection and this belongs to government Now God is the cause not indeed only of some particular kind of being but of the whole universal being as proved above Q forty four AA one two Wherefore as there can be nothing which is not created by God so there can be nothing which is not subject to His government This can also be proved from the nature of the end of government For a man s government extends over all those things which come under the end of his government Now the end of the Divine government is the Divine goodness as we have shown A two Wherefore as there can be nothing that is not ordered to the Divine goodness as its end as is clear from what we have said above Q forty four A four Q sixty five A two so it is impossible for anything to escape from the Divine government Foolish therefore was the opinion of those who said that the corruptible lower world or individual things or that even human affairs were not subject to the Divine government These are represented as saying God hath abandoned the earth Ezech nine nine Reply Obj one These things are said to be under the sun which are generated and corrupted according to the sun s movement In all such things we find chance not that everything is casual which occurs in such things but that in each one there is an element of chance And the very fact that an element of chance is found in those things proves that they are subject to government of some kind For unless corruptible things were governed by a higher being they would tend to nothing definite especially those which possess no kind of knowledge So nothing would happen unintentionally which constitutes the nature of chance Wherefore to show how things happen by chance and yet according to the ordering of a higher cause he does not say absolutely that he observes chance in all things but time and chance that is to say that defects may be found in these things according to some order of time Reply Obj two Government implies a certain change effected by the governor in the things governed Now every movement is the act of a movable thing caused by the moving principle as is laid down Phys iii three And every act is proportionate to that of which it is an act Consequently various movable things must be moved variously even as regards movement by one and the same mover Thus by the one art of the Divine governor various things are variously governed according to their variety Some according to their nature act of themselves having dominion over their actions and these are governed by God not only in this that they are moved by God Himself Who works in them interiorly but also in this that they are induced by Him to do good and to fly from evil by precepts and prohibitions rewards and punishments But irrational creatures which do not act but are acted upon are not thus governed by God Hence when the Apostle says that God hath no care for oxen he does not wholly withdraw them from the Divine government but only as regards the way in which rational creatures are governed Reply Obj three The rational creature governs itself by its intellect and will both of which require to be governed and perfected by the Divine intellect and will Therefore above the government whereby the rational creature governs itself as master of its own act it requires to be governed by God SIXTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred three Art six Whether all things are immediately governed by God Objection one It would seem that all things are governed by God immediately For Gregory of Nyssa Nemesius De Nat Hom reproves the opinion of Plato who divides providence into three parts The first he ascribes to the supreme god who watches over heavenly things and all universals the second providence he attributes to the secondary deities who go the round of the heavens to watch over generation and corruption while he ascribes a third providence to certain spirits who are guardians on earth of human actions Therefore it seems that all things are immediately governed by God Obj two Further it is better that a thing be done by one if possible than by many as the Philosopher says Phys viii six But God can by Himself govern all things without any intermediary cause Therefore it seems that He governs all things immediately Obj three Further in God nothing is defective or imperfect But it seems to be imperfect in a ruler to govern by means of others thus an earthly king by reason of his not being able to do everything himself and because he cannot be everywhere at the same time requires to govern by means of ministers Therefore God governs all things immediately On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iii four As the lower and grosser bodies are ruled in a certain orderly way by bodies of greater subtlety and power so all bodies are ruled by the rational spirit of life and the sinful and unfaithful spirit is ruled by the good and just spirit of life and this spirit by God Himself I answer that In government there are two things to be considered the design of government which is providence itself and the execution of the design As to the design of government God governs all things immediately whereas in its execution He governs some things by means of others The reason of this is that as God is the very essence of goodness so everything must be attributed to God in its highest degree of goodness Now the highest degree of goodness in any practical order design or knowledge and such is the design of government consists in knowing the individuals acted upon as the best physician is not the one who can only give his attention to general principles but who can consider the least details and so on in other things Therefore we must say that God has the design of the government of all things even of the very least But since things which are governed should be brought to perfection by government this government will be so much the better in the degree the things governed are brought to perfection Now it is a greater perfection for a thing to be good in itself and also the cause of goodness in others than only to be good in itself Therefore God so governs things that He makes some of them to be causes of others in government as a master who not only imparts knowledge to his pupils but gives also the faculty of teaching others Reply Obj one Plato s opinion is to be rejected because he held that God did not govern all things immediately even in the design of government this is clear from the fact that he divided providence which is the design of government into three parts Reply Obj two If God governed alone things would be deprived of the perfection of causality Wherefore all that is effected by many would not be accomplished by one Reply Obj three That an earthly king should have ministers to execute his laws is a sign not only of his being imperfect but also of his dignity because by the ordering of ministers the kingly power is brought into greater evidence SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred three Art seven Whether Anything Can Happen Outside the Order of the Divine Government Objection one It would seem possible that something may occur outside the order of the Divine government For Boethius says De Consol iii that God disposes all for good Therefore if nothing happens outside the order of the Divine government it would follow that no evil exists Obj two Further nothing that is in accordance with the pre ordination of a ruler occurs by chance Therefore if nothing occurs outside the order of the Divine government it follows that there is nothing fortuitous and casual Obj three Further the order of Divine Providence is certain and unchangeable because it is in accordance with the eternal design Therefore if nothing happens outside the order of the Divine government it follows that all things happen by necessity and nothing is contingent which is false Therefore it is possible for something to occur outside the order of the Divine government On the contrary It is written Esther thirteen nine O Lord Lord almighty King all things are in Thy power and there is none that can resist Thy will I answer that It is possible for an effect to result outside the order of some particular cause but not outside the order of the universal cause The reason of this is that no effect results outside the order of a particular cause except through some other impeding cause which other cause must itself be reduced to the first universal cause as indigestion may occur outside the order of the nutritive power by some such impediment as the coarseness of the food which again is to be ascribed to some other cause and so on till we come to the first universal cause Therefore as God is the first universal cause not of one genus only but of all being in general it is impossible for anything to occur outside the order of the Divine government but from the very fact that from one point of view something seems to evade the order of Divine providence considered in regard to one particular cause it must necessarily come back to that order as regards some other cause Reply Obj one There is nothing wholly evil in the world for evil is ever founded on good as shown above Q forty eight A three Therefore something is said to be evil through its escaping from the order of some particular good If it wholly escaped from the order of the Divine government it would wholly cease to exist Reply Obj two Things are said to be fortuitous as regards some particular cause from the order of which they escape But as to the order of Divine providence nothing in the world happens by chance as Augustine declares QQ eighty three qu twenty four Reply Obj three Certain effects are said to be contingent as compared to their proximate causes which may fail in their effects and not as though anything could happen entirely outside the order of Divine government The very fact that something occurs outside the order of some proximate cause is owing to some other cause itself subject to the Divine government EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred three Art eight Whether anything can resist the order of the Divine government Objection one It would seem possible that some resistance can be made to the order of the Divine government For it is written Isa three eight Their tongue and their devices are against the Lord Obj two Further a king does not justly punish those who do not rebel against his commands Therefore if no one rebelled against God s commands no one would be justly punished by God Obj three Further everything is subject to the order of the Divine government But some things oppose others Therefore some things rebel against the order of the Divine government On the contrary Boethius says De Consol iii There is nothing that can desire or is able to resist this sovereign good It is this sovereign good therefore that ruleth all mightily and ordereth all sweetly as is said Wis eight of Divine wisdom I answer that We may consider the order of Divine providence in two ways in general inasmuch as it proceeds from the governing cause of all and in particular inasmuch as it proceeds from some particular cause which executes the order of the Divine government Considered in the first way nothing can resist the order of the Divine government This can be proved in two ways firstly from the fact that the order of the Divine government is wholly directed to good and everything by its own operation and effort tends to good only for no one acts intending evil as Dionysius says Div Nom iv secondly from the fact that as we have said above A one ad three A five ad two every inclination of anything whether natural or voluntary is nothing but a kind of impression from the first mover as the inclination of the arrow towards a fixed point is nothing but an impulse received from the archer Wherefore every agent whether natural or free attains to its divinely appointed end as though of its own accord For this reason God is said to order all things sweetly Reply Obj one Some are said to think or speak or act against God not that they entirely resist the order of the Divine government for even the sinner intends the attainment of a certain good but because they resist some particular good which belongs to their nature or state Therefore they are justly punished by God Reply Obj two is clear from the above Reply Obj three From the fact that one thing opposes another it follows that some one thing can resist the order of a particular cause but not that order which depends on the universal cause of all things QUESTION one hundred four THE SPECIAL EFFECTS OF THE DIVINE GOVERNMENT In Four Articles We next consider the effects of the Divine government in particular concerning which four points of inquiry arise one Whether creatures need to be kept in existence by God two Whether they are immediately preserved by God three Whether God can reduce anything to nothingness four Whether anything is reduced to nothingness FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred four Art one Whether Creatures Need to Be Kept in Being by God Objection one It would seem that creatures do not need to be kept in being by God For what cannot not be does not need to be kept in being just as that which cannot depart does not need to be kept from departing But some creatures by their very nature cannot not be Therefore not all creatures need to be kept in being by God The middle proposition is proved thus That which is included in the nature of a thing is necessarily in that thing and its contrary cannot be in it thus a multiple of two must necessarily be even and cannot possibly be an odd number Now form brings being with itself because everything is actually in being so far as it has form But some creatures are subsistent forms as we have said of the angels Q fifty AA two five and thus to be is in them of themselves The same reasoning applies to those creatures whose matter is in potentiality to one form only as above explained of heavenly bodies Q sixty six A two Therefore such creatures as these have in their nature to be necessarily and cannot not be for there can be no potentiality to not being either in the form which has being of itself or in matter existing under a form which it cannot lose since it is not in potentiality to any other form Obj two Further God is more powerful than any created agent But a created agent even after ceasing to act can cause its effect to be preserved in being thus the house continues to stand after the builder has ceased to build and water remains hot for some time after the fire has ceased to heat Much more therefore can God cause His creature to be kept in being after He has ceased to create it Obj three Further nothing violent can occur except there be some active cause thereof But tendency to not being is unnatural and violent to any creature since all creatures naturally desire to be Therefore no creature can tend to not being except through some active cause of corruption Now there are creatures of such a nature that nothing can cause them to corrupt such are spiritual substances and heavenly bodies Therefore such creatures cannot tend to not being even if God were to withdraw His action Obj four Further if God keeps creatures in being this is done by some action Now every action of an agent if that action be efficacious produces something in the effect Therefore the preserving power of God must produce something in the creature But this is not so because this action does not give being to the creature since being is not given to that which already is nor does it add anything new to the creature because either God would not keep the creature in being continually or He would be continually adding something new to the creature either of which is unreasonable Therefore creatures are not kept in being by God On the contrary It is written Heb one three Upholding all things by the word of His power I answer that Both reason and faith bind us to say that creatures are kept in being by God To make this clear we must consider that a thing is preserved by another in two ways First indirectly and accidentally thus a person is said to preserve anything by removing the cause of its corruption as a man may be said to preserve a child whom he guards from falling into the fire In this way God preserves some things but not all for there are some things of such a nature that nothing can corrupt them so that it is not necessary to keep them from corruption Secondly a thing is said to preserve another per se and directly namely when what is preserved depends on the preserver in such a way that it cannot exist without it In this manner all creatures need to be preserved by God For the being of every creature depends on God so that not for a moment could it subsist but would fall into nothingness were it not kept in being by the operation of the Divine power as Gregory says Moral xvi This is made clear as follows Every effect depends on its cause so far as it is its cause But we must observe that an agent may be the cause of the becoming of its effect but not directly of its being This may be seen both in artificial and in natural beings for the builder causes the house in its becoming but he is not the direct cause of its being For it is clear that the being of the house is a result of its form which consists in the putting together and arrangement of the materials and results from the natural qualities of certain things Thus a cook dresses the food by applying the natural activity of fire thus a builder constructs a house by making use of cement stones and wood which are able to be put together in a certain order and to preserve it Therefore the being of a house depends on the nature of these materials just as its becoming depends on the action of the builder The same principle applies to natural things For if an agent is not the cause of a form as such neither will it be directly the cause of being which results from that form but it will be the cause of the effect in its becoming only Now it is clear that of two things in the same species one cannot directly cause the other s form as such since it would then be the cause of its own form which is essentially the same as the form of the other but it can be the cause of this form for as much as it is in matter in other words it may be the cause that this matter receives this form And this is to be the cause of becoming as when man begets man and fire causes fire Thus whenever a natural effect is such that it has an aptitude to receive from its active cause an impression specifically the same as in that active cause then the becoming of the effect but not its being depends on the agent Sometimes however the effect has not this aptitude to receive the impression of its cause in the same way as it exists in the agent as may be seen clearly in all agents which do not produce an effect of the same species as themselves thus the heavenly bodies cause the generation of inferior bodies which differ from them in species Such an agent can be the cause of a form as such and not merely as existing in this matter consequently it is not merely the cause of becoming but also the cause of being Therefore as the becoming of a thing cannot continue when that action of the agent ceases which causes the becoming of the effect so neither can the being of a thing continue after that action of the agent has ceased which is the cause of the effect not only in becoming but also in being This is why hot water retains heat after the cessation of the fire s action while on the contrary the air does not continue to be lit up even for a moment when the sun ceases to act upon it because water is a matter susceptive of the fire s heat in the same way as it exists in the fire Wherefore if it were to be reduced to the perfect form of fire it would retain that form always whereas if it has the form of fire imperfectly and inchoately the heat will remain for a time only by reason of the imperfect participation of the principle of heat On the other hand air is not of such a nature as to receive light in the same way as it exists in the sun which is the principle of light Therefore since it has not root in the air the light ceases with the action of the sun Now every creature may be compared to God as the air is to the sun which enlightens it For as the sun possesses light by its nature and as the air is enlightened by sharing the sun s nature so God alone is Being in virtue of His own Essence since His Essence is His existence whereas every creature has being by participation so that its essence is not its existence Therefore as Augustine says general ad lit iv twelve If the ruling power of God were withdrawn from His creatures their nature would at once cease and all nature would collapse In the same work general ad lit viii twelve he says As the air becomes light by the presence of the sun so is man enlightened by the presence of God and in His absence returns at once to darkness Reply Obj one Being naturally results from the form of a creature given the influence of the Divine action just as light results from the diaphanous nature of the air given the action of the sun Wherefore the potentiality to not being in spiritual creatures and heavenly bodies is rather something in God Who can withdraw His influence than in the form or matter of those creatures Reply Obj two God cannot grant to a creature to be preserved in being after the cessation of the Divine influence as neither can He make it not to have received its being from Himself For the creature needs to be preserved by God in so far as the being of an effect depends on the cause of its being So that there is no comparison with an agent that is not the cause of being but only of becoming Reply Obj three This argument holds in regard to that preservation which consists in the removal of corruption but all creatures do not need to be preserved thus as stated above Reply Obj four The preservation of things by God is a continuation of that action whereby He gives existence which action is without either motion or time so also the preservation of light in the air is by the continual influence of the sun SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred four Art two Whether God Preserves Every Creature Immediately Objection one It would seem that God preserves every creature immediately For God creates and preserves things by the same action as above stated A one ad four But God created all things immediately Therefore He preserves all things immediately Obj two Further a thing is nearer to itself than to another But it cannot be given to a creature to preserve itself much less therefore can it be given to a creature to preserve another Therefore God preserves all things without any intermediate cause preserving them Obj three Further an effect is kept in being by the cause not only of its becoming but also of its being But all created causes do not seem to cause their effects except in their becoming for they cause only by moving as above stated Q forty five A three Therefore they do not cause so as to keep their effects in being On the contrary A thing is kept in being by that which gives it being But God gives being by means of certain intermediate causes Therefore He also keeps things in being by means of certain causes I answer that As stated above A one a thing keeps another in being in two ways first indirectly and accidentally by removing or hindering the action of a corrupting cause secondly directly and per se by the fact that that on it depends the other s being as the being of the effect depends on the cause And in both ways a created thing keeps another in being For it is clear that even in corporeal things there are many causes which hinder the action of corrupting agents and for that reason are called preservatives just as salt preserves meat from putrefaction and in like manner with many other things It happens also that an effect depends on a creature as to its being For when we have a series of causes depending on one another it necessarily follows that while the effect depends first and principally on the first cause it also depends in a secondary way on all the middle causes Therefore the first cause is the principal cause of the preservation of the effect which is to be referred to the middle causes in a secondary way and all the more so as the middle cause is higher and nearer to the first cause For this reason even in things corporeal the preservation and continuation of things is ascribed to the higher causes thus the Philosopher says Metaph xii Did xi six that the first namely the diurnal movement is the cause of the continuation of things generated whereas the second movement which is from the zodiac is the cause of diversity owing to generation and corruption In like manner astrologers ascribe to Saturn the highest of the planets those things which are permanent and fixed So we conclude that God keeps certain things in being by means of certain causes Reply Obj one God created all things immediately but in the creation itself He established an order among things so that some depend on others by which they are preserved in being though He remains the principal cause of their preservation Reply Obj two Since an effect is preserved by its proper cause on which it depends just as no effect can be its own cause but can only produce another effect so no effect can be endowed with the power of self preservation but only with the power of preserving another Reply Obj three No created nature can be the cause of another as regards the latter acquiring a new form or disposition except by virtue of some change for the created nature acts always on something presupposed But after causing the form or disposition in the effect without any fresh change in the effect the cause preserves that form or disposition as in the air when it is lit up anew we must allow some change to have taken place while the preservation of the light is without any further change in the air due to the presence of the source of light THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred four Art three Whether God Can Annihilate Anything Objection one It would seem that God cannot annihilate anything For Augustine says QQ eighty three qu twenty one that God is not the cause of anything tending to non existence But He would be such a cause if He were to annihilate anything Therefore He cannot annihilate anything Obj two Further by His goodness God is the cause why things exist since as Augustine says De Doctr Christ i thirty two Because God is good we exist But God cannot cease to be good Therefore He cannot cause things to cease to exist which would be the case were He to annihilate anything Obj three Further if God were to annihilate anything it would be by His action But this cannot be because the term of every action is existence Hence even the action of a corrupting cause has its term in something generated for when one thing is generated another undergoes corruption Therefore God cannot annihilate anything On the contrary It is written Jer ten twenty four Correct me O Lord but yet with judgment and not in Thy fury lest Thou bring me to nothing I answer that Some have held that God in giving existence to creatures acted from natural necessity Were this true God could not annihilate anything since His nature cannot change But as we have said above Q nineteen A four such an opinion is entirely false and absolutely contrary to the Catholic faith which confesses that God created things of His own free will according to Ps one hundred thirty four six Whatsoever the Lord pleased He hath done Therefore that God gives existence to a creature depends on His will nor does He preserve things in existence otherwise than by continually pouring out existence into them as we have said Therefore just as before things existed God was free not to give them existence and not to make them so after they are made He is free not to continue their existence and thus they would cease to exist and this would be to annihilate them Reply Obj one Non existence has no direct cause for nothing is a cause except inasmuch as it has existence and a being essentially as such is a cause of something existing Therefore God cannot cause a thing to tend to non existence whereas a creature has this tendency of itself since it is produced from nothing But indirectly God can be the cause of things being reduced to non existence by withdrawing His action therefrom Reply Obj two God s goodness is the cause of things not as though by natural necessity because the Divine goodness does not depend on creatures but by His free will Wherefore as without prejudice to His goodness He might not have produced things into existence so without prejudice to His goodness He might not preserve things in existence Reply Obj three If God were to annihilate anything this would not imply an action on God s part but a mere cessation of His action FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred four Art four Whether Anything Is Annihilated Objection one It would seem that something is annihilated For the end corresponds to the beginning But in the beginning there was nothing but God Therefore all things must tend to this end that there shall be nothing but God Therefore creatures will be reduced to nothing Obj two Further every creature has a finite power But no finite power extends to the infinite Wherefore the Philosopher proves Phys viii ten that a finite power cannot move in infinite time Therefore a creature cannot last for an infinite duration and so at some time it will be reduced to nothing Obj three Further forms and accidents have no matter as part of themselves But at some time they cease to exist Therefore they are reduced to nothing On the contrary It is written Eccles three fourteen I have learned that all the works that God hath made continue for ever I answer that Some of those things which God does in creatures occur in accordance with the natural course of things others happen miraculously and not in accordance with the natural order as will be explained Q one hundred five A six Now whatever God wills to do according to the natural order of things may be observed from their nature but those things which occur miraculously are ordered for the manifestation of grace according to the Apostle To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit unto profit one Cor twelve seven and subsequently he mentions among others the working of miracles Now the nature of creatures shows that none of them is annihilated For either they are immaterial and therefore have no potentiality to non existence or they are material and then they continue to exist at least in matter which is incorruptible since it is the subject of generation and corruption Moreover the annihilation of things does not pertain to the manifestation of grace since rather the power and goodness of God are manifested by the preservation of things in existence Wherefore we must conclude by denying absolutely that anything at all will be annihilated Reply Obj one That things are brought into existence from a state of non existence clearly shows the power of Him Who made them but that they should be reduced to nothing would hinder that manifestation since the power of God is conspicuously shown in His preserving all things in existence according to the Apostle Upholding all things by the word of His power Heb one three Reply Obj two A creature s potentiality to existence is merely receptive the active power belongs to God Himself from Whom existence is derived Wherefore the infinite duration of things is a consequence of the infinity of the Divine power To some things however is given a determinate power of duration for a certain time so far as they may be hindered by some contrary agent from receiving the influx of existence which comes from Him Whom finite power cannot resist for an infinite but only for a fixed time So things which have no contrary although they have a finite power continue to exist for ever Reply Obj three Forms and accidents are not complete beings since they do not subsist but each one of them is something of a being for it is called a being because something is by it Yet so far as their mode of existence is concerned they are not entirely reduced to nothingness not that any part of them survives but that they remain in the potentiality of the matter or of the subject QUESTION one hundred five OF THE CHANGE OF CREATURES BY GOD In Eight Articles We now consider the second effect of the Divine government i e the change of creatures and first the change of creatures by God secondly the change of one creature by another Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry one Whether God can move immediately the matter to the form two Whether He can immediately move a body three Whether He can move the intellect four Whether He can move the will five Whether God works in every worker six Whether He can do anything outside the order imposed on things seven Whether all that God does is miraculous eight Of the diversity of miracles FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred five Art one Whether God Can Move the Matter Immediately to the Form Objection one It would seem that God cannot move the matter immediately to receive the form For as the Philosopher proves Metaph vii Did vi eight nothing can bring a form into any particular matter except that form which is in matter because like begets like But God is not a form in matter Therefore He cannot cause a form in matter Obj two Further any agent inclined to several effects will produce none of them unless it is determined to a particular one by some other cause for as the Philosopher says De Anima iii eleven a general assertion does not move the mind except by means of some particular apprehension But the Divine power is the universal cause of all things Therefore it cannot produce any particular form except by means of a particular agent Obj three As universal being depends on the first universal cause so determinate being depends on determinate particular causes as we have seen above Q one hundred four A two But the determinate being of a particular thing is from its own form Therefore the forms of things are produced by God only by means of particular causes On the contrary It is written general two seven God formed man of the slime of the earth I answer that God can move matter immediately to form because whatever is in passive potentiality can be reduced to act by the active power which extends over that potentiality Therefore since the Divine power extends over matter as produced by God it can be reduced to act by the Divine power and this is what is meant by matter being moved to a form for a form is nothing else but the act of matter Reply Obj one An effect is assimilated to the active cause in two ways First according to the same species as man is generated by man and fire by fire Secondly by being virtually contained in the cause as the form of the effect is virtually contained in its cause thus animals produced by putrefaction and plants and minerals are like the sun and stars by whose power they are produced In this way the effect is like its active cause as regards all that over which the power of that cause extends Now the power of God extends to both matter and form as we have said above Q fourteen A two Q forty four A two wherefore if a composite thing be produced it is likened to God by way of a virtual inclusion or it is likened to the composite generator by a likeness of species Therefore just as the composite generator can move matter to a form by generating a composite thing like itself so also can God But no other form not existing in matter can do this because the power of no other separate substance extends over matter Hence angels and demons operate on visible matter not by imprinting forms in matter but by making use of corporeal seeds Reply Obj two This argument would hold if God were to act of natural necessity But since He acts by His will and intellect which knows the particular and not only the universal natures of all forms it follows that He can determinately imprint this or that form on matter Reply Obj three The fact that secondary causes are ordered to determinate effects is due to God wherefore since God ordains other causes to certain effects He can also produce certain effects by Himself without any other cause SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred five Art two Whether God Can Move a Body Immediately Objection one It would seem that God cannot move a body immediately For as the mover and the moved must exist simultaneously as the Philosopher says Phys vii two it follows that there must be some contact between the mover and moved But there can be no contact between God and a body for Dionysius says Div Nom one There is no contact with God Therefore God cannot move a body immediately Obj two Further God is the mover unmoved But such also is the desirable object when apprehended Therefore God moves as the object of desire and apprehension But He cannot be apprehended except by the intellect which is neither a body nor a corporeal power Therefore God cannot move a body immediately Obj three Further the Philosopher proves Phys viii ten that an infinite power moves instantaneously But it is impossible for a body to be moved in one instant for since every movement is between opposites it follows that two opposites would exist at once in the same subject which is impossible Therefore a body cannot be moved immediately by an infinite power But God s power is infinite as we have explained Q twenty five A two Therefore God cannot move a body immediately On the contrary God produced the works of the six days immediately among which is included the movements of bodies as is clear from general one nine Let the waters be gathered together into one place Therefore God alone can move a body immediately I answer that It is erroneous to say that God cannot Himself produce all the determinate effects which are produced by any created cause Wherefore since bodies are moved immediately by created causes we cannot possibly doubt that God can move immediately any bodies whatever This indeed follows from what is above stated A one For every movement of any body whatever either results from a form as the movements of things heavy and light result from the form which they have from their generating cause for which reason the generator is called the mover or else tends to a form as heating tends to the form of heat Now it belongs to the same cause to imprint a form to dispose to that form and to give the movement which results from that form for fire not only generates fire but it also heats and moves things upwards Therefore as God can imprint form immediately in matter it follows that He can move any body whatever in respect of any movement whatever Reply Obj one There are two kinds of contact corporeal contact when two bodies touch each other and virtual contact as the cause of sadness is said to touch the one made sad According to the first kind of contact God as being incorporeal neither touches nor is touched but according to virtual contact He touches creatures by moving them but He is not touched because the natural power of no creature can reach up to Him Thus did Dionysius understand the words There is no contact with God that is so that God Himself be touched Reply Obj two God moves as the object of desire and apprehension but it does not follow that He always moves as being desired and apprehended by that which is moved but as being desired and known by Himself for He does all things for His own goodness Reply Obj three The Philosopher Phys viii ten intends to prove that the power of the first mover is not a power of the first mover of bulk by the following argument The power of the first mover is infinite which he proves from the fact that the first mover can move in infinite time Now an infinite power if it were a power of bulk would move without time which is impossible therefore the infinite power of the first mover must be in something which is not measured by its bulk Whence it is clear that for a body to be moved without time can only be the result of an infinite power The reason is that every power of bulk moves in its entirety since it moves by the necessity of its nature But an infinite power surpasses out of all proportion any finite power Now the greater the power of the mover the greater is the velocity of the movement Therefore since a finite power moves in a determinate time it follows that an infinite power does not move in any time for between one time and any other time there is some proportion On the other hand a power which is not in bulk is the power of an intelligent being which operates in its effects according to what is fitting to them and therefore since it cannot be fitting for a body to be moved without time it does not follow that it moves without time THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred five Art three Whether God Moves the Created Intellect Immediately Objection one It would seem that God does not immediately move the created intellect For the action of the intellect is governed by its own subject since it does not pass into external matter as stated in Metaph ix Did viii eight But the action of what is moved by another does not proceed from that wherein it is but from the mover Therefore the intellect is not moved by another and so apparently God cannot move the created intellect Obj two Further anything which in itself is a sufficient principle of movement is not moved by another But the movement of the intellect is its act of understanding in the sense in which we say that to understand or to feel is a kind of movement as the Philosopher says De Anima iii seven But the intellectual light which is natural to the soul is a sufficient principle of understanding Therefore it is not moved by another Obj three Further as the senses are moved by the sensible so the intellect is moved by the intelligible But God is not intelligible to us and exceeds the capacity of our intellect Therefore God cannot move our intellect On the contrary The teacher moves the intellect of the one taught But it is written Ps ninety three ten that God teaches man knowledge Therefore God moves the human intellect I answer that As in corporeal movement that is called the mover which gives the form that is the principle of movement so that is said to move the intellect which is the cause of the form that is the principle of the intellectual operation called the movement of the intellect Now there is a twofold principle of intellectual operation in the intelligent being one which is the intellectual power itself which principle exists in the one who understands in potentiality while the other is the principle of actual understanding namely the likeness of the thing understood in the one who understands So a thing is said to move the intellect whether it gives to him who understands the power of understanding or impresses on him the likeness of the thing understood Now God moves the created intellect in both ways For He is the First immaterial Being and as intellectuality is a result of immateriality it follows that He is the First intelligent Being Therefore since in each order the first is the cause of all that follows we must conclude that from Him proceeds all intellectual power In like manner since He is the First Being and all other beings pre exist in Him as in their First Cause it follows that they exist intelligibly in Him after the mode of His own Nature For as the intelligible types of everything exist first of all in God and are derived from Him by other intellects in order that these may actually understand so also are they derived by creatures that they may subsist Therefore God so moves the created intellect inasmuch as He gives it the intellectual power whether natural or superadded and impresses on the created intellect the intelligible species and maintains and preserves both power and species in existence Reply Obj one The intellectual operation is performed by the intellect in which it exists as by a secondary cause but it proceeds from God as from its first cause For by Him the power to understand is given to the one who understands Reply Obj two The intellectual light together with the likeness of the thing understood is a sufficient principle of understanding but it is a secondary principle and depends upon the First Principle Reply Obj three The intelligible object moves our human intellect so far as in a way it impresses on it its own likeness by means of which the intellect is able to understand it But the likenesses which God impresses on the created intellect are not sufficient to enable the created intellect to understand Him through His Essence as we have seen above Q twelve A two Q fifty six A three Hence He moves the created intellect and yet He cannot be intelligible to it as we have explained Q twelve A four FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred five Art four Whether God Can Move the Created Will Objection one It would seem that God cannot move the created will For whatever is moved from without is forced But the will cannot be forced Therefore it is not moved from without and therefore cannot be moved by God Obj two Further God cannot make two contradictories to be true at the same time But this would follow if He moved the will for to be voluntarily moved means to be moved from within and not by another Therefore God cannot move the will Obj three Further movement is attributed to the mover rather than to the one moved wherefore homicide is not ascribed to the stone but to the thrower Therefore if God moves the will it follows that voluntary actions are not imputed to man for reward or blame But this is false Therefore God does not move the will On the contrary It is written Phil two thirteen It is God who worketh in us Vulgate you both to will and to accomplish I answer that As the intellect is moved by the object and by the Giver of the power of intelligence as stated above A three so is the will moved by its object which is good and by Him who creates the power of willing Now the will can be moved by good as its object but by God alone sufficiently and efficaciously For nothing can move a movable thing sufficiently unless the active power of the mover surpasses or at least equals the potentiality of the thing movable Now the potentiality of the will extends to the universal good for its object is the universal good just as the object of the intellect is the universal being But every created good is some particular good God alone is the universal good Whereas He alone fills the capacity of the will and moves it sufficiently as its object In like manner the power of willing is caused by God alone For to will is nothing but to be inclined towards the object of the will which is universal good But to incline towards the universal good belongs to the First Mover to Whom the ultimate end is proportionate just as in human affairs to him that presides over the community belongs the directing of his subjects to the common weal Wherefore in both ways it belongs to God to move the will but especially in the second way by an interior inclination of the will Reply Obj one A thing moved by another is forced if moved against its natural inclination but if it is moved by another giving to it the proper natural inclination it is not forced as when a heavy body is made to move downwards by that which produced it then it is not forced In like manner God while moving the will does not force it because He gives the will its own natural inclination Reply Obj two To be moved voluntarily is to be moved from within that is by an interior principle yet this interior principle may be caused by an exterior principle and so to be moved from within is not repugnant to being moved by another Reply Obj three If the will were so moved by another as in no way to be moved from within itself the act of the will would not be imputed for reward or blame But since its being moved by another does not prevent its being moved from within itself as we have stated ad two it does not thereby forfeit the motive for merit or demerit FIFTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred five Art five Whether God Works in Every Agent Objection one It would seem that God does not work in every agent For we must not attribute any insufficiency to God If therefore God works in every agent He works sufficiently in each one Hence it would be superfluous for the created agent to work at all Obj two Further the same work cannot proceed at the same time from two sources as neither can one and the same movement belong to two movable things Therefore if the creature s operation is from God operating in the creature it cannot at the same time proceed from the creature and so no creature works at all Obj three Further the maker is the cause of the operation of the thing made as giving it the form whereby it operates Therefore if God is the cause of the operation of things made by Him this would be inasmuch as He gives them the power of operating But this is in the beginning when He makes them Thus it seems that God does not operate any further in the operating creature On the contrary It is written Isa twenty six twelve Lord Thou hast wrought all our works in Vulg for us I answer that Some have understood God to work in every agent in such a way that no created power has any effect in things but that God alone is the ultimate cause of everything wrought for instance that it is not fire that gives heat but God in the fire and so forth But this is impossible First because the order of cause and effect would be taken away from created things and this would imply lack of power in the Creator for it is due to the power of the cause that it bestows active power on its effect Secondly because the active powers which are seen to exist in things would be bestowed on things to no purpose if these wrought nothing through them Indeed all things created would seem in a way to be purposeless if they lacked an operation proper to them since the purpose of everything is its operation For the less perfect is always for the sake of the more perfect and consequently as the matter is for the sake of the form so the form which is the first act is for the sake of its operation which is the second act and thus operation is the end of the creature We must therefore understand that God works in things in such a manner that things have their proper operation In order to make this clear we must observe that as there are few kinds of causes matter is not a principle of action but is the subject that receives the effect of action On the other hand the end the agent and the form are principles of action but in a certain order For the first principle of action is the end which moves the agent the second is the agent the third is the form of that which the agent applies to action although the agent also acts through its own form as may be clearly seen in things made by art For the craftsman is moved to action by the end which is the thing wrought for instance a chest or a bed and applies to action the axe which cuts through its being sharp Thus then does God work in every worker according to these three things First as an end For since every operation is for the sake of some good real or apparent and nothing is good either really or apparently except in as far as it participates in a likeness to the Supreme Good which is God it follows that God Himself is the cause of every operation as its end Again it is to be observed that where there are several agents in order the second always acts in virtue of the first for the first agent moves the second to act And thus all agents act in virtue of God Himself and therefore He is the cause of action in every agent Thirdly we must observe that God not only moves things to operate as it were applying their forms and powers to operation just as the workman applies the axe to cut who nevertheless at times does not give the axe its form but He also gives created agents their forms and preserves them in being Therefore He is the cause of action not only by giving the form which is the principle of action as the generator is said to be the cause of movement in things heavy and light but also as preserving the forms and powers of things just as the sun is said to be the cause of the manifestation of colors inasmuch as it gives and preserves the light by which colors are made manifest And since the form of a thing is within the thing and all the more as it approaches nearer to the First and Universal Cause and because in all things God Himself is properly the cause of universal being which is innermost in all things it follows that in all things God works intimately For this reason in Holy Scripture the operations of nature are attributed to God as operating in nature according to Job ten eleven Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh Thou hast put me together with bones and sinews Reply Obj one God works sufficiently in things as First Agent but it does not follow from this that the operation of secondary agents is superfluous Reply Obj two One action does not proceed from two agents of the same order But nothing hinders the same action from proceeding from a primary and a secondary agent Reply Obj three God not only gives things their form but He also preserves them in existence and applies them to act and is moreover the end of every action as above explained SIXTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred five Art six Whether God Can Do Anything Outside the Established Order of Nature Objection one It would seem that God cannot do anything outside the established order of nature For Augustine Contra Faust xxvi three says God the Maker and Creator of each nature does nothing against nature But that which is outside the natural order seems to be against nature Therefore God can do nothing outside the natural order Obj two Further as the order of justice is from God so is the order of nature But God cannot do anything outside the order of justice for then He would do something unjust Therefore He cannot do anything outside the order of nature Obj three Further God established the order of nature Therefore it God does anything outside the order of nature it would seem that He is changeable which cannot be said On the contrary Augustine says Contra Faust xxvi three God sometimes does things which are contrary to the ordinary course of nature I answer that From each cause there results a certain order to its effects since every cause is a principle and so according to the multiplicity of causes there results a multiplicity of orders subjected one to the other as cause is subjected to cause Wherefore a higher cause is not subjected to a cause of a lower order but conversely An example of this may be seen in human affairs On the father of a family depends the order of the household which order is contained in the order of the city which order again depends on the ruler of the city while this last order depends on that of the king by whom the whole kingdom is ordered If therefore we consider the order of things depending on the first cause God cannot do anything against this order for if He did so He would act against His foreknowledge or His will or His goodness But if we consider the order of things depending on any secondary cause thus God can do something outside such order for He is not subject to the order of secondary causes but on the contrary this order is subject to Him as proceeding from Him not by a natural necessity but by the choice of His own will for He could have created another order of things Wherefore God can do something outside this order created by Him when He chooses for instance by producing the effects of secondary causes without them or by producing certain effects to which secondary causes do not extend So Augustine says Contra Faust xxvi three God acts against the wonted course of nature but by no means does He act against the supreme law because He does not act against Himself Reply Obj one In natural things something may happen outside this natural order in two ways It may happen by the action of an agent which did not give them their natural inclination as for example when a man moves a heavy body upwards which does not owe to him its natural inclination to move downwards and that would be against nature It may also happen by the action of the agent on whom the natural inclination depends and this is not against nature as is clear in the ebb and flow of the tide which is not against nature although it is against the natural movement of water in a downward direction for it is owing to the influence of a heavenly body on which the natural inclination of lower bodies depends Therefore since the order of nature is given to things by God if He does anything outside this order it is not against nature Wherefore Augustine says Contra Faust xxvi three That is natural to each thing which is caused by Him from Whom is all mode number and order in nature Reply Obj two The order of justice arises by relation to the First Cause Who is the rule of all justice and therefore God can do nothing against such order Reply Obj three God fixed a certain order in things in such a way that at the same time He reserved to Himself whatever he intended to do otherwise than by a particular cause So when He acts outside this order He does not change SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred five Art seven Whether Whatever God Does Outside the Natural Order Is Miraculous Objection one It would seem that not everything which God does outside the natural order of things is miraculous For the creation of the world and of souls and the justification of the unrighteous are done by God outside the natural order as not being accomplished by the action of any natural cause Yet these things are not called miracles Therefore not everything that God does outside the natural order is a miracle Obj two Further a miracle is something difficult which seldom occurs surpassing the faculty of nature and going so far beyond our hopes as to compel our astonishment saint Augustine De utilitate credendi xvi But some things outside the order of nature are not arduous for they occur in small things such as the recovery and healing of the sick Nor are they of rare occurrence since they happen frequently as when the sick were placed in the streets to be healed by the shadow of Peter Acts five fifteen Nor do they surpass the faculty of nature as when people are cured of a fever Nor are they beyond our hopes since we all hope for the resurrection of the dead which nevertheless will be outside the course of nature Therefore not all things are outside the course of nature are miraculous Obj three Further the word miracle is derived from admiration Now admiration concerns things manifest to the senses But sometimes things happen outside the order of nature which are not manifest to the senses as when the Apostles were endowed with knowledge without studying or being taught Therefore not everything that occurs outside the order of nature is miraculous On the contrary Augustine says Contra Faust xxvi three Where God does anything against that order of nature which we know and are accustomed to observe we call it a miracle I answer that The word miracle is derived from admiration which arises when an effect is manifest whereas its cause is hidden as when a man sees an eclipse without knowing its cause as the Philosopher says in the beginning of his Metaphysics Now the cause of a manifest effect may be known to one but unknown to others Wherefore a thing is wonderful to one man and not at all to others as an eclipse is to a rustic but not to an astronomer Now a miracle is so called as being full of wonder as having a cause absolutely hidden from all and this cause is God Wherefore those things which God does outside those causes which we know are called miracles Reply Obj one Creation and the justification of the unrighteous though done by God alone are not properly speaking miracles because they are not of a nature to proceed from any other cause so they do not occur outside the order of nature since they do not belong to that order Reply Obj two An arduous thing is called a miracle not on account of the excellence of the thing wherein it is done but because it surpasses the faculty of nature likewise a thing is called unusual not because it does not often happen but because it is outside the usual natural course of things Furthermore a thing is said to be above the faculty of nature not only by reason of the substance of the thing done but also on account of the manner and order in which it is done Again a miracle is said to go beyond the hope of nature not above the hope of grace which hope comes from faith whereby we believe in the future resurrection Reply Obj three The knowledge of the Apostles although not manifest in itself yet was made manifest in its effect from which it was shown to be wonderful EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred five Art eight Whether One Miracle Is Greater Than Another Objection one It would seem that one miracle is not greater than another For Augustine says Epist ad Volusian cxxxvii In miraculous deeds the whole measure of the deed is the power of the doer But by the same power of God all miracles are done Therefore one miracle is not greater than another Obj two Further the power of God is infinite But the infinite exceeds the finite beyond all proportion and therefore no more reason exists to wonder at one effect thereof than at another Therefore one miracle is not greater than another On the contrary The Lord says speaking of miraculous works John fourteen twelve The works that I do he also shall do and greater than these shall he do I answer that Nothing is called a miracle by comparison with the Divine Power because no action is of any account compared with the power of God according to Isa forty fifteen Behold the Gentiles are as a drop from a bucket and are counted as the smallest grain of a balance But a thing is called a miracle by comparison with the power of nature which it surpasses So the more the power of nature is surpassed the greater the miracle Now the power of nature is surpassed in three ways firstly in the substance of the deed for instance if two bodies occupy the same place or if the sun goes backwards or if a human body is glorified such things nature is absolutely unable to do and these hold the highest rank among miracles Secondly a thing surpasses the power of nature not in the deed but in that wherein it is done as the raising of the dead and giving sight to the blind and the like for nature can give life but not to the dead and such hold the second rank in miracles Thirdly a thing surpasses nature s power in the measure and order in which it is done as when a man is cured of a fever suddenly without treatment or the usual process of nature or as when the air is suddenly condensed into rain by Divine power without a natural cause as occurred at the prayers of Samuel and Elias and these hold the lowest place in miracles Moreover each of these kinds has various degrees according to the different ways in which the power of nature is surpassed From this is clear how to reply to the objections arguing as they do from the Divine power QUESTION one hundred six HOW ONE CREATURE MOVES ANOTHER In Four Articles We next consider how one creature moves another This consideration will be threefold one How the angels move who are purely spiritual creatures two How bodies move three How man moves who is composed of a spiritual and a corporeal nature Concerning the first point there are three things to be considered one How an angel acts on an angel two How an angel acts on a corporeal nature three How an angel acts on man The first of these raises the question of the enlightenment and speech of the angels and of their mutual coordination both of the good and of the bad angels Concerning their enlightenment there are four points of inquiry one Whether one angel moves the intellect of another by enlightenment two Whether one angel moves the will of another three Whether an inferior angel can enlighten a superior angel four Whether a superior angel enlightens an inferior angel in all that he knows himself FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred six Art one Whether One Angel Enlightens Another Objection one It would seem that one angel does not enlighten another For the angels possess now the same beatitude which we hope to obtain But one man will not then enlighten another according to Jer thirty one thirty four They shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother Therefore neither does an angel enlighten another now Obj two Further light in the angels is threefold of nature of grace and of glory But an angel is enlightened in the light of nature by the Creator in the light of grace by the Justifier in the light of glory by the Beatifier all of which comes from God Therefore one angel does not enlighten another Obj three Further light is a form in the mind But the rational mind is informed by God alone without created intervention as Augustine says QQ eighty three qu fifty one Therefore one angel does not enlighten the mind of another On the contrary Dionysius says Coel Hier viii that the angels of the second hierarchy are cleansed enlightened and perfected by the angels of the first hierarchy I answer that One angel enlightens another To make this clear we must observe that intellectual light is nothing else than a manifestation of truth according to Eph five thirteen All that is made manifest is light Hence to enlighten means nothing else but to communicate to others the manifestation of the known truth according to the Apostle Eph three eight To me the least of all the saints is given this grace to enlighten all men that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God Therefore one angel is said to enlighten another by manifesting the truth which he knows himself Hence Dionysius says Coel Hier vii Theologians plainly show that the orders of the heavenly beings are taught Divine science by the higher minds Now since two things concur in the intellectual operation as we have said Q one hundred five A three namely the intellectual power and the likeness of the thing understood in both of these one angel can notify the known truth to another First by strengthening his intellectual power for just as the power of an imperfect body is strengthened by the neighborhood of a more perfect body for instance the less hot is made hotter by the presence of what is hotter so the intellectual power of an inferior angel is strengthened by the superior angel turning to him since in spiritual things for one thing to turn to another corresponds to neighborhood in corporeal things Secondly one angel manifests the truth to another as regards the likeness of the thing understood For the superior angel receives the knowledge of truth by a kind of universal conception to receive which the inferior angel s intellect is not sufficiently powerful for it is natural to him to receive truth in a more particular manner Therefore the superior angel distinguishes in a way the truth which he conceives universally so that it can be grasped by the inferior angel and thus he proposes it to his knowledge Thus it is with us that the teacher in order to adapt himself to others divides into many points the knowledge which he possesses in the universal This is thus expressed by Dionysius Coel Hier xv Every intellectual substance with provident power divides and multiplies the uniform knowledge bestowed on it by one nearer to God so as to lead its inferiors upwards by analogy Reply Obj one All the angels both inferior and superior see the Essence of God immediately and in this respect one does not teach another It is of this truth that the prophet speaks wherefore he adds They shall teach no more every man his brother saying Know the Lord for all shall know Me from the least of them even to the greatest But all the types of the Divine works which are known in God as in their cause God knows in Himself because He comprehends Himself but of others who see God each one knows the more types the more perfectly he sees God Hence a superior angel knows more about the types of the Divine works than an inferior angel and concerning these the former enlightens the latter and as to this Dionysius says Div Nom iv that the angels are enlightened by the types of existing things Reply Obj two An angel does not enlighten another by giving him the light of nature grace or glory but by strengthening his natural light and by manifesting to him the truth concerning the state of nature of grace and of glory as explained above Reply Obj three The rational mind is formed immediately by God either as the image from the exemplar forasmuch as it is made to the image of God alone or as the subject by the ultimate perfecting form for the created mind is always considered to be unformed except it adhere to the first truth while the other kinds of enlightenment that proceed from man or angel are as it were dispositions to this ultimate form SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred six Art two Whether one angel moves another angel s will Objection one It would seem that one angel can move another angel s will Because according to Dionysius quoted above A one as one angel enlightens another so does he cleanse and perfect another But cleansing and perfecting seem to belong to the will for the former seems to point to the stain of sin which appertains to will while to be perfected is to obtain an end which is the object of the will Therefore an angel can move another angel s will Obj two Further as Dionysius says Coel Hier vii The names of the angels designate their properties Now the Seraphim are so called because they kindle or give heat and this is by love which belongs to the will Therefore one angel moves another angel s will Obj three Further the Philosopher says De Anima iii eleven that the higher appetite moves the lower But as the intellect of the superior angel is higher so also is his will It seems therefore that the superior angel can change the will of another angel On the contrary To him it belongs to change the will to whom it belongs to bestow righteousness for righteousness is the rightness of the will But God alone bestows righteousness Therefore one angel cannot change another angel s will I answer that As was said above Q one hundred five A four the will is changed in two ways on the part of the object and on the part of the power On the part of the object both the good itself which is the object of the will moves the will as the appetible moves the appetite and he who points out the object as for instance one who proves something to be good But as we have said above Q one hundred five A four other goods in a measure incline the will yet nothing sufficiently moves the will save the universal good and that is God And this good He alone shows that it may be seen by the blessed Who when Moses asked Show me Thy glory answered I will show thee all good Ex thirty three eighteen nineteen Therefore an angel does not move the will sufficiently either as the object or as showing the object But he inclines the will as something lovable and as manifesting some created good ordered to God s goodness And thus he can incline the will to the love of the creature or of God by way of persuasion But on the part of the power the will cannot be moved at all save by God For the operation of the will is a certain inclination of the willer to the thing willed And He alone can change this inclination Who bestowed on the creature the power to will just as that agent alone can change the natural inclination which can give the power to which follows that natural inclination Now God alone gave to the creature the power to will because He alone is the author of the intellectual nature Therefore an angel cannot move another angel s will Reply Obj one Cleansing and perfecting are to be understood according to the mode of enlightenment And since God enlightens by changing the intellect and will He cleanses by removing defects of intellect and will and perfects unto the end of the intellect and will But the enlightenment caused by an angel concerns the intellect as explained above A one therefore an angel is to be understood as cleansing from the defect of nescience in the intellect and as perfecting unto the consummate end of the intellect and this is the knowledge of truth Thus Dionysius says Eccl Hier vi that in the heavenly hierarchy the chastening of the inferior essence is an enlightening of things unknown that leads them to more perfect knowledge For instance we might say that corporeal sight is cleansed by the removal of darkness enlightened by the diffusion of light and perfected by being brought to the perception of the colored object Reply Obj two One angel can induce another to love God by persuasion as explained above Reply Obj three The Philosopher speaks of the lower sensitive appetite which can be moved by the superior intellectual appetite because it belongs to the same nature of the soul and because the inferior appetite is a power in a corporeal organ But this does not apply to the angels THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred six Art three Whether an Inferior Angel Can Enlighten a Superior Angel Objection one It would seem that an inferior angel can enlighten a superior angel For the ecclesiastical hierarchy is derived from and represents the heavenly hierarchy and hence the heavenly Jerusalem is called our mother Gal four twenty six But in the Church even superiors are enlightened and taught by their inferiors as the Apostle says one Cor fourteen thirty one You may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be exhorted Therefore likewise in the heavenly hierarchy the superiors can be enlightened by inferiors Obj two Further as the order of corporeal substances depends on the will of God so also does the order of spiritual substances But as was said above Q one hundred five A six God sometimes acts outside the order of corporeal substances Therefore He also sometimes acts outside the order of spiritual substances by enlightening inferior otherwise than through their superiors Therefore in that way the inferiors enlightened by God can enlighten superiors Obj three Further one angel enlightens the other to whom he turns as was above explained A one But since this turning to another is voluntary the highest angel can turn to the lowest passing over the others Therefore he can enlighten him immediately and thus the latter can enlighten his superiors On the contrary Dionysius says that this is the Divine unalterable law that inferior things are led to God by the superior Coel Hier iv Eccl Hier v I answer that The inferior angels never enlighten the superior but are always enlightened by them The reason is because as above explained Q one hundred five A six one order is under another as cause is under cause and hence as cause is ordered to cause so is order to order Therefore there is no incongruity if sometimes anything is done outside the order of the inferior cause to be ordered to the superior cause as in human affairs the command of the president is passed over from obedience to the prince So it happens that God works miraculously outside the order of corporeal nature that men may be ordered to the knowledge of Him But the passing over of the order that belongs to spiritual substances in no way belongs to the ordering of men to God since the angelic operations are not made known to us as are the operations of sensible bodies Thus the order which belongs to spiritual substances is never passed over by God so that the inferiors are always moved by the superior and not conversely Reply Obj one The ecclesiastical hierarchy imitates the heavenly in some degree but not by a perfect likeness For in the heavenly hierarchy the perfection of the order is in proportion to its nearness to God so that those who are the nearer to God are the more sublime in grade and more clear in knowledge and on that account the superiors are never enlightened by the inferiors whereas in the ecclesiastical hierarchy sometimes those who are the nearer to God in sanctity are in the lowest grade and are not conspicuous for science and some also are eminent in one kind of science and fail in another and on that account superiors may be taught by inferiors Reply Obj two As above explained there is no similarity between what God does outside the order of corporeal nature and that of spiritual nature Hence the argument does not hold Reply Obj three An angel turns voluntarily to enlighten another angel but the angel s will is ever regulated by the Divine law which made the order in the angels FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred six Art four Whether the Superior Angel Enlightens the Inferior As Regards All He Himself Knows Objection one It would seem that the superior angel does not enlighten the inferior concerning all he himself knows For Dionysius says Coel Hier xii that the superior angels have a more universal knowledge and the inferior a more particular and individual knowledge But more is contained under a universal knowledge than under a particular knowledge Therefore not all that the superior angels know is known by the inferior through these being enlightened by the former Obj two Further the Master of the Sentences ii D eleven says that the superior angels had long known the Mystery of the Incarnation whereas the inferior angels did not know it until it was accomplished Thus we find that on some of the angels inquiring as it were in ignorance Who is this King of glory other angels who knew answered The Lord of Hosts He is the King of glory as Dionysius expounds Coel Hier vii But this would not apply if the superior angels enlightened the inferior concerning all they know themselves Therefore they do not do so Obj three Further if the superior angels enlighten the inferior about all they know nothing that the superior angels know would be unknown to the inferior angels Therefore the superior angels could communicate nothing more to the inferior which appears open to objection Therefore the superior angels enlighten the inferior in all things On the contrary Gregory Peter Lombard Sent ii D ix Cf Gregory Hom xxxiv in Ev says In that heavenly country though there are some excellent gifts yet nothing is held individually And Dionysius says Each heavenly essence communicates to the inferior the gift derived from the superior Coel Hier xv as quoted above A one I answer that Every creature participates in the Divine goodness so as to diffuse the good it possesses to others for it is of the nature of good to communicate itself to others Hence also corporeal agents give their likeness to others so far as they can So the more an agent is established in the share of the Divine goodness so much the more does it strive to transmit its perfections to others as far as possible Hence the Blessed Peter admonishes those who by grace share in the Divine goodness saying As every man hath received grace ministering the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God one Pet four ten Much more therefore do the holy angels who enjoy the plenitude of participation of the Divine goodness impart the same to those below them Nevertheless this gift is not received so excellently by the inferior as by the superior angels and therefore the superior ever remain in a higher order and have a more perfect knowledge as the master understands the same thing better than the pupil who learns from him Reply Obj one The knowledge of the superior angels is said to be more universal as regards the more eminent mode of knowledge Reply Obj two The Master s words are not to be understood as if the inferior angels were entirely ignorant of the Mystery of the Incarnation but that they did not know it as fully as the superior angels and that they progressed in the knowledge of it afterwards when the Mystery was accomplished Reply Obj three Till the Judgment Day some new things are always being revealed by God to the highest angels concerning the course of the world and especially the salvation of the elect Hence there is always something for the superior angels to make known to the inferior QUESTION one hundred seven THE SPEECH OF THE ANGELS In Five Articles We next consider the speech of the angels Here there are five points of inquiry one Whether one angel speaks to another two Whether the inferior speaks to the superior three Whether an angel speaks to God four Whether the angelic speech is subject to local distance five Whether all the speech of one angel to another is known to all FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred seven Art one Whether One Angel Speaks to Another Objection one It would seem that one angel does not speak to another For Gregory says Moral xviii that in the state of the resurrection each one s body will not hide his mind from his fellows Much less therefore is one angel s mind hidden from another But speech manifests to another what lies hidden in the mind Therefore it is not necessary that one angel should speak to another Obj two Further speech is twofold interior whereby one speaks to oneself and exterior whereby one speaks to another But exterior speech takes place by some sensible sign as by voice or gesture or some bodily member as the tongue or the fingers and this cannot apply to the angels Therefore one angel does not speak to another Obj three Further the speaker incites the hearer to listen to what he says But it does not appear that one angel incites another to listen for this happens among us by some sensible sign Therefore one angel does not speak to another On the contrary The Apostle says one Cor thirteen one If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels I answer that The angels speak in a certain way But as Gregory says Moral ii It is fitting that our mind rising above the properties of bodily speech should be lifted to the sublime and unknown methods of interior speech To understand how one angel speaks to another we must consider that as we explained above Q eighty two A four when treating of the actions and powers of the soul the will moves the intellect to its operation Now an intelligible object is present to the intellect in three ways first habitually or in the memory as Augustine says De Trin xiv six seven secondly as actually considered or conceived thirdly as related to something else And it is clear that the intelligible object passes from the first to the second stage by the command of the will and hence in the definition of habit these words occur which anyone uses when he wills So likewise the intelligible object passes from the second to the third stage by the will for by the will the concept of the mind is ordered to something else as for instance either to the performing of an action or to being made known to another Now when the mind turns itself to the actual consideration of any habitual knowledge then a person speaks to himself for the concept of the mind is called the interior word And by the fact that the concept of the angelic mind is ordered to be made known to another by the will of the angel himself the concept of one angel is made known to another and in this way one angel speaks to another for to speak to another only means to make known the mental concept to another Reply Obj one Our mental concept is hidden by a twofold obstacle The first is in the will which can retain the mental concept within or can direct it externally In this way God alone can see the mind of another according to one Cor two eleven What man knoweth the things of a man but the spirit of a man that is in him The other obstacle whereby the mental concept is excluded from another one s knowledge comes from the body and so it happens that even when the will directs the concept of the mind to make itself known it is not at once make known to another but some sensible sign must be used Gregory alludes to this fact when he says Moral ii To other eyes we seem to stand aloof as it were behind the wall of the body and when we wish to make ourselves known we go out as it were by the door of the tongue to show what we really are But an angel is under no such obstacle and so he can make his concept known to another at once Reply Obj two External speech made by the voice is a necessity for us on account of the obstacle of the body Hence it does not befit an angel but only interior speech belongs to him and this includes not only the interior speech by mental concept but also its being ordered to another s knowledge by the will So the tongue of an angel is called metaphorically the angel s power whereby he manifests his mental concept Reply Obj three There is no need to draw the attention of the good angels inasmuch as they always see each other in the Word for as one ever sees the other so he ever sees what is ordered to himself But because by their very nature they can speak to each other and even now the bad angels speak to each other we must say that the intellect is moved by the intelligible object just as sense is affected by the sensible object Therefore as sense is aroused by the sensible object so the mind of an angel can be aroused to attention by some intelligible power SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred seven Art two Whether the Inferior Angel Speaks to the Superior Objection one It would seem that the inferior angel does not speak to the superior For on the text one Cor thirteen one If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels a gloss remarks that the speech of the angels is an enlightenment whereby the superior enlightens the inferior But the inferior never enlightens the superior as was above explained Q one hundred six A three Therefore neither do the inferior speak to the superior Obj two Further as was said above Q one hundred six A one to enlighten means merely to acquaint one man of what is known to another and this is to speak Therefore to speak and to enlighten are the same so the same conclusion follows Obj three Further Gregory says Moral ii God speaks to the angels by the very fact that He shows to their hearts His hidden and invisible things But this is to enlighten them Therefore whenever God speaks He enlightens In the same way every angelic speech is an enlightening Therefore an inferior angel can in no way speak to a superior angel On the contrary According to the exposition of Dionysius Coel Hier vii the inferior angels said to the superior Who is this King of Glory I answer that The inferior angels can speak to the superior To make this clear we must consider that every angelic enlightening is an angelic speech but on the other hand not every speech is an enlightening because as we have said A one for one angel to speak to another angel means nothing else but that by his own will he directs his mental concept in such a way that it becomes known to the other Now what the mind conceives may be reduced to a twofold principle to God Himself Who is the primal truth and to the will of the one who understands whereby we actually consider anything But because truth is the light of the intellect and God Himself is the rule of all truth the manifestation of what is conceived by the mind as depending on the primary truth is both speech and enlightenment for example when one man says to another Heaven was created by God or Man is an animal The manifestation however of what depends on the will of the one who understands cannot be called an enlightenment but is only a speech for instance when one says to another I wish to learn this I wish to do this or that The reason is that the created will is not a light nor a rule of truth but participates of light Hence to communicate what comes from the created will is not as such an enlightening For to know what you may will or what you may understand does not belong to the perfection of my intellect but only to know the truth in reality Now it is clear that the angels are called superior or inferior by comparison with this principle God and therefore enlightenment which depends on the principle which is God is conveyed only by the superior angels to the inferior But as regards the will as the principle he who wills is first and supreme and therefore the manifestation of what belongs to the will is conveyed to others by the one who wills In that manner both the superior angels speak to the inferior and the inferior speak to the superior From this clearly appear the replies to the first and second objections Reply Obj three Every speech of God to the angels is an enlightening because since the will of God is the rule of truth it belongs to the perfection and enlightenment of the created mind to know even what God wills But the same does not apply to the will of the angels as was explained above THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred seven Art three Whether an Angel Speaks to God Objection one It would seem that an angel does not speak to God For speech makes known something to another But an angel cannot make known anything to God Who knows all things Therefore an angel does not speak to God Obj two Further to speak is to order the mental concept in reference to another as was shown above A one But an angel ever orders his mental concept to God So if an angel speaks to God he ever speaks to God which in some ways appears to be unreasonable since an angel sometimes speaks to another angel Therefore it seems that an angel never speaks to God On the contrary It is written Zech one twelve The angel of the Lord answered and said O Lord of hosts how long wilt Thou not have mercy on Jerusalem Therefore an angel speaks to God I answer that As was said above AA one two the angel speaks by ordering his mental concept to something else Now one thing is ordered to another in a twofold manner In one way for the purpose of giving one thing to another as in natural things the agent is ordered to the patient and in human speech the teacher is ordered to the learner and in this sense an angel in no way speaks to God either of what concerns the truth or of whatever depends on the created will because God is the principle and source of all truth and of all will In another way one thing is ordered to another to receive something as in natural things the passive is ordered to the agent and in human speech the disciple to the master and in this way an angel speaks to God either by consulting the Divine will of what ought to be done or by admiring the Divine excellence which he can never comprehend thus Gregory says Moral ii that the angels speak to God when by contemplating what is above themselves they rise to emotions of admiration Reply Obj one Speech is not always for the purpose of making something known to another but is sometimes finally ordered to the purpose of manifesting something to the speaker himself as when the disciples ask instruction from the master Reply Obj two The angels are ever speaking to God in the sense of praising and admiring Him and His works but they speak to Him by consulting Him about what ought to be done whenever they have to perform any new work concerning which they desire enlightenment FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred seven Art four Whether Local Distance Influences the Angelic Speech Objection one It would seem that local distance affects the angelic speech For as Damascene says De Fide Orth i thirteen An angel works where he is But speech is an angelic operation Therefore as an angel is in a determinate place it seems that an angel s speech is limited by the bounds of that place Obj two Further a speaker cries out on account of the distance of the hearer But it is said of the Seraphim that they cried one to another Isa six three Therefore in the angelic speech local distance has some effect On the contrary It is said that the rich man in hell spoke to Abraham notwithstanding the local distance Luke sixteen twenty four Much less therefore does local distance impede the speech of one angel to another I answer that The angelic speech consists in an intellectual operation as explained above AA one two three And the intellectual operation of an angel abstracts from the here and now For even our own intellectual operation takes place by abstraction from the here and now except accidentally on the part of the phantasms which do not exist at all in an angel But as regards whatever is abstracted from here and now neither difference of time nor local distance has any influence whatever Hence in the angelic speech local distance is no impediment Reply Obj one The angelic speech as above explained A one ad two is interior perceived nevertheless by another and therefore it exists in the angel who speaks and consequently where the angel is who speaks But as local distance does not prevent one angel seeing another so neither does it prevent an angel perceiving what is ordered to him on the part of another and this is to perceive his speech Reply Obj two The cry mentioned is not a bodily voice raised by reason of the local distance but is taken to signify the magnitude of what is said or the intensity of the affection according to what Gregory says Moral ii The less one desires the less one cries out FIFTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred seven Art five Whether All the Angels Know What One Speaks to Another Objection one It would seem that all the angels know what one speaks to another For unequal local distance is the reason why all men do not know what one man says to another But in the angelic speech local distance has no effect as above explained A four Therefore all the angels know what one speaks to another Obj two Further all the angels have the intellectual power in common So if the mental concept of one ordered to another is known by one it is for the same reason known by all Obj three Further enlightenment is a kind of speech But the enlightenment of one angel by another extends to all the angels because as Dionysius says Coel Hier xv Each one of the heavenly beings communicates what he learns to the others Therefore the speech of one angel to another extends to all On the contrary One man can speak to another alone much more can this be the case among the angels I answer that As above explained AA one two the mental concept of one angel can be perceived by another when the angel who possesses the concept refers it by his will to another Now a thing can be ordered through some cause to one thing and not to another consequently the concept of one angel may be known by one and not by another and therefore an angel can perceive the speech of one angel to another whereas others do not not through the obstacle of local distance but on account of the will so ordering as explained above From this appear the replies to the first and second objections Reply Obj three Enlightenment is of those truths that emanate from the first rule of truth which is the principle common to all the angels and in that way all enlightenments are common to all But speech may be of something ordered to the principle of the created will which is proper to each angel and in this way it is not necessary that these speeches should be common to all QUESTION one hundred eight OF THE ANGELIC DEGREES OF HIERARCHIES AND ORDERS In Eight Articles We next consider the degrees of the angels in their hierarchies and orders for it was said above Q one hundred six A three that the superior angels enlighten the inferior angels and not conversely Under this head there are eight points of inquiry one Whether all the angels belong to one hierarchy two Whether in one hierarchy there is only one order three Whether in one order there are many angels four Whether the distinction of hierarchies and orders is natural five Of the names and properties of each order six Of the comparison of the orders to one another seven Whether the orders will outlast the Day of Judgment eight Whether men are taken up into the angelic orders FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred eight Art one Whether All the Angels Are of One Hierarchy Objection one It would seem that all the angels belong to one hierarchy For since the angels are supreme among creatures it is evident that they are ordered for the best But the best ordering of a multitude is for it to be governed by one authority as the Philosopher shows Metaph xii Did xi ten Polit iii four Therefore as a hierarchy is nothing but a sacred principality it seems that all the angels belong to one hierarchy Obj two Further Dionysius says Coel Hier iii that hierarchy is order knowledge and action But all the angels agree in one order towards God Whom they know and by Whom in their actions they are ruled Therefore all the angels belong to one hierarchy Obj three Further the sacred principality called hierarchy is to be found among men and angels But all men are of one hierarchy Therefore likewise all the angels are of one hierarchy On the contrary Dionysius Coel Hier vi distinguishes three hierarchies of angels I answer that Hierarchy means a sacred principality as above explained Now principality includes two things the prince himself and the multitude ordered under the prince Therefore because there is one God the Prince not only of all the angels but also of men and all creatures so there is one hierarchy not only of all the angels but also of all rational creatures who can be participators of sacred things according to Augustine De Civ Dei xii one There are two cities that is two societies one of the good angels and men the other of the wicked But if we consider the principality on the part of the multitude ordered under the prince then principality is said to be one accordingly as the multitude can be subject in one way to the government of the prince And those that cannot be governed in the same way by a prince belong to different principalities thus under one king there are different cities which are governed by different laws and administrators Now it is evident that men do not receive the Divine enlightenments in the same way as do the angels for the angels receive them in their intelligible purity whereas men receive them under sensible signs as Dionysius says Coel Hier i Therefore there must needs be a distinction between the human and the angelic hierarchy In the same manner we distinguish three angelic hierarchies For it was shown above Q fifty five A three in treating of the angelic knowledge that the superior angels have a more universal knowledge of the truth than the inferior angels This universal knowledge has three grades among the angels For the types of things concerning which the angels are enlightened can be considered in a threefold manner First as preceding from God as the first universal principle which mode of knowledge belongs to the first hierarchy connected immediately with God and as it were placed in the vestibule of God as Dionysius says Coel Hier vii Secondly forasmuch as these types depend on the universal created causes which in some way are already multiplied which mode belongs to the second hierarchy Thirdly forasmuch as these types are applied to particular things as depending on their causes which mode belongs to the lowest hierarchy All this will appear more clearly when we treat of each of the orders A six In this way are the hierarchies distinguished on the part of the multitude of subjects Hence it is clear that those err and speak against the opinion of Dionysius who place a hierarchy in the Divine Persons and call it the supercelestial hierarchy For in the Divine Persons there exists indeed a natural order but there is no hierarchical order for as Dionysius says Coel Hier iii The hierarchical order is so directed that some be cleansed enlightened and perfected and that others cleanse enlighten and perfect which far be it from us to apply to the Divine Persons Reply Obj one This objection considers principality on the part of the ruler inasmuch as a multitude is best ruled by one ruler as the Philosopher asserts in those passages Reply Obj two As regards knowing God Himself Whom all see in one way that is in His essence there is no hierarchical distinction among the angels but there is such a distinction as regards the types of created things as above explained Reply Obj three All men are of one species and have one connatural mode of understanding which is not the case in the angels and hence the same argument does not apply to both SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred eight Art two Whether There Are Several Orders in One Hierarchy Objection one It would seem that in the one hierarchy there are not several orders For when a definition is multiplied the thing defined is also multiplied But hierarchy is order as Dionysius says Coel Hier iii Therefore if there are many orders there is not one hierarchy only but many Obj two Further different orders are different grades and grades among spirits are constituted by different spiritual gifts But among the angels all the spiritual gifts are common to all for nothing is possessed individually Sent ii D ix Therefore there are not different orders of angels Obj three Further in the ecclesiastical hierarchy the orders are distinguished according to the actions of cleansing enlightening and perfecting For the order of deacons is cleansing the order of priests is enlightening and of bishops perfecting as Dionysius says Eccl Hier v But each of the angels cleanses enlightens and perfects Therefore there is no distinction of orders among the angels On the contrary The Apostle says Eph one twenty twenty one that God has set the Man Christ above all principality and power and virtue and dominion which are the various orders of the angels and some of them belong to one hierarchy as will be explained A six I answer that As explained above one hierarchy is one principality that is one multitude ordered in one way under the rule of a prince Now such a multitude would not be ordered but confused if there were not in it different orders So the nature of a hierarchy requires diversity of orders This diversity of order arises from the diversity of offices and actions as appears in one city where there are different orders according to the different actions for there is one order of those who judge and another of those who fight and another of those who labor in the fields and so forth But although one city thus comprises several orders all may be reduced to three when we consider that every multitude has a beginning a middle and an end So in every city a threefold order of men is to be seen some of whom are supreme as the nobles others are the last as the common people while others hold a place between these as the middle class populus honorabilis In the same way we find in each angelic hierarchy the orders distinguished according to their actions and offices and all this diversity is reduced to three namely to the summit the middle and the base and so in every hierarchy Dionysius places three orders Coel Hier vi Reply Obj one Order is twofold In one way it is taken as the order comprehending in itself different grades and in that way a hierarchy is called an order In another way one grade is called an order and in that sense the several orders of one hierarchy are so called Reply Obj two All things are possessed in common by the angelic society some things however being held more excellently by some than by others Each gift is more perfectly possessed by the one who can communicate it than by the one who cannot communicate it as the hot thing which can communicate heat is more perfect that what is unable to give heat And the more perfectly anyone can communicate a gift the higher grade he occupies as he is in the more perfect grade of mastership who can teach a higher science By this similitude we can reckon the diversity of grades or orders among the angels according to their different offices and actions Reply Obj three The inferior angel is superior to the highest man of our hierarchy according to the words He that is the lesser in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he namely John the Baptist than whom there hath not risen a greater among them that are born of women Matt eleven eleven Hence the lesser angel of the heavenly hierarchy can not only cleanse but also enlighten and perfect and in a higher way than can the orders of our hierarchy Thus the heavenly orders are not distinguished by reason of these but by reason of other different acts THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred eight Art three Whether There Are Many Angels in One Order Objection one It seems that there are not many angels in one order For it was shown above Q fifty A four that all the angels are unequal But equals belong to one order Therefore there are not many angels in one order Obj two Further it is superfluous for a thing to be done by many which can be done sufficiently by one But that which belongs to one angelic office can be done sufficiently by one angel so much more sufficiently than the one sun does what belongs to the office of the sun as the angel is more perfect than a heavenly body If therefore the orders are distinguished by their offices as stated above A two several angels in one order would be superfluous Obj three Further it was said above Obj one that all the angels are unequal Therefore if several angels for instance three or four are of one order the lowest one of the superior order will be more akin to the highest of the inferior order than with the highest of his own order and thus he does not seem to be more of one order with the latter than with the former Therefore there are not many angels of one order On the contrary It is written The Seraphim cried to one another Isa six three Therefore there are many angels in the one order of the Seraphim I answer that Whoever knows anything perfectly is able to distinguish its acts powers and nature down to the minutest details whereas he who knows a thing in an imperfect manner can only distinguish it in a general way and only as regards a few points Thus one who knows natural things imperfectly can distinguish their orders in a general way placing the heavenly bodies in one order inanimate inferior bodies in another plants in another and animals in another whilst he who knows natural things perfectly is able to distinguish different orders in the heavenly bodies themselves and in each of the other orders Now our knowledge of the angels is imperfect as Dionysius says Coel Hier vi Hence we can only distinguish the angelic offices and orders in a general way so as to place many angels in one order But if we knew the offices and distinctions of the angels perfectly we should know perfectly that each angel has his own office and his own order among things and much more so than any star though this be hidden from us Reply Obj one All the angels of one order are in some way equal in a common similitude whereby they are placed in that order but absolutely speaking they are not equal Hence Dionysius says Coel Hier x that in one and the same order of angels there are those who are first middle and last Reply Obj two That special distinction of orders and offices wherein each angel has his own office and order is hidden from us Reply Obj three As in a surface which is partly white and partly black the two parts on the borders of white and black are more akin as regards their position than any other two white parts but are less akin in quality so two angels who are on the boundary of two orders are more akin in propinquity of nature than one of them is akin to the others of its own order but less akin in their fitness for similar offices which fitness indeed extends to a definite limit FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred eight Art four Whether the Distinction of Hierarchies and Orders Comes from the Angelic Nature Objection one It would seem that the distinction of hierarchies and of orders is not from the nature of the angels For hierarchy is a sacred principality and Dionysius places in its definition that it approaches a resemblance to God as far as may be Coel Hier iii But sanctity and resemblance to God is in the angels by grace and not by nature Therefore the distinction of hierarchies and orders in the angels is by grace and not by nature Obj two Further the Seraphim are called burning or kindling as Dionysius says Coel Hier vii This belongs to charity which comes not from nature but from grace for it is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost Who is given to us Rom five five which is said not only of holy men but also of the holy angels as Augustine says De Civ Dei xii Therefore the angelic orders are not from nature but from grace Obj three Further the ecclesiastical hierarchy is copied from the heavenly But the orders among men are not from nature but by the gift of grace for it is not a natural gift for one to be a bishop and another a priest and another a deacon Therefore neither in the angels are the orders from nature but from grace only On the contrary The Master says ii D nine that an angelic order is a multitude of heavenly spirits who are likened to each other by some gift of grace just as they agree also in the participation of natural gifts Therefore the distinction of orders among the angels is not only by gifts of grace but also by gifts of nature I answer that The order of government which is the order of a multitude under authority is derived from its end Now the end of the angels may be considered in two ways First according to the faculty of nature so that they may know and love God by natural knowledge and love and according to their relation to this end the orders of the angels are distinguished by natural gifts Secondly the end of the angelic multitude can be taken from what is above their natural powers which consists in the vision of the Divine Essence and in the unchangeable fruition of His goodness to which end they can reach only by grace and hence as regards this end the orders in the angels are adequately distinguished by the gifts of grace but dispositively by natural gifts forasmuch as to the angels are given gratuitous gifts according to the capacity of their natural gifts which is not the case with men as above explained Q sixty two A six Hence among men the orders are distinguished according to the gratuitous gifts only and not according to natural gifts From the above the replies to the objections are evident FIFTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred eight Art five Whether the Orders of the Angels Are Properly Named Objection one It would seem that the orders of the angels are not properly named For all the heavenly spirits are called angels and heavenly virtues But common names should not be appropriated to individuals Therefore the orders of the angels and virtues are ineptly named Obj two Further it belongs to God alone to be Lord according to the words Know ye that the Lord He is God Ps ninety nine three Therefore one order of the heavenly spirits is not properly called Dominations Obj three Further the name Domination seems to imply government and likewise the names Principalities and Powers Therefore these three names do not seem to be properly applied to three orders Obj four Further archangels are as it were angel princes Therefore this name ought not to be given to any other order than to the Principalities Obj five Further the name Seraphim is derived from ardor which pertains to charity and the name Cherubim from knowledge But charity and knowledge are gifts common to all the angels Therefore they ought not to be names of any particular orders Obj six Further Thrones are seats But from the fact that God knows and loves the rational creature He is said to sit within it Therefore there ought not to be any order of Thrones besides the Cherubim and Seraphim Therefore it appears that the orders of angels are not properly styled On the contrary is the authority of Holy Scripture wherein they are so named For the name Seraphim is found in Isa six two the name Cherubim in Ezech one Cf ten fifteen twenty Thrones in colonel one sixteen Dominations Virtues Powers and Principalities are mentioned in Eph one twenty one the name Archangels in the canonical epistle of saint Jude nine and the name Angels is found in many places of Scripture I answer that As Dionysius says Coel Hier vii in the names of the angelic orders it is necessary to observe that the proper name of each order expresses its property Now to see what is the property of each order we must consider that in coordinated things something may be found in a threefold manner by way of property by way of excess and by way of participation A thing is said to be in another by way of property if it is adequate and proportionate to its nature by excess when an attribute is less than that to which it is attributed but is possessed thereby in an eminent manner as we have stated Q thirteen A two concerning all the names which are attributed to God by participation when an attribute is possessed by something not fully but partially thus holy men are called gods by participation Therefore if anything is to be called by a name designating its property it ought not to be named from what it participates imperfectly nor from that which it possesses in excess but from that which is adequate thereto as for instance when we wish properly to name a man we should call him a rational substance but not an intellectual substance which latter is the proper name of an angel because simple intelligence belongs to an angel as a property and to man by participation nor do we call him a sensible substance which is the proper name of a brute because sense is less than the property of a man and belongs to man in a more excellent way than to other animals So we must consider that in the angelic orders all spiritual perfections are common to all the angels and that they are all more excellently in the superior than in the inferior angels Further as in these perfections there are grades the superior perfection belongs to the superior order as its property whereas it belongs to the inferior by participation and conversely the inferior perfection belongs to the inferior order as its property and to the superior by way of excess and thus the superior order is denominated from the superior perfection So in this way Dionysius Coel Hier vii explains the names of the orders accordingly as they befit the spiritual perfections they signify Gregory on the other hand in expounding these names Hom xxxiv in Evang seems to regard more the exterior ministrations for he says that angels are so called as announcing the least things and the archangels in the greatest by the virtues miracles are wrought by the powers hostile powers are repulsed and the principalities preside over the good spirits themselves Reply Obj one Angel means messenger So all the heavenly spirits so far as they make known Divine things are called angels But the superior angels enjoy a certain excellence as regards this manifestation from which the superior orders are denominated The lowest order of angels possess no excellence above the common manifestation and therefore it is denominated from manifestation only and thus the common name remains as it were proper to the lowest order as Dionysius says Coel Hier v Or we may say that the lowest order can be specially called the order of angels forasmuch as they announce things to us immediately Virtue can be taken in two ways First commonly considered as the medium between the essence and the operation and in that sense all the heavenly spirits are called heavenly virtues as also heavenly essences Secondly as meaning a certain excellence of strength and thus it is the proper name of an angelic order Hence Dionysius says Coel Hier viii that the name virtues signifies a certain virile and immovable strength first in regard of those Divine operations which befit them secondly in regard to receiving Divine gifts Thus it signifies that they undertake fearlessly the Divine behests appointed to them and this seems to imply strength of mind Reply Obj two As Dionysius says Div Nom xii Dominion is attributed to God in a special manner by way of excess but the Divine word gives the more illustrious heavenly princes the name of Lord by participation through whom the inferior angels receive the Divine gifts Hence Dionysius also states Coel Hier viii that the name Domination means first a certain liberty free from servile condition and common subjection such as that of plebeians and from tyrannical oppression endured sometimes even by the great Secondly it signifies a certain rigid and inflexible supremacy which does not bend to any servile act or to the act of those who are subject to or oppressed by tyrants Thirdly it signifies the desire and participation of the true dominion which belongs to God Likewise the name of each order signifies the participation of what belongs to God as the name Virtues signifies the participation of the Divine virtue and the same principle applies to the rest Reply Obj three The names Domination Power and Principality belong to government in different ways The place of a lord is only to prescribe what is to be done So Gregory says Hom xxiv in Evang that some companies of the angels because others are subject to obedience to them are called dominations The name Power points out a kind of order according to what the Apostle says He that resisteth the power resisteth the ordination of God Rom thirteen two And so Dionysius says Coel Hier viii that the name Power signifies a kind of ordination both as regards the reception of Divine things and as regards the Divine actions performed by superiors towards inferiors by leading them to things above Therefore to the order of Powers it belongs to regulate what is to be done by those who are subject to them To preside principari as Gregory says Hom xxiv in Ev is to be first among others as being first in carrying out what is ordered to be done And so Dionysius says Coel Hier ix that the name of Principalities signifies one who leads in a sacred order For those who lead others being first among them are properly called princes according to the words Princes went before joined with singers Ps sixty seven twenty six Reply Obj four The Archangels according to Dionysius Coel Hier ix are between the Principalities and the Angels A medium compared to one extreme seems like the other as participating in the nature of both extremes thus tepid seems cold compared to hot and hot compared to cold So the Archangels are called the angel princes forasmuch as they are princes as regards the Angels and angels as regards the Principalities But according to Gregory Hom xxiv in Ev they are called Archangels because they preside over the one order of the Angels as it were announcing greater things and the Principalities are so called as presiding over all the heavenly Virtues who fulfil the Divine commands Reply Obj five The name Seraphim does not come from charity only but from the excess of charity expressed by the word ardor or fire Hence Dionysius Coel Hier vii expounds the name Seraphim according to the properties of fire containing an excess of heat Now in fire we may consider three things First the movement which is upwards and continuous This signifies that they are borne inflexibly towards God Secondly the active force which is heat which is not found in fire simply but exists with a certain sharpness as being of most penetrating action and reaching even to the smallest things and as it were with superabundant fervor whereby is signified the action of these angels exercised powerfully upon those who are subject to them rousing them to a like fervor and cleansing them wholly by their heat Thirdly we consider in fire the quality of clarity or brightness which signifies that these angels have in themselves an inextinguishable light and that they also perfectly enlighten others In the same way the name Cherubim comes from a certain excess of knowledge hence it is interpreted fulness of knowledge which Dionysius Coel Hier vii expounds in regard to four things the perfect vision of God the full reception of the Divine Light their contemplation in God of the beauty of the Divine order and in regard to the fact that possessing this knowledge fully they pour it forth copiously upon others Reply Obj six The order of the Thrones excels the inferior orders as having an immediate knowledge of the types of the Divine works whereas the Cherubim have the excellence of knowledge and the Seraphim the excellence of ardor And although these two excellent attributes include the third yet the gift belonging to the Thrones does not include the other two and so the order of the Thrones is distinguished from the orders of the Cherubim and the Seraphim For it is a common rule in all things that the excellence of the inferior is contained in the superior but not conversely But Dionysius Coel Hier vii explains the name Thrones by its relation to material seats in which we may consider four things First the site because seats are raised above the earth and to the angels who are called Thrones are raised up to the immediate knowledge of the types of things in God Secondly because in material seats is displayed strength forasmuch as a person sits firmly on them But here the reverse is the case for the angels themselves are made firm by God Thirdly because the seat receives him who sits thereon and he can be carried thereupon and so the angels receive God in themselves and in a certain way bear Him to the inferior creatures Fourthly because in its shape a seat is open on one side to receive the sitter and thus are the angels promptly open to receive God and to serve Him SIXTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred eight Art six Whether the Grades of the Orders Are Properly Assigned Objection one It would seem that the grades of the orders are not properly assigned For the order of prelates is the highest But the names of Dominations Principalities and Powers of themselves imply prelacy Therefore these orders ought not to be supreme Obj two Further the nearer an order is to God the higher it is But the order of Thrones is the nearest to God for nothing is nearer to the sitter than the seat Therefore the order of the Thrones is the highest Obj three Further knowledge comes before love and intellect is higher than will Therefore the order of Cherubim seems to be higher than the Seraphim Obj four Further Gregory Hom xxiv in Evang places the Principalities above the Powers These therefore are not placed immediately above the Archangels as Dionysius says Coel Hier ix On the contrary Dionysius Coel Hier vii places in the highest hierarchy the Seraphim as the first the Cherubim as the middle the Thrones as the last in the middle hierarchy he places the Dominations as the first the Virtues in the middle the Powers last in the lowest hierarchy the Principalities first then the Archangels and lastly the Angels I answer that The grades of the angelic orders are assigned by Gregory Hom xxiv in Ev and Dionysius Coel Hier vii who agree as regards all except the Principalities and Virtues For Dionysius places the Virtues beneath the Dominations and above the Powers the Principalities beneath the Powers and above the Archangels Gregory however places the Principalities between the Dominations and the Powers and the Virtues between the Powers and the Archangels Each of these placings may claim authority from the words of the Apostle who Eph one twenty twenty one enumerates the middle orders beginning from the lowest saying that God set Him i e Christ on His right hand in the heavenly places above all Principality and Power and Virtue and Dominion Here he places Virtues between Powers and Dominations according to the placing of Dionysius Writing however to the Colossians one sixteen numbering the same orders from the highest he says Whether Thrones or Dominations or Principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and in Him Here he places the Principalities between Dominations and Powers as does also Gregory Let us then first examine the reason for the ordering of Dionysius in which we see that as said above A one the highest hierarchy contemplates the ideas of things in God Himself the second in the universal causes and third in their application to particular effects And because God is the end not only of the angelic ministrations but also of the whole creation it belongs to the first hierarchy to consider the end to the middle one belongs the universal disposition of what is to be done and to the last belongs the application of this disposition to the effect which is the carrying out of the work for it is clear that these three things exist in every kind of operation So Dionysius considering the properties of the orders as derived from their names places in the first hierarchy those orders the names of which are taken from their relation to God the Seraphim Cherubim and Thrones and he places in the middle hierarchy those orders whose names denote a certain kind of common government or disposition the Dominations Virtues and Powers and he places in the third hierarchy the orders whose names denote the execution of the work the Principalities Angels and Archangels As regards the end three things may be considered For firstly we consider the end then we acquire perfect knowledge of the end thirdly we fix our intention on the end of which the second is an addition to the first and the third an addition to both And because God is the end of creatures as the leader is the end of an army as the Philosopher says Metaph xii Did xi ten so a somewhat similar order may be seen in human affairs For there are some who enjoy the dignity of being able with familiarity to approach the king or leader others in addition are privileged to know his secrets and others above these ever abide with him in a close union According to this similitude we can understand the disposition in the orders of the first hierarchy for the Thrones are raised up so as to be the familiar recipients of God in themselves in the sense of knowing immediately the types of things in Himself and this is proper to the whole of the first hierarchy The Cherubim know the Divine secrets supereminently and the Seraphim excel in what is the supreme excellence of all in being united to God Himself and all this in such a manner that the whole of this hierarchy can be called the Thrones as from what is common to all the heavenly spirits together they are all called Angels As regards government three things are comprised therein the first of which is to appoint those things which are to be done and this belongs to the Dominations the second is to give the power of carrying out what is to be done which belongs to the Virtues the third is to order how what has been commanded or decided to be done can be carried out by others which belongs to the Powers The execution of the angelic ministrations consists in announcing Divine things Now in the execution of any action there are beginners and leaders as in singing the precentors and in war generals and officers this belongs to the Principalities There are others who simply execute what is to be done and these are the Angels Others hold a middle place and these are the Archangels as above explained This explanation of the orders is quite a reasonable one For the highest in an inferior order always has affinity to the lowest in the higher order as the lowest animals are near to the plants Now the first order is that of the Divine Persons which terminates in the Holy Ghost Who is Love proceeding with Whom the highest order of the first hierarchy has affinity denominated as it is from the fire of love The lowest order of the first hierarchy is that of the Thrones who in their own order are akin to the Dominations for the Thrones according to Gregory Hom xxiv in Ev are so called because through them God accomplishes His judgments since they are enlightened by Him in a manner adapted to the immediate enlightening of the second hierarchy to which belongs the disposition of the Divine ministrations The order of the Powers is akin to the order of the Principalities for as it belongs to the Powers to impose order on those subject to them this ordering is plainly shown at once in the name of Principalities who as presiding over the government of peoples and kingdoms which occupies the first and principal place in the Divine ministrations are the first in the execution thereof for the good of a nation is more divine than the good of one man Ethic i two and hence it is written The prince of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me Dan ten thirteen The disposition of the orders which is mentioned by Gregory is also reasonable For since the Dominations appoint and order what belongs to the Divine ministrations the orders subject to them are arranged according to the disposition of those things in which the Divine ministrations are effected Still as Augustine says De Trin iii bodies are ruled in a certain order the inferior by the superior and all of them by the spiritual creature and the bad spirit by the good spirit So the first order after the Dominations is called that of Principalities who rule even over good spirits then the Powers who coerce the evil spirits even as evil doers are coerced by earthly powers as it is written Rom thirteen thirty four After these come the Virtues which have power over corporeal nature in the working of miracles after these are the Angels and the Archangels who announce to men either great things above reason or small things within the purview of reason Reply Obj one The angels subjection to God is greater than their presiding over inferior things and the latter is derived from the former Thus the orders which derive their name from presiding are not the first and highest but rather the orders deriving their name from their nearness and relation to God Reply Obj two The nearness to God designated by the name of the Thrones belongs also to the Cherubim and Seraphim and in a more excellent way as above explained Reply Obj three As above explained Q twenty seven A three knowledge takes place accordingly as the thing known is in the knower but love as the lover is united to the object loved Now higher things are in a nobler way in themselves than in lower things whereas lower things are in higher things in a nobler way than they are in themselves Therefore to know lower things is better than to love them and to love the higher things God above all is better than to know them Reply Obj four A careful comparison will show that little or no difference exists in reality between the dispositions of the orders according to Dionysius and Gregory For Gregory expounds the name Principalities from their presiding over good spirits which also agrees with the Virtues accordingly as this name expressed a certain strength giving efficacy to the inferior spirits in the execution of the Divine ministrations Again according to Gregory the Virtues seem to be the same as Principalities of Dionysius For to work miracles holds the first place in the Divine ministrations since thereby the way is prepared for the announcements of the Archangels and the Angels SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred eight Art seven Whether the Orders Will Outlast the Day of Judgment Objection one It would seem that the orders of angels will not outlast the Day of Judgment For the Apostle says one Cor fifteen twenty four that Christ will bring to naught all principality and power when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father and this will be in the final consummation Therefore for the same reason all others will be abolished in that state Obj two Further to the office of the angelic orders it belongs to cleanse enlighten and perfect But after the Day of Judgment one angel will not cleanse enlighten or perfect another because they will not advance any more in knowledge Therefore the angelic orders would remain for no purpose Obj three Further the Apostle says of the angels Heb one fourteen that they are all ministering spirits sent to minister to them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation whence it appears that the angelic offices are ordered for the purpose of leading men to salvation But all the elect are in pursuit of salvation until the Day of Judgment Therefore the angelic offices and orders will not outlast the Day of Judgment On the contrary It is written Judges five twenty Stars remaining in their order and courses which is applied to the angels Therefore the angels will ever remain in their orders I answer that In the angelic orders we may consider two things the distinction of grades and the execution of their offices The distinction of grades among the angels takes place according to the difference of grace and nature as above explained A four and these differences will ever remain in the angels for these differences of natures cannot be taken from them unless they themselves be corrupted The difference of glory will also ever remain in them according to the difference of preceding merit As to the execution of the angelic offices it will to a certain degree remain after the Day of Judgment and to a certain degree will cease It will cease accordingly as their offices are directed towards leading others to their end but it will remain accordingly as it agrees with the attainment of the end Thus also the various ranks of soldiers have different duties to perform in battle and in triumph Reply Obj one The principalities and powers will come to an end in that final consummation as regards their office of leading others to their end because when the end is attained it is no longer necessary to tend towards the end This is clear from the words of the Apostle When He shall have delivered up the kingdom of God and the Father i e when He shall have led the faithful to the enjoyment of God Himself Reply Obj two The actions of angels over the other angels are to be considered according to a likeness to our own intellectual actions In ourselves we find many intellectual actions which are ordered according to the order of cause and effect as when we gradually arrive at one conclusion by many middle terms Now it is manifest that the knowledge of a conclusion depends on all the preceding middle terms not only in the new acquisition of knowledge but also as regards the keeping of the knowledge acquired A proof of this is that when anyone forgets any of the preceding middle terms he can have opinion or belief about the conclusion but not knowledge as he is ignorant of the order of the causes So since the inferior angels know the types of the Divine works by the light of the superior angels their knowledge depends on the light of the superior angels not only as regards the acquisition of knowledge but also as regards the preserving of the knowledge possessed So although after the Judgment the inferior angels will not progress in the knowledge of some things still this will not prevent their being enlightened by the superior angels Reply Obj three Although after the Day of Judgment men will not be led any more to salvation by the ministry of the angels still those who are already saved will be enlightened through the angelic ministry EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred eight Art eight Whether Men Are Taken Up into the Angelic Orders Objection one It would seem that men are not taken up into the orders of the angels For the human hierarchy is stationed beneath the lowest heavenly hierarchy as the lowest under the middle hierarchy and the middle beneath the first But the angels of the lowest hierarchy are never transferred into the middle or the first Therefore neither are men transferred to the angelic orders Obj two Further certain offices belong to the orders of the angels as to guard to work miracles to coerce the demons and the like which do not appear to belong to the souls of the saints Therefore they are not transferred to the angelic orders Obj three Further as the good angels lead on to good so do the demons to what is evil But it is erroneous to say that the souls of bad men are changed into demons for Chrysostom rejects this Hom xxviii in Matt Therefore it does not seem that the souls of the saints will be transferred to the orders of angels On the contrary The Lord says of the saints that they will be as the angels of God Matt twenty two thirty I answer that As above explained AA forty seven the orders of the angels are distinguished according to the conditions of nature and according to the gifts of grace Considered only as regards the grade of nature men can in no way be assumed into the angelic orders for the natural distinction will always remain In view of this distinction some asserted that men can in no way be transferred to an equality with the angels but this is erroneous contradicting as it does the promise of Christ saying that the children of the resurrection will be equal to the angels in heaven Luke twenty thirty six For whatever belongs to nature is the material part of an order whilst that which perfects is from grace which depends on the liberality of God and not on the order of nature Therefore by the gift of grace men can merit glory in such a degree as to be equal to the angels in each of the angelic grades and this implies that men are taken up into the orders of the angels Some however say that not all who are saved are assumed into the angelic orders but only virgins or the perfect and that the other will constitute their own order as it were corresponding to the whole society of the angels But this is against what Augustine says De Civ Dei xii nine that there will not be two societies of men and angels but only one because the beatitude of all is to cleave to God alone Reply Obj one Grace is given to the angels in proportion to their natural gifts This however does not apply to men as above explained A four Q sixty two A six So as the inferior angels cannot be transferred to the natural grade of the superior neither can they be transferred to the superior grade of grace whereas men can ascend to the grade of grace but not of nature Reply Obj two The angels according to the order of nature are between us and God and therefore according to the common law not only human affairs are administered by them but also all corporeal matters But holy men even after this life are of the same nature with ourselves and hence according to the common law they do not administer human affairs nor do they interfere in the things of the living as Augustine says De cura pro mortuis xiii xvi Still by a certain special dispensation it is sometimes granted to some of the saints to exercise these offices by working miracles by coercing the demons or by doing something of that kind as Augustine says De cura pro mortuis xvi Reply Obj three It is not erroneous to say that men are transferred to the penalty of demons but some erroneously stated that the demons are nothing but souls of the dead and it is this that Chrysostom rejects QUESTION one hundred nine THE ORDERING OF THE BAD ANGELS In Four Articles We now consider the ordering of the bad angels concerning which there are four points of inquiry one Whether there are orders among the demons two Whether among them there is precedence three Whether one enlightens another four Whether they are subject to the precedence of the good angels FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred nine Art one Whether There Are Orders Among the Demons Objection one It would seem that there are no orders among the demons For order belongs to good as also mode and species as Augustine says De Nat Boni iii and on the contrary disorder belongs to evil But there is nothing disorderly in the good angels Therefore in the bad angels there are no orders Obj two Further the angelic orders are contained under a hierarchy But the demons are not in a hierarchy which is defined as a holy principality for they are void of all holiness Therefore among the demons there are no orders Obj three Further the demons fell from every one of the angelic orders as is commonly supposed Therefore if some demons are said to belong to an order as falling from that order it would seem necessary to give them the names of each of those orders But we never find that they are called Seraphim or Thrones or Dominations Therefore on the same ground they are not to be placed in any other order On the contrary The Apostle says Eph six twelve Our wrestling is against principalities and powers against the rulers of the world of this darkness I answer that As explained above Q one hundred eight AA four seven eight order in the angels is considered both according to the grade of nature and according to that of grace Now grace has a twofold state the imperfect which is that of merit and the perfect which is that of consummate glory If therefore we consider the angelic orders in the light of the perfection of glory then the demons are not in the angelic orders and never were But if we consider them in relation to imperfect grace in that view the demons were at the time in the orders of angels but fell away from them according to what was said above Q sixty two A three that all the angels were created in grace But if we consider them in the light of nature in that view they are still in those orders because they have not lost their natural gifts as Dionysius says Div Nom iv Reply Obj one Good can exist without evil whereas evil cannot exist without good Q forty nine A three so there is order in the demons as possessing a good nature Reply Obj two If we consider the ordering of the demons on the part of God Who orders them it is sacred for He uses the demons for Himself but on the part of the demons will it is not a sacred thing because they abuse their nature for evil Reply Obj three The name Seraphim is given from the ardor of charity and the name Thrones from the Divine indwelling and the name Dominations imports a certain liberty all of which are opposed to sin and therefore these names are not given to the angels who sinned SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred nine Art two Whether among the demons there is precedence Objection one It would seem that there is no precedence among the demons For every precedence is according to some order of justice But the demons are wholly fallen from justice Therefore there is no precedence among them Obj two Further there is no precedence where obedience and subjection do not exist But these cannot be without concord which is not to be found among the demons according to the text Among the proud there are always contentions Prov thirteen ten Therefore there is no precedence among the demons Obj three If there be precedence among them it is either according to nature or according to their sin or punishment But it is not according to their nature for subjection and service do not come from nature but from subsequent sin neither is it according to sin or punishment because in that case the superior demons who have sinned the most grievously would be subject to the inferior Therefore there is no precedence among the demons On the contrary On one Cor fifteen twenty four the gloss says While the world lasts angels will preside over angels men over men and demons over demons I answer that Since action follows the nature of a thing where natures are subordinate actions also must be subordinate to each other Thus it is in corporeal things for as the inferior bodies by natural order are below the heavenly bodies their actions and movements are subject to the actions and movements of the heavenly bodies Now it is plain from what we have said A one that the demons are by natural order subject to others and hence their actions are subject to the action of those above them and this is what we mean by precedence that the action of the subject should be under the action of the prelate So the very natural disposition of the demons requires that there should be authority among them This agrees too with Divine wisdom which leaves nothing inordinate which reacheth from end to end mightily and ordereth all things sweetly Wis eight one Reply Obj one The authority of the demons is not founded on their justice but on the justice of God ordering all things Reply Obj two The concord of the demons whereby some obey others does not arise from mutual friendships but from their common wickedness whereby they hate men and fight against God s justice For it belongs to wicked men to be joined to and subject to those whom they see to be stronger in order to carry out their own wickedness Reply Obj three The demons are not equal in nature and so among them there exists a natural precedence which is not the case with men who are naturally equal That the inferior are subject to the superior is not for the benefit of the superior but rather to their detriment because since to do evil belongs in a pre eminent degree to unhappiness it follows that to preside in evil is to be more unhappy THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred nine Art three Whether There Is Enlightenment in the Demons Objection one It would seem that enlightenment is in the demons For enlightenment means the manifestation of the truth But one demon can manifest truth to another because the superior excel in natural knowledge Therefore the superior demons can enlighten the inferior Obj two Further a body abounding in light can enlighten a body deficient in light as the sun enlightens the moon But the superior demons abound in the participation of natural light Therefore it seems that the superior demons can enlighten the inferior On the contrary Enlightenment is not without cleansing and perfecting as stated above Q one hundred six A one But to cleanse does not befit the demons according to the words What can be made clean by the unclean Ecclus thirty four four Therefore neither can they enlighten I answer that There can be no enlightenment properly speaking among the demons For as above explained Q one hundred seven A two enlightenment properly speaking is the manifestation of the truth in reference to God Who enlightens every intellect Another kind of manifestation of the truth is speech as when one angel manifests his concept to another Now the demon s perversity does not lead one to order another to God but rather to lead away from the Divine order and so one demon does not enlighten another but one can make known his mental concept to another by way of speech Reply Obj one Not every kind of manifestation of the truth is enlightenment but only that which is above described Reply Obj two According to what belongs to natural knowledge there is no necessary manifestation of the truth either in the angels or in the demons because as above explained Q fifty five A two Q fifty eight A two Q seventy nine A two they know from the first all that belongs to their natural knowledge So the greater fulness of natural light in the superior demons does not prove that they can enlighten others FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred nine Art four Whether the Good Angels Have Precedence Over the Bad Angels Objection one It would seem that the good angels have no precedence over the bad angels For the angels precedence is especially connected with enlightenment But the bad angels being darkness are not enlightened by the good angels Therefore the good angels do not rule over the bad Obj two Further superiors are responsible as regards negligence for the evil deeds of their subjects But the demons do much evil Therefore if they are subject to the good angels it seems that negligence is to be charged to the good angels which cannot be admitted Obj three Further the angels precedence follows upon the order of nature as above explained A two But if the demons fell from every order as is commonly said many of the demons are superior to many good angels in the natural order Therefore the good angels have no precedence over all the bad angels On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iii that the treacherous and sinful spirit of life is ruled by the rational pious and just spirit of life and Gregory says Hom xxxiv that the Powers are the angels to whose charge are subjected the hostile powers I answer that The whole order of precedence is first and originally in God and it is shared by creatures accordingly as they are the nearer to God For those creatures which are more perfect and nearer to God have the power to act on others Now the greatest perfection and that which brings them nearest to God belongs to the creatures who enjoy God as the holy angels of which perfection the demons are deprived and therefore the good angels have precedence over the bad and these are ruled by them Reply Obj one Many things concerning Divine mysteries are made known by the holy angels to the bad angels whenever the Divine justice requires the demons to do anything for the punishment of the evil or for the trial of the good as in human affairs the judge s assessors make known his sentence to the executioners This revelation if compared to the angelic revealers can be called an enlightenment forasmuch as they direct it to God but it is not an enlightenment on the part of the demons for these do not direct it to God but to the fulfilment of their own wickedness Reply Obj two The holy angels are the ministers of the Divine wisdom Hence as the Divine wisdom permits some evil to be done by bad angels or men for the sake of the good that follows so also the good angels do not entirely restrain the bad from inflicting harm Reply Obj three An angel who is inferior in the natural order presides over demons although these may be naturally superior because the power of Divine justice to which the good angels cleave is stronger than the natural power of the angels Hence likewise among men the spiritual man judgeth all things one Cor two fifteen and the Philosopher says Ethic iii four x five that the virtuous man is the rule and measure of all human acts QUESTION one hundred ten HOW ANGELS ACT ON BODIES In Four Articles We now consider how the angels preside over the corporeal creatures Under this head there are four points of inquiry one Whether the corporeal creature is governed by the angels two Whether the corporeal creature obeys the mere will of the angels three Whether the angels by their own power can immediately move bodies locally four Whether the good or bad angels can work miracles FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred ten Art one Whether the Corporeal Creature Is Governed by the Angels Objection one It would seem that the corporeal creature is not governed by angels For whatever possesses a determinate mode of action needs not to be governed by any superior power for we require to be governed lest we do what we ought not But corporeal things have their actions determined by the nature divinely bestowed upon them Therefore they do not need the government of angels Obj two Further the lowest things are ruled by the superior But some corporeal things are inferior and others are superior Therefore they need not be governed by the angels Obj three Further the different orders of the angels are distinguished by different offices But if corporeal creatures were ruled by the angels there would be as many angelic offices as there are species of things So also there would be as many orders of angels as there are species of things which is against what is laid down above Q one hundred eight A two Therefore the corporeal creature is not governed by angels On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iii four that all bodies are ruled by the rational spirit of life and Gregory says Dial iv six that in this visible world nothing takes place without the agency of the invisible creature I answer that It is generally found both in human affairs and in natural things that every particular power is governed and ruled by the universal power as for example the bailiff s power is governed by the power of the king Among the angels also as explained above Q fifty five A three Q one hundred eight A one the superior angels who preside over the inferior possess a more universal knowledge Now it is manifest that the power of any individual body is more particular than the power of any spiritual substance for every corporeal form is a form individualized by matter and determined to the here and now whereas immaterial forms are absolute and intelligible Therefore as the inferior angels who have the less universal forms are ruled by the superior so are all corporeal things ruled by the angels This is not only laid down by the holy doctors but also by all philosophers who admit the existence of incorporeal substances Reply Obj one Corporeal things have determinate actions but they exercise such actions only according as they are moved because it belongs to a body not to act unless moved Hence a corporeal creature must be moved by a spiritual creature Reply Obj two The reason alleged is according to the opinion of Aristotle who laid down Metaph xi eight that the heavenly bodies are moved by spiritual substances the number of which he endeavored to assign according to the number of motions apparent in the heavenly bodies But he did not say that there were any spiritual substances with immediate rule over the inferior bodies except perhaps human souls and this was because he did not consider that any operations were exercised in the inferior bodies except the natural ones for which the movement of the heavenly bodies sufficed But because we assert that many things are done in the inferior bodies besides the natural corporeal actions for which the movements of the heavenly bodies are not sufficient therefore in our opinion we must assert that the angels possess an immediate presidency not only over the heavenly bodies but also over the inferior bodies Reply Obj three Philosophers have held different opinions about immaterial substances For Plato laid down that immaterial substances were types and species of sensible bodies and that some were more universal than others and so he held that immaterial substances preside immediately over all sensible bodies and different ones over different bodies But Aristotle held that immaterial substances are not the species of sensible bodies but something higher and more universal and so he did not attribute to them any immediate presiding over single bodies but only over the universal agents the heavenly bodies Avicenna followed a middle course For he agreed with Plato in supposing some spiritual substance to preside immediately in the sphere of active and passive elements because as Plato also said he held that the forms of these sensible things are derived from immaterial substances But he differed from Plato because he supposed only one immaterial substance to preside over all inferior bodies which he called the active intelligence The holy doctors held with the Platonists that different spiritual substances were placed over corporeal things For Augustine says QQ eighty three qu seventy nine Every visible thing in this world has an angelic power placed over it and Damascene says De Fide Orth ii four The devil was one of the angelic powers who presided over the terrestrial order and Origen says on the text When the ass saw the angel Num twenty two twenty three that the world has need of angels who preside over beasts and over the birth of animals and trees and plants and over the increase of all other things Hom xiv in Num The reason of this however is not that an angel is more fitted by his nature to preside over animals than over plants because each angel even the least has a higher and more universal power than any kind of corporeal things the reason is to be sought in the order of Divine wisdom Who places different rulers over different things Nor does it follow that there are more than nine orders of angels because as above expounded Q one hundred eight A two the orders are distinguished by their general offices Hence as according to Gregory all the angels whose proper office it is to preside over the demons are of the order of the powers so to the order of the virtues do those angels seem to belong who preside over purely corporeal creatures for by their ministration miracles are sometimes performed SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred ten Art two Whether Corporeal Matter Obeys the Mere Will of an Angel Objection one It would seem that corporeal matter obeys the mere will of an angel For the power of an angel excels the power of the soul But corporeal matter obeys a conception of the soul for the body of man is changed by a conception of the soul as regards heat and cold and sometimes even as regards health and sickness Therefore much more is corporeal matter changed by a conception of an angel Obj two Further whatever can be done by an inferior power can be done by a superior power Now the power of an angel is superior to corporeal power But a body by its power is able to transform corporeal matter as appears when fire begets fire Therefore much more efficaciously can an angel by his power transform corporeal matter Obj three Further all corporeal nature is under angelic administration as appears above A one and thus it appears that bodies are as instruments to the angels for an instrument is essentially a mover moved Now in effects there is something that is due to the power of their principal agents and which cannot be due to the power of the instrument and this it is that takes the principal place in the effect For example digestion is due to the force of natural heat which is the instrument of the nutritive soul but that living flesh is thus generated is due to the power of the soul Again the cutting of the wood is from the saw but that it assumes the length the form of a bed is from the design of the joiner s art Therefore the substantial form which takes the principal place in the corporeal effects is due to the angelic power Therefore matter obeys the angels in receiving its form On the contrary Augustine says It is not to be thought that this visible matter obeys these rebel angels for it obeys God alone I answer that The Platonists Phaedo xlix Tim Did vol ii p two hundred eighteen asserted that the forms which are in matter are caused by immaterial forms because they said that the material forms are participations of immaterial forms Avicenna followed them in this opinion to some extent for he said that all forms which are in matter proceed from the concept of the intellect and that corporeal agents only dispose matter for the forms They seem to have been deceived on this point through supposing a form to be something made per se so that it would be the effect of a formal principle But as the Philosopher proves Metaph vii Did vi eight what is made properly speaking is the composite for this properly speaking is as it were what subsists Whereas the form is called a being not as that which is but as that by which something is and consequently neither is a form properly speaking made for that is made which is since to be is nothing but the way to existence Now it is manifest that what is made is like to the maker forasmuch as every agent makes its like So whatever makes natural things has a likeness to the composite either because it is composite itself as when fire begets fire or because the whole composite as to both matter and form is within its power and this belongs to God alone Therefore every informing of matter is either immediately from God or form some corporeal agent but not immediately from an angel Reply Obj one Our soul is united to the body as the form and so it is not surprising for the body to be formally changed by the soul s concept especially as the movement of the sensitive appetite which is accompanied with a certain bodily change is subject to the command of reason An angel however has not the same connection with natural bodies and hence the argument does not hold Reply Obj two Whatever an inferior power can do that a superior power can do not in the same way but in a more excellent way for example the intellect knows sensible things in a more excellent way than sense knows them So an angel can change corporeal matter in a more excellent way than can corporeal agents that is by moving the corporeal agents themselves as being the superior cause Reply Obj three There is nothing to prevent some natural effect taking place by angelic power for which the power of corporeal agents would not suffice This however is not to obey an angel s will as neither does matter obey the mere will of a cook when by regulating the fire according to the prescription of his art he produces a dish that the fire could not have produced by itself since to reduce matter to the act of the substantial form does not exceed the power of a corporeal agent for it is natural for like to make like THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred ten Art three Whether Bodies Obey the Angels As Regards Local Motion Objection one It would seem that bodies do not obey the angels in local motion For the local motion of natural bodies follows on their forms But the angels do not cause the forms of natural bodies as stated above A two Therefore neither can they cause in them local motion Obj two Further the Philosopher Phys viii seven proves that local motion is the first of all movements But the angels cannot cause other movements by a formal change of the matter Therefore neither can they cause local motion Obj three Further the corporeal members obey the concept of the soul as regards local movement as having in themselves some principle of life In natural bodies however there is no vital principle Therefore they do not obey the angels in local motion On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iii eighty nine that the angels use corporeal seed to produce certain effects But they cannot do this without causing local movement Therefore bodies obey them in local motion I answer that As Dionysius says Div Nom vii Divine wisdom has joined the ends of the first to the principles of the second Hence it is clear that the inferior nature at its highest point is in conjunction with superior nature Now corporeal nature is below the spiritual nature But among all corporeal movements the most perfect is local motion as the Philosopher proves Phys viii seven The reason of this is that what is moved locally is not as such in potentiality to anything intrinsic but only to something extrinsic that is to place Therefore the corporeal nature has a natural aptitude to be moved immediately by the spiritual nature as regards place Hence also the philosophers asserted that the supreme bodies are moved locally by the spiritual substances whence we see that the soul moves the body first and chiefly by a local motion Reply Obj one There are in bodies other local movements besides those which result from the forms for instance the ebb and flow of the sea does not follow from the substantial form of the water but from the influence of the moon and much more can local movements result from the power of spiritual substances Reply Obj two The angels by causing local motion as the first motion can thereby cause other movements that is by employing corporeal agents to produce these effects as a workman employs fire to soften iron Reply Obj three The power of an angel is not so limited as is the power of the soul Hence the motive power of the soul is limited to the body united to it which is vivified by it and by which it can move other things But an angel s power is not limited to any body hence it can move locally bodies not joined to it FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred ten Art four Whether Angels Can Work Miracles Objection one It would seem that the angels can work miracles For Gregory says Hom xxxiv in Evang Those spirits are called virtues by whom signs and miracles are usually done Obj two Further Augustine says QQ eighty three qu seventy nine that magicians work miracles by private contracts good Christians by public justice bad Christians by the signs of public justice But magicians work miracles because they are heard by the demons as he says elsewhere in the same work Cf Liber xxi Sentent sent four among the supposititious works of saint Augustine Therefore the demons can work miracles Therefore much more can the good angels Obj three Further Augustine says in the same work Cf Liber xxi Sentent sent four among the supposititious works of saint Augustine that it is not absurd to believe that all the things we see happen may be brought about by the lower powers that dwell in our atmosphere But when an effect of natural causes is produced outside the order of the natural cause we call it a miracle as for instance when anyone is cured of a fever without the operation of nature Therefore the angels and demons can work miracles Obj four Further superior power is not subject to the order of an inferior cause But corporeal nature is inferior to an angel Therefore an angel can work outside the order of corporeal agents which is to work miracles On the contrary It is written of God Ps one hundred thirty five four Who alone doth great wonders I answer that A miracle properly so called is when something is done outside the order of nature But it is not enough for a miracle if something is done outside the order of any particular nature for otherwise anyone would perform a miracle by throwing a stone upwards as such a thing is outside the order of the stone s nature So for a miracle is required that it be against the order of the whole created nature But God alone can do this because whatever an angel or any other creature does by its own power is according to the order of created nature and thus it is not a miracle Hence God alone can work miracles Reply Obj one Some angels are said to work miracles either because God works miracles at their request in the same way as holy men are said to work miracles or because they exercise a kind of ministry in the miracles which take place as in collecting the dust in the general resurrection or by doing something of that kind Reply Obj two Properly speaking as said above miracles are those things which are done outside the order of the whole created nature But as we do not know all the power of created nature it follows that when anything is done outside the order of created nature by a power unknown to us it is called a miracle as regards ourselves So when the demons do anything of their own natural power these things are called miracles not in an absolute sense but in reference to ourselves In this way the magicians work miracles through the demons and these are said to be done by private contracts forasmuch as every power of the creature in the universe may be compared to the power of a private person in a city Hence when a magician does anything by compact with the devil this is done as it were by private contract On the other hand the Divine justice is in the whole universe as the public law is in the city Therefore good Christians so far as they work miracles by Divine justice are said to work miracles by public justice but bad Christians by the signs of public justice as by invoking the name of Christ or by making use of other sacred signs Reply Obj three Spiritual powers are able to effect whatever happens in this visible world by employing corporeal seeds by local movement Reply Obj four Although the angels can do something which is outside the order of corporeal nature yet they cannot do anything outside the whole created order which is essential to a miracle as above explained QUESTION one hundred eleven THE ACTION OF THE ANGELS ON MAN In Four Articles We now consider the action of the angels on man and inquire one How far they can change them by their own natural power two How they are sent by God to the ministry of men three How they guard and protect men Under the first head there are four points of inquiry one Whether an angel can enlighten the human intellect two Whether he can change man s will three Whether he can change man s imagination four Whether he can change man s senses FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred eleven Art one Whether an Angel Can Enlighten Man Objection one It would seem that an angel cannot enlighten man For man is enlightened by faith hence Dionysius Eccl Hier iii attributes enlightenment to baptism as the sacrament of faith But faith is immediately from God according to Eph two eight By grace you are saved through faith and that not of yourselves for it is the gift of God Therefore man is not enlightened by an angel but immediately by God Obj two Further on the words God hath manifested it to them Rom one nineteen the gloss observes that not only natural reason availed for the manifestation of Divine truths to men but God also revealed them by His work that is by His creature But both are immediately from God that is natural reason and the creature Therefore God enlightens man immediately Obj three Further whoever is enlightened is conscious of being enlightened But man is not conscious of being enlightened by angels Therefore he is not enlightened by them On the contrary Dionysius says Coel Hier iv that the revelation of Divine things reaches men through the ministry of the angels But such revelation is an enlightenment as we have stated Q one hundred six A one Q one hundred seven A two Therefore men are enlightened by the angels I answer that Since the order of Divine Providence disposes that lower things be subject to the actions of higher as explained above Q one hundred nine A two as the inferior angels are enlightened by the superior so men who are inferior to the angels are enlightened by them The modes of each of these kinds of enlightenment are in one way alike and in another way unlike For as was shown above Q one hundred six A one the enlightenment which consists in making known Divine truth has two functions namely according as the inferior intellect is strengthened by the action of the superior intellect and according as the intelligible species which are in the superior intellect are proposed to the inferior so as to be grasped thereby This takes place in the angels when the superior angel divides his universal concept of the truth according to the capacity of the inferior angel as explained above Q one hundred six A one The human intellect however cannot grasp the universal truth itself unveiled because its nature requires it to understand by turning to the phantasms as above explained Q eighty four A seven So the angels propose the intelligible truth to men under the similitudes of sensible things according to what Dionysius says Coel Hier i that It is impossible for the divine ray to shine on us otherwise than shrouded by the variety of the sacred veils On the other hand the human intellect as the inferior is strengthened by the action of the angelic intellect And in these two ways man is enlightened by an angel Reply Obj one Two dispositions concur in the virtue of faith first the habit of the intellect whereby it is disposed to obey the will tending to Divine truth For the intellect assents to the truth of faith not as convinced by the reason but as commanded by the will hence Augustine says No one believes except willingly In this respect faith comes from God alone Secondly faith requires that what is to be believed be proposed to the believer which is accomplished by man according to Rom ten seventeen Faith cometh by hearing principally however by the angels by whom Divine things are revealed to men Hence the angels have some part in the enlightenment of faith Moreover men are enlightened by the angels not only concerning what is to be believed but also as regards what is to be done Reply Obj two Natural reason which is immediately from God can be strengthened by an angel as we have said above Again the more the human intellect is strengthened so much higher an intelligible truth can be elicited from the species derived from creatures Thus man is assisted by an angel so that he may obtain from creatures a more perfect knowledge of God Reply Obj three Intellectual operation and enlightenment can be understood in two ways First on the part of the object understood thus whoever understands or is enlightened knows that he understands or is enlightened because he knows that the object is made known to him Secondly on the part of the principle and thus it does not follow that whoever understands a truth knows what the intellect is which is the principle of the intellectual operation In like manner not everyone who is enlightened by an angel knows that he is enlightened by him SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred eleven Art three Whether the Angels Can Change the Will of Man Objection one It would seem that the angels can change the will of man For upon the text Who maketh His angels spirits and His ministers a flame of fire Heb one seven the gloss notes that they are fire as being spiritually fervent and as burning away our vices This could not be however unless they changed the will Therefore the angels can change the will Obj two Further Bede says Super Matth xv eleven that the devil does not send wicked thoughts but kindles them Damascene however says that he also sends them for he remarks that every malicious act and unclean passion is contrived by the demons and put into men De Fide Orth ii four in like manner also the good angels introduce and kindle good thoughts But this could only be if they changed the will Therefore the will is changed by them Obj three Further the angel as above explained enlightens the human intellect by means of the phantasms But as the imagination which serves the intellect can be changed by an angel so can the sensitive appetite which serves the will because it also is a faculty using a corporeal organ Therefore as the angel enlightens the mind so can he change the will On the contrary To change the will belongs to God alone according to Prov twenty one one The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord whithersoever He will He shall turn it I answer that The will can be changed in two ways First from within in which way since the movement of the will is nothing but the inclination of the will to the thing willed God alone can thus change the will because He gives the power of such an inclination to the intellectual nature For as the natural inclination is from God alone Who gives the nature so the inclination of the will is from God alone Who causes the will Secondly the will is moved from without As regards an angel this can be only in one way by the good apprehended by the intellect Hence in as far as anyone may be the cause why anything be apprehended as an appetible good so far does he move the will In this way also God alone can move the will efficaciously but an angel and man move the will by way of persuasion as above explained Q one hundred six A two In addition to this mode the human will can be moved from without in another way namely by the passion residing in the sensitive appetite thus by concupiscence or anger the will is inclined to will something In this manner the angels as being able to rouse these passions can move the will not however by necessity for the will ever remains free to consent to or to resist the passion Reply Obj one Those who act as God s ministers either men or angels are said to burn away vices and to incite to virtue by way of persuasion Reply Obj two The demon cannot put thoughts in our minds by causing them from within since the act of the cogitative faculty is subject to the will nevertheless the devil is called the kindler of thoughts inasmuch as he incites to thought by the desire of the things thought of by way of persuasion or by rousing the passions Damascene calls this kindling a putting in because such a work is accomplished within But good thoughts are attributed to a higher principle namely God though they may be procured by the ministry of the angels Reply Obj three The human intellect in its present state can understand only by turning to the phantasms but the human will can will something following the judgment of reason rather than the passion of the sensitive appetite Hence the comparison does not hold THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred eleven Art three Whether an Angel Can Change Man s Imagination Objection one It would seem that an angel cannot change man s imagination For the phantasy as is said De Anima iii is a motion caused by the sense in act But if this motion were caused by an angel it would not be caused by the sense in act Therefore it is contrary to the nature of the phantasy which is the act of the imaginative faculty to be changed by an angel Obj two Further since the forms in the imagination are spiritual they are nobler than the forms existing in sensible matter But an angel cannot impress forms upon sensible matter Q one hundred ten A two Therefore he cannot impress forms on the imagination and so he cannot change it Obj three Further Augustine says general ad lit xii twelve One spirit by intermingling with another can communicate his knowledge to the other spirit by these images so that the latter either understands it himself or accepts it as understood by the other But it does not seem that an angel can be mingled with the human imagination nor that the imagination can receive the knowledge of an angel Therefore it seems that an angel cannot change the imagination Obj four Further in the imaginative vision man cleaves to the similitudes of the things as to the things themselves But in this there is deception So as a good angel cannot be the cause of deception it seems that he cannot cause the imaginative vision by changing the imagination On the contrary Those things which are seen in dreams are seen by imaginative vision But the angels reveal things in dreams as appears from Matt one twenty two thirteen nineteen in regard to the angel who appeared to Joseph in dreams Therefore an angel can move the imagination I answer that Both a good and a bad angel by their own natural power can move the human imagination This may be explained as follows For it was said above Q one hundred ten A three that corporeal nature obeys the angel as regards local movement so that whatever can be caused by the local movement of bodies is subject to the natural power of the angels Now it is manifest that imaginative apparitions are sometimes caused in us by the local movement of animal spirits and humors Hence Aristotle says De Somn et Vigil De Insomniis iii when assigning the cause of visions in dreams that when an animal sleeps the blood descends in abundance to the sensitive principle and movements descend with it that is the impressions left from the movements are preserved in the animal spirits and move the sensitive principle so that a certain appearance ensues as if the sensitive principle were being then changed by the external objects themselves Indeed the commotion of the spirits and humors may be so great that such appearances may even occur to those who are awake as is seen in mad people and the like So as this happens by a natural disturbance of the humors and sometimes also by the will of man who voluntarily imagines what he previously experienced so also the same may be done by the power of a good or a bad angel sometimes with alienation from the bodily senses sometimes without such alienation Reply Obj one The first principle of the imagination is from the sense in act For we cannot imagine what we have never perceived by the senses either wholly or partly as a man born blind cannot imagine color Sometimes however the imagination is informed in such a way that the act of the imaginative movement arises from the impressions preserved within Reply Obj two An angel changes the imagination not indeed by the impression of an imaginative form in no way previously received from the senses for he cannot make a man born blind imagine color but by local movement of the spirits and humors as above explained Reply Obj three The commingling of the angelic spirit with the human imagination is not a mingling of essences but by reason of an effect which he produces in the imagination in the way above stated so that he shows man what he the angel knows but not in the way he knows Reply Obj four An angel causing an imaginative vision sometimes enlightens the intellect at the same time so that it knows what these images signify and then there is no deception But sometimes by the angelic operation the similitudes of things only appear in the imagination but neither then is deception caused by the angel but by the defect in the intellect to whom such things appear Thus neither was Christ a cause of deception when He spoke many things to the people in parables which He did not explain to them FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred eleven Art four Whether an Angel Can Change the Human Senses Objection one It seems that an angel cannot change the human senses For the sensitive operation is a vital operation But such an operation does not come from an extrinsic principle Therefore the sensitive operation cannot be caused by an angel Obj two Further the sensitive operation is nobler than the nutritive But the angel cannot change the nutritive power nor other natural forms Therefore neither can he change the sensitive power Obj three Further the senses are naturally moved by the sensible objects But an angel cannot change the order of nature Q one hundred ten A four Therefore an angel cannot change the senses but these are changed always by the sensible object On the contrary The angels who overturned Sodom struck the people of Sodom with blindness or aorasia so that they could not find the door general nineteen eleven It is worth noting that these are the only two passages in the Greek version where the word aorasia appears It expresses in fact the effect produced on the people of Sodom namely dazzling French version eblouissement which the Latin caecitas blindness does not necessarily imply The same is recorded of the Syrians whom Eliseus led into Samaria four Kings six eighteen I answer that The senses may be changed in a twofold manner from without as when affected by the sensible object and from within for we see that the senses are changed when the spirits and humors are disturbed as for example a sick man s tongue charged with choleric humor tastes everything as bitter and the like with the other senses Now an angel by his natural power can work a change in the senses both ways For an angel can offer the senses a sensible object from without formed by nature or by the angel himself as when he assumes a body as we have said above Q fifty one A two Likewise he can move the spirits and humors from within as above remarked whereby the senses are changed in various ways Reply Obj one The principle of the sensitive operation cannot be without the interior principle which is the sensitive power but this interior principle can be moved in many ways by the exterior principle as above explained Reply Obj two By the interior movement of the spirits and humors an angel can do something towards changing the act of the nutritive power and also of the appetitive and sensitive power and of any other power using a corporeal organ Reply Obj three An angel can do nothing outside the entire order of creatures but he can outside some particular order of nature since he is not subject to that order thus in some special way an angel can work a change in the senses outside the common mode of nature QUESTION one hundred twelve THE MISSION OF THE ANGELS In Four Articles We next consider the mission of the angels Under this head arise four points of inquiry one Whether any angels are sent on works of ministry two Whether all are sent three Whether those who are sent assist four From what orders they are sent FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred twelve Art one Whether the Angels Are Sent on Works of Ministry Objection one It would seem that the angels are not sent on works of ministry For every mission is to some determinate place But intellectual actions do not determine a place for intellect abstracts from the here and now Since therefore the angelic actions are intellectual it appears that the angels are not sent to perform their own actions Obj two Further the empyrean heaven is the place that beseems the angelic dignity Therefore if they are sent to us in ministry it seems that something of their dignity would be lost which is unseemly Obj three Further external occupation hinders the contemplation of wisdom hence it is said He that is less in action shall receive wisdom Ecclus thirty eight twenty five So if some angels are sent on external ministrations they would seemingly be hindered from contemplation But the whole of their beatitude consists in the contemplation of God So if they were sent their beatitude would be lessened which is unfitting Obj four Further to minister is the part of an inferior hence it is written Luke twenty two twenty seven Which is the greater he that sitteth at table or he that serveth is not he that sitteth at table But the angels are naturally greater than we are Therefore they are not sent to administer to us On the contrary It is written Ex twenty three twenty Behold I will send My angels who shall go before thee I answer that From what has been said above Q one hundred eight A six it may be shown that some angels are sent in ministry by God For as we have already stated Q forty three A one in treating of the mission of the Divine Persons he is said to be sent who in any way proceeds from another so as to begin to be where he was not or to be in another way where he already was Thus the Son or the Holy Ghost is said to be sent as proceeding from the Father by origin and begins to be in a new way by grace or by the nature assumed where He was before by the presence of His Godhead for it belongs to God to be present everywhere because since He is the universal agent His power reaches to all being and hence He exists in all things Q eight A one An angel s power however as a particular agent does not reach to the whole universe but reaches to one thing in such a way as not to reach another and so he is here in such a manner as not to be there But it is clear from what was above stated Q one hundred ten A one that the corporeal creature is governed by the angels Hence whenever an angel has to perform any work concerning a corporeal creature the angel applies himself anew to that body by his power and in that way begins to be there afresh Now all this takes place by Divine command Hence it follows that an angel is sent by God Yet the action performed by the angel who is sent proceeds from God as from its first principle at Whose nod and by Whose authority the angels work and is reduced to God as to its last end Now this is what is meant by a minister for a minister is an intelligent instrument while an instrument is moved by another and its action is ordered to another Hence angels actions are called ministries and for this reason they are said to be sent in ministry Reply Obj one An operation can be intellectual in two ways In one way as dwelling in the intellect itself as contemplation such an operation does not demand to occupy a place indeed as Augustine says De Trin iv twenty Even we ourselves as mentally tasting something eternal are not in this world In another sense an action is said to be intellectual because it is regulated and commanded by some intellect in that sense the intellectual operations evidently have sometimes a determinate place Reply Obj two The empyrean heaven belongs to the angelic dignity by way of congruity forasmuch as it is congruous that the higher body should be attributed to that nature which occupies a rank above bodies Yet an angel does not derive his dignity from the empyrean heaven so when he is not actually in the empyrean heaven nothing of his dignity is lost as neither does a king lessen his dignity when not actually sitting on his regal throne which suits his dignity Reply Obj three In ourselves the purity of contemplation is obscured by exterior occupation because we give ourselves to action through the sensitive faculties the action of which when intense impedes the action of the intellectual powers An angel on the contrary regulates his exterior actions by intellectual operation alone Hence it follows that his external occupations in no respect impede his contemplation because given two actions one of which is the rule and the reason of the other one does not hinder but helps the other Wherefore Gregory says Moral ii that the angels do not go abroad in such a manner as to lose the delights of inward contemplation Reply Obj four In their external actions the angels chiefly minister to God and secondarily to us not because we are superior to them absolutely speaking but because since every man or angel by cleaving to God is made one spirit with God he is thereby superior to every creature Hence the Apostle says Phil two three Esteeming others better than themselves SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred twelve Art two Whether All the Angels Are Sent in Ministry Objection one It would seem that all the angels are sent in ministry For the Apostle says Heb one fourteen All are ministering spirits sent to minister Vulg Are they not all Obj two Further among the orders the highest is that of the Seraphim as stated above Q one hundred eight A six But a Seraph was sent to purify the lips of the prophet Isa six six seven Therefore much more are the inferior orders sent Obj three Further the Divine Persons infinitely excel all the angelic orders But the Divine Persons are sent Therefore much more are even the highest angels sent Obj four Further if the superior angels are not sent to the external ministries this can only be because the superior angels execute the Divine ministries by means of the inferior angels But as all the angels are unequal as stated above Q fifty A four each angel has an angel inferior to himself except the last one Therefore only the last angel would be sent in ministry which contradicts the words Thousands of thousands ministered to Him Dan seven ten On the contrary Gregory says Hom xxxiv in Evang quoting the statement of Dionysius Coel Hier xiii that the higher ranks fulfil no exterior service I answer that As appears from what has been said above Q one hundred six A three Q one hundred ten A one the order of Divine Providence has so disposed not only among the angels but also in the whole universe that inferior things are administered by the superior But the Divine dispensation however this order is sometimes departed from as regards corporeal things for the sake of a higher order that is according as it is suitable for the manifestation of grace That the man born blind was enlightened that Lazarus was raised from the dead was accomplished immediately by God without the action of the heavenly bodies Moreover both good and bad angels can work some effect in these bodies independently of the heavenly bodies by the condensation of the clouds to rain and by producing some such effects Nor can anyone doubt that God can immediately reveal things to men without the help of the angels and the superior angels without the inferior From this standpoint some have said that according to the general law the superior angels are not sent but only the inferior yet that sometimes by Divine dispensation the superior angels also are sent It may also be said that the Apostle wishes to prove that Christ is greater than the angels who were chosen as the messengers of the law in order that He might show the excellence of the new over the old law Hence there is no need to apply this to any other angels besides those who were sent to give the law Reply Obj two According to Dionysius Coel Hier xiii the angel who was sent to purify the prophet s lips was one of the inferior order but was called a Seraph that is kindling in an equivocal sense because he came to kindle the lips of the prophet It may also be said that the superior angels communicate their own proper gifts whereby they are denominated through the ministry of the inferior angels Thus one of the Seraphim is described as purifying by fire the prophet s lips not as if he did so immediately but because an inferior angel did so by his power as the Pope is said to absolve a man when he gives absolution by means of someone else Reply Obj three The Divine Persons are not sent in ministry but are said to be sent in an equivocal sense as appears from what has been said Q forty three A one Reply Obj four A manifold grade exists in the Divine ministries Hence there is nothing to prevent angels though unequal from being sent immediately in ministry in such a manner however that the superior are sent to the higher ministries and the lower to the inferior ministries THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred twelve Art three Whether All the Angels Who Are Sent Assist Objection one It would seem that the angels who are sent also assist For Gregory says Hom xxxiv in Evang So the angels are sent and assist for though the angelic spirit is limited yet the supreme Spirit God is not limited Obj two Further the angel was sent to administer to Tobias Yet he said I am the angel Raphael one of the seven who stand before the Lord Tob twelve fifteen Therefore the angels who are sent assist Obj three Further every holy angel is nearer to God than Satan is Yet Satan assisted God according to Job one six When the sons of God came to stand before the Lord Satan also was present among them Therefore much more do the angels who are sent to minister assist Obj four Further if the inferior angels do not assist the reason is because they receive the Divine enlightenment not immediately but through the superior angels But every angel receives the Divine enlightenment from a superior except the one who is highest of all Therefore only the highest angel would assist which is contrary to the text of Dan seven ten Ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood before Him Therefore the angels who are sent also assist On the contrary Gregory says on Job twenty five three Is there any numbering of His soldiers Moral xvii Those powers assist who do not go forth as messengers to men Therefore those who are sent in ministry do not assist I answer that The angels are spoken of as assisting and administering after the likeness of those who attend upon a king some of whom ever wait upon him and hear his commands immediately while others there are to whom the royal commands are conveyed by those who are in attendance for instance those who are placed at the head of the administration of various cities these are said to administer not to assist We must therefore observe that all the angels gaze upon the Divine Essence immediately in regard to which all even those who minister are said to assist Hence Gregory says Moral ii that those who are sent on the external ministry of our salvation can always assist and see the face of the Father Yet not all the angels can perceive the secrets of the Divine mysteries in the clearness itself of the Divine Essence but only the superior angels who announce them to the inferior and in that respect only the superior angels belonging to the highest hierarchy are said to assist whose special prerogative it is to be enlightened immediately by God From this may be deduced the reply to the first and second objections which are based on the first mode of assisting Reply Obj three Satan is not described as having assisted but as present among the assistants for as Gregory says Moral ii though he has lost beatitude still he has retained a nature like to the angels Reply Obj four All the assistants see some things immediately in the glory of the Divine Essence and so it may be said that it is the prerogative of the whole of the highest hierarchy to be immediately enlightened by God while the higher ones among them see more than is seen by the inferior some of whom enlighten others as also among those who assist the king one knows more of the king s secrets than another FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred twelve Art four Whether All the Angels of the Second Hierarchy Are Sent Objection one It would seem that all the angels of the second hierarchy are sent For all the angels either assist or minister according to Dan seven ten But the angels of the second hierarchy do not assist for they are enlightened by the angels of the first hierarchy as Dionysius says Coel Hier viii Therefore all the angels of the second hierarchy are sent in ministry Obj two Further Gregory says Moral xvii that there are more who minister than who assist This would not be the case if the angels of the second hierarchy were not sent in ministry Therefore all the angels of the second hierarchy are sent to minister On the contrary Dionysius says Coel Hier viii that the Dominations are above all subjection But to be sent implies subjection Therefore the dominations are not sent to minister I answer that As above stated A one to be sent to external ministry properly belongs to an angel according as he acts by Divine command in respect of any corporeal creature which is part of the execution of the Divine ministry Now the angelic properties are manifested by their names as Dionysius says Coel Hier vii and therefore the angels of those orders are sent to external ministry whose names signify some kind of administration But the name dominations does not signify any such administration but only disposition and command in administering On the other hand the names of the inferior orders imply administration for the Angels and Archangels are so called from announcing the Virtues and Powers are so called in respect of some act and it is right that the Prince according to what Gregory says Hom xxxiv in Evang be first among the workers Hence it belongs to these five orders to be sent to external ministry not to the four superior orders Reply Obj one The Dominations are reckoned among the ministering angels not as exercising but as disposing and commanding what is to be done by others thus an architect does not put his hands to the production of his art but only disposes and orders what others are to do Reply Obj two A twofold reason may be given in assigning the number of the assisting and ministering angels For Gregory says that those who minister are more numerous than those who assist because he takes the words Dan seven ten thousands of thousands ministered to Him not in a multiple but in a partitive sense to mean thousands out of thousands thus the number of those who minister is indefinite and signifies excess while the number of assistants is finite as in the words added and ten thousand times a hundred thousand assisted Him This explanation rests on the opinion of the Platonists who said that the nearer things are to the one first principle the smaller they are in number as the nearer a number is to unity the lesser it is than multitude This opinion is verified as regards the number of orders as six administer and three assist Dionysius however Coel Hier xiv declares that the multitude of angels surpasses all the multitude of material things so that as the superior bodies exceed the inferior in magnitude to an immeasurable degree so the superior incorporeal natures surpass all corporeal natures in multitude because whatever is better is more intended and more multiplied by God Hence as the assistants are superior to the ministers there will be more assistants than ministers In this way the words thousands of thousands are taken by way of multiplication to signify a thousand times a thousand And because ten times a hundred is a thousand if it were said ten times a hundred thousand it would mean that there are as many assistants as ministers but since it is written ten thousand times a hundred thousand we are given to understand that the assistants are much more numerous than the ministers Nor is this said to signify that this is the precise number of angels but rather that it is much greater in that it exceeds all material multitude This is signified by the multiplication together of all the greatest numbers namely ten a hundred and a thousand as Dionysius remarks in the same passage QUESTION one hundred thirteen OF THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE GOOD ANGELS In Eight Articles We next consider the guardianship exercised by the good angels and their warfare against the bad angels Under the first head eight points of inquiry arise one Whether men are guarded by the angels two Whether to each man is assigned a single guardian angel three Whether the guardianship belongs only to the lowest order of angels four Whether it is fitting for each man to have an angel guardian five When does an angel s guardianship of a man begin six Whether the angel guardians always watch over men seven Whether the angel grieves over the loss of the one guarded eight Whether rivalry exists among the angels as regards their guardianship FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred thirteen Art one Whether Men Are Guarded by the Angels Objection one It would seem that men are not guarded by the angels For guardians are deputed to some because they either know not how or are not able to guard themselves as children and the sick But man is able to guard himself by his free will and knows how by his natural knowledge of natural law Therefore man is not guarded by an angel Obj two Further a strong guard makes a weaker one superfluous But men are guarded by God according to Ps one hundred twenty four He shall neither slumber nor sleep that keepeth Israel Therefore man does not need to be guarded by an angel Obj three Further the loss of the guarded redounds to the negligence of the guardian hence it was said to a certain one Keep this man and if he shall slip away thy life shall be for his life three Kings twenty thirty nine Now many perish daily through falling into sin whom the angels could help by visible appearance or by miracles or in some such like way The angels would therefore be negligent if men are given to their guardianship But that is clearly false Therefore the angels are not the guardians of men On the contrary It is written Ps ninety eleven He hath given His angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways I answer that According to the plan of Divine Providence we find that in all things the movable and variable are moved and regulated by the immovable and invariable as all corporeal things by immovable spiritual substances and the inferior bodies by the superior which are invariable in substance We ourselves also are regulated as regards conclusions about which we may have various opinions by the principles which we hold in an invariable manner It is moreover manifest that as regards things to be done human knowledge and affection can vary and fail from good in many ways and so it was necessary that angels should be deputed for the guardianship of men in order to regulate them and move them to good Reply Obj one By free will man can avoid evil to a certain degree but not in any sufficient degree forasmuch as he is weak in affection towards good on account of the manifold passions of the soul Likewise universal natural knowledge of the law which by nature belongs to man to a certain degree directs man to good but not in a sufficient degree because in the application of the universal principles of law to particular actions man happens to be deficient in many ways Hence it is written Wis nine fourteen The thoughts of mortal men are fearful and our counsels uncertain Thus man needs to be guarded by the angels Reply Obj two Two things are required for a good action first that the affection be inclined to good which is effected in us by the habit of mortal virtue Secondly that reason should discover the proper methods to make perfect the good of virtue this the Philosopher Ethic vi attributes to prudence As regards the first God guards man immediately by infusing into him grace and virtues as regards the second God guards man as his universal instructor Whose precepts reach man by the medium of the angels as above stated Q one hundred eleven A one Reply Obj three As men depart from the natural instinct of good by reason of a sinful passion so also do they depart from the instigation of the good angels which takes place invisibly when they enlighten man that he may do what is right Hence that men perish is not to be imputed to the negligence of the angels but to the malice of men That they sometimes appear to men visibly outside the ordinary course of nature comes from a special grace of God as likewise that miracles occur outside the order of nature SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred thirteen Art two Whether Each Man Is Guarded by an Angel Objection one It would seem that each man is not guarded by an angel For an angel is stronger than a man But one man suffices to guard many men Therefore much more can one angel guard many men Obj two Further the lower things are brought to God through the medium of the higher as Dionysius says Coel Hier iv xiii But as all the angels are unequal Q fifty A four there is only one angel between whom and men there is no medium Therefore there is only one angel who immediately keeps men Obj three Further the greater angels are deputed to the greater offices But it is not a greater office to keep one man more than another since all men are naturally equal Since therefore of all the angels one is greater than another as Dionysius says Coel Hier x it seems that different men are not guarded by different angels On the contrary On the text Their angels in heaven et cetera Matt eight ten Jerome says Great is the dignity of souls for each one to have an angel deputed to guard it from its birth I answer that Each man has an angel guardian appointed to him This rests upon the fact that the guardianship of angels belongs to the execution of Divine providence concerning men But God s providence acts differently as regards men and as regards other corruptible creatures for they are related differently to incorruptibility For men are not only incorruptible in the common species but also in the proper forms of each individual which are the rational souls which cannot be said of other incorruptible things Now it is manifest that the providence of God is chiefly exercised towards what remains for ever whereas as regards things which pass away the providence of God acts so as to order their existence to the things which are perpetual Thus the providence of God is related to each man as it is to every genus or species of things corruptible But according to Gregory Hom xxxiv in Evang the different orders are deputed to the different genera of things for instance the Powers to coerce the demons the Virtues to work miracles in things corporeal while it is probable that the different species are presided over by different angels of the same order Hence it is also reasonable to suppose that different angels are appointed to the guardianship of different men Reply Obj one A guardian may be assigned to a man for two reasons first inasmuch as a man is an individual and thus to one man one guardian is due and sometimes several are appointed to guard one Secondly inasmuch as a man is part of a community and thus one man is appointed as guardian of a whole community to whom it belongs to provide what concerns one man in his relation to the whole community such as external works which are sources of strength or weakness to others But angel guardians are given to men also as regards invisible and occult things concerning the salvation of each one in his own regard Hence individual angels are appointed to guard individual men Reply Obj two As above stated Q one hundred twelve A three ad four all the angels of the first hierarchy are as to some things enlightened by God directly but as to other things only the superior are directly enlightened by God and these reveal them to the inferior And the same also applies to the inferior orders for a lower angel is enlightened in some respects by one of the highest and in other respects by the one immediately above him Thus it is possible that some one angel enlightens a man immediately and yet has other angels beneath him whom he enlightens Reply Obj three Although men are equal in nature still inequality exists among them according as Divine Providence orders some to the greater and others to the lesser things according to Ecclus thirty three eleven twelve With much knowledge the Lord hath divided them and diversified their ways some of them hath He blessed and exalted and some of them hath He cursed and brought low Thus it is a greater office to guard one man than another THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred thirteen Art three Whether to Guard Men Belongs Only to the Lowest Order of Angels Objection one It would seem that the guardianship of men does not belong only to the lowest order of the angels For Chrysostom says that the text Matt eighteen ten Their angels in heaven et cetera is to be understood not of any angels but of the highest Therefore the superior angels guard men Obj two Further the Apostle says that angels are sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation Heb one fourteen and thus it seems that the mission of the angels is directed to the guardianship of men But five orders are sent in external ministry Q one hundred twelve A four Therefore all the angels of the five orders are deputed to the guardianship of men Obj three Further for the guardianship of men it seems especially necessary to coerce the demons which belongs most of all to the Powers according to Gregory Hom xxxiv in Evang and to work miracles which belongs to the Virtues Therefore these orders are also deputed to the work of guardianship and not only the lowest order On the contrary In the Psalm ninety the guardianship of men is attributed to the angels who belong to the lowest order according to Dionysius Coel Hier v ix I answer that As above stated A two man is guarded in two ways in one way by particular guardianship according as to each man an angel is appointed to guard him and such guardianship belongs to the lowest order of the angels whose place it is according to Gregory to announce the lesser things for it seems to be the least of the angelic offices to procure what concerns the salvation of only one man The other kind of guardianship is universal multiplied according to the different orders For the more universal an agent is the higher it is Thus the guardianship of the human race belongs to the order of Principalities or perhaps to the Archangels whom we call the angel princes Hence Michael whom we call an archangel is also styled one of the princes Dan ten thirteen Moreover all corporeal creatures are guarded by the Virtues and likewise the demons by the Powers and the good spirits by the Principalities according to Gregory s opinion Hom xxxiv in Ev Reply Obj one Chrysostom can be taken to mean the highest in the lowest order of angels for as Dionysius says Coel Hier x in each order there are first middle and last It is however probable that the greater angels are deputed to keep those chosen by God for the higher degree of glory Reply Obj two Not all the angels who are sent have guardianship of individual men but some orders have a universal guardianship greater or less as above explained Reply Obj three Even inferior angels exercise the office of the superior as they share in their gifts and they are executors of the superiors power and in this way all the angels of the lowest order can coerce the demons and work miracles FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred thirteen Art four Whether Angels Are Appointed to the Guardianship of All Men Objection one It would seem that angels are not appointed to the guardianship of all men For it is written of Christ Phil two seven that He was made in the likeness of men and in habit found as a man If therefore angels are appointed to the guardianship of all men Christ also would have had an angel guardian But this is unseemly for Christ is greater than all the angels Therefore angels are not appointed to the guardianship of all men Obj two Further Adam was the first of all men But it was not fitting that he should have an angel guardian at least in the state of innocence for then he was not beset by any dangers Therefore angels are not appointed to the guardianship of all men Obj three Further angels are appointed to the guardianship of men that they may take them by the hand and guide them to eternal life encourage them to good works and protect them against the assaults of the demons But men who are foreknown to damnation never attain to eternal life Infidels also though at times they perform good works do not perform them well for they have not a right intention for faith directs the intention as Augustine says Enarr ii in Ps thirty one Moreover the coming of Antichrist will be according to the working of Satan as it is written two Thess two nine Therefore angels are not deputed to the guardianship of all men On the contrary is the authority of Jerome quoted above A two for he says that each soul has an angel appointed to guard it I answer that Man while in this state of life is as it were on a road by which he should journey towards heaven On this road man is threatened by many dangers both from within and from without according to Ps one hundred fifty nine four In this way wherein I walked they have hidden a snare for me And therefore as guardians are appointed for men who have to pass by an unsafe road so an angel guardian is assigned to each man as long as he is a wayfarer When however he arrives at the end of life he no longer has a guardian angel but in the kingdom he will have an angel to reign with him in hell a demon to punish him Reply Obj one Christ as man was guided immediately by the Word of God wherefore He needed not be guarded by an angel Again as regards His soul He was a comprehensor although in regard to His passible body He was a wayfarer In this latter respect it was right that He should have not a guardian angel as superior to Him but a ministering angel as inferior to Him Whence it is written Matt four eleven that angels came and ministered to Him Reply Obj two In the state of innocence man was not threatened by any peril from within because within him all was well ordered as we have said above Q ninety five AA one three But peril threatened from without on account of the snares of the demons as was proved by the event For this reason he needed a guardian angel Reply Obj three Just as the foreknown the infidels and even Antichrist are not deprived of the interior help of natural reason so neither are they deprived of that exterior help granted by God to the whole human race namely the guardianship of the angels And although the help which they receive therefrom does not result in their deserving eternal life by good works it does nevertheless conduce to their being protected from certain evils which would hurt both themselves and others For even the demons are held off by the good angels lest they hurt as much as they would In like manner Antichrist will not do as much harm as he would wish FIFTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred thirteen Art five Whether an Angel Is Appointed to Guard a Man from His Birth Objection one It would seem that an angel is not appointed to guard a man from his birth For angels are sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation as the Apostle says Heb one fourteen But men begin to receive the inheritance of salvation when they are baptized Therefore an angel is appointed to guard a man from the time of his baptism not of his birth Obj two Further men are guarded by angels in as far as angels enlighten and instruct them But children are not capable of instruction as soon as they are born for they have not the use of reason Therefore angels are not appointed to guard children as soon as they are born Obj three Further a child has a rational soul for some time before birth just as well as after But it does not appear that an angel is appointed to guard a child before its birth for they are not then admitted to the sacraments of the Church Therefore angels are not appointed to guard men from the moment of their birth On the contrary Jerome says vide A four that each soul has an angel appointed to guard it from its birth I answer that as Origen observes Tract v super Matt there are two opinions on this matter For some have held that the angel guardian is appointed at the time of baptism others that he is appointed at the time of birth The latter opinion Jerome approves loc cit and with reason For those benefits which are conferred by God on man as a Christian begin with his baptism such as receiving the Eucharist and the like But those which are conferred by God on man as a rational being are bestowed on him at his birth for then it is that he receives that nature Among the latter benefits we must count the guardianship of angels as we have said above AA one four Wherefore from the very moment of his birth man has an angel guardian appointed to him Reply Obj one Angels are sent to minister and that efficaciously indeed for those who shall receive the inheritance of salvation if we consider the ultimate effect of their guardianship which is the realizing of that inheritance But for all that the angelic ministrations are not withdrawn for others although they are not so efficacious as to bring them to salvation efficacious nevertheless they are inasmuch as they ward off many evils Reply Obj two Guardianship is ordained to enlightenment by instruction as to its ultimate and principal effect Nevertheless it has many other effects consistent with childhood for instance to ward off the demons and to prevent both bodily and spiritual harm Reply Obj three As long as the child is in the mother s womb it is not entirely separate but by reason of a certain intimate tie is still part of her just as the fruit while hanging on the tree is part of the tree And therefore it can be said with some degree of probability that the angel who guards the mother guards the child while in the womb But at its birth when it becomes separate from the mother an angel guardian is appointed to it as Jerome above quoted says SIXTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred thirteen Art six Whether the Angel Guardian Ever Forsakes a Man Objection one It would seem that the angel guardian sometimes forsakes the man whom he is appointed to guard For it is said Jer fifty one nine in the person of the angels We would have cured Babylon but she is not healed let us forsake her And Isa five five it is written I will take away the hedge that is the guardianship of the angels gloss and it shall be wasted Obj two Further God s guardianship excels that of the angels But God forsakes man at times according to Ps twenty one two O God my God look upon me why hast Thou forsaken me Much rather therefore does an angel guardian forsake man Obj three Further according to Damascene De Fide Orth ii three When the angels are here with us they are not in heaven But sometimes they are in heaven Therefore sometimes they forsake us On the contrary The demons are ever assailing us according to one Pet five eight Your adversary the devil as a roaring lion goeth about seeking whom he may devour Much more therefore do the good angels ever guard us I answer that As appears above A two the guardianship of the angels is an effect of Divine providence in regard to man Now it is evident that neither man nor anything at all is entirely withdrawn from the providence of God for in as far as a thing participates being so far is it subject to the providence that extends over all being God indeed is said to forsake man according to the ordering of His providence but only in so far as He allows man to suffer some defect of punishment or of fault In like manner it must be said that the angel guardian never forsakes a man entirely but sometimes he leaves him in some particular for instance by not preventing him from being subject to some trouble or even from falling into sin according to the ordering of Divine judgments In this sense Babylon and the House of Israel are said to have been forsaken by the angels because their angel guardians did not prevent them from being subject to tribulation From this the answers are clear to the first and second objections Reply Obj three Although an angel may forsake a man sometimes locally he does not for that reason forsake him as to the effect of his guardianship for even when he is in heaven he knows what is happening to man nor does he need time for his local motion for he can be with man in an instant SEVENTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred thirteen Art seven Whether Angels Grieve for the Ills of Those Whom They Guard Objection one It would seem that angels grieve for the ills of those whom they guard For it is written Isa thirty three seven The angels of peace shall weep bitterly But weeping is a sign of grief and sorrow Therefore angels grieve for the ills of those whom they guard Obj two Further according to Augustine De Civ Dei xiv fifteen sorrow is for those things that happen against our will But the loss of the man whom he has guarded is against the guardian angel s will Therefore angels grieve for the loss of men Obj three Further as sorrow is contrary to joy so penance is contrary to sin But angels rejoice about one sinner doing penance as we are told Luke fifteen seven Therefore they grieve for the just man who falls into sin Obj four Further on Numbers eighteen twelve Whatsoever first fruits they offer et cetera the gloss of Origen says The angels are brought to judgment as to whether men have fallen through their negligence or through their own fault But it is reasonable for anyone to grieve for the ills which have brought him to judgment Therefore angels grieve for men s sins On the contrary Where there is grief and sorrow there is not perfect happiness wherefore it is written Apoc twenty one four Death shall be no more nor mourning nor crying nor sorrow But the angels are perfectly happy Therefore they have no cause for grief I answer that Angels do not grieve either for sins or for the pains inflicted on men For grief and sorrow according to Augustine De Civ Dei xiv fifteen are for those things which occur against our will But nothing happens in the world contrary to the will of the angels and the other blessed because their will cleaves entirely to the ordering of Divine justice while nothing happens in the world save what is effected or permitted by Divine justice Therefore simply speaking nothing occurs in the world against the will of the blessed For as the Philosopher says Ethic iii one that is called simply voluntary which a man wills in a particular case and at a particular time having considered all the circumstances although universally speaking such a thing would not be voluntary thus the sailor does not will the casting of his cargo into the sea considered universally and absolutely but on account of the threatened danger of his life he wills it Wherefore this is voluntary rather than involuntary as stated in the same passage Therefore universally and absolutely speaking the angels do not will sin and the pains inflicted on its account but they do will the fulfilment of the ordering of Divine justice in this matter in respect of which some are subjected to pains and are allowed to fall into sin Reply Obj one These words of Isaias may be understood of the angels i e the messengers of Ezechias who wept on account of the words of Rabsaces as related Isa thirty seven two seqq this would be the literal sense According to the allegorical sense the angels of peace are the apostles and preachers who weep for men s sins If according to the anagogical sense this passage be expounded of the blessed angels then the expression is metaphorical and signifies that universally speaking the angels will the salvation of mankind for in this sense we attribute passions to God and the angels The reply to the second objection appears from what has been said Reply Obj three Both in man s repentance and in man s sin there is one reason for the angel s joy namely the fulfilment of the ordering of the Divine Providence Reply Obj four The angels are brought into judgment for the sins of men not as guilty but as witnesses to convict man of weakness EIGHTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred thirteen Art eight Whether There Can Be Strife or Discord Among the Angels Objection one It would seem that there can be no strife or discord among the angels For it is written Job twenty five two Who maketh peace in His high places But strife is opposed to peace Therefore among the high angels there is no strife Obj two Further where there is perfect charity and just authority there can be no strife But all this exists among the angels Therefore there is no strife among the angels Obj three Further if we say that angels strive for those whom they guard one angel must needs take one side and another angel the opposite side But if one side is in the right the other side is in the wrong It will follow therefore that a good angel is a compounder of wrong which is unseemly Therefore there is no strife among good angels On the contrary It is written Dan ten thirteen The prince of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me one and twenty days But this prince of the Persians was the angel deputed to the guardianship of the kingdom of the Persians Therefore one good angel resists the others and thus there is strife among them I answer that The raising of this question is occasioned by this passage of Daniel Jerome explains it by saying that the prince of the kingdom of the Persians is the angel who opposed the setting free of the people of Israel for whom Daniel was praying his prayers being offered to God by Gabriel And this resistance of his may have been caused by some prince of the demons having led the Jewish captives in Persia into sin which sin was an impediment to the efficacy of the prayer which Daniel put up for that same people But according to Gregory Moral xvii the prince of the kingdom of Persia was a good angel appointed to the guardianship of that kingdom To see therefore how one angel can be said to resist another we must note that the Divine judgments in regard to various kingdoms and various men are executed by the angels Now in their actions the angels are ruled by the Divine decree But it happens at times in various kingdoms or various men there are contrary merits or demerits so that one of them is subject to or placed over another As to what is the ordering of Divine wisdom on such matters the angels cannot know it unless God reveal it to them and so they need to consult Divine wisdom thereupon Wherefore forasmuch as they consult the Divine will concerning various contrary and opposing merits they are said to resist one another not that their wills are in opposition since they are all of one mind as to the fulfilment of the Divine decree but that the things about which they seek knowledge are in opposition From this the answers to the objections are clear QUESTION one hundred fourteen OF THE ASSAULTS OF THE DEMONS In Five Articles We now consider the assaults of the demons Under this head there are five points of inquiry one Whether men are assailed by the demons two Whether to tempt is proper to the devil three Whether all the sins of men are to be set down to the assaults or temptations of the demons four Whether they can work real miracles for the purpose of leading men astray five Whether the demons who are overcome by men are hindered from making further assaults FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred fourteen Art one Whether Men Are Assailed by the Demons Objection one It would seem that men are not assailed by the demons For angels are sent by God to guard man But demons are not sent by God for the demons intention is the loss of souls whereas God s is the salvation of souls Therefore demons are not deputed to assail man Obj two Further it is not a fair fight for the weak to be set against the strong and the ignorant against the astute But men are weak and ignorant whereas the demons are strong and astute It is not therefore to be permitted by God the author of all justice that men should be assailed by demons Obj three Further the assaults of the flesh and the world are enough for man s exercise But God permits His elect to be assailed that they may be exercised Therefore there is no need for them to be assailed by the demons On the contrary The Apostle says Eph six twelve Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood but against Principalities and Powers against the rulers of the world of this darkness against the spirits of wickedness in the high places I answer that Two things may be considered in the assault of the demons the assault itself and the ordering thereof The assault itself is due to the malice of the demons who through envy endeavor to hinder man s progress and through pride usurp a semblance of Divine power by deputing certain ministers to assail man as the angels of God in their various offices minister to man s salvation But the ordering of the assault is from God Who knows how to make orderly use of evil by ordering it to good On the other hand in regard to the angels both their guardianship and the ordering thereof are to be referred to God as their first author Reply Obj one The wicked angels assail men in two ways Firstly by instigating them to sin and thus they are not sent by God to assail us but are sometimes permitted to do so according to God s just judgments But sometimes their assault is a punishment to man and thus they are sent by God as the lying spirit was sent to punish Achab King of Israel as is related in three Kings twenty two twenty For punishment is referred to God as its first author Nevertheless the demons who are sent to punish do so with an intention other than that for which they are sent for they punish from hatred or envy whereas they are sent by God on account of His justice Reply Obj two In order that the conditions of the fight be not unequal there is as regards man the promised recompense to be gained principally through the grace of God secondarily through the guardianship of the angels Wherefore four Kings six sixteen Eliseus said to his servant Fear not for there are more with us than with them Reply Obj three The assault of the flesh and the world would suffice for the exercise of human weakness but it does not suffice for the demon s malice which makes use of both the above in assailing men But by the Divine ordinance this tends to the glory of the elect SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred fourteen Art two Whether to Tempt Is Proper to the Devil Objection one It would seem that to tempt is not proper to the devil For God is said to tempt according to general twenty two one God tempted Abraham Moreover man is tempted by the flesh and the world Again man is said to tempt God and to tempt man Therefore it is not proper to the devil to tempt Obj two Further to tempt is a sign of ignorance But the demons know what happens among men Therefore the demons do not tempt Obj three Further temptation is the road to sin Now sin dwells in the will Since therefore the demons cannot change man s will as appears from what has been said above Q one hundred eleven A two it seems that it is not in their province to tempt On the contrary It is written one Thess three five Lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you to which the gloss adds that is the devil whose office it is to tempt I answer that To tempt is properly speaking to make trial of something Now we make trial of something in order to know something about it hence the immediate end of every tempter is knowledge But sometimes another end either good or bad is sought to be acquired through that knowledge a good end when for instance one desires to know of someone what sort of a man he is as to knowledge or virtue with a view to his promotion a bad end when that knowledge is sought with the purpose of deceiving or ruining him From this we can gather how various beings are said to tempt in various ways For man is said to tempt sometimes indeed merely for the sake of knowing something and for this reason it is a sin to tempt God for man being uncertain as it were presumes to make an experiment of God s power Sometimes too he tempts in order to help sometimes in order to hurt The devil however always tempts in order to hurt by urging man into sin In this sense it is said to be his proper office to tempt for thought at times man tempts thus he does this as minister of the devil God is said to tempt that He may know in the same sense as that is said to know which makes others to know Hence it is written Deut thirteen three The Lord your God trieth you that it may appear whether you love him The flesh and the world are said to tempt as the instruments or matter of temptations inasmuch as one can know what sort of man someone is according as he follows or resists the desires of the flesh and according as he despises worldly advantages and adversity of which things the devil also makes use in tempting Thus the reply to the first objection is clear Reply Obj two The demons know what happens outwardly among men but the inward disposition of man God alone knows Who is the weigher of spirits Prov sixteen two It is this disposition that makes man more prone to one vice than to another hence the devil tempts in order to explore this inward disposition of man so that he may tempt him to that vice to which he is most prone Reply Obj three Although a demon cannot change the will yet as stated above Q one hundred eleven A three he can change the inferior powers of man in a certain degree by which powers though the will cannot be forced it can nevertheless be inclined THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred fourteen Art three Whether All Sins Are Due to the Temptation of the Devil Objection one It would seem that all sins are due to the temptation of the devil For Dionysius says Div Nom iv that the multitude of demons is the cause of all evils both to themselves and to others And Damascene says De Fide Orth ii four that all malice and all uncleanness have been devised by the devil Obj two Further of every sinner can be said what the Lord said of the Jews John eight forty four You are of your father the devil But this was in as far as they sinned through the devil s instigation Therefore every sin is due to the devil s instigation Obj three Further as angels are deputed to guard men so demons are deputed to assail men But every good thing we do is due to the suggestion of the good angels because the Divine gifts are borne to us by the angels Therefore all the evil we do is due to the instigation of the devil On the contrary It is written De Eccl Dogmat xlix Not all our evil thoughts are stirred up by the devil but sometimes they arise from the movement of our free will I answer that One thing can be the cause of another in two ways directly and indirectly Indirectly as when an agent is the cause of a disposition to a certain effect it is said to be the occasional and indirect cause of that effect for instance we might say that he who dries the wood is the cause of the wood burning In this way we must admit that the devil is the cause of all our sins because he it was who instigated the first man to sin from whose sin there resulted a proneness to sin in the whole human race and in this sense we must take the words of Damascene and Dionysius But a thing is said to be the direct cause of something when its action tends directly thereunto And in this way the devil is not the cause of every sin for all sins are not committed at the devil s instigation but some are due to the free will and the corruption of the flesh For as Origen says Peri Archon iii even if there were no devil men would have the desire for food and love and such like pleasures with regard to which many disorders may arise unless those desires are curbed by reason especially if we presuppose the corruption of our natures Now it is in the power of the free will to curb this appetite and keep it in order Consequently there is no need for all sins to be due to the instigation of the devil But those sins which are due thereto man perpetrates through being deceived by the same blandishments as were our first parents as Isidore says De Summo Bono ii Thus the answer to the first objection is clear Reply Obj two When man commits sin without being thereto instigated by the devil he nevertheless becomes a child of the devil thereby in so far as he imitates him who was the first to sin Reply Obj three Man can of his own accord fall into sin but he cannot advance in merit without the Divine assistance which is borne to man by the ministry of the angels For this reason the angels take part in all our good works whereas all our sins are not due to the demons instigation Nevertheless there is no kind of sin which is not sometimes due to the demons suggestion FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred fourteen Art four Whether Demons Can Lead Men Astray by Means of Real Miracles Objection one It would seem that the demons cannot lead men astray by means of real miracles For the activity of the demons will show itself especially in the works of Antichrist But as the Apostle says two Thess two nine his coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and signs and lying wonders Much more therefore at other times do the demons perform lying wonders Obj two Further true miracles are wrought by some corporeal change But demons are unable to change the nature of a body for Augustine says De Civ Dei xviii eighteen I cannot believe that the human body can receive the limbs of a beast by means of a demon s art or power Therefore the demons cannot work real miracles Obj three Further an argument is useless which may prove both ways If therefore real miracles can be wrought by demons to persuade one of what is false they will be useless to confirm the teaching of the faith This is unfitting for it is written Mk sixteen twenty The Lord working withal and confirming the word with signs that followed On the contrary Augustine says Q eighty three Lib xxi Sent sent four among the supposititious works of saint Augustine Often by means of the magic art miracles are wrought like those which are wrought by the servants of God I answer that As is clear from what has been said above Q one hundred ten A four if we take a miracle in the strict sense the demons cannot work miracles nor can any creature but God alone since in the strict sense a miracle is something done outside the order of the entire created nature under which order every power of a creature is contained But sometimes miracle may be taken in a wide sense for whatever exceeds the human power and experience And thus demons can work miracles that is things which rouse man s astonishment by reason of their being beyond his power and outside his sphere of knowledge For even a man by doing what is beyond the power and knowledge of another leads him to marvel at what he has done so that in a way he seems to that man to have worked a miracle It is to be noted however that although these works of demons which appear marvelous to us are not real miracles they are sometimes nevertheless something real Thus the magicians of Pharaoh by the demons power produced real serpents and frogs And when fire came down from heaven and at one blow consumed Job s servants and sheep when the storm struck down his house and with it his children these were the work of Satan not phantoms as Augustine says De Civ Dei xx nineteen Reply Obj one As Augustine says in the same place the works of Antichrist may be called lying wonders either because he will deceive men s senses by means of phantoms so that he will not really do what he will seem to do or because if he work real prodigies they will lead those into falsehood who believe in him Reply Obj two As we have said above Q one hundred ten A two corporeal matter does not obey either good or bad angels at their will so that demons be able by their power to transmute matter from one form to another but they can employ certain seeds that exist in the elements of the world in order to produce these effects as Augustine says De Trin iii eight nine Therefore it must be admitted that all the transformation of corporeal things which can be produced by certain natural powers to which we must assign the seeds above mentioned can alike be produced by the operation of the demons by the employment of these seeds such as the transformation of certain things into serpents or frogs which can be produced by putrefaction On the contrary those transformations which cannot be produced by the power of nature cannot in reality be effected by the operation of the demons for instance that the human body be changed into the body of a beast or that the body of a dead man return to life And if at times something of this sort seems to be effected by the operation of demons it is not real but a mere semblance of reality Now this may happen in two ways Firstly from within in this way a demon can work on man s imagination and even on his corporeal senses so that something seems otherwise that it is as explained above Q one hundred eleven AA thirty four It is said indeed that this can be done sometimes by the power of certain bodies Secondly from without for just as he can from the air form a body of any form and shape and assume it so as to appear in it visibly so in the same way he can clothe any corporeal thing with any corporeal form so as to appear therein This is what Augustine says De Civ Dei xviii eighteen Man s imagination which whether thinking or dreaming takes the forms of an innumerable number of things appears to other men s senses as it were embodied in the semblance of some animal This not to be understood as though the imagination itself or the images formed therein were identified with that which appears embodied to the senses of another man but that the demon who forms an image in a man s imagination can offer the same picture to another man s senses Reply Obj three As Augustine says QQ eighty three qu seventy nine When magicians do what holy men do they do it for a different end and by a different right The former do it for their own glory the latter for the glory of God the former by certain private compacts the latter by the evident assistance and command of God to Whom every creature is subject FIFTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred fourteen Art five Whether a Demon Who Is Overcome by Man Is for This Reason Hindered from Making Further Assaults Objection one It would seem that a demon who is overcome by a man is not for that reason hindered from any further assault For Christ overcame the tempter most effectively Yet afterwards the demon assailed Him by instigating the Jews to kill Him Therefore it is not true that the devil when conquered ceases his assaults Obj two Further to inflict punishment on one who has been worsted in a fight is to incite him to a sharper attack But this is not befitting God s mercy Therefore the conquered demons are not prevented from further assaults On the contrary It is written Matt four eleven Then the devil left Him i e Christ Who overcame I answer that Some say that when once a demon has been overcome he can no more tempt any man at all neither to the same nor to any other sin And others say that he can tempt others but not the same man This seems more probable as long as we understand it to be so for a certain definite time wherefore Luke four thirteen it is written All temptation being ended the devil departed from Him for a time There are two reasons for this One is on the part of God s clemency for as Chrysostom says Super Matt Hom v In the Opus Imperfectum among his supposititious works the devil does not tempt man for just as long as he likes but for as long as God allows for although He allows him to tempt for a short time He orders him off on account of our weakness The other reason is taken from the astuteness of the devil As to this Ambrose says on Luke four thirteen The devil is afraid of persisting because he shrinks from frequent defeat That the devil does nevertheless sometimes return to the assault is apparent from Matt twelve forty four I will return into my house from whence I came out From what has been said the objections can easily be solved QUESTION one hundred fifteen OF THE ACTION OF THE CORPOREAL CREATURE In Six Articles We have now to consider the action of the corporeal creature and fate which is ascribed to certain bodies Concerning corporeal actions there are six points of inquiry one Whether a body can be active two Whether there exist in bodies certain seminal virtues three Whether the heavenly bodies are the causes of what is done here by the inferior bodies four Whether they are the cause of human acts five Whether demons are subject to their influence six Whether the heavenly bodies impose necessity on those things which are subject to their influence FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred fifteen Art one Whether a Body Can Be Active Objection one It would seem that no bodies are active For Augustine says De Civ Dei v nine There are things that are acted upon but do not act such are bodies there is one Who acts but is not acted upon this is God there are things that both act and are acted upon these are the spiritual substances Obj two Further every agent except the first agent requires in its work a subject susceptible of its action But there is not substance below the corporeal substance which can be susceptible of the latter s action since it belongs to the lowest degree of beings Therefore corporeal substance is not active Obj three Further every corporeal substance is limited by quantity But quantity hinders substance from movement and action because it surrounds it and penetrates it just as a cloud hinders the air from receiving light A proof of this is that the more a body increases in quantity the heavier it is and the more difficult to move Therefore no corporeal substance is active Obj four Further the power of action in every agent is according to its propinquity to the first active cause But bodies being most composite are most remote from the first active cause which is most simple Therefore no bodies are active Obj five Further if a body is an agent the term of its action is either a substantial or an accidental form But it is not a substantial form for it is not possible to find in a body any principle of action save an active quality which is an accident and an accident cannot be the cause of a substantial form since the cause is always more excellent than the effect Likewise neither is it an accidental form for an accident does not extend beyond its subject as Augustine says De Trin ix four Therefore no bodies are active On the contrary Dionysius says Coel Hier xv that among other qualities of corporeal fire it shows its greatness in its action and power on that of which it lays hold I answer that It is apparent to the senses that some bodies are active But concerning the action of bodies there have been three errors For some denied all action to bodies This is the opinion of Avicebron in his book on The Fount of Life where by the arguments mentioned above he endeavors to prove that no bodies act but that all the actions which seem to be the actions of bodies are the actions of some spiritual power that penetrates all bodies so that according to him it is not fire that heats but a spiritual power which penetrates by means of the fire And this opinion seems to be derived from that of Plato For Plato held that all forms existing in corporeal matter are participated thereby and determined and limited thereto and that separate forms are absolute and as it were universal wherefore he said that these separate forms are the causes of forms that exist in matter Therefore inasmuch as the form which is in corporeal matter is determined to this matter individualized by quantity Avicebron held that the corporeal form is held back and imprisoned by quantity as the principle of individuality so as to be unable by action to extend to any other matter and that the spiritual and immaterial form alone which is not hedged in by quantity can issue forth by acting on something else But this does not prove that the corporeal form is not an agent but that it is not a universal agent For in proportion as a thing is participated so of necessity must that be participated which is proper thereto thus in proportion to the participation of light is the participation of visibility But to act which is nothing else than to make something to be in act is essentially proper to an act as such wherefore every agent produces its like So therefore to the fact of its being a form not determined by matter subject to quantity a thing owes its being an agent indeterminate and universal but to the fact that it is determined to this matter it owes its being an agent limited and particular Wherefore if the form of fire were separate as the Platonists supposed it would be in a fashion the cause of every ignition But this form of fire which is in this corporeal matter is the cause of this ignition which passes from this body to that Hence such an action is effected by the contact of two bodies But this opinion of Avicebron goes further than that of Plato For Plato held only substantial forms to be separate while he referred accidents to the material principles which are the great and the small which he considered to be the first contraries by others considered to the the rare and the dense Consequently both Plato and Avicenna who follows him to a certain extent held that corporeal agents act through their accidental forms by disposing matter for the substantial form but that the ultimate perfection attained by the introduction of the substantial form is due to an immaterial principle And this is the second opinion concerning the action of bodies of which we have spoken above when treating of the creation Q forty five A eight The third opinion is that of Democritus who held that action takes place through the issue of atoms from the corporeal agent while passion consists in the reception of the atoms in the pores of the passive body This opinion is disproved by Aristotle De Gener i eight nine For it would follow that a body would not be passive as a whole and the quantity of the active body would be diminished through its action which things are manifestly untrue We must therefore say that a body acts forasmuch as it is in act on a body forasmuch as it is in potentiality Reply Obj one This passage of Augustine is to be understood of the whole corporeal nature considered as a whole which thus has no nature inferior to it on which it can act as the spiritual nature acts on the corporeal and the uncreated nature on the created Nevertheless one body is inferior to another forasmuch as it is in potentiality to that which the other has in act From this follows the solution of the second objection But it must be observed when Avicebron argues thus There is a mover who is not moved to wit the first maker of all therefore on the other hand there exists something moved which is purely passive that this is to be conceded But this latter is primary matter which is a pure potentiality just as God is pure act Now a body is composed of potentiality and act and therefore it is both active and passive Reply Obj three Quantity does not entirely hinder the corporeal form from action as stated above but from being a universal agent forasmuch as a form is individualized through being in matter subject to quantity The proof taken from the weight of bodies is not to the purpose First because addition of quantity does not cause weight as is proved De Coelo et Mundo iv two Secondly it is false that weight retards movement on the contrary the heavier a thing the greater its movement if we consider the movement proper thereto Thirdly because action is not effected by local movement as Democritus held but by something being reduced from potentiality to act Reply Obj four A body is not that which is most distant from God for it participates something of a likeness to the Divine Being forasmuch as it has a form That which is most distant from God is primary matter which is in no way active since it is a pure potentiality Reply Obj five The term of a body s action is both an accidental form and a substantial form For the active quality such as heat although itself an accident acts nevertheless by virtue of the substantial form as its instrument wherefore its action can terminate in a substantial form thus natural heat as the instrument of the soul has an action terminating in the generation of flesh But by its own virtue it produces an accident Nor is it against the nature of an accident to surpass its subject in acting but it is to surpass it in being unless indeed one were to imagine that an accident transfers its identical self from the agent to the patient thus Democritus explained action by an issue of atoms SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred fifteen Art two Whether There Are Any Seminal Virtues in Corporeal Matter Objection one It would seem that there are no seminal virtues in corporeal matter For virtue ratio implies something of a spiritual order But in corporeal matter nothing exists spiritually but only materially that is according to the mode of that in which it is Therefore there are no seminal virtues in corporeal matter Obj two Further Augustine De Trin iii eight nine says that demons produce certain results by employing with a hidden movement certain seeds which they know to exist in matter But bodies not virtues can be employed with local movement Therefore it is unreasonable to say that there are seminal virtues in corporeal matter Obj three Further seeds are active principles But there are no active principles in corporeal matter since as we have said above matter is not competent to act A one ad two four Therefore there are no seminal virtues in corporeal matter Obj four Further there are said to be certain causal virtues Augustine De general ad lit v four which seem to suffice for the production of things But seminal virtues are not causal virtues for miracles are outside the scope of seminal virtues but not of causal virtues Therefore it is unreasonable to say that there are seminal virtues in corporeal matter On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iii eight Of all the things which are generated in a corporeal and visible fashion certain seeds lie hidden in the corporeal things of this world I answer that It is customary to name things after what is more perfect as the Philosopher says De Anima ii four Now in the whole corporeal nature living bodies are the most perfect wherefore the word nature has been transferred from living things to all natural things For the word itself nature as the Philosopher says Metaph v Did iv four was first applied to signify the generation of living things which is called nativity and because living things are generated from a principle united to them as fruit from a tree and the offspring from the mother to whom it is united consequently the word nature has been applied to every principle of movement existing in that which is moved Now it is manifest that the active and passive principles of the generation of living things are the seeds from which living things are generated Therefore Augustine fittingly gave the name of seminal virtues seminales rationes to all those active and passive virtues which are the principles of natural generation and movement These active and passive virtues may be considered in several orders For in the first place as Augustine says general ad lit vi ten they are principally and originally in the Word of God as typal ideas Secondly they are in the elements of the world where they were produced altogether at the beginning as in universal causes Thirdly they are in those things which in the succession of time are produced by universal causes for instance in this plant and in that animal as in particular causes Fourthly they are in the seeds produced from animals and plants And these again are compared to further particular effects as the primordial universal causes to the first effects produced Reply Obj one These active and passive virtues of natural things though not called virtues rationes by reason of their being in corporeal matter can nevertheless be so called in respect of their origin forasmuch as they are the effect of the typal ideas rationes ideales Reply Obj two These active and passive virtues are in certain parts of corporeal things and when they are employed with local movement for the production of certain results we speak of the demons as employing seeds Reply Obj three The seed of the male is the active principle in the generation of an animal But that can be called seed also which the female contributes as the passive principle And thus the word seed covers both active and passive principles Reply Obj four From the words of Augustine when speaking of these seminal virtues it is easy to gather that they are also causal virtues just as seed is a kind of cause for he says De Trin iii nine that as a mother is pregnant with the unborn offspring so is the world itself pregnant with the causes of unborn things Nevertheless the typal ideas can be called causal virtues but not strictly speaking seminal virtues because seed is not a separate principle and because miracles are not wrought outside the scope of causal virtues Likewise neither are miracles wrought outside the scope of the passive virtues so implanted in the creature that the latter can be used to any purpose that God commands But miracles are said to be wrought outside the scope of the natural active virtues and the passive potentialities which are ordered to such active virtues and this is what is meant when we say that they are wrought outside the scope of seminal virtues THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred fifteen Art three Whether the Heavenly Bodies Are the Cause of What Is Produced in Bodies Here Below Objection one It would seem that the heavenly bodies are not the cause of what is produced in bodies here below For Damascene says De Fide Orth ii seven We say that they namely the heavenly bodies are not the cause of generation or corruption they are rather signs of storms and atmospheric changes Obj two Further for the production of anything an agent and matter suffice But in things here below there is passive matter and there are contrary agents heat and cold and the like Therefore for the production of things here below there is no need to ascribe causality to the heavenly bodies Obj three Further the agent produces its like Now it is to be observed that everything which is produced here below is produced through the action of heat and cold moisture and dryness and other such qualities which do not exist in heavenly bodies Therefore the heavenly bodies are not the cause of what is produced here below Obj four Further Augustine says De Civ Dei v six Nothing is more corporeal than sex But sex is not caused by the heavenly bodies a sign of this is that of twins born under the same constellation one may be male the other female Therefore the heavenly bodies are not the cause of things produced in bodies here below On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iii four Bodies of a grosser and inferior nature are ruled in a certain order by those of a more subtle and powerful nature And Dionysius Div Nom iv says that the light of the sun conduces to the generation of sensible bodies moves them to life gives them nourishment growth and perfection I answer that Since every multitude proceeds from unity and since what is immovable is always in the same way of being whereas what is moved has many ways of being it must be observed that throughout the whole of nature all movement proceeds from the immovable Therefore the more immovable certain things are the more are they the cause of those things which are most movable Now the heavenly bodies are of all bodies the most immovable for they are not moved save locally Therefore the movements of bodies here below which are various and multiform must be referred to the movement of the heavenly bodies as to their cause Reply Obj one These words of Damascene are to be understood as denying that the heavenly bodies are the first cause of generation and corruption here below for this was affirmed by those who held that the heavenly bodies are gods Reply Obj two The active principles of bodies here below are only the active qualities of the elements such as hot and cold and the like If therefore the substantial forms of inferior bodies were not diversified save according to accidents of that kind the principles of which the early natural philosophers held to be the rare and the dense there would be no need to suppose some principle above these inferior bodies for they would be of themselves sufficient to act But to anyone who considers the matter aright it is clear that those accidents are merely material dispositions in regard to the substantial forms of natural bodies Now matter is not of itself sufficient to act And therefore it is necessary to suppose some active principle above these material dispositions This is why the Platonists maintained the existence of separate species by participation of which the inferior bodies receive their substantial forms But this does not seem enough For the separate species since they are supposed to be immovable would always have the same mode of being and consequently there would be no variety in the generation and corruption of inferior bodies which is clearly false Therefore it is necessary as the Philosopher says De Gener ii ten to suppose a movable principle which by reason of its presence or absence causes variety in the generation and corruption of inferior bodies Such are the heavenly bodies Consequently whatever generates here below moves to the production of the species as the instrument of a heavenly body thus the Philosopher says Phys ii two that man and the sun generate man Reply Obj three The heavenly bodies have not a specific likeness to the bodies here below Their likeness consists in this that by reason of their universal power whatever is generated in inferior bodies is contained in them In this way also we say that all things are like God Reply Obj four The actions of heavenly bodies are variously received in inferior bodies according to the various dispositions of matter Now it happens at times that the matter in the human conception is not wholly disposed to the male sex wherefore it is formed sometimes into a male sometimes into a female Augustine quotes this as an argument against divination by stars because the effects of the stars are varied even in corporeal things according to the various dispositions of matter FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred fifteen Art four Whether the Heavenly Bodies Are the Cause of Human Actions Objection one It would seem that the heavenly bodies are the cause of human actions For since the heavenly bodies are moved by spiritual substances as stated above Q one hundred ten A three they act by virtue thereof as their instruments But those spiritual substances are superior to our souls Therefore it seems that they can cause impressions on our souls and thereby cause human actions Obj two Further every multiform is reducible to a uniform principle But human actions are various and multiform Therefore it seems that they are reducible to the uniform movements of heavenly bodies as to their principles Obj three Further astrologers often foretell the truth concerning the outcome of wars and other human actions of which the intellect and will are the principles But they could not do this by means of the heavenly bodies unless these were the cause of human actions Therefore the heavenly bodies are the cause of human actions On the contrary Damascene says De Fide Orth ii seven that the heavenly bodies are by no means the cause of human actions I answer that The heavenly bodies can directly and of themselves act on bodies as stated above A three They can act directly indeed on those powers of the soul which are the acts of corporeal organs but accidentally because the acts of such powers must needs be hindered by obstacles in the organs thus an eye when disturbed cannot see well Wherefore if the intellect and will were powers affixed to corporeal organs as some maintained holding that intellect does not differ from sense it would follow of necessity that the heavenly bodies are the cause of human choice and action It would also follow that man is led by natural instinct to his actions just as other animals in which there are powers other than those which are affixed to corporeal organs for whatever is done here below in virtue of the action of heavenly bodies is done naturally It would therefore follow that man has no free will and that he would have determinate actions like other natural things All of which is manifestly false and contrary to human habit It must be observed however that indirectly and accidentally the impressions of heavenly bodies can reach the intellect and will forasmuch namely as both intellect and will receive something from the inferior powers which are affixed to corporeal organs But in this the intellect and will are differently situated For the intellect of necessity receives from the inferior apprehensive powers wherefore if the imaginative cogitative or memorative powers be disturbed the action of the intellect is of necessity disturbed also The will on the contrary does not of necessity follow the inclination of the inferior appetite for although the passions in the irascible and concupiscible have a certain force in inclining the will nevertheless the will retains the power of following the passions or repressing them Therefore the impressions of the heavenly bodies by virtue of which the inferior powers can be changed has less influence on the will which is the proximate cause of human actions than on the intellect To maintain therefore that heavenly bodies are the cause of human actions is proper to those who hold that intellect does not differ from sense Wherefore some of these said that such is the will of men as is the day which the father of men and of gods brings on Odyssey xviii one hundred thirty five Since therefore it is manifest that intellect and will are not acts of corporeal organs it is impossible that heavenly bodies be the cause of human actions Reply Obj one The spiritual substances that move the heavenly bodies do indeed act on corporeal things by means of the heavenly bodies but they act immediately on the human intellect by enlightening it On the other hand they cannot compel the will as stated above Q one hundred eleven A two Reply Obj two Just as the multiformity of corporeal movements is reducible to the uniformity of the heavenly movement as to its cause so the multiformity of actions proceeding from the intellect and the will is reduced to a uniform principle which is the Divine intellect and will Reply Obj three The majority of men follow their passions which are movements of the sensitive appetite in which movements of the heavenly bodies can cooperate but few are wise enough to resist these passions Consequently astrologers are able to foretell the truth in the majority of cases especially in a general way But not in particular cases for nothing prevents man resisting his passions by his free will Wherefore the astrologers themselves are wont to say that the wise man is stronger than the stars Ptolemy Centiloquium prop five forasmuch as to wit he conquers his passions FIFTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred fifteen Art five Whether Heavenly Bodies Can Act on the Demons Objection one It would seem that heavenly bodies can act on the demons For the demons according to certain phases of the moon can harass men who on that account are called lunatics as appears from Matt four twenty four and seventeen fourteen But this would not be if they were not subject to the heavenly bodies Therefore the demons are subject to them Obj two Further necromancers observe certain constellations in order to invoke the demons But these would not be invoked through the heavenly bodies unless they were subject to them Therefore they are subject to them Obj three Further heavenly bodies are more powerful than inferior bodies But the demons are confined to certain inferior bodies namely herbs stones animals and to certain sounds and words forms and figures as Porphyry says quoted by Augustine De Civ Dei x eleven Much more therefore are the demons subject to the action of heavenly bodies On the contrary The demons are superior in the order of nature to the heavenly bodies But the agent is superior to the patient as Augustine says general ad lit xii sixteen Therefore the demons are not subject to the action of heavenly bodies I answer that There have been three opinions about the demons In the first place the Peripatetics denied the existence of demons and held that what is ascribed to the demons according to the necromantic art is effected by the power of the heavenly bodies This is what Augustine De Civ Dei x eleven relates as having been held by Porphyry namely that on earth men fabricate certain powers useful in producing certain effects of the stars But this opinion is manifestly false For we know by experience that many things are done by demons for which the power of heavenly bodies would in no way suffice for instance that a man in a state of delirium should speak an unknown tongue recite poetry and authors of whom he has no previous knowledge that necromancers make statues to speak and move and other like things For this reason the Platonists were led to hold that demons are animals with an aerial body and a passive soul as Apuleius says quoted by Augustine De Civ Dei viii sixteen And this is the second of the opinions mentioned above according to which it could be said that demons are subject to heavenly bodies in the same way as we have said man is subject thereto A four But this opinion is proved to be false from what we have said above Q fifty one A one for we hold that demons are spiritual substances not united to bodies Hence it is clear that they are subject to the action of heavenly bodies neither essentially nor accidentally neither directly nor indirectly Reply Obj one That demons harass men according to certain phases of the moon happens in two ways Firstly they do so in order to defame God s creature namely the moon as Jerome In Matt iv twenty four and Chrysostom Hom lvii in Matt say Secondly because as they are unable to effect anything save by means of the natural forces as stated above Q one hundred fourteen A four ad two they take into account the aptitude of bodies for the intended result Now it is manifest that the brain is the most moist of all the parts of the body as Aristotle says De Part Animal ii seven De Sens et Sensato ii De Somn et Vigil iii wherefore it is the most subject to the action of the moon the property of which is to move what is moist And it is precisely in the brain that animal forces culminate wherefore the demons according to certain phases of the moon disturb man s imagination when they observe that the brain is thereto disposed Reply Obj two Demons when summoned through certain constellations come for two reasons Firstly in order to lead man into the error of believing that there is some Divine power in the stars Secondly because they consider that under certain constellations corporeal matter is better disposed for the result for which they are summoned Reply Obj three As Augustine says De Civ Dei xxi six the demons are enticed through various kinds of stones herbs trees animals songs rites not as an animal is enticed by food but as a spirit by signs that is to say forasmuch as these things are offered to them in token of the honor due to God of which they are covetous SIXTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred fifteen Art six Whether Heavenly Bodies Impose Necessity on Things Subject to Their Action Objection one It would seem that heavenly bodies impose necessity on things subject to their action For given a sufficient cause the effect follows of necessity But heavenly bodies are a sufficient cause of their effects Since therefore heavenly bodies with their movements and dispositions are necessary beings it seems that their effects follow of necessity Obj two Further an agent s effect results of necessity in matter when the power of the agent is such that it can subject the matter to itself entirely But the entire matter of inferior bodies is subject to the power of heavenly bodies since this is a higher power than theirs Therefore the effect of the heavenly bodies is of necessity received in corporeal matter Obj three Further if the effect of the heavenly body does not follow of necessity this is due to some hindering cause But any corporeal cause that might possibly hinder the effect of a heavenly body must of necessity be reducible to some heavenly principle since the heavenly bodies are the causes of all that takes place here below Therefore since also that heavenly principle is necessary it follows that the effect of the heavenly body is necessarily hindered Consequently it would follow that all that takes place here below happens of necessity On the contrary The Philosopher says De Somn et Vigil De Divin per Somn ii It is not incongruous that many of the signs observed in bodies of occurrences in the heavens such as rain and wind should not be fulfilled Therefore not all the effects of heavenly bodies take place of necessity I answer that This question is partly solved by what was said above A four and in part presents some difficulty For it was shown that although the action of heavenly bodies produces certain inclinations in corporeal nature the will nevertheless does not of necessity follow these inclinations Therefore there is nothing to prevent the effect of heavenly bodies being hindered by the action of the will not only in man himself but also in other things to which human action extends But in natural things there is no such principle endowed with freedom to follow or not to follow the impressions produced by heavenly agents Wherefore it seems that in such things at least everything happens of necessity according to the reasoning of some of the ancients who supposing that everything that is has a cause and that given the cause the effect follows of necessity concluded that all things happen of necessity This opinion is refuted by Aristotle Metaph vi Did v three as to this double supposition For in the first place it is not true that given any cause whatever the effect must follow of necessity For some causes are so ordered to their effects as to produce them not of necessity but in the majority of cases and in the minority to fail in producing them But that such causes do fail in the minority of cases is due to some hindering cause consequently the above mentioned difficulty seems not to be avoided since the cause in question is hindered of necessity Therefore we must say in the second place that everything that is a being per se has a cause but what is accidentally has not a cause because it is not truly a being since it is not truly one For that a thing is white has a cause likewise that a man is musical has not a cause but that a being is white musical has not a cause because it is not truly a being nor truly one Now it is manifest that a cause which hinders the action of a cause so ordered to its effect as to produce it in the majority of cases clashes sometimes with this cause by accident and the clashing of these two causes inasmuch as it is accidental has no cause Consequently what results from this clashing of causes is not to be reduced to a further pre existing cause from which it follows of necessity For instance that some terrestrial body take fire in the higher regions of the air and fall to the earth is caused by some heavenly power again that there be on the surface of the earth some combustible matter is reducible to some heavenly principle But that the burning body should alight on this matter and set fire to it is not caused by a heavenly body but is accidental Consequently not all the effects of heavenly bodies result of necessity Reply Obj one The heavenly bodies are causes of effects that take place here below through the means of particular inferior causes which can fail in their effects in the minority of cases Reply Obj two The power of a heavenly body is not infinite Wherefore it requires a determinate disposition in matter both as to local distance and as to other conditions in order to produce its effect Therefore as local distance hinders the effect of a heavenly body for the sun has not the same effect in heat in Dacia as in Ethiopia so the grossness of matter its low or high temperature or other such disposition can hinder the effect of a heavenly body Reply Obj three Although the cause that hinders the effect of another cause can be reduced to a heavenly body as its cause nevertheless the clashing of two causes being accidental is not reduced to the causality of a heavenly body as stated above ON FATE In Four Articles We come now to the consideration of fate Under this head there are four points of inquiry one Is there such a thing as fate two Where is it three Is it unchangeable four Are all things subject to fate FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred sixteen Art one Whether There Be Such a Thing As Fate Objection one It would seem that fate is nothing For Gregory says in a homily for the Epiphany Hom x in Evang Far be it from the hearts of the faithful to think that fate is anything real Obj two Further what happens by fate is not unforeseen for as Augustine says De Civ Dei v four fate is understood to be derived from the verb fari which means to speak as though things were said to happen by fate which are fore spoken by one who decrees them to happen Now what is foreseen is neither lucky nor chance like If therefore things happen by fate there will be neither luck nor chance in the world On the contrary What does not exist cannot be defined But Boethius De Consol iv defines fate thus Fate is a disposition inherent to changeable things by which Providence connects each one with its proper order I answer that In this world some things seem to happen by luck or chance Now it happens sometimes that something is lucky or chance like as compared to inferior causes which if compared to some higher cause is directly intended For instance if two servants are sent by their master to the same place the meeting of the two servants in regard to themselves is by chance but as compared to the master who had ordered it it is directly intended So there were some who refused to refer to a higher cause such events which by luck or chance take place here below These denied the existence of fate and Providence as Augustine relates of Tully De Civ Dei v nine And this is contrary to what we have said above about Providence Q twenty two A two On the other hand some have considered that everything that takes place here below by luck or by chance whether in natural things or in human affairs is to be reduced to a superior cause namely the heavenly bodies According to these fate is nothing else than a disposition of the stars under which each one is begotten or born Cf saint Augustine loc cit v one eight nine But this will not hold First as to human affairs because we have proved above Q one hundred fifteen A four that human actions are not subject to the action of heavenly bodies save accidentally and indirectly Now the cause of fate since it has the ordering of things that happen by fate must of necessity be directly and of itself the cause of what takes place Secondly as to all things that happen accidentally for it has been said Q one hundred fifteen A six that what is accidental is properly speaking neither a being nor a unity But every action of nature terminates in some one thing Wherefore it is impossible for that which is accidental to be the proper effect of an active natural principle No natural cause can therefore have for its proper effect that a man intending to dig a grave finds a treasure Now it is manifest that a acts after the manner of a natural principle wherefore its effects in this world are natural It is therefore impossible that any active power of a heavenly body be the cause of what happens by accident here below whether by luck or by chance We must therefore say that what happens here by accident both in natural things and in human affairs is reduced to a preordaining cause which is Divine Providence For nothing hinders that which happens by accident being considered as one by an intellect otherwise the intellect could not form this proposition The digger of a grave found a treasure And just as an intellect can apprehend this so can it effect it for instance someone who knows a place where a treasure is hidden might instigate a rustic ignorant of this to dig a grave there Consequently nothing hinders what happens here by accident by luck or by chance being reduced to some ordering cause which acts by the intellect especially the Divine intellect For God alone can change the will as shown above Q one hundred five A four Consequently the ordering of human actions the principle of which is the will must be ascribed to God alone So therefore inasmuch as all that happens here below is subject to Divine Providence as being pre ordained and as it were fore spoken we can admit the existence of fate although the holy doctors avoided the use of this word on account of those who twisted its application to a certain force in the position of the stars Hence Augustine says De Civ Dei v one If anyone ascribes human affairs to fate meaning thereby the will or power of God let him keep to his opinion but hold his tongue For this reason Gregory denies the existence of fate wherefore the first objection s solution is manifest Reply Obj two Nothing hinders certain things happening by luck or by chance if compared to their proximate causes but not if compared to Divine Providence whereby nothing happens at random in the world as Augustine says QQ eighty three qu twenty four SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred sixteen Art two Whether Fate Is in Created Things Objection one It would seem that fate is not in created things For Augustine says De Civ Dei v one that the Divine will or power is called fate But the Divine will or power is not in creatures but in God Therefore fate is not in creatures but in God Obj two Further fate is compared to things that happen by fate as their cause as the very use of the word proves But the universal cause that of itself effects what takes place by accident here below is God alone as stated above A one Therefore fate is in God and not in creatures Obj three Further if fate is in creatures it is either a substance or an accident and whichever it is it must be multiplied according to the number of creatures Since therefore fate seems to be one thing only it seems that fate is not in creatures but in God On the contrary Boethius says De Consol iv Fate is a disposition inherent to changeable things I answer that As is clear from what has been stated above Q twenty two A three Q one hundred three A six Divine Providence produces effects through mediate causes We can therefore consider the ordering of the effects in two ways Firstly as being in God Himself and thus the ordering of the effects is called Providence But if we consider this ordering as being in the mediate causes ordered by God to the production of certain effects thus it has the nature of fate This is what Boethius says De Consol iv Fate is worked out when Divine Providence is served by certain spirits whether by the soul or by all nature itself which obeys Him whether by the heavenly movements of the stars whether by the angelic power or by the ingenuity of the demons whether by some of these or by all the chain of fate is forged Of each of these things we have spoken above A one Q one hundred four A two Q one hundred ten A one Q one hundred thirteen Q one hundred fourteen It is therefore manifest that fate is in the created causes themselves as ordered by God to the production of their effects Reply Obj one The ordering itself of second causes which Augustine De Civ Dei v eight calls the series of causes has not the nature of fate except as dependent on God Wherefore the Divine power or will can be called fate as being the cause of fate But essentially fate is the very disposition or series i e order of second causes Reply Obj two Fate has the nature of a cause just as much as the second causes themselves the ordering of which is called fate Reply Obj three Fate is called a disposition not that disposition which is a species of quality but in the sense in which it signifies order which is not a substance but a relation And if this order be considered in relation to its principle it is one and thus fate is one But if it be considered in relation to its effects or to the mediate causes this fate is multiple In this sense the poet wrote Thy fate draws thee THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred sixteen Art three Whether Fate Is Unchangeable Objection one It seems that fate is not unchangeable For Boethius says De Consol iv As reasoning is to the intellect as the begotten is to that which is as time to eternity as the circle to its centre so is the fickle chain of fate to the unwavering simplicity of Providence Obj two Further the Philosopher says Topic ii seven If we be moved what is in us is moved But fate is a disposition inherent to changeable things as Boethius says De Consol iv Therefore fate is changeable Obj three Further if fate is unchangeable what is subject to fate happens unchangeably and of necessity But things ascribed to fate seem principally to be contingencies Therefore there would be no contingencies in the world but all things would happen of necessity On the contrary Boethius says De Consol iv that fate is an unchangeable disposition I answer that The disposition of second causes which we call fate can be considered in two ways firstly in regard to the second causes which are thus disposed or ordered secondly in regard to the first principle namely God by Whom they are ordered Some therefore have held that the series itself o f dispositions of causes is in itself necessary so that all things would happen of necessity for this reason that each effect has a cause and given a cause the effect must follow of necessity But this is false as proved above Q one hundred fifteen A six Others on the other hand held that fate is changeable even as dependent on Divine Providence Wherefore the Egyptians said that fate could be changed by certain sacrifices as Gregory of Nyssa says Nemesius De Homine This too has been disproved above for the reason that it is repugnant to Divine Providence We must therefore say that fate considered in regard to second causes is changeable but as subject to Divine Providence it derives a certain unchangeableness not of absolute but of conditional necessity In this sense we say that this conditional is true and necessary If God foreknew that this would happen it will happen Wherefore Boethius having said that the chain of fate is fickle shortly afterwards adds which since it is derived from an unchangeable Providence must also itself be unchangeable From this the answers to the objections are clear FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred sixteen Art four Whether All Things Are Subject to Fate Objection one It seems that all things are subject to fate For Boethius says De Consol iv The chain of fate moves the heaven and the stars tempers the elements to one another and models them by a reciprocal transformation By fate all things that are born into the world and perish are renewed in a uniform progression of offspring and seed Nothing therefore seems to be excluded from the domain of fate Obj two Further Augustine says De Civ Dei v one that fate is something real as referred to the Divine will and power But the Divine will is cause of all things that happen as Augustine says De Trin iii one seqq Therefore all things are subject to fate Obj three Further Boethius says De Consol iv that fate is a disposition inherent to changeable things But all creatures are changeable and God alone is truly unchangeable as stated above Q nine A two Therefore fate is in all things On the contrary Boethius says De Consol iv that some things subject to Providence are above the ordering of fate I answer that As stated above A two fate is the ordering of second causes to effects foreseen by God Whatever therefore is subject to second causes is subject also to fate But whatever is done immediately by God since it is not subject to second causes neither is it subject to fate such are creation the glorification of spiritual substances and the like And this is what Boethius says De Consol iv viz that those things which are nigh to God have a state of immobility and exceed the changeable order of fate Hence it is clear that the further a thing is from the First Mind the more it is involved in the chain of fate since so much the more it is bound up with second causes Reply Obj one All the things mentioned in this passage are done by God by means of second causes for this reason they are contained in the order of fate But it is not the same with everything else as stated above Reply Obj two Fate is to be referred to the Divine will and power as to its first principle Consequently it does not follow that whatever is subject to the Divine will or power is subject also to fate as already stated Reply Obj three Although all creatures are in some way changeable yet some of them do not proceed from changeable created causes And these therefore are not subject to fate as stated above QUESTION one hundred seventeen OF THINGS PERTAINING TO THE ACTION OF MAN In Four Articles We have next to consider those things which pertain to the action of man who is composed of a created corporeal and spiritual nature In the first place we shall consider that action in general and secondly in regard to the propagation of man from man As to the first there are four points of inquiry one Whether one man can teach another as being the cause of his knowledge two Whether man can teach an angel three Whether by the power of his soul man can change corporeal matter four Whether the separate soul of man can move bodies by local movement FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred seventeen Art one Whether One Man Can Teach Another Objection one It would seem that one man cannot teach another For the Lord says Matt twenty two eight Be not you called Rabbi on which the gloss of Jerome says Lest you give to men the honor due to God Therefore to be a master is properly an honor due to God But it belongs to a master to teach Therefore man cannot teach and this is proper to God Obj two Further if one man teaches another this is only inasmuch as he acts through his own knowledge so as to cause knowledge in the other But a quality through which anyone acts so as to produce his like is an active quality Therefore it follows that knowledge is an active quality just as heat is Obj three Further for knowledge we require intellectual light and the species of the thing understood But a man cannot cause either of these in another man Therefore a man cannot by teaching cause knowledge in another man Obj four Further the teacher does nothing in regard to a disciple save to propose to him certain signs so as to signify something by words or gestures But it is not possible to teach anyone so as to cause knowledge in him by putting signs before him For these are signs either of things that he knows or of things he does not know If of things that he knows he to whom these signs are proposed is already in the possession of knowledge and does not acquire it from the master If they are signs of things that he does not know he can learn nothing therefrom for instance if one were to speak Greek to a man who only knows Latin he would learn nothing thereby Therefore in no way can a man cause knowledge in another by teaching him On the contrary The Apostle says one Tim two seven Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth I answer that On this question there have been various opinions For Averroes commenting on De Anima iii maintains that all men have one passive intellect in common as stated above Q seventy six A two From this it follows that the same intelligible species belong to all men Consequently he held that one man does not cause another to have a knowledge distinct from that which he has himself but that he communicates the identical knowledge which he has himself by moving him to order rightly the phantasms in his soul so that they be rightly disposed for intelligible apprehension This opinion is true so far as knowledge is the same in disciple and master if we consider the identity of the thing known for the same objective truth is known by both of them But so far as he maintains that all men have but one passive intellect and the same intelligible species differing only as to various phantasms his opinion is false as stated above Q seventy six A two Besides this there is the opinion of the Platonists who held that our souls are possessed of knowledge from the very beginning through the participation of separate forms as stated above Q eighty four AA three four but that the soul is hindered through its union with the body from the free consideration of those things which it knows According to this the disciple does not acquire fresh knowledge from his master but is roused by him to consider what he knows so that to learn would be nothing else than to remember In the same way they held that natural agents only dispose matter to receive forms which matter acquires by a participation of separate substances But against this we have proved above Q seventy nine A two Q eighty four A three that the passive intellect of the human soul is in pure potentiality to intelligible species as Aristotle says De Anima iii four We must therefore decide the question differently by saying that the teacher causes knowledge in the learner by reducing him from potentiality to act as the Philosopher says Phys viii four In order to make this clear we must observe that of effects proceeding from an exterior principle some proceed from the exterior principle alone as the form of a house is caused to be in matter by art alone whereas other effects proceed sometimes from an exterior principle sometimes from an interior principle thus health is caused in a sick man sometimes by an exterior principle namely by the medical art sometimes by an interior principle as when a man is healed by the force of nature In these latter effects two things must be noticed First that art in its work imitates nature for just as nature heals a man by alteration digestion rejection of the matter that caused the sickness so does art Secondly we must remark that the exterior principle art acts not as principal agent but as helping the principal agent but as helping the principal agent which is the interior principle by strengthening it and by furnishing it with instruments and assistance of which the interior principle makes use in producing the effect Thus the physician strengthens nature and employs food and medicine of which nature makes use for the intended end Now knowledge is acquired in man both from an interior principle as is clear in one who procures knowledge by his own research and from an exterior principle as is clear in one who learns by instruction For in every man there is a certain principle of knowledge namely the light of the active intellect through which certain universal principles of all the sciences are naturally understood as soon as proposed to the intellect Now when anyone applies these universal principles to certain particular things the memory or experience of which he acquires through the senses then by his own research advancing from the known to the unknown he obtains knowledge of what he knew not before Wherefore anyone who teaches leads the disciple from things known by the latter to the knowledge of things previously unknown to him according to what the Philosopher says Poster i one All teaching and all learning proceed from previous knowledge Now the master leads the disciple from things known to knowledge of the unknown in a twofold manner Firstly by proposing to him certain helps or means of instruction which his intellect can use for the acquisition of science for instance he may put before him certain less universal propositions of which nevertheless the disciple is able to judge from previous knowledge or he may propose to him some sensible examples either by way of likeness or of opposition or something of the sort from which the intellect of the learner is led to the knowledge of truth previously unknown Secondly by strengthening the intellect of the learner not indeed by some active power as of a higher nature as explained above Q one hundred six A one Q one hundred eleven A one of the angelic enlightenment because all human intellects are of one grade in the natural order but inasmuch as he proposes to the disciple the order of principles to conclusions by reason of his not having sufficient collating power to be able to draw the conclusions from the principles Hence the Philosopher says Poster i two that a demonstration is a syllogism that causes knowledge In this way a demonstrator causes his hearer to know Reply Obj one As stated above the teacher only brings exterior help as the physician who heals but just as the interior nature is the principal cause of the healing so the interior light of the intellect is the principal cause of knowledge But both of these are from God Therefore as of God is it written Who healeth all thy diseases Ps one hundred two three so of Him is it written He that teacheth man knowledge Ps ninety three ten inasmuch as the light of His countenance is signed upon us Ps four seven through which light all things are shown to us Reply Obj two As Averroes argues the teacher does not cause knowledge in the disciple after the manner of a natural active cause Wherefore knowledge need not be an active quality but is the principle by which one is directed in teaching just as art is the principle by which one is directed in working Reply Obj three The master does not cause the intellectual light in the disciple nor does he cause the intelligible species directly but he moves the disciple by teaching so that the latter by the power of his intellect forms intelligible concepts the signs of which are proposed to him from without Reply Obj four The signs proposed by the master to the disciple are of things known in a general and confused manner but not known in detail and distinctly Therefore when anyone acquires knowledge by himself he cannot be called self taught or be said to have his own master because perfect knowledge did not precede in him such as is required in a master SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred seventeen Art two Whether Man Can Teach the Angels Objection one It would seem that men teach angels For the Apostle says Eph three ten That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places through the Church But the Church is the union of all the faithful Therefore some things are made known to angels through men Obj two Further the superior angels who are enlightened immediately concerning Divine things by God can instruct the inferior angels as stated above Q one hundred sixteen A one Q one hundred twelve A three But some men are instructed immediately concerning Divine things by the Word of God as appears principally of the apostles from Heb one one two Last of all in these days God hath spoken to us by His Son Therefore some men have been able to teach the angels Obj three Further the inferior angels are instructed by the superior But some men are higher than some angels since some men are taken up to the highest angelic orders as Gregory says in a homily Hom xxxiv in Evang Therefore some of the inferior angels can be instructed by men concerning Divine things On the contrary Dionysius says Div Nom iv that every Divine enlightenment is borne to men by the ministry of the angels Therefore angels are not instructed by men concerning Divine things I answer that As stated above Q one hundred seven A two the inferior angels can indeed speak to the superior angels by making their thoughts known to them but concerning Divine things superior angels are never enlightened by inferior angels Now it is manifest that in the same way as inferior angels are subject to the superior the highest men are subject even to the lowest angels This is clear from Our Lord s words Matt eleven eleven There hath not risen among them that are born of woman a greater than John the Baptist yet he that is lesser in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he Therefore angels are never enlightened by men concerning Divine things But men can by means of speech make known to angels the thoughts of their hearts because it belongs to God alone to know the heart s secrets Reply Obj one Augustine general ad lit v nineteen thus explains this passage of the Apostle who in the preceding verses says To me the least of all the saints is given this grace to enlighten all men that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God Hidden yet so that the multiform wisdom of God was made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places that is through the Church As though he were to say This mystery was hidden from men but not from the Church in heaven which is contained in the principalities and powers who knew it from all ages but not before all ages because the Church was at first there where after the resurrection this Church composed of men will be gathered together It can also be explained otherwise that what is hidden is known by the angels not only in God but also here where when it takes place and is made public as Augustine says further on general ad lit v nineteen Thus when the mysteries of Christ and the Church were fulfilled by the apostles some things concerning these mysteries became apparent to the angels which were hidden from them before In this way we can understand what Jerome says Comment in Ep ad Eph that from the preaching of the apostles the angels learned certain mysteries that is to say through the preaching of the apostles the mysteries were realized in the things themselves thus by the preaching of Paul the Gentiles were converted of which mystery the Apostle is speaking in the passage quoted Reply Obj two The apostles were instructed immediately by the Word of God not according to His Divinity but according as He spoke in His human nature Hence the argument does not prove Reply Obj three Certain men in this state of life are greater than certain angels not actually but virtually forasmuch as they have such great charity that they can merit a higher degree of beatitude than that possessed by certain angels In the same way we might say that the seed of a great tree is virtually greater than a small tree though actually it is much smaller THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred seventeen Art three Whether Man by the Power of His Soul Can Change Corporeal Matter Objection one It would seem that man by the power of his soul can change corporeal matter For Gregory says Dialog ii thirty Saints work miracles sometimes by prayer sometimes by their power thus Peter by prayer raised the dead Tabitha to life and by his reproof delivered to death the lying Ananias and Saphira But in the working of miracles a change is wrought in corporeal matter Therefore men by the power of the soul can change corporeal matter Obj two Further on these words Gal three one Who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth the gloss says that some have blazing eyes who by a single look bewitch others especially children But this would not be unless the power of the soul could change corporeal matter Therefore man can change corporeal matter by the power of his soul Obj three Further the human body is nobler than other inferior bodies But by the apprehension of the human soul the human body is changed to heat and cold as appears when a man is angry or afraid indeed this change sometimes goes so far as to bring on sickness and death Much more then can the human soul by its power change corporeal matter On the contrary Augustine says De Trin iii eight Corporeal matter obeys God alone at will I answer that As stated above Q one hundred ten A two corporeal matter is not changed to the reception of a form save either by some agent composed of matter and form or by God Himself in whom both matter and form pre exist virtually as in the primordial cause of both Wherefore of the angels also we have stated Q one hundred ten A two that they cannot change corporeal matter by their natural power except by employing corporeal agents for the production of certain effects Much less therefore can the soul by its natural power change corporeal matter except by means of bodies Reply Obj one The saints are said to work miracles by the power of grace not of nature This is clear from what Gregory says in the same place Those who are sons of God in power as John says what wonder is there that they should work miracles by that power Reply Obj two Avicenna assigns the cause of bewitchment to the fact that corporeal matter has a natural tendency to obey spiritual substance rather than natural contrary agents Therefore when the soul is of strong imagination it can change corporeal matter This he says is the cause of the evil eye But it has been shown above Q one hundred ten A two that corporeal matter does not obey spiritual substances at will but the Creator alone Therefore it is better to say that by a strong imagination the corporeal spirits of the body united to that soul are changed which change in the spirits takes place especially in the eyes to which the more subtle spirits can reach And the eyes infect the air which is in contact with them to a certain distance in the same way as a new and clear mirror contracts a tarnish from the look of a menstruata as Aristotle says De Somn et Vigil De Insomniis ii Hence then when a soul is vehemently moved to wickedness as occurs mostly in little old women according to the above explanation the countenance becomes venomous and hurtful especially to children who have a tender and most impressionable body It is also possible that by God s permission or from some hidden deed the spiteful demons company operate in this as the witches may have some compact with them Reply Obj three The soul is united to the body as its form and the sensitive appetite which obeys the reason in a certain way as stated above Q eighty one A three it is the act of a corporeal organ Therefore at the apprehension of the human soul the sensitive appetite must needs be moved with an accompanying corporeal operation But the apprehension of the human soul does not suffice to work a change in exterior bodies except by means of a change in the body united to it as stated above ad two FOURTH ARTICLE I Q one hundred seventeen Art four Whether the Separate Human Soul Can Move Bodies at Least Locally Objection one It seems that the separate human soul can move bodies at least locally For a body naturally obeys a spiritual substance as to local motion as stated above Q one hundred ten A five But the separate soul is a spiritual substance Therefore it can move exterior bodies by its command Obj two Further in the Itinerary of Clement it is said in the narrative of Nicetas to Peter that Simon Magus by sorcery retained power over the soul of a child that he had slain and that through this soul he worked magical wonders But this could not have been without some corporeal change at least as to place Therefore the separate soul has the power to move bodies locally On the contrary the Philosopher says De Anima i three that the soul cannot move any other body whatsoever but its own I answer that The separate soul cannot by its natural power move a body For it is manifest that even while the soul is united to the body it does not move the body except as endowed with life so that if one of the members become lifeless it does not obey the soul as to local motion Now it is also manifest that no body is quickened by the separate soul Therefore within the limits of its natural power the separate soul cannot command the obedience of a body though by the power of God it can exceed those limits Reply Obj one There are certain spiritual substances whose powers are not determinate to certain bodies such are the angels who are naturally unfettered by a body consequently various bodies may obey them as to movement But if the motive power of a separate substance is naturally determinate to move a certain body that substance will not be able to move a body of higher degree but only one of lower degree thus according to philosophers the mover of the lower heaven cannot move the higher heaven Wherefore since the soul is by its nature determinate to move the body of which it is the form it cannot by its natural power move any other body Reply Obj two As Augustine De Civ Dei x eleven and Chrysostom Hom xxviii in Matt say the demons often pretend to be the souls of the dead in order to confirm the error of heathen superstition It is therefore credible that Simon Magus was deceived by some demon who pretended to be the soul of the child whom the magician had slain QUESTION one hundred eighteen OF THE PRODUCTION OF MAN FROM MAN AS TO THE SOUL In Three Articles We next consider the production of man from man first as to the soul secondly as to the body Under the first head there are three points of inquiry one Whether the sensitive soul is transmitted with the semen two Whether the intellectual soul is thus transmitted three Whether all souls were created at the same time FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred eighteen Art one Whether the Sensitive Soul Is Transmitted with the Semen Objection one It would seem that the sensitive soul is not transmitted with the semen but created by God For every perfect substance not composed of matter and form that begins to exist acquires existence not by generation but by creation for nothing is generated save from matter But the sensitive soul is a perfect substance otherwise it could not move the body and since it is the form of a body it is not composed of matter and form Therefore it begins to exist not by generation but by creation Obj two Further in living things the principle of generation is the generating power which since it is one of the powers of the vegetative soul is of a lower order than the sensitive soul Now nothing acts beyond its species Therefore the sensitive soul cannot be caused by the animal s generating power Obj three Further the generator begets its like so that the form of the generator must be actually in the cause of generation But neither the sensitive soul itself nor any part thereof is actually in the semen for no part of the sensitive soul is elsewhere than in some part of the body while in the semen there is not even a particle of the body because there is not a particle of the body which is not made from the semen and by the power thereof Therefore the sensitive soul is not produced through the semen Obj four Further if there be in the semen any principle productive of the sensitive soul this principle either remains after the animal is begotten or it does not remain Now it cannot remain For either it would be identified with the sensitive soul of the begotten animal which is impossible for thus there would be identity between begetter and begotten maker and made or it would be distinct therefrom and again this is impossible for it has been proved above Q seventy six A four that in one animal there is but one formal principle which is the soul If on the other hand the aforesaid principle does not remain this again seems to be impossible for thus an agent would act to its own destruction which cannot be Therefore the sensitive soul cannot be generated from the semen On the contrary The power in the semen is to the animal seminally generated as the power in the elements of the world is to animals produced from these elements for instance by putrefaction But in the latter animals the soul is produced by the elemental power according to general one twenty Let the waters bring forth the creeping creatures having life Therefore also the souls of animals seminally generated are produced by the seminal power I answer that Some have held that the sensitive souls of animals are created by God Q sixty five A four This opinion would hold if the sensitive soul were subsistent having being and operation of itself For thus as having being and operation of itself to be made would needs be proper to it And since a simple and subsistent thing cannot be made except by creation it would follow that the sensitive soul would arrive at existence by creation But this principle is false namely that being and operation are proper to the sensitive soul as has been made clear above Q seventy five A three for it would not cease to exist when the body perishes Since therefore it is not a subsistent form its relation to existence is that of the corporeal forms to which existence does not belong as proper to them but which are said to exist forasmuch as the subsistent composites exist through them Wherefore to be made is proper to composites And since the generator is like the generated it follows of necessity that both the sensitive soul and all other like forms are naturally brought into existence by certain corporeal agents that reduce the matter from potentiality to act through some corporeal power of which they are possessed Now the more powerful an agent the greater scope its action has for instance the hotter a body the greater the distance to which its heat carries Therefore bodies not endowed with life which are the lowest in the order of nature generate their like not through some medium but by themselves thus fire by itself generates fire But living bodies as being more powerful act so as to generate their like both without and with a medium Without a medium in the work of nutrition in which flesh generates flesh with a medium in the act of generation because the semen of the animal or plant derives a certain active force from the soul of the generator just as the instrument derives a certain motive power from the principal agent And as it matters not whether we say that something is moved by the instrument or by the principal agent so neither does it matter whether we say that the soul of the generated is caused by the soul of the generator or by some seminal power derived therefrom Reply Obj one The sensitive soul is not a perfect self subsistent substance We have said enough Q twenty five A three on this point nor need we repeat it here Reply Obj two The generating power begets not only by its own virtue but by that of the whole soul of which it is a power Therefore the generating power of a plant generates a plant and that of an animal begets an animal For the more perfect the soul is to so much a more perfect effect is its generating power ordained Reply Obj three This active force which is in the semen and which is derived from the soul of the generator is as it were a certain movement of this soul itself nor is it the soul or a part of the soul save virtually thus the form of a bed is not in the saw or the axe but a certain movement towards that form Consequently there is no need for this active force to have an actual organ but it is based on the vital spirit in the semen which is frothy as is attested by its whiteness In which spirit moreover there is a certain heat derived from the power of the heavenly bodies by virtue of which the inferior bodies also act towards the production of the species as stated above Q one hundred fifteen A three ad two And since in this vital spirit the power of the soul is concurrent with the power of a heavenly body it has been said that man and the sun generate man Moreover elemental heat is employed instrumentally by the soul s power as also by the nutritive power as stated De Anima ii four Reply Obj four In perfect animals generated by coition the active force is in the semen of the male as the Philosopher says De Gener Animal ii three but the foetal matter is provided by the female In this matter the vegetative soul exists from the very beginning not as to the second act but as to the first act as the sensitive soul is in one who sleeps But as soon as it begins to attract nourishment then it already operates in act This matter therefore is transmuted by the power which is in the semen of the male until it is actually informed by the sensitive soul not as though the force itself which was in the semen becomes the sensitive soul for thus indeed the generator and generated would be identical moreover this would be more like nourishment and growth than generation as the Philosopher says And after the sensitive soul by the power of the active principle in the semen has been produced in one of the principal parts of the thing generated then it is that the sensitive soul of the offspring begins to work towards the perfection of its own body by nourishment and growth As to the active power which was in the semen it ceases to exist when the semen is dissolved and the vital spirit thereof vanishes Nor is there anything unreasonable in this because this force is not the principal but the instrumental agent and the movement of an instrument ceases when once the effect has been produced SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred eighteen Art two Whether the Intellectual Soul Is Produced from the Semen Objection one It would seem that the intellectual soul is produced from the semen For it is written general forty six twenty six All the souls that came out of Jacob s thigh sixty six But nothing is produced from the thigh of a man except from the semen Therefore the intellectual soul is produced from the semen Obj two Further as shown above Q seventy six A three the intellectual sensitive and nutritive souls are in substance one soul in man But the sensitive soul in man is generated from the semen as in other animals wherefore the Philosopher says De Gener Animal ii three that the animal and the man are not made at the same time but first of all the animal is made having a sensitive soul Therefore also the intellectual soul is produced from the semen Obj three Further it is one and the same agent whose action is directed to the matter and to the form else from the matter and the form there would not result something simply one But the intellectual soul is the form of the human body which is produced by the power of the semen Therefore the intellectual soul also is produced by the power of the semen Obj four Further man begets his like in species But the human species is constituted by the rational soul Therefore the rational soul is from the begetter Obj five Further it cannot be said that God concurs in sin But if the rational soul be created by God sometimes God concurs in the sin of adultery since sometimes offspring is begotten of illicit intercourse Therefore the rational soul is not created by God On the contrary It is written in De Eccl Dogmat xiv that the rational soul is not engendered by coition I answer that It is impossible for an active power existing in matter to extend its action to the production of an immaterial effect Now it is manifest that the intellectual principle in man transcends matter for it has an operation in which the body takes no part whatever It is therefore impossible for the seminal power to produce the intellectual principle Again the seminal power acts by virtue of the soul of the begetter according as the soul of the begetter is the act of the body making use of the body in its operation Now the body has nothing whatever to do in the operation of the intellect Therefore the power of the intellectual principle as intellectual cannot reach the semen Hence the Philosopher says De Gener Animal ii three It follows that the intellect alone comes from without Again since the intellectual soul has an operation independent of the body it is subsistent as proved above Q seventy five A two therefore to be and to be made are proper to it Moreover since it is an immaterial substance it cannot be caused through generation but only through creation by God Therefore to hold that the intellectual soul is caused by the begetter is nothing else than to hold the soul to be non subsistent and consequently to perish with the body It is therefore heretical to say that the intellectual soul is transmitted with the semen Reply Obj one In the passage quoted the part is put instead of the whole the soul for the whole man by the figure of synecdoche Reply Obj two Some say that the vital functions observed in the embryo are not from its soul but from the soul of the mother or from the formative power of the semen Both of these explanations are false for vital functions such as feeling nourishment and growth cannot be from an extrinsic principle Consequently it must be said that the soul is in the embryo the nutritive soul from the beginning then the sensitive lastly the intellectual soul Therefore some say that in addition to the vegetative soul which existed first another namely the sensitive soul supervenes and in addition to this again another namely the intellectual soul Thus there would be in man three souls of which one would be in potentiality to another This has been disproved above Q seventy six A three Therefore others say that the same soul which was at first merely vegetative afterwards through the action of the seminal power becomes a sensitive soul and finally this same soul becomes intellectual not indeed through the active seminal power but by the power of a higher agent namely God enlightening the soul from without For this reason the Philosopher says that the intellect comes from without But this will not hold First because no substantial form is susceptible of more or less but addition of greater perfection constitutes another species just as the addition of unity constitutes another species of number Now it is not possible for the same identical form to belong to different species Secondly because it would follow that the generation of an animal would be a continuous movement proceeding gradually from the imperfect to the perfect as happens in alteration Thirdly because it would follow that the generation of a man or an animal is not generation simply because the subject thereof would be a being in act For if the vegetative soul is from the beginning in the matter of offspring and is subsequently gradually brought to perfection this will imply addition of further perfection without corruption of the preceding perfection And this is contrary to the nature of generation properly so called Fourthly because either that which is caused by the action of God is something subsistent and thus it must needs be essentially distinct from the pre existing form which was non subsistent and we shall then come back to the opinion of those who held the existence of several souls in the body or else it is not subsistent but a perfection of the pre existing soul and from this it follows of necessity that the intellectual soul perishes with the body which cannot be admitted There is again another explanation according to those who held that all men have but one intellect in common but this has been disproved above Q seventy six A two We must therefore say that since the generation of one thing is the corruption of another it follows of necessity that both in men and in other animals when a more perfect form supervenes the previous form is corrupted yet so that the supervening form contains the perfection of the previous form and something in addition It is in this way that through many generations and corruptions we arrive at the ultimate substantial form both in man and other animals This indeed is apparent to the senses in animals generated from putrefaction We conclude therefore that the intellectual soul is created by God at the end of human generation and this soul is at the same time sensitive and nutritive the pre existing forms being corrupted Reply Obj three This argument holds in the case of diverse agents not ordered to one another But where there are many agents ordered to one another nothing hinders the power of the higher agent from reaching to the ultimate form while the powers of the inferior agents extend only to some disposition of matter thus in the generation of an animal the seminal power disposes the matter but the power of the soul gives the form Now it is manifest from what has been said above Q one hundred five A five Q one hundred ten A one that the whole of corporeal nature acts as the instrument of a spiritual power especially of God Therefore nothing hinders the formation of the body from being due to a corporeal power while the intellectual soul is from God alone Reply Obj four Man begets his like forasmuch as by his seminal power the matter is disposed for the reception of a certain species of form Reply Obj five In the action of the adulterer what is of nature is good in this God concurs But what there is of inordinate lust is evil in this God does not concur THIRD ARTICLE I Q one hundred eighteen Art three Whether Human Souls Were Created Together at the Beginning of the World Objection one It would seem that human souls were created together at the beginning of the world For it is written general two two God rested Him from all His work which He had done This would not be true if He created new souls every day Therefore all souls were created at the same time Obj two Further spiritual substances before all others belong to the perfection of the universe If therefore souls were created with the bodies every day innumerable spiritual substances would be added to the perfection of the universe consequently at the beginning the universe would have been imperfect This is contrary to general two two where it is said that God ended all His work Obj three Further the end of a thing corresponds to its beginning But the intellectual soul remains when the body perishes Therefore it began to exist before the body On the contrary It is said De Eccl Dogmat xiv xviii that the soul is created together with the body I answer that Some have maintained that it is accidental to the intellectual soul to be united to the body asserting that the soul is of the same nature as those spiritual substances which are not united to a body These therefore stated that the souls of men were created together with the angels at the beginning But this statement is false Firstly in the very principle on which it is based For if it were accidental to the soul to be united to the body it would follow that man who results from this union is a being by accident or that the soul is a man which is false as proved above Q seventy five A four Moreover that the human soul is not of the same nature as the angels is proved from the different mode of understanding as shown above Q fifty five A two Q eighty five A one for man understands through receiving from the senses and turning to phantasms as stated above Q eighty four AA six seven Q eighty five A one For this reason the soul needs to be united to the body which is necessary to it for the operation of the sensitive part whereas this cannot be said of an angel Secondly this statement can be proved to be false in itself For if it is natural to the soul to be united to the body it is unnatural to it to be without a body and as long as it is without a body it is deprived of its natural perfection Now it was not fitting that God should begin His work with things imperfect and unnatural for He did not make man without a hand or a foot which are natural parts of a man Much less therefore did He make the soul without a body But if someone say that it is not natural to the soul to be united to the body he must give the reason why it is united to a body And the reason must be either because the soul so willed or for some other reason If because the soul willed it this seems incongruous First because it would be unreasonable of the soul to wish to be united to the body if it did not need the body for if it did need it it would be natural for it to be united to it since nature does not fail in what is necessary Secondly because there would be no reason why having been created from the beginning of the world the soul should after such a long time come to wish to be united to the body For a spiritual substance is above time and superior to the heavenly revolutions Thirdly because it would seem that this body was united to this soul by chance since for this union to take place two wills would have to concur to wit that of the incoming soul and that of the begetter If however this union be neither voluntary nor natural on the part of the soul then it must be the result of some violent cause and to the soul would have something of a penal and afflicting nature This is in keeping with the opinion of Origen who held that souls were embodied in punishment of sin Since therefore all these opinions are unreasonable we must simply confess that souls were not created before bodies but are created at the same time as they are infused into them Reply Obj one God is said to have rested on the seventh day not from all work since we read John five seventeen My Father worketh until now but from the creation of any new genera and species which may not have already existed in the first works For in this sense the souls which are created now existed already as to the likeness of the species in the first works which included the creation of Adam s soul Reply Obj two Something can be added every day to the perfection of the universe as to the number of individuals but not as to the number of species Reply Obj three That the soul remains without the body is due to the corruption of the body which was a result of sin Consequently it was not fitting that God should make the soul without the body from the beginning for as it is written Wis one thirteen sixteen God made not death but the wicked with works and words have called it to them QUESTION one hundred nineteen OF THE PROPAGATION OF MAN AS TO THE BODY In Two Articles We now consider the propagation of man as to the body Concerning this there are two points of inquiry one Whether any part of the food is changed into true human nature two Whether the semen which is the principle of human generation is produced from the surplus food FIRST ARTICLE I Q one hundred nineteen Art one Whether Some Part of the Food Is Changed into True Human Nature Objection one It would seem that none of the food is changed into true human nature For it is written Matt fifteen seventeen Whatsoever entereth into the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the privy But what is cast out is not changed into the reality of human nature Therefore none of the food is changed into true human nature Obj two Further the Philosopher De Gener i five distinguishes flesh belonging to the species from flesh belonging to matter and says that the latter comes and goes Now what is formed from food comes and goes Therefore what is produced from food is flesh belonging to matter not to the species But what belongs to true human nature belongs to the species Therefore the food is not changed into true human nature Obj three Further the radical humor seems to belong to the reality of human nature and if it be lost it cannot be recovered according to physicians But it could be recovered if the food were changed into the humor Therefore food is not changed into true human nature Obj four Further if the food were changed into true human nature whatever is lost in man could be restored But man s death is due only to the loss of something Therefore man would be able by taking food to insure himself against death in perpetuity Obj five Further if the food is changed into true human nature there is nothing in man which may not recede or be repaired for what is generated in a man from his food can both recede and be repaired If therefore a man lived long enough it would follow that in the end nothing would be left in him of what belonged to him at the beginning Consequently he would not be numerically the same man throughout his life since for the thing to be numerically the same identity of matter is necessary But this is incongruous Therefore the food is not changed into true human nature On the contrary Augustine says De Vera Relig xi The bodily food when corrupted that is having lost its form is changed into the texture of the members But the texture of the members belongs to true human nature Therefore the food is changed into the reality of human nature I answer that According to the Philosopher Metaph ii The relation of a thing to truth is the same as its relation to being Therefore that belongs to the true nature of any thing which enters into the constitution of that nature But nature can be considered in two ways firstly in general according to the species secondly as in the individual And whereas the form and the common matter belong to a thing s true nature considered in general individual signate matter and the form individualized by that matter belong to the true nature considered in this particular individual Thus a soul and body belong to the true human nature in general but to the true human nature of Peter and Martin belong this soul and this body Now there are certain things whose form cannot exist but in one individual matter thus the form of the sun cannot exist save in the matter in which it actually is And in this sense some have said that the human form cannot exist but in a certain individual matter which they said was given that form at the very beginning in the first man So that whatever may have been added to that which was derived by posterity from the first parent does not belong to the truth of human nature as not receiving in truth the form of human nature But said they that matter which in the first man was the subject of the human form was multiplied in itself and in this way the multitude of human bodies is derived from the body of the first man According to these the food is not changed into true human nature we take food they stated in order to help nature to resist the action of natural heat and prevent the consumption of the radical humor just as lead or tin is mixed with silver to prevent its being consumed by fire But this is unreasonable in many ways Firstly because it comes to the same that a form can be produced in another matter or that it can cease to be in its proper matter wherefore all things that can be generated are corruptible and conversely Now it is manifest that the human form can cease to exist in this particular matter which is its subject else the human body would not be corruptible Consequently it can begin to exist in another matter so that something else be changed into true human nature Secondly because in all beings whose entire matter is contained in one individual there is only one individual in the species as is clearly the case with the sun moon and such like Thus there would only be one individual of the human species Thirdly because multiplication of matter cannot be understood otherwise than either in respect of quantity only as in things which are rarefied so that their matter increases in dimensions or in respect of the substance itself of the matter But as long as the substance alone of matter remains it cannot be said to be multiplied for multitude cannot consist in the addition of a thing to itself since of necessity it can only result from division Therefore some other substance must be added to matter either by creation or by something else being changed into it Consequently no matter can be multiplied save either by rarefaction as when air is made from water or by the change of some other things as fire is multiplied by the addition of wood or lastly by creation Now it is manifest that the multiplication of matter in the human body does not occur by rarefaction for thus the body of a man of perfect age would be more imperfect than the body of a child Nor does it occur by creation of fresh matter for according to Gregory Moral xxxii All things were created together as to the substance of matter but not as to the specific form Consequently the multiplication of the human body can only be the result of the food being changed into the true human nature Fourthly because since man does not differ from animals and plants in regard to the vegetative soul it would follow that the bodies of animals and plants do not increase through a change of nourishment into the body so nourished but through some kind of multiplication Which multiplication cannot be natural since the matter cannot naturally extend beyond a certain fixed quantity nor again does anything increase naturally save either by rarefaction or the change of something else into it Consequently the whole process of generation and nourishment which are called natural forces would be miraculous Which is altogether inadmissible Wherefore others have said that the human form can indeed begin to exist in some other matter if we consider the human nature in general but not if we consider it as in this individual For in the individual the form remains confined to a certain determinate matter on which it is first imprinted at the generation of that individual so that it never leaves that matter until the ultimate dissolution of the individual And this matter say they principally belongs to the true human nature But since this matter does not suffice for the requisite quantity some other matter must be added through the change of food into the substance of the individual partaking thereof in such a quantity as suffices for the increase required And this matter they state belongs secondarily to the true human nature because it is not required for the primary existence of the individual but for the quantity due to him And if anything further is produced from the food this does not belong to true human nature properly speaking However this also is inadmissible First because this opinion judges of living bodies as of inanimate bodies in which although there be a power of generating their like in species there is not the power of generating their like in the individual which power in living bodies is the nutritive power Nothing therefore would be added to living bodies by their nutritive power if their food were not changed into their true nature Secondly because the active seminal power is a certain impression derived from the soul of the begetter as stated above Q one hundred eighteen A one Hence it cannot have a greater power in acting than the soul from which it is derived If therefore by the seminal power a certain matter truly assumes the form of human nature much more can the soul by the nutritive power imprint the true form of human nature on the food which is assimilated Thirdly because food is needed not only for growth else at the term of growth food would be needful no longer but also to renew that which is lost by the action of natural heat But there would be no renewal unless what is formed from the food took the place of what is lost Wherefore just as that which was there previously belonged to true human nature so also does that which is formed from the food Therefore according to others it must be said that the food is really changed into the true human nature by reason of its assuming the specific form of flesh bones and such like parts This is what the Philosopher says De Anima ii four Food nourishes inasmuch as it is potentially flesh Reply Obj one Our Lord does not say that the whole of what enters into the mouth but all because something from every kind of food is cast out into the privy It may also be said that whatever is generated from food can be dissolved by natural heat and be cast aside through the pores as Jerome expounds the passage Reply Obj two By flesh belonging to the species some have understood that which first receives the human species which is derived from the begetter this they say lasts as long as the individual does By flesh belonging to the matter these understand what is generated from food and this they say does not always remain but as it comes so it goes But this is contrary to the mind of Aristotle For he says there that just as in things which have their species in matter for instance wood or stone so in flesh there is something belonging to the species and something belonging to matter Now it is clear that this distinction has no place in inanimate things which are not generated seminally or nourished Again since what is generated from food is united to by mixing with the body so nourished just as water is mixed with wine as the Philosopher says there by way of example that which is added and that to which it is added cannot be different natures since they are already made one by being mixed together Therefore there is no reason for saying that one is destroyed by natural heat while the other remains It must therefore be said that this distinction of the Philosopher is not of different kinds of flesh but of the same flesh considered from different points of view For if we consider the flesh according to the species that is according to that which is formed therein thus it remains always because the nature of flesh always remains together with its natural disposition But if we consider flesh according to matter then it does not remain but is gradually destroyed and renewed thus in the fire of a furnace the form of fire remains but the matter is gradually consumed and other matter is substituted in its place Reply Obj three The radical humor is said to comprise whatever the virtue of the species is founded on If this be taken away it cannot be renewed as when a man s hand or foot is amputated But the nutritive humor is that which has not yet received perfectly the specific nature but is on the way thereto such is the blood and the like Wherefore if such be taken away the virtue of the species remains in its root which is not destroyed Reply Obj four Every virtue of a passible body is weakened by continuous action because such agents are also patient Therefore the transforming virtue is strong at first so as to be able to transform not only enough for the renewal of what is lost but also for growth Later on it can only transform enough for the renewal of what is lost and then growth ceases At last it cannot even do this and then begins decline In fine when this virtue fails altogether the animal dies Thus the virtue of wine that transforms the water added to it is weakened by further additions of water so as to become at length watery as the Philosopher says by way of example De Gener i five Reply Obj five As the Philosopher says De Gener i five when a certain matter is directly transformed into fire then fire is said to be generated anew but when matter is transformed into a fire already existing then fire is said to be fed Wherefore if the entire matter together loses the form of fire and another matter transformed into fire there will be another distinct fire But if while one piece of wood is burning other wood is laid on and so on until the first piece is entirely consumed the same identical fire will remain all the time because that which is added passes into what pre existed It is the same with living bodies in which by means of nourishment that is renewed which was consumed by natural heat SECOND ARTICLE I Q one hundred nineteen Art two Whether the Semen Is Produced from Surplus Food Objection one It would seem that the semen is not produced from the surplus food but from the substance of the begetter For Damascene says De Fide Orth i eight that generation is a work of nature producing from the substance of the begetter that which is begotten But that which is generated is produced from the semen Therefore the semen is produced from the substance of the begetter Obj two Further the son is like his father in respect of that which he receives from him But if the semen from which something is generated is produced from the surplus food a man would receive nothing from his grandfather and his ancestors in whom the food never existed Therefore a man would not be more like to his grandfather or ancestors than to any other men Obj three Further the food of the generator is sometimes the flesh of cows pigs and suchlike If therefore the semen were produced from surplus food the man begotten of such semen would be more akin to the cow and the pig than to his father or other relations Obj four Further Augustine says general ad lit x twenty that we were in Adam not only by seminal virtue but also in the very substance of the body But this would not be if the semen were produced from surplus food Therefore the semen is not produced therefrom On the contrary The Philosopher proves in many ways De Gener Animal i eighteen that the semen is surplus food I answer that This question depends in some way on what has been stated above A one Q one hundred eighteen A one For if human nature has a virtue for the communication of its form to alien matter not only in another but also in its own subject it is clear that the food which at first is dissimilar becomes at length similar through the form communicated to it Now it belongs to the natural order that a thing should be reduced from potentiality to act gradually hence in things generated we observe that at first each is imperfect and is afterwards perfected But it is clear that the common is to the proper and determinate as imperfect is to perfect therefore we see that in the generation of an animal the animal is generated first then the man or the horse So therefore food first of all receives a certain common virtue in regard to all the parts of the body which virtue is subsequently determinate to this or that part Now it is not possible that the semen be a kind of solution from what is already transformed into the substance of the members For this solution if it does not retain the nature of the member it is taken from it would no longer be of the nature of the begetter and would be due to a process of corruption and consequently it would not have the power of transforming something else into the likeness of that nature But if it retained the nature of the member it is taken from then since it is limited to a certain part of the body it would not have the power of moving towards the production of the whole nature but only the nature of that part Unless one were to say that the solution is taken from all the parts of the body and that it retains the nature of each part Thus the semen would be a small animal in act and generation of animal from animal would be a mere division as mud is generated from mud and as animals which continue to live after being cut in two which is inadmissible It remains to be said therefore that the semen is not something separated from what was before the actual whole rather is it the whole though potentially having the power derived from the soul of the begetter to produce the whole body as stated above A one Q one hundred eight A one Now that which is in potentiality to the whole is that which is generated from the food before it is transformed into the substance of the members Therefore the semen is taken from this In this sense the nutritive power is said to serve the generative power because what is transformed by the nutritive power is employed as semen by the generative power A sign of this according to the Philosopher is that animals of great size which require much food have little semen in proportion to the size of their bodies and generate seldom in like manner fat men and for the same reason Reply Obj one Generation is from the substance of the begetter in animals and plants inasmuch as the semen owes its virtue to the form of the begetter and inasmuch as it is in potentiality to the substance Reply Obj two The likeness of the begetter to the begotten is on account not of the matter but of the form of the agent that generates its like Wherefore in order for a man to be like his grandfather there is no need that the corporeal seminal matter should have been in the grandfather but that there be in the semen a virtue derived from the soul of the grandfather through the father In like manner the third objection is answered For kinship is not in relation to matter but rather to the derivation of the forms Reply Obj four These words of Augustine are not to be understood as though the immediate seminal virtue or the corporeal substance from which this individual was formed were actually in Adam but so that both were in Adam as in principle For even the corporeal matter which is supplied by the mother and which he calls the corporeal substance is originally derived from Adam and likewise the active seminal power of the father which is the immediate seminal virtue in the production of this man But Christ is said to have been in Adam according to the corporeal substance not according to the seminal virtue Because the matter from which His Body was formed and which was supplied by the Virgin Mother was derived from Adam whereas the active virtue was not derived from Adam because His Body was not formed by the seminal virtue of a man but by the operation of the Holy Ghost For such a birth was becoming to Him Hymn for Vespers at Christmas Breviary O P WHO IS ABOVE ALL GOD FOR EVER BLESSED Amen End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Summa Theologica Part I Prima
