INTRODUCTION The Kalevala or the Land of Heroes as the word may be freely rendered is the national epic of Finland and as that country and its literature are still comparatively little known to English readers some preliminary explanations are here necessary On reference to a map of Europe it will be seen that the north western portion of the Russian Empire forms almost a peninsula surrounded except on the Norwegian and Swedish frontiers by two great arms of the Baltic Sea the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland the two great lakes Ladoga and Onega the White Sea and the Arctic Ocean In the north of this peninsula is Lapland and in the south Finland The modern history of Finland begins with the year eleven fifty seven when the country was conquered from the original inhabitants by the Swedes and Christianity was introduced Later on the Finns became Lutherans and are a pious industrious and law abiding people the upper classes being highly educated During the wars between Sweden and Russia under Peter the Great and his successors much Finnish territory was wrested from Sweden and saint Petersburg itself stands on what was formerly Finnish territory When what was left of Finland was finally absorbed by Russia in eighteen oh nine special privileges were granted by Alexander I to the Finns which his successors confirmed and which are highly valued by the people The upper classes speak Swedish and Finnish and the lower classes chiefly Finnish Finnish is upheld by many Finns from patriotic motives and there is a considerable modern literature in both languages Translations of most standard works by English and other authors are published in Finnish The Finns call their country Suomi or Marshland and it is often spoken of as the Land of Ten Thousand Lakes The language they speak belongs to a group called Finnish Ugrian or Altaic and is allied to Lappish and Esthonian and more distantly to Turkish and Hungarian There are only twenty one letters in the alphabet the letter J is pronounced like Y as a consonant and Y almost as a short I The first syllable of every word is accented This renders it difficult to accommodate such words as K a l e v a l a to the metre but I have tried to do my best The Finlanders are very fond of old ballads of which a great number have been collected especially by Elias Lonnrot to whom it occurred to arrange a selection into a connected poem to which he gave the name of Kalevala This he first published in eighteen thirty five in two small volumes containing twenty five Runos or Cantos but afterwards rearranged and expanded it to fifty Runos in which form it was published in eighteen forty nine and this was speedily translated into other languages Perhaps the best translations are Schiefner s German version eighteen fifty two and Collan s Swedish version eighteen sixty four Several volumes of selections and abridgments have also appeared in America and England and an English translation by John Martin Crawford in two volumes was published in New York and London in eighteen eighty nine Schiefner used a flexible metre for his translation which resembles the original as closely as the different character of Finnish and German would permit a metre which had previously though rarely been used in English His work attracted the attention of Longfellow whose Song of Hiawatha is only a rather poor imitation of Schiefner s version of the Kalevala some of the lines being almost identical and several of the characters and incidents being more or less distinctly borrowed from those in the Kalevala The incidents however are generally considerably altered and not always for the better It will be seen that Lonnrot edited the Kalevala from old ballads much as the poems of Homer or at least the Iliad and Odyssey are said to have been put together by order of Pisistratus In the preparation of my own translation the flexibility of the metre has permitted me to attempt an almost literal rendering without I hope sacrificing elegance The simplicity of the Finnish language and metre would in my opinion render a prose version bald and unsatisfactory My chief difficulty has been to fit the Finnish names into even a simple English metre so as to retain the correct pronunciation and I fear I have not always succeeded in overcoming it satisfactorily I am greatly indebted to Prof Kaarle Krohn and Madame Aino Malmberg of Helsingfors for their kindness in looking over the whole of my typewritten translation and for numerous suggestions and comments Of course I am solely responsible for any errors and shortcomings which may be detected in my work I have added short notes at the end of each volume and a glossary of proper names at the end of the book but a detailed commentary would be out of place in a popular edition The Arguments to each Runo are translated slightly modified from those in the original The religion of the poem is peculiar it is a Shamanistic animism overlaid with Christianity The Kalevala relates the history of four principal heroes Vainamoinen the Son of the Wind and of the Virgin of the Air a great culture hero patriarch and minstrel always described as a vigorous old man The Esthonians call him Vanemuine and make him the God of Music His brother Ilmarinen appears to be the son of a human mother though he is also said to have been born upon a hill of charcoal He is a great smith and craftsman and is described as a handsome young man The third hero Lemminkainen is a jovial reckless personage always getting into serious scrapes from which he escapes either by his own skill in magic or by his mother s His love for his mother is the redeeming feature in his character One of his names is Kaukomieli and he is in part the original of Longfellow s Pau Puk Keewis The fourth hero is Kullervo a morose and wicked slave of gigantic strength which he always misuses His history is a terrible tragedy which has been compared to that of OEdipus He is in part the prototype of Longfellow s Kwasind He is the principal hero of the Esthonian ballads in which he is called Kalevipoeg the son of Kaiev Kaleva in Finnish the mythical ancestor of the heroes who does not appear in person in the Kalevala The history of the Kalevipoeg will be found in my work entitled The Hero of Esthonia published by Nimmo in eighteen ninety five in two volumes However the Esthonians make him not a slave but a king In the Kalevala we meet with no kings but only patriarchs or chiefs of clans The principal heroines of the Kalevala are Ilmatar the Daughter of the Air the Creatrix of the world in the first Runo whose counterpart is Marjatta the mother of the successor of Vainamoinen in the last Runo Aino a young Lapp girl beloved of Vainamoinen whose sad fate forms one of the most pathetic episodes in the Kalevala Louhi the Mistress of Pohjola or the North Country and her daughter afterwards the wife of Ilmarinen The character of the daughter of Louhi presents three phases which illustrate more than anything else the composite character of the poem for it is impossible that any two can have been drawn by the same hand Firstly we find her as the beautiful and accomplished daughter of the witch playing the part of a Medea without her cruelty Secondly we find her as a timid and shrinking bride in fact almost a child bride Thirdly when married she appears as a wicked and heartless peasant woman of the worst type The heroes are all skilled in magic and to some extent are able to command or propitiate even the gods A peculiarity of Finnish magic is what is called the word of origin To control or banish an evil power it is sufficient to know and to repeat to it its proper name and to relate the history of its creation Before concluding the Introduction it may be well to give a brief summary of the principal contents of the fifty Runos of the poem Runo I After a preamble by the bard he proceeds to relate how the Virgin of the Air descended into the sea was tossed about by the winds and waves modelled the earth and brought forth the culture hero Vainamoinen who swims to shore Runo II Vainamoinen clears and plants the country and sows barley Runo III The Laplander Joukahainen presumes to contend with Vainamoinen in singing but is plunged by him into a swamp till he pledges to him his sister Aino after which he is released and returns home discomfited But Aino is much distressed at the idea of being obliged to marry an old man Runo IV Vainamoinen makes love to Aino in the forest but she returns home in grief and anger and finally wanders away again and is drowned while trying to swim out to some water nymphs in a lake Her mother weeps for her incessantly Runo V Vainamoinen fishes up Aino in the form of a salmon but she escapes him and his mother advises him to seek a bride in Pohjola the North Country sometimes identified with Lapland but apparently still further north Runo VI While Vainamoinen is riding over the water on his magic steed Joukahainen shoots the horse under him Vainamoinen falls into the water and is driven onwards by a tempest while Joukahainen returns to his mother who upbraids him for shooting at the minstrel Runo VII Vainamoinen is carried by an eagle to the neighbourhood of the Castle of Pohjola where the chatelaine Louhi receives him hospitably and offers him her beautiful daughter if he will forge for her the talisman called the Sampo He replies that he cannot do so himself but will send his brother Ilmarinen so Louhi gives him a sledge in which to return home Runo VIII Vainamoinen on his journey finds the daughter of Louhi sitting on a rainbow weaving and makes love to her In trying to accomplish the tasks she sets him he wounds himself severely and drives away till he finds an old man who promises to stanch the blood Runo IX The old man heals Vainamoinen by relating the origin of Iron and by salving his wounds Runo X Vainamoinen returns home and as Ilmarinen declines to go to Pohjola to forge the Sampo he causes a whirlwind to carry him to the castle Ilmarinen forges the Sampo but the maiden declines to marry him at present and he returns home disconsolate Runos XI XV These Runos relate the early adventures of Lemminkainen He carries off and marries the beautiful Kyllikki but quarrels with her and starts off to Pohjola to woo the daughter of Louhi Louhi sets him various tasks and at length he is slain cast into the river of Tuoni the death god and is hewed to pieces but is rescued and resuscitated by his mother Runos XVI XVII Vainamoinen regrets having renounced the daughter of Louhi in favour of Ilmarinen and begins to build a boat but cannot complete it without three magic words which he seeks for in vain in Tuonela the death kingdom but afterwards jumps down the throat of the dead giant Antero Vipunen and compels him to sing to him all his wisdom Runos XVIII XIX Vainamoinen and Ilmarinen travel to Pohjola one by water and the other by land and agree that the maiden shall make her choice between them She prefers Ilmarinen who is aided by his bride to perform all the tasks set him by Louhi Runos XX XXV The wedding is celebrated at Pohjola an immense ox being slaughtered for the feast after which ale is brewed by Osmotar Kaleva s most beauteous daughter Every one is invited except Lemminkainen who is passed over as too quarrelsome and ill mannered Before the bride and bridegroom leave they have to listen to long lectures about their future conduct Runos XXVI XXX Lemminkainen is enraged at not being invited to the wedding forces his way into the Castle of Pohjola through the magical obstacles in his path and slays the lord of the castle in a duel He flies home and his mother sends him to hide in a distant island where all the warriors are absent and where he lives with the women till the return of the men when he is again obliged to fly He returns home and finds the whole country laid waste and only his mother in hiding Against her advice he persuades his old comrade Tiera to join him in another expedition against Pohjola but Louhi sends the Frost against them and they are driven back in great distress Runos XXXI XXXVI A chief named Untamo lays waste the territory of his brother Kalervo and carries off his wife She gives birth to Kullervo who vows vengeance against Untamo in his cradle Untamo brings Kullervo up as a slave but as he spoils everything he touches sells him to Ilmarinen Ilmarinen s wife ill treats him and he revenges himself by giving her over to be devoured by wolves and bears and escapes to the forests where he rejoins his family One of his sisters has been lost and meeting her accidentally and without knowing her he carries her off She throws herself into a torrent and he returns home His mother advises him to go into hiding but first he makes war on Untamo destroys him and his clan and again returns home Here he finds all his people dead and everything desolate so he wanders off into the forest and falls on his own sword Runos XXXVII XLIX Ilmarinen forges himself a new wife of gold and silver but cannot give her life or warmth so he carries off another daughter of Louhi but she angers him so much that he changes her into a seagull Ilmarinen and Vainamoinen who are afterwards joined by Lemminkainen now undertake another expedition to Pohjola to carry off the Sampo On the way Vainamoinen constructs a kantele or harp of pikebone and lulls Louhi and her people to sleep but she pursues the robbers and first the kantele is lost overboard and then the Sampo is broken to pieces and lost in the sea Vainamoinen saves enough to secure the prosperity of Kalevala but Louhi only carries home a small and almost useless fragment Vainamoinen then makes a new kantele of birchwood Louhi brings pestilence on Kalevala then sends a bear against the country and lastly steals away the sun and moon hiding them in the stone mountain of Pohjola Vainamoinen drives away the plagues kills the bear and renews fire from a conflagration caused by a spark sent down from heaven by the god Ukko Ilmarinen then prepares chains for Louhi and terrifies her into restoring the sun and moon to their original places Runo L The virgin Marjatta swallows a cranberry and brings forth a son who is proclaimed King of Carelia Vainamoinen in great anger quits the country in his boat but leaves the kantele and his songs behind him for the pleasure of the people As a specimen of the Finnish language I quote the original text of a few lines from the charming passage at the commencement of Runo VIII lines one sixteen Tuo oli kaunis Pohjan neiti Maan kuula ve en valio Istui ilman wempelella Taivon kaarella kajotti Pukehissa puhtaissa Walkeissa vaattehissa Kultakangasta kutovi Hopeista huolittavi Kultaisesta sukkulasta Pirralla hopeisella Suihki sukkula piossa Kaami kaessa kaaperoitsi Niiet vaskiset vatisi Hopeinen pirta piukki Neien kangasta kutoissa Hopeista huolittaissa The Kalevala is very unlike any poem familiar to general readers but it contains much that is extremely curious and interesting and many beautiful passages and episodes which are by no means inferior to those we find in the ballad literature of better known countries than Finland W F KIRBY Chiswick May nineteen oh seven CONTENTS OF VOL I RUNO PAGE

the sea where she is fertilized by the winds and waves and becomes the Water Mother one hundred three one hundred seventy six A teal builds its nest on her knee and lays eggs one hundred seventy seven two hundred twelve The eggs fall from the nest and break but the fragments form the earth sky sun moon and clouds two hundred thirteen two hundred forty four The Water Mother creates capes bays sea shores and the depths and shallows of the ocean two hundred forty five two hundred eighty Vainamoinen is born from the Water Mother and is tossed about by the waves for a long time until he reaches the shore two hundred eighty one three hundred forty four I am driven by my longing And my understanding urges That I should commence my singing And begin my recitation I will sing the people s legends And the ballads of the nation To my mouth the words are flowing And the words are gently falling Quickly as my tongue can shape them And between my teeth emerging ten Dearest friend and much loved brother Best beloved of all companions Come and let us sing together Let us now begin our converse Since at length we meet together From two widely sundered regions Rarely can we meet together Rarely one can meet the other In these dismal Northern regions In the dreary land of Pohja twenty Let us clasp our hands together Let us interlock our fingers Let us sing a cheerful measure Let us use our best endeavours While our dear ones hearken to us And our loved ones are instructed While the young are standing round us Of the rising generation Let them learn the words of magic And recall our songs and legends thirty Of the belt of Vainamoinen Of the forge of Ilmarinen And of Kaukomieli s sword point And of Joukahainen s crossbow Of the utmost bounds of Pohja And of Kalevala s wide heathlands These my father sang aforetime As he carved his hatchet s handle And my mother taught me likewise As she turned around her spindle When upon the floor an infant At her knees she saw me tumbling forty As a helpless child milk bearded As a babe with mouth all milky Tales about the Sampo failed not Nor the magic spells of Louhi Old at length became the Sampo Louhi vanished with her magic Vipunen while singing perished Lemminkainen in his follies fifty There are many other legends Songs I learned of magic import Some beside the pathway gathered Others broken from the heather Others wrested from the bushes Others taken from the saplings Gathered from the springing verdure Or collected from the by ways As I passed along as herd boy As a child in cattle pastures sixty On the hillocks rich in honey On the hills for ever golden After Muurikki the black one By the side of dappled Kimmo Then the Frost his songs recited And the rain its legends taught me Other songs the winds have wafted Or the ocean waves have drifted And their songs the birds have added And the magic spells the tree tops seventy In a ball I bound them tightly And arranged them in a bundle On my little sledge I laid it On my sleigh I laid the bundle Home upon the sledge I brought it Then into the barn conveyed it In the storehouse loft I placed it In a little box of copper In the cold my song was resting Long remained in darkness hidden eighty I must draw the songs from Coldness From the Frost must I withdraw them Bring my box into the chamber On the bench end lay the casket Underneath this noble gable Underneath this roof of beauty Shall I ope my box of legends And my chest where lays are treasured Is the ball to be unravelled And the bundle s knot unfastened ninety Then I ll sing so grand a ballad That it wondrously shall echo While the ryebread I am eating And the beer of barley drinking But though ale should not be brought me And though beer should not be offered I will sing though dry my throttle Or will sing with water only To enhance our evening s pleasure Celebrate the daylight s beauty one hundred Or the beauty of the daybreak When another day is dawning I have often heard related And have heard the song recited How the nights closed ever lonely And the days were shining lonely Only born was Vainamoinen And revealed the bard immortal Sprung from the divine Creatrix Born of Ilmatar his mother one hundred ten Air s young daughter was a virgin Fairest daughter of Creation Long did she abide a virgin All the long days of her girlhood In the Air s own spacious mansions In those far extending regions Wearily the time passed ever And her life became a burden Dwelling evermore so lonely Always living as a maiden one hundred twenty In the Air s own spacious mansions In those far extending deserts After this the maid descending Sank upon the tossing billows On the open ocean s surface On the wide expanse of water Then a storm arose in fury From the East a mighty tempest And the sea was wildly foaming And the waves dashed ever higher one hundred thirty Thus the tempest rocked the virgin And the billows drove the maiden O er the ocean s azure surface On the crest of foaming billows Till the wind that blew around her And the sea woke life within her Then she bore her heavy burden And the pain it brought upon her Seven long centuries together Nine times longer than a lifetime one hundred forty Yet no child was fashioned from her And no offspring was perfected Thus she swam the Water Mother East she swam and westward swam she Swam to north west and to south west And around in all directions In the sharpness of her torment In her body s fearful anguish Yet no child was fashioned from her And no offspring was perfected one hundred fifty Then she fell to weeping gently And in words like these expressed her O how wretched is my fortune Wandering thus a child unhappy I have wandered far already And I dwell beneath the heaven By the tempest tossed for ever While the billows drive me onward O er this wide expanse of water On the far extending billows one hundred sixty Better were it had I tarried Virgin in aerial regions Then I should not drift for ever As the Mother of the Waters Here my life is cold and dreary Every moment now is painful Ever tossing on the billows Ever floating on the water Ukko thou of Gods the highest Ruler of the whole of heaven one hundred seventy Hasten here for thou art needed Hasten here at my entreaty Free the damsel from her burden And release her from her tortures Quickly haste and yet more quickly Where I long for thee so sorely Short the time that passed thereafter Scarce a moment had passed over Ere a beauteous teal came flying Lightly hovering o er the water one hundred eighty Seeking for a spot to rest in Searching for a home to dwell in Eastward flew she westward flew she Flew to north west and to southward But the place she sought she found not Not a spot however barren Where her nest she could establish Or a resting place could light on Then she hovered slowly moving And she pondered and reflected one hundred ninety If my nest in wind I stablish Or should rest it on the billows Then the winds will overturn it Or the waves will drift it from me Then the Mother of the Waters Water Mother maid aerial From the waves her knee uplifted Raised her shoulder from the billows That the teal her nest might stablish And might find a peaceful dwelling two hundred Then the teal the bird so beauteous Hovered slow and gazed around her And she saw the knee uplifted From the blue waves of the ocean And she thought she saw a hillock Freshly green with springing verdure There she flew and hovered slowly Gently on the knee alighting And her nest she there established And she laid her eggs all golden two hundred ten Six gold eggs she laid within it And a seventh she laid of iron O er her eggs the teal sat brooding And the knee grew warm beneath her And she sat one day a second Brooded also on the third day Then the Mother of the Waters Water Mother maid aerial Felt it hot and felt it hotter And she felt her skin was heated two hundred twenty Till she thought her knee was burning And that all her veins were melting Then she jerked her knee with quickness And her limbs convulsive shaking Rolled the eggs into the water Down amid the waves of ocean And to splinters they were broken And to fragments they were shattered In the ooze they were not wasted Nor the fragments in the water two hundred thirty But a wondrous change came o er them And the fragments all grew lovely From the cracked egg s lower fragment Now the solid earth was fashioned From the cracked egg s upper fragment Rose the lofty arch of heaven From the yolk the upper portion Now became the sun s bright lustre From the white the upper portion Rose the moon that shines so brightly two hundred forty Whatso in the egg was mottled Now became the stars in heaven Whatso in the egg was blackish In the air as cloudlets floated Now the time passed quickly over And the years rolled quickly onward In the new sun s shining lustre In the new moon s softer beaming Still the Water Mother floated Water Mother maid aerial two hundred fifty Ever on the peaceful waters On the billows foamy surface With the moving waves before her And the heaven serene behind her When the ninth year had passed over And the summer tenth was passing From the sea her head she lifted And her forehead she uplifted And she then began Creation And she brought the world to order two hundred sixty On the open ocean s surface On the far extending waters Wheresoe er her hand she pointed There she formed the jutting headlands Wheresoe er her feet she rested There she formed the caves for fishes When she dived beneath the water There she formed the depths of ocean When towards the land she turned her There the level shores extended two hundred seventy Where her feet to land extended Spots were formed for salmon netting Where her head the land touched lightly There the curving bays extended Further from the land she floated And abode in open water And created rocks in ocean And the reefs that eyes behold not Where the ships are often shattered And the sailors lives are ended two hundred eighty Now the isles were formed already In the sea the rocks were planted Pillars of the sky established Lands and continents created Rocks engraved as though with figures And the hills were cleft with fissures Still unborn was Vainamoinen Still unborn the bard immortal Vainamoinen old and steadfast Rested in his mother s body two hundred ninety For the space of thirty summers And the sum of thirty winters Ever on the placid waters And upon the foaming billows So he pondered and reflected How he could continue living In a resting place so gloomy In a dwelling far too narrow Where he could not see the moonlight Neither could behold the sunlight three hundred Then he spake the words which follow And expressed his thoughts in this wise Aid me Moon and Sun release me And the Great Bear lend his counsel Through the portal that I know not Through the unaccustomed passage From the little nest that holds me From a dwelling place so narrow To the land conduct the roamer To the open air conduct me three hundred ten To behold the moon in heaven And the splendour of the sunlight See the Great Bear s stars above me And the shining stars in heaven When the moon no freedom gave him Neither did the sun release him Then he wearied of existence And his life became a burden Thereupon he moved the portal With his finger fourth in number three hundred twenty Opened quick the bony gateway With the toes upon his left foot With his nails beyond the threshold With his knees beyond the gateway Headlong in the water falling With his hands the waves repelling Thus the man remained in ocean And the hero on the billows In the sea five years he sojourned Waited five years waited six years three hundred thirty Seven years also even eight years On the surface of the ocean By a nameless promontory Near a barren treeless country On the land his knees he planted And upon his arms he rested Rose that he might view the moonbeams And enjoy the pleasant sunlight See the Great Bear s stars above him And the shining stars in heaven three hundred forty Thus was ancient Vainamoinen He the ever famous minstrel Born of the divine Creatrix Born of Ilmatar his mother RUNO II VaINaMoINEN S SOWING Argument Vainamoinen lands on a treeless country and directs Sampsa Pellervoinen to sow trees one forty two At first the oak will not grow but after repeated sowings it springs up overshadows the whole country and hides the sun and moon forty three one hundred ten A little man rises from the sea who fells the oak and permits the sun and moon to shine again one hundred eleven two hundred twenty four Birds sing in the trees herbs flowers and berries grow on the ground only the barley will not spring up two hundred twenty five two hundred fifty six Vainamoinen finds some barleycorns in the sand on the shore and fells the forest leaving only a birch tree as a resting place for the birds two hundred fifty seven two hundred sixty four The eagle grateful for this strikes fire and the felled trees are consumed two hundred sixty five two hundred eighty four Vainamoinen sows the barley prays to Ukko for its increase and it grows and flourishes two hundred eighty five three hundred seventy eight Then did Vainamoinen rising Set his feet upon the surface Of a sea encircled island In a region bare of forest There he dwelt while years passed over And his dwelling he established On the silent voiceless island In a barren treeless country Then he pondered and reflected In his mind he turned it over ten Who shall sow this barren country Thickly scattering seeds around him Pellervoinen earth begotten Sampsa youth of smallest stature Came to sow the barren country Thickly scattering seeds around him Down he stooped the seeds to scatter On the land and in the marshes Both in flat and sandy regions And in hard and rocky places twenty On the hills he sowed the pine trees On the knolls he sowed the fir trees And in sandy places heather Leafy saplings in the valleys In the dales he sowed the birch trees In the loose earth sowed the alders Where the ground was damp the cherries Likewise in the marshes sallows Rowan trees in holy places Willows in the fenny regions thirty Juniper in stony districts Oaks upon the banks of rivers Now the trees sprang up and flourished And the saplings sprouted bravely With their bloom the firs were loaded And the pines their boughs extended In the dales the birch was sprouting In the loose earth rose the alders Where the ground was damp the cherries Juniper in stony districts forty Loaded with its lovely berries And the cherries likewise fruited Vainamoinen old and steadfast Came to view the work in progress Where the land was sown by Sampsa And where Pellervoinen laboured While he saw the trees had flourished And the saplings sprouted bravely Yet had Jumala s tree the oak tree Not struck down its root and sprouted fifty Therefore to its fate he left it Left it to enjoy its freedom And he waited three nights longer And as many days he waited Then he went and gazed around him When the week was quite completed Yet had Jumala s tree the oak tree Not struck down its root and sprouted Then he saw four lovely maidens Five like brides from water rising sixty And they mowed the grassy meadow Down they cut the dewy herbage On the cloud encompassed headland On the peaceful island s summit What they mowed they raked together And in heaps the hay collected From the ocean rose up Tursas From the waves arose the hero And the heaps of hay he kindled And the flames arose in fury seventy All was soon consumed to ashes Till the sparks were quite extinguished Then among the heaps of ashes In the dryness of the ashes There a tender germ he planted Tender germ of oak an acorn Whence the beauteous plant sprang upward And the sapling grew and flourished As from earth a strawberry rises And it forked in both directions eighty Then the branches wide extended And the leaves were thickly scattered And the summit rose to heaven And its leaves in air expanded In their course the clouds it hindered And the driving clouds impeded And it hid the shining sunlight And the gleaming of the moonlight Then the aged Vainamoinen Pondered deeply and reflected ninety Is there none to fell the oak tree And o erthrow the tree majestic Sad is now the life of mortals And for fish to swim is dismal Since the air is void of sunlight And the gleaming of the moonlight But they could not find a hero Nowhere find a man so mighty Who could fell the giant oak tree With its hundred spreading branches one hundred Then the aged Vainamoinen Spoke the very words which follow Noble mother who hast borne me Luonnotar who me hast nurtured Send me powers from out the ocean Numerous are the powers of ocean So that they may fell the oak tree And destroy the tree so baneful That the sun may shine upon us And the pleasant moonlight glimmer one hundred ten Then a man arose from ocean From the waves a hero started Not the hugest of the hugest Nor the smallest of the smallest As a man s thumb was his stature Lofty as the span of woman Decked his head a helm of copper On his feet were boots of copper On his hands were copper gauntlets Gloves adorned with copper tracings one hundred twenty Round his waist his belt was copper In his belt his axe was copper And the haft thereof was thumb long And the blade thereof was nail long Vainamoinen old and steadfast Deeply pondered and reflected While he seems a man in semblance And a hero in appearance Yet his height is but a thumb length Scarce as lofty as an ox hoof one hundred thirty Then he spoke the words which follow And expressed himself in this wise Who are you my little fellow Most contemptible of heroes Than a dead man scarcely stronger And your beauty all has vanished Then the puny man from ocean Hero of the floods made answer I m a man as you behold me Small but mighty water hero one hundred forty I have come to fell the oak tree And to splinter it to fragments Vainamoinen old and steadfast Answered in the words which follow You have hardly been created Neither made nor so proportioned As to fell this mighty oak tree Overthrow the tree stupendous Scarcely had the words been spoken While his gaze was fixed upon him one hundred fifty When the man transformed before him And became a mighty hero While his feet the earth were stamping To the clouds his head he lifted To his knees his beard was flowing To his spurs his locks descended Fathom wide his eyes were parted Fathom wide his trousers measured Round his knee the girth was greater And around his hip twas doubled one hundred sixty Then he sharpened keen the axe blade Brought the polished blade to sharpness Six the stones on which he ground it Seven the stones on which he whet it Then the man stepped forward lightly Hastened on to do his mission Wide his trousers and they fluttered Round his legs as onward strode he And the first step taken brought him To the shore so soft and sandy one hundred seventy With the second stride he landed On the dun ground further inland And the third step brought him quickly Where the oak itself was rooted With his axe he smote the oak tree With his sharpened blade he hewed it Once he smote it twice he smote it And the third stroke wholly cleft it From the axe the flame was flashing Flame was bursting from the oak tree one hundred eighty As he strove to fell the oak tree Overthrow the tree stupendous Thus the third blow was delivered And the oak tree fell before him For the mighty tree was shattered And the hundred boughs had fallen And the trunk extended eastward And the summit to the north west And the leaves were scattered southwards And the branches to the northward one hundred ninety He who took a branch from off it Took prosperity unceasing What was broken from the summit Gave unending skill in magic He who broke a leafy branchlet Gathered with it love unending What remained of fragments scattered Chips of wood and broken splinters On the bright expanse of ocean On the far extending billows two hundred In the breeze were gently rocking On the waves were lightly drifted Like the boats on ocean s surface Like the ships amid the sea waves Northward drove the wind the fragments Where the little maid of Pohja Stood on beach and washed her head dress And she washed her clothes and rinsed them On the shingle by the ocean On a tongue of land projecting two hundred ten On the waves she saw the fragments Put them in her birchbark wallet In her wallet took them homeward In the well closed yard she stored them For the arrows of the sorcerer For the chase to furnish weapons When the oak at last had fallen And the evil tree was levelled Once again the sun shone brightly And the pleasant moonlight glimmered two hundred twenty And the clouds extended widely And the rainbow spanned the heavens O er the cloud encompassed headland And the island s misty summit Then the wastes were clothed with verdure And the woods grew up and flourished Leaves on trees and grass in meadows In the trees the birds were singing Loudly sang the cheery throstle In the tree tops called the cuckoo two hundred thirty Then the earth brought forth her berries Shone the fields with golden blossoms Herbs of every species flourished Plants and trees of all descriptions But the barley would not flourish Nor the precious seed would ripen Then the aged Vainamoinen Walked around and deeply pondered By the blue waves sandy margin On the mighty ocean s border two hundred forty And six grains of corn he found there Seven fine seeds of corn he found there On the borders of the ocean On the yielding sandy margin In a marten s skin he placed them From the leg of summer squirrel Then he went to sow the fallows On the ground the seeds to scatter Near to Kaleva s own fountain And upon the field of Osmo two hundred fifty From a tree there chirped the titmouse Osmo s barley will not flourish Nor will Kaleva s oats prosper While untilled remains the country And uncleared remains the forest Nor the fire has burned it over Vainamoinen old and steadfast Ground his axe blade edge to sharpness And began to fell the forest Toiling hard to clear the country two hundred sixty All the lovely trees he levelled Sparing but a single birch tree That the birds might rest upon it And from thence might call the cuckoo In the sky there soared an eagle Of the birds of air the greatest And he came and gazed around him Wherefore is the work unfinished And the birch tree still unfallen Wherefore spare the beauteous birch tree Said the aged Vainamoinen two hundred seventy Therefore is the birch left standing That the birds may perch upon it All the birds of air may rest there Said the bird of air the eagle Very wisely hast thou acted Thus to leave the birch tree standing And the lovely tree unfallen That the birds may perch upon it And that I myself may rest there Then the bird of air struck fire two hundred eighty And the flames rose up in brightness While the north wind fanned the forest And the north east wind blew fiercely All the trees were burned to ashes Till the sparks were quite extinguished Then the aged Vainamoinen Took the six seeds from his satchel And he took the seven small kernels From the marten s skin he took them From the leg of summer squirrel two hundred ninety From the leg of summer ermine Then he went to sow the country And to scatter seeds around him And he spoke the words which follow Now I stoop the seeds to scatter As from the Creator s fingers From the hand of Him Almighty That the country may be fertile And the corn may grow and flourish Patroness of lowland country three hundred Old one of the plains Earth Mother Let the tender blade spring upward Let the earth support and cherish Might of earth will never fail us Never while the earth existeth When the Givers are propitious And Creation s daughters aid us Rise O earth from out thy slumber Field of the Creator rouse thee Make the blade arise and flourish three hundred ten Let the stalks grow up and lengthen That the ears may grow by thousands Yet a hundredfold increasing By my ploughing and my sowing In return for all my labour Ukko thou of Gods the highest Father thou in heaven abiding Thou to whom the clouds are subject Of the scattered clouds the ruler three hundred twenty All thy clouds do thou assemble In the light make clear thy counsel Send thou forth a cloud from eastwards In the north west let one gather Send thou others from the westward Let them drive along from southward Send the light rain forth from heaven Let the clouds distil with honey That the corn may sprout up strongly And the stalks may wave and rustle three hundred thirty Ukko then of Gods the highest Father of the highest heaven Heard and all the clouds assembled In the light made clear his counsel And he sent a cloud from eastward In the north west let one gather Others too he sent from westward Let them drive along from southward Linked them edge to edge together And he closed the rifts between them three hundred forty Then he sent the rain from heaven And the clouds distilled sweet honey That the corn might sprout up stronger And the stalks might wave and rustle Thus the sprouting germ was nourished And the rustling stalks grew upward From the soft earth of the cornfield Through the toil of Vainamoinen After this two days passed over After two nights after three nights three hundred fifty When the week was full completed Vainamoinen old and steadfast Wandered forth to see the progress How his ploughing and his sowing And his labours had resulted There he found the barley growing And the ears were all six cornered And the stalks were all three knotted Then the aged Vainamoinen Wandered on and gazed around him three hundred sixty And the cuckoo bird of springtime Came and saw the birch tree growing Wherefore is the birch left standing And unfelled the slender birch tree Said the aged Vainamoinen Therefore is the birch left standing And unfelled the slender birch tree As a perch for thee O Cuckoo Whence the cuckoo s cry may echo From thy sand hued throat cry sweetly three hundred seventy With thy silver voice call loudly With thy tin like voice cry clearly Call at morning call at evening And at noontide call thou likewise To rejoice my plains surrounding That my woods may grow more cheerful That my coast may grow more wealthy And my region grow more fruitful RUNO III VaINaMoINEN AND JOUKAHAINEN Argument Vainamoinen increases in wisdom and composes songs one twenty Joukahainen sets out to contend with him in wisdom but as he cannot overcome him he challenges him to a duel whereupon Vainamoinen grows angry and sinks him in a swamp by his magic songs twenty one three hundred thirty Joukahainen in great distress finally offers his sister Aino in marriage to Vainamoinen who accepts the offer and releases him three hundred thirty one four hundred seventy six Joukahainen returns home discomfited and relates his misfortunes to his mother four hundred seventy seven five hundred twenty four The mother rejoices at the prospect of such an alliance but the daughter laments and weeps five hundred twenty five five hundred eighty Vainamoinen old and steadfast Passed the days of his existence Where lie Vainola s sweet meadows Kalevala s extended heathlands There he sang his songs of sweetness Sang his songs and proved his wisdom Day by day he sang unwearied Night by night discoursed unceasing Sang the songs of by gone ages Hidden words of ancient wisdom ten Songs which all the children sing not All beyond men s comprehension In these ages of misfortune When the race is near Its ending Far away the news was carried Far abroad was spread the tidings Of the songs of Vainamoinen Of the wisdom of the hero In the south was spread the rumour Reached to Pohjola the tidings twenty Here dwelt youthful Joukahainen He the meagre youth of Lapland And when visiting the village Wondrous tales he heard related How there dwelt another minstrel And that better songs were carolled Far in Vainola s sweet meadows Kalevala s extended heathlands Better songs than he could compass Better than his father taught him thirty This he heard with great displeasure And his heart was filled with envy That the songs of Vainamoinen Better than his own were reckoned Then he went to seek his mother Sought her out the aged woman And declared that he would journey And was eager to betake him Unto Vainola s far dwellings That he might contend with Vaino forty But his father straight forbade him Both his father and his mother Thence to Vainola to journey That he might contend with Vaino He will surely sing against you Sing against you and will ban you Sink your mouth and head in snow drifts And your hands in bitter tempest Till your hands and feet are stiffened And incapable of motion fifty Said the youthful Joukahainen Good the counsel of my father And my mother s counsel better Best of all my own opinion I will set myself against him And defy him to a contest I myself my songs will sing him I myself will speak my mantras Sing until the best of minstrels Shall become the worst of singers sixty Shoes of stone will I provide him Wooden trousers on his haunches On his breast a stony burden And a rock upon his shoulders Stony gloves his hands shall cover And his head a stony helmet Then he went his way unheeding Went his way and fetched his gelding From whose mouth the fire was flashing Neath whose legs the sparks were flying seventy Then the fiery steed he harnessed To the golden sledge he yoked him In the sledge himself he mounted And upon the seat he sat him O er the horse his whip he brandished With the beaded whip he smote him From the place the horse sprang quickly And he darted lightly forwards On he drove with thundering clatter As he drove a day a second eighty Driving also on the third day And at length upon the third day Came to Vainola s sweet meadows Kalevala s extended heathlands Vainamoinen old and steadfast He the oldest of magicians As it chanced was driving onward Peacefully his course pursuing On through Vainola s sweet meadows Kalevala s extended heathlands ninety Came the youthful Joukahainen Driving on the road against him And the shafts were wedged together And the reins were all entangled And the collar jammed with collar And the runners dashed together Thus their progress was arrested Thus they halted and reflected Sweat dropped down upon the runners From the shafts the steam was rising one hundred Asked the aged Vainamoinen Who are you and what your lineage You who drive so reckless onward Utterly without reflection Broken are the horses collars And the wooden runners likewise You have smashed my sledge to pieces Broke the sledge in which I travelled Then the youthful Joukahainen Answered in the words which follow one hundred ten I am youthful Joukahainen But yourself should also tell me What your race and what your nation And from what vile stock you issue Vainamoinen old and steadfast Told his name without concealment And began to speak as follows Youth if you are Joukahainen You should move aside a little For remember you are younger one hundred twenty But the youthful Joukahainen Answered in the words which follow Here of youthfulness we reck not Nought doth youth or age concern us He who highest stands in knowledge He whose wisdom is the greatest Let him keep the path before him And the other yield the passage If you are old Vainamoinen And the oldest of the minstrels one hundred thirty Let us give ourselves to singing Let us now repeat our sayings That the one may teach the other And the one surpass the other Vainamoinen old and steadfast Answered in the words which follow What can I myself accomplish As a wise man or a singer I have passed my life in quiet Here among these very moorlands one hundred forty On the borders of my home field I have heard the cuckoo calling But apart from this at present I will ask you to inform me What may be your greatest wisdom And the utmost of your knowledge Said the youthful Joukahainen Many things I know in fulness And I know with perfect clearness And my insight shows me plainly one hundred fifty In the roof we find the smoke hole And the fire is near the hearthstone Joyful life the seal is leading In the waves there sports the sea dog And he feeds upon the salmon And the powans round about him Smooth the water loved by powans Smooth the surface too for salmon And in frost the pike is spawning Slimy fish in wintry weather one hundred sixty Sluggish is the perch the humpback In the depths it swims in autumn But it spawns in drought of summer Swimming slowly to the margin If this does not yet suffice you I am wise in other matters And of weighty things can tell you In the north they plough with reindeer In the south the mare is useful And the elk In furthest Lapland one hundred seventy Trees I know on Pisa mountain Firs upon the rocks of Horna Tall the trees on Pisa mountain And the firs on rocks of Horna Three great waterfalls I know of And as many lakes extensive And as many lofty mountains Underneath the vault of heaven Hallapyora is in Hame Karjala has Kaatrakoski one hundred eighty But they do not match the Vuoksi There where Imatra is rushing Said the aged Vainamoinen Childish tales and woman s wisdom But for bearded men unsuited And for married men unfitted Tell me words of deepest wisdom Tell me now of things eternal Then the youthful Joukahainen Answered in the words which follow one hundred ninety Well I know whence comes the titmouse That the titmouse is a birdie And a snake the hissing viper And the ruffe a fish in water And I know that hard is iron And that mud when black is bitter Painful too is boiling water And the heat of fire is hurtful Water is the oldest medicine Cataract s foam a magic potion two hundred The Creator s self a sorcerer Jumala the Great Magician From the rock springs forth the water And the fire from heaven descendeth And from ore we get the iron And in hills we find the copper Marshy country is the oldest And the first of trees the willow Pine roots were the oldest houses And the earliest pots were stone ones two hundred ten Vainamoinen old and steadfast Answered in the words which follow Is there more that you can tell me Or is this the end of nonsense Said the youthful Joukahainen Many little things I wot of And the time I well remember When twas I who ploughed the ocean Hollowed out the depths of ocean And I dug the caves for fishes two hundred twenty And I sunk the deep abysses When the lakes I first created And I heaped the hills together And the rocky mountains fashioned Then I stood with six great heroes I myself the seventh among them When the earth was first created And the air above expanded For the sky I fixed the pillars And I reared the arch of heaven two hundred thirty To the moon assigned his journey Helped the sun upon his pathway To the Bear his place appointed And the stars in heaven I scattered Said the aged Vainamoinen Ay indeed a shameless liar You at least were never present When the ocean first was furrowed And the ocean depths were hollowed And the caves were dug for fishes two hundred forty And the deep abysses sunken And the lakes were first created When the hills were heaped together And the rocky mountains fashioned No one ever yet had seen you None had seen you none had heard you When the earth was first created And the air above expanded When the posts of heaven were planted And the arch of heaven exalted two hundred fifty When the moon was shown his pathway And the sun was taught to journey When the Bear was fixed in heaven And the stars in heaven were scattered But the youthful Joukahainen Answered in the words which follow If I fail in understanding I will seek it at the sword point O thou aged Vainamoinen O thou very broad mouthed minstrel two hundred sixty Let us measure swords together Let the blade decide between us Said the aged Vainamoinen I have little cause to fret me Either for your sword or wisdom For your sword point or your judgment But apart from this at present I will draw no sword upon you So contemptible a fellow And so pitiful a weakling two hundred seventy Then the youthful Joukahainen Shook his head his mouth drawn crooked And he tossed his locks of blackness And he spake the words which follow He who shuns the sword s decision Nor betakes him to his sword blade To a swine I soon will sing him To a snouted swine transform him Heroes I have thus o erpowered Hither will I drive and thither two hundred eighty And will pitch them on the dunghill Grunting in the cowshed corner Angry then was Vainamoinen Filled with wrath and indignation And himself commenced his singing And to speak his words of wisdom But he sang no childish ditties Children s songs and women s jesting But a song for bearded heroes Such as all the children sing not two hundred ninety Nor a half the boys can master Nor a third can lovers compass In the days of dark misfortune When our life is near its ending Sang the aged Vainamoinen Lakes swelled up and earth was shaken And the coppery mountains trembled And the mighty rocks resounded And the mountains clove asunder On the shore the stones were shivered three hundred Then he sang of Joukahainen Changed his runners into saplings And to willows changed the collar And the reins he turned to alder And he sang the sledge all gilded To the lake among the rushes And the whip with beads embellished To a reed upon the water And the horse with front white spotted To a stone beside the torrent three hundred ten Then he sang his sword gold hilted To a lightning flash in heaven And his ornamented crossbow To a rainbow o er the water And he sang his feathered arrows Into hawks that soar above him And his dog with upturned muzzle Stands a stone in earth embedded From his head his cap by singing Next became a cloud above him three hundred twenty From his hands his gloves by singing Next were changed to water lilies And the blue coat he was wearing Floats a fleecy cloud in heaven And the handsome belt that girt him In the sky as stars he scattered As he sang sank Joukahainen Waist deep in the swamp beneath him Hip deep in the marshy meadow To his arm pits in a quicksand three hundred thirty Then indeed young Joukahainen Knew at last and comprehended And he knew his course was finished And his journey now was ended For in singing he was beaten By the aged Vainamoinen He would raise his foot to struggle But he could no longer lift it Then he tried to lift the other But as shod with stone he felt it three hundred forty Then the youthful Joukahainen Felt the greatest pain and anguish And he fell in grievous trouble And he spoke the words which follow O thou wisest Vainamoinen O thou oldest of magicians Speak thy words of magic backwards And reverse thy songs of magic Loose me from this place of terror And release me from my torment three hundred fifty I will pay the highest ransom And the fixed reward will give thee Said the aged Vainamoinen What do you propose to give me If I turn my words of magic And reverse my songs of magic Loose you from this place of terror And release you from your torment Said the youthful Joukahainen I ve two crossbows I could give you three hundred sixty Ay a pair of splendid crossbows One shoots forth with passing quickness Surely hits the mark the other If it please you choose between them Said the aged Vainamoinen No your bows I do not covet For the wretched bows I care not I myself have plenty of them All the walls are decked with crossbows All the pegs are hung with crossbows three hundred seventy In the woods they wander hunting Nor a hero needs to span them Then the youthful Joukahainen In the swamp he sang yet deeper Said the youthful Joukahainen I have yet two boats to offer Splendid boats as I can witness One is light and fit for racing Heavy loads will bear the other If it please you choose between them three

upon their haunches Then the youthful Joukahainen In the swamp he sang yet deeper Said the youthful Joukahainen O thou aged Vainamoinen Speak thy words of magic backwards And reverse thy songs of magic four hundred ten I will give a golden helmet And a hat filled up with silver Which my father won in warfare Which he won in battle struggle Said the aged Vainamoinen No I do not want your silver And for gold I only scorn it I myself have both in plenty Every storeroom crammed with treasure Every chest is overflowing four hundred twenty Gold as ancient as the moonlight Silver with the sun coeval Then the youthful Joukahainen In the swamp he sang yet deeper Said the youthful Joukahainen O thou aged Vainamoinen Loose me from this place of terror And release me from my torment All my stacks at home I ll give thee And my fields I likewise promise four hundred thirty All to save my life I offer If you will accept my ransom Said the aged Vainamoinen No your barns I do not covet And your fields are neath my notice I myself have plenty of them Fields are mine in all directions Stocks are reared on every fallow And my own fields please me better And my stacks of corn are finest four hundred forty Then the youthful Joukahainen In the swamp he sang yet deeper Then the youthful Joukahainen Felt at length the greatest anguish Chin deep in the swamp while sinking In the mud his beard was draggled In the moss his mouth was sunken And his teeth among the tree roots Said the youthful Joukahainen O thou wisest Vainamoinen four hundred fifty O thou oldest of magicians Sing once more thy songs of magic Grant the life of one so wretched And release me from my prison In the stream my feet are sunken With the sand my eyes are smarting Speak thy words of magic backwards Break the spell that overwhelms me You shall have my sister Aino I will give my mother s daughter four hundred sixty She shall dust your chamber for you Sweep the flooring with her besom Keep the milk pots all in order And shall wash your garments for you Golden fabrics she shall weave you And shall bake you cakes of honey Then the aged Vainamoinen Heard his words and grew full joyful Since to tend his age was promised Joukahainen s lovely sister four hundred seventy On the stone of joy he sat him On the stone of song he rested Sang an hour and sang a second And again he sang a third time Thus reversed his words of magic And dissolved the spell completely Then the youthful Joukahainen From the mud his chin uplifted And his beard he disentangled From the rock his steed led forward four hundred eighty Drew his sledge from out the bushes From the reeds his whip unloosing Then upon his sledge he mounted And upon the seat he sat him And with gloomy thoughts he hastened With a heart all sad and doleful Homeward to his dearest mother Unto her the aged woman On he drove with noise and tumult Home he drove in consternation four hundred ninety And he broke the sledge to pieces At the door the shafts were broken Then the noise alarmed his mother And his father came and asked him Recklessly the sledge was broken Did you break the shafts on purpose Wherefore do you drive so rashly And arrive at home so madly Then the youthful Joukahainen Could not keep his tears from flowing five hundred Sad he bowed his head in sorrow And his cap awry he shifted And his lips were dry and stiffened O er his mouth his nose was drooping Then his mother came and asked him Wherefore was he sunk in sorrow O my son why weep so sadly O my darling why so troubled With thy lips so dry and stiffened O er thy mouth thy nose thus drooping five hundred ten Said the youthful Joukahainen O my mother who hast borne me There is cause for what has happened For the sorcerer has o ercome me Cause enough have I for weeping

Not alone on father s acres Or upon your brother s clearings five hundred eighty RUNO IV THE FATE OF AINO Argument Vainamoinen meets Aino in the wood and addresses her one twenty Aino hurries home

her home three hundred seventy one four hundred thirty four Her mother weeps for her night and day four hundred thirty five five hundred eighteen Then the little maiden Aino Youthful Joukahainen s sister Went for besoms to the greenwood Sought for bath whisks in the bushes One she gathered for her father And a second for her mother And she gathered yet another For her young and ruddy brother As she turned her footsteps homeward Pushing through the alder bushes ten Came the aged Vainamoinen And he saw her in the thicket Finely clad among the herbage And he spoke the words which follow Maiden do not wear for others But for me alone O maiden Round thy neck a beaded necklace And a cross upon thy bosom Plait for me thy beauteous tresses Bind thy hair with silken ribands twenty But the young maid gave him answer Not for thee and not for others Rests the cross upon my bosom And my hair is bound with ribands Nought I care for sea borne raiment Wheaten bread I do not value I will walk in home spun garments And with crusts will still my hunger In my dearest father s dwelling And beside my much loved mother thirty From her breast she took the crosslet Drew the rings from off her fingers From her neck the beaded necklace From her head the scarlet ribands Down upon the ground she threw them Scattered them among the bushes Then she hastened ever weeping Loud lamenting to the homestead At the window sat her father While he carved a hatchet handle forty Wherefore weepest thou my daughter Young and yet so full of sadness Cause enough have I for weeping Cause for weeping and lamenting

nursed me eighty Cause enough have I for anguish Cause enough for bitter sorrow Therefore do I weep poor mother Therefore grieve I O my mother To the wood I went for besoms Gathered bath whisks from the bushes One I gathered for my father One I gathered for my mother And I gathered yet another For my young and ruddy brother ninety As I turned my footsteps homeward And across the heath was tripping From the dell there called Osmoinen From the field cried Kalevainen Do not wear fair maid for others But for me alone poor maiden Round thy neck a beaded necklace And a cross upon thy bosom Plait for me thy beauteous tresses Braid thy hair with silken ribands one hundred From my breast I took the crosslet From my neck the beaded necklace Tore the blue bands from my temples From my head the scarlet ribands Then upon the ground I threw them Scattered them among the bushes And I answered him in this wise Not for thee and not for others Rests my cross upon my bosom And my hair is bound with ribands one hundred ten Nought I care for sea borne raiment Wheaten bread I do not value I will walk in home spun garments And with crusts will still my hunger In my dearest father s dwelling And

long fresh butter That your form may grow more rounded Eat thou pork the second season That your form may grow more charming And the third year eat thou cream cakes That you may become more lovely Seek the storehouse on the mountain There the finest chamber open There are coffers piled on coffers Chests in heaps on chests are loaded one hundred thirty Open then the finest coffer Raise the painted lid with clangour There you ll find six golden girdles Seven blue robes of finest texture Woven by the Moon s own daughter By the Sun s own daughter fashioned In the days when I was youthful In my youthful days of girlhood In the wood I sought for berries Gathered raspberries on the mountain one hundred forty Heard the moonlight s daughter weaving And the sunlight s daughter spinning There beside the wooded island On the borders of the greenwood Thereupon I softly neared them And beside them took my station And began to ask them gently In the words that I repeat you Give you of your gold O Kuutar And your silver give Paivatar one hundred fifty To the maiden poorly dowered To the child who now implores you Then her gold did Kuutar give me And her silver gave Paivatar With the gold I decked my temples And adorned my head with silver Homeward like a flower I hastened Joyful to my father s dwelling These I wore one day a second Then upon the third day after one hundred sixty Took the gold from off my temples From my head removed the silver Took them to the mountain storehouse In the chest with care I laid them There until this day I left them And since then I have not seen them On thy brows bind silken ribands On thy temples gold adornments Round thy neck a beaded necklace On thy breast a golden crosslet one hundred seventy Put thou on a shift of linen Of the finest flax that s woven Lay thou on a robe of woollen Bind it with a silken girdle Then the finest silken stockings And of shoes the very finest Then In plaits thy hair arranging Bind it up with silken ribands Slip the gold rings on thy fingers Deck thy wrists with golden bracelets one hundred eighty After this return thou homewards From thy visit to the storehouse As the joy of all thy kindred And of all thy race the fairest Like a floweret by the wayside Like a raspberry on the mountain Far more lovely than aforetime Fairer than in former seasons Thus the mother urged her counsel Thus she spoke unto her daughter one hundred ninety But the daughter did not heed her Heeded not her mother s counsel From the house she wandered weeping From the homestead went in sorrow And she said the words which follow And expressed herself in this wise What may be the joyous feelings And the thoughts of one rejoicing Such may be the joyous feelings And the thoughts of one rejoicing two hundred Like the dancing of the water On the waves when gently swelling What do mournful thoughts resemble What the long tailed duck may ponder Such may mournful thoughts resemble Thus the long tailed duck may ponder As neath frozen snow embedded Water deep in well imprisoned Often now my life is clouded Often is my childhood troubled two hundred ten And my thoughts like withered herbage As I wander through the bushes Wandering on through grassy meadows Pushing through the tangled thickets And my thoughts are pitch for blackness And my heart than soot not brighter Better fortune had befel me And it would have been more happy Had I not been born and nurtured And had never grown in stature two hundred twenty Till I saw these days of sorrow And this joyless time o ertook me Had I died in six nights only Or upon the eighth had perished Much I should not then have needed But a shroud a span long only And of earth a tiny corner Little then had wept my mother Fewer tears had shed my father And my brother not a tearlet two hundred thirty Thus she wept a day a second And again her mother asked her Wherefore dost thou weep poor maiden Wherefore thus lament and sorrow Therefore weep I hapless maiden Therefore do I weep for ever That yourself have pledged me hapless And your daughter you have promised Thus to be an old man s comfort As a solace to the old man two hundred forty To support his feeble footsteps And to wait upon him always Better were it had you sent me Deeply down beneath the billows There to be the powan s sister And companion of the fishes In the lake tis surely better There beneath the waves to sojourn There to be the powan s sister And companion of the fishes two hundred fifty Than to be an old man s comfort To support his aged footsteps So that I can mend his stockings And may be a staff to prop him Then she sought the mountain storehouse And the inner room she entered And the finest chest she opened Raised the painted lid with clangour And she found six golden girdles Seven blue robes of finest textures two hundred sixty And she robed her in the finest And completed her adornment Set the gold upon her temples On her hair the shining silver On her brow the sky blue ribands On her head the bands of scarlet Then she wandered from the storehouses And across the fields she wandered Past the marshes and the heathlands Through the shady gloomy forests two hundred seventy Thus she sang as on she hastened Thus she spoke as on she wandered All my heart is filled with trouble On my head a stone is loaded But my trouble would not vex me And the weight would less oppress me If I perished hapless maiden Ending thus my life of sorrow In the burden of my trouble In the sadness of my sorrow two hundred eighty Now my time perchance approaches From this weary world to hasten Time to seek the world of Mana Time to Tuonela to hasten For my father will not mourn me Nor my mother will lament me Nor my sister s cheeks be moistened Nor my brother s eyes be tearful If I sank beneath the waters Sinking where the fish are sporting two hundred ninety To the depths beneath the billows Down amid the oozy blackness On she went one day a second And at length upon the third day Came she to a lake s broad margin To the bank o ergrown with rushes And she reached it in the night time And she halted in the darkness In the evening wept the maiden Through the darksome night lamented three hundred On the rocks that fringed the margin Where a bay spread wide before her At the earliest dawn of morning As she gazed from off a headland Just beyond she saw three maidens Bathing there amid the waters Aino made the fourth among then And the fifth a slender sapling Then her shift she cast on willows And her dress upon the aspens three hundred ten On the open ground her stockings Threw her shoes upon the boulders On the sand her beads she scattered And her rings upon the shingle In the waves a rock was standing Brightly hued and golden shining And she swam and sought to reach it As a refuge in her trouble When at length she stood upon it And would rest upon the summit three hundred twenty On the stone of many colours On the

8713_302111_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Vainamoinen old and steadfast Thundered on upon his journey From the gloomy land of Pohja Sariola for ever misty 
none	none	twenty Short the distance he had travelled Short the way that he had journeyed When he heard the shuttle whizzing High above his head he heard it 
8713_302111_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Thereupon his head he lifted And he gazed aloft to heaven And beheld a glorious rainbow On the arch the maiden seated As she wove a golden fabric As the silver comb resounded

8713_302111_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Vainamoinen old and steadfast Stayed his horse upon the instant And he raised his voice and speaking In such words as these addressed her Come into my sledge O maiden In the sledge beside me seat thee 
none	none	Then the maiden made him answer And in words like these responded Wherefore should the maiden join you In the sledge beside you seated forty Vainamoinen old and steadfast Heard her words and then responded Therefore should the maiden join me In the sledge beside me seat her Bread of honey to prepare me And the best of beer to brew me Singing blithely on the benches Gaily talking at the window When in Vainola I sojourn At my home in Kalevala fifty 
8713_302111_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Then the maiden gave him answer And in words like these addressed him As I wandered through the bedstraws Tripping o er the yellow meadows Yesterday in time of evening As the sun was slowly sinking In the bush a bird was singing And I heard the fieldfare trilling Singing of the whims of maidens And the whims of new wed damsels 
none	none	sixty
8713_302111_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Thus the bird was speaking to me And I questioned it in this wise 
8713_302111_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell me O thou little fieldfare Sing thou that my ears may hear it Whether it indeed is better Whether thou hast heard tis better For a girl in father s dwelling Or in household of a husband 
none	none	Thereupon the bird made answer And the fieldfare answered chirping seventy Brilliant is the day in summer But a maiden s lot is brighter And the frost makes cold the iron Yet the new bride s lot is colder In her father s house a maiden Lives like strawberry in the garden But a bride in house of husband Lives like house dog tightly fettered To a slave comes rarely pleasure To a wedded damsel never eighty Vainamoinen old and steadfast Answered in the words which follow Song of birds is idle chatter And the throstle s merely chirping As a child a daughter s treated But a maid must needs be married Come into my sledge O maiden In the sledge beside me seat thee I am not a man unworthy Lazier not than other heroes ninety 
8713_302111_000015_000000	train-clean-360	But the maid gave crafty answer And in words like these responded As a man I will esteem you And as hero will regard you If you can split up a horsehair With a blunt and pointless knife blade And an egg in knots you tie me Yet no knot is seen upon it 
none	none	Vainamoinen old and steadfast Then the hair in twain divided one hundred With a blunt and pointless knife blade With a knife completely pointless And an egg in knots he twisted Yet no knot was seen upon it Then again he asked the maiden In the sledge to sit beside him But the maid gave crafty answer I perchance at length may join you If you ll peel the stone I give you And a pile of ice will hew me one hundred ten But no splinter scatter from it Nor the smallest fragment loosen 
8713_302111_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Vainamoinen old and steadfast Did not find the task a hard one From the stone the rind he severed And a pile of ice he hewed her But no splinters scattered from it Nor the smallest fragment loosened Then again he asked the maiden In the sledge to sit beside him 
none	none	one hundred twenty But the maid gave crafty answer And she spoke the words which follow No I will not yet go with you If a boat you cannot carve me From the splinters of my spindle From the fragments of my shuttle And shall launch the boat in water Push it out upon the billows But no knee shall press against it And no hand must even touch it one hundred thirty And no arm shall urge it onward Neither shall a shoulder guide it Vainamoinen old and steadfast Answered in the words which follow None in any land or country Under all the vault of heaven Like myself can build a vessel Or so deftly can construct it Then he took the spindle splinters Of the reel he took the fragments one hundred forty And began the boat to fashion Fixed a hundred planks together On a mount of steel he built it Built it on the rocks of iron 
8713_302111_000020_000000	train-clean-360	At the boat with zeal he laboured Toiling at the work unresting Working thus one day a second On the third day likewise working But the rocks his axe blade touched not And upon the hill it rang not 
none	none	one hundred fifty But at length upon the third day Hiisi turned aside the axe shaft Lempo turned the edge against him And an evil stroke delivered On the rocks the axe blade glinted On the hill the blade rang loudly From the rock the axe rebounded In the flesh the steel was buried In the victim s knee twas buried In the toes of Vainamoinen one hundred sixty In the flesh did Lempo drive it To the veins did Hiisi guide it From the wound the blood flowed freely Bursting forth in streaming torrents Vainamoinen old and steadfast He the oldest of magicians Uttered words like those which follow And expressed himself in this wise O thou evil axe ferocious With thy edge of gleaming sharpness one hundred seventy Thou hast thought to hew a tree trunk And to strike upon a pine tree Match thyself against a fir tree Or to fall upon a birch tree Tis my flesh that thou hast wounded And my veins thou hast divided Then his magic spells he uttered And himself began to speak them Spells of origin for healing And to close the wound completely one hundred eighty But he could not think of any Words of origin of iron Which might serve to bind the evil And to close the gaping edges Of the great wound from the iron By the blue edge deeply bitten But the blood gushed forth in torrents Rushing like a foaming river O er the berry bearing bushes And the heath the ground that covered one hundred ninety There remained no single hillock Which was not completely flooded By the overflowing bloodstream Which came rushing forth in torrents From the knee of one most worthy From the toes of Vainamoinen Vainamoinen old and steadfast Gathered from the rocks the lichen From the swamps the moss collected Earth he gathered from the hillocks two hundred Hoping thus to stop the outlet Of the wound that bled so freely But he could not check the bleeding Nor restrain it in the slightest And the pain he felt oppressed him And the greatest trouble seized him Vainamoinen old and steadfast Then began to weep full sorely Thereupon his horse he harnessed In the sledge he yoked the chestnut two hundred ten On the sledge himself he mounted And upon the seat he sat him O er the horse his whip he brandished With the bead decked whip he lashed him And the horse sped quickly onward Rocked the sledge the way grew shorter And they quickly reached a village Where the path in three divided Vainamoinen old and steadfast Drove along the lowest pathway two hundred twenty To the lowest of the homesteads And he asked upon the threshold Is there no one in this household Who can cure the wounds of iron Who can soothe the hero s anguish And can heal the wound that pains him On the floor a child was playing By the stove a boy was sitting And he answered him in this wise There is no one in this household two hundred thirty Who can heal the wounds of iron Who can soothe the hero s anguish To the rock can fix it firmly And can heal the wound that pains him Such may dwell in other houses Drive away to other houses Vainamoinen old and steadfast O er the horse his whip then brandished And the sledge went rattling onward Thus a little way he travelled two hundred forty On the midmost of the pathways To the midmost of the houses And he asked upon the threshold And beseeching at the window Is there no one in this household Who can heal the wounds of iron Who can stanch the blood when flowing And can check the rushing bloodstream Neath the quilt a crone was resting By the stove there sat a gossip two hundred fifty And she spoke and answered plainly As her three teeth gnashed together There is no one in this household Who can heal the wounds of iron None who knows efficient blood spells And can close the wound that pains you Such may dwell in other houses Drive away to other houses Vainamoinen old and steadfast O er the horse his whip then brandished two hundred sixty And the sledge went rattling onward Thus a little way he travelled On the highest of the pathways To the highest of the houses And he asked upon the threshold Calling from beside the doorpost Is there any in this household Who can heal the wounds of iron Who can check this rushing bloodstream And can stay the dark red torrent two hundred seventy By the stove an old man rested On the stove bed lay a greybeard From the stove the old man mumbled And the greybeard cried in answer Stemmed before were greater torrents Greater floods than this were hindered By three words of the Creator By the mighty words primeval Brooks and streams were checked from flowing Mighty streams in cataracts falling two hundred eighty Bays were formed in rocky headlands Tongues of land were linked together RUNO IX THE ORIGIN OF IRON Argument Vainamoinen repeats to the old man the legend of the origin of iron one two hundred sixty six The old man reviles the iron and repeats spells for the stopping of blood and the flow of blood is stayed two hundred sixty seven four hundred sixteen The old man directs his son to prepare a salve and dresses and binds up the wound Vainamoinen is cured and thanks Jumala for his merciful assistance four hundred seventeen five hundred eighty six Then the aged Vainamoinen In the sledge at once stood upright From the sledge he sprang unaided And courageously stood upright To the room he hastened quickly And beneath the roof he hurried There they brought a silver beaker And a golden goblet likewise But they proved by far too little Holding but the smallest measure ten Of the blood of aged Vaino From the hero s foot that spouted From the stove the old man mumbled Cried the greybeard when he saw him Who among mankind may saint thou be Who among the roll of heroes Seven large boats with blood are brimming Eight large tubs are overflowing From your knee O most unhappy On the floor in torrents gushing twenty Other words I well remember But the oldest I recall not How the iron was first created And the unworked ore was fashioned Then the aged Vainamoinen Answered in the words that follow Well I know the birth of Iron And how steel was first created Air is the primeval mother Water is the eldest brother thirty Iron is the youngest brother And the Fire in midst between them Ukko mightiest of Creators He the God above in heaven From the Air the Water parted And the continents from water When unborn was evil Iron Uncreated undeveloped Ukko God of realms supernal Rubbed his mighty hands together forty Both his hands he rubbed together On his left knee then he pressed them And three maidens were created Three fair Daughters of Creation Mothers of the rust of Iron And of blue mouthed steel the fosterers Strolled the maids with faltering footsteps On the borders of the cloudlets And their full breasts were o erflowing And their nipples pained them sorely fifty Down on earth their milk ran over From their breasts overflowing fulness Milk on land and milk on marshes Milk upon the peaceful waters Black milk from the first was flowing From the eldest of the maidens White milk issued from another From the second of the maidens Red milk by the third was yielded By the youngest of the maidens sixty Where the black milk had been dropping There was found the softest Iron Where the white milk had been flowing There the hardest steel was fashioned Where the red milk had been trickling There was undeveloped Iron But a short time had passed over When the Iron desired to visit Him its dearest elder brother And to make the Fire s acquaintance seventy But the Fire arose in fury Blazing up in greatest anger Seeking to consume its victim E en the wretched Iron its brother Then the Iron sought out a refuge Sought for refuge and protection From the hands of furious Fire From his mouth all bright with anger Then the Iron took refuge from him Sought both refuge and protection eighty Down amid the quaking marshes Where the springs have many sources On the level mighty marshes On the void and barren mountains Where the swans their eggs deposit And the goose her brood is rearing In the swamps lay hid the Iron Stretched beneath the marshy surface Hid for one year and a second For a third year likewise hidden ninety Hidden there between two tree stumps Neath three roots of birch trees hidden But it had not yet found safety From the fierce hands of the Fire And a second time it wandered To the dwelling of the Fire That it should be forged to weapons And to sword blades should be fashioned On the marshes wolves were running On the heath the bears came trooping one hundred Neath the wolves feet quaked the marshes Neath the bears the heath was shaken Thus was ore of iron uncovered And the bars of steel were noticed Where the claws of wolves had trodden And the paws of bears had trampled Then was born smith Ilmarinen Thus was born and thus was nurtured Born upon a hill of charcoal Reared upon a plain of charcoal one hundred ten In his hands a copper hammer And his little pincers likewise Ilmari was born at night time And at day he built his smithy Sought a place to build his smithy Where he could construct his bellows In the swamp he found a land ridge And a small place in the marshes So he went to gaze upon it And examined the surroundings one hundred twenty And erected there his bellows And his anvil there constructed Then he hastened to the wolf tracks And the bear tracks also followed And the ore of iron he saw there And the lumps of steel he found there In the wolves enormous footprints Where the bears paws left their imprints Then he spoke the words which follow O thou most unlucky Iron one hundred thirty In an ill abode thou dwellest In a very lowly station Neath the wolf prints in the marshes And the imprints of the bear paws Then he pondered and reflected What would be the upshot of it If I cast it in the fire And I laid it on the anvil Sore alarmed was hapless Iron Sore alarmed and greatly startled one hundred forty When of Fire it heard him speaking Speaking of the furious Fire Said the smith said Ilmarinen But indeed it cannot happen Fire his friends will never injure Nor will harm his dear relations If you seek the Fire s red chamber All illumined with its brightness You will greatly gain in beauty And your splendour greatly increase one hundred fifty Fitted thus for men s keen sword blades Or as clasps for women s girdles Therefore when the day was ended Was the Iron from out the marshes Delved from all the swampy places Carried homeward to the smithy Then he cast it in the furnace And he laid it on the anvil Blew a blast and then a second And he blew again a third time one hundred sixty Till the Iron was fully softened And the ore completely melted Like to wheaten dough in softness Soft as dough for ryebread kneaded In the furnace of the smithy By the bright flame s softening power Then exclaimed the Iron unhappy O thou smith O Ilmarinen Take me quickly from this furnace From the red flames that torment me one hundred seventy Said the smith said Ilmarinen If I take you from the furnace Perhaps you might become outrageous And commit some furious action Perhaps you might attack your brother And your mother s child might injure Therefore swore the Iron unhappy By the oaths of all most solemn By the forge and by the anvil By the hammer and the mallet one hundred eighty And it said the words which follow And expressed itself in this wise Give me trees that I can bite them Give me stones that I may break them I will not assault my brother Nor my mother s child will injure Better will be my existence And my life will be more happy If I dwell among companions As the tools of handicraftsmen one hundred ninety Than to wound my own relations And disgrace my own connections Then the smith e en Ilmarinen He the great primeval craftsman From the fire removed the Iron Laid it down upon the anvil Welded it till it was wearied Shaped it into pointed weapons Into spears and into axes Into tools of all descriptions two hundred Still there was a trifle wanting And the soft Iron still defective For the tongue of Iron had hissed not And its mouth of steel was formed not For the Iron was not yet hardened Nor with water had been tempered Then the smith e en Ilmarinen Pondered over what was needed Mixed a small supply of ashes And some lye he added to it two hundred ten To the blue steel s smelting mixture For the tempering of the Iron With his tongue he tried the liquid Tasted it if it would please him And he spoke the words which follow Even yet it does not please me For the blue steel s smelting mixture And perfecting of the Iron From without a bee came flying Blue winged from the grassy hillocks two hundred twenty Hovering forwards hovering backwards Hovering all around the smithy Then the smith spoke up as follows O thou bee my nimble comrade Honey on thy wings convey me On thy tongue from out the forest From the summits of six flowerets And from seven tall grass stems bring it For the blue steel s smelting mixture And the tempering of the Iron two hundred thirty But the hornet Bird of Hiisi Looked around him and he listened Gazing from beside the roof tree Looking from below the birchbark At the tempering of the Iron And the blue steel s smelting mixture Thence he flew on whirring pinions Scattering all of Hiisi s terrors Brought the hissing of the serpents And of snakes the dusky venom two hundred forty And of ants he brought the acid And of toads the hidden poison That the steel might thus be poisoned In the tempering of the Iron Then the smith e en Ilmarinen He the greatest of the craftsmen Was deluded and imagined That the bee returned already And had brought the honey needed Brought the honey that he wanted two hundred fifty And he spoke the words which follow Here at last is what will please me For the blue steel s smelting mixture And the tempering of the Iron Thereupon the steel he lifted In he plunged the luckless Iron As from out the fire he took it And he took it from the anvil Then indeed the steel was angry And the Iron was seized with fury two hundred sixty And its oath the wretch has broken Like a dog has soiled its honour Brutally its brother bitten Striking at its own relations Let the blood rush forth in torrents From the wound in torrents gushing From the stove the old man mumbled Shook his beard his head he nodded Now I know whence comes the Iron And of steel the evil customs two hundred seventy O thou most unhappy Iron Wretched Iron slag most worthless Steel thou art of evil witchcraft Thou hast been for nought developed But to turn to evil courses In the greatness of thy power Once thou wast devoid of greatness Neither wast thou great nor little Neither noted for thy beauty Nor remarkable for evil two hundred eighty When as milk thou wast created When the sweet milk trickled over From the breasts of youthful maidens From the maidens swelling bosoms On the borders of the cloudland Neath the broad expanse of heaven Thou wast then devoid of greatness Thou wast neither great nor little When thou in the mud wast resting Sunk below the sparkling water two hundred ninety Overspreading all the marshland At the base of rocky mountains And in loose earth thou wast altered And to iron ore converted Thou wast still devoid of greatness Thou wast neither great nor little When the elks were trampling o er thee And the reindeer in the marshes When the wolves claws trod upon thee And the bears paws passed above thee three hundred Thou wast still devoid of greatness Thou wast neither great nor little When thou from the marsh wast gathered From the ground with care uplifted Carried thence into the smithy To the forge of Ilmarinen Thou wast still devoid of greatness Thou wast neither great nor little When as ore thou there wast hissing Plunged amid the boiling water three hundred ten Or amid the fiery furnace When the mighty oath thou sworest By the forge and by the anvil By the hammer and the mallet Where the smith himself was standing On the flooring of the smithy Now that thou hast grown to greatness Thou hast wrought thyself to frenzy And thy mighty oath hast broken Like a dog hast soiled thy honour three hundred twenty For thy kinsman thou hast wounded Raised thy mouth against thy kinsman Who hast led thee to this outrage To this wickedness incited Perhaps thy father or thy mother Or the eldest of thy brothers Or the youngest of thy sisters Or some other near relation Not thy father not thy mother Nor the eldest of thy brothers three hundred thirty Nor the youngest of thy sisters Nor some other near relation Thou thyself hast wrought the evil And hast done a deadly outrage Come thyself to see the mischief And to remedy the evil Come before I tell thy mother And complain unto thy parents More will be thy mother s trouble Great the anguish of thy parents three hundred forty That their son had wrought this evil And their son had wrought this folly Hear me Blood and cease thy flowing O thou Bloodstream rush no longer Nor upon my head spirt further Nor upon my breast down trickle Like a wall O Blood arrest thee Like a fence O Bloodstream stand thou As a flag in lakelet standing Like a reed in moss grown country three hundred fifty Like the bank that bounds the cornfield Like a rock in raging torrent But thy own sense ought to teach thee How that thou should saint run more smoothly In the flesh should saint thou be moving With thy current smoothly flowing In the body is it better Underneath the skin more lovely Through the veins to trace thy pathway With thy current smoothly flowing three hundred sixty Than upon the earth rash downward And among the dust to trickle Flow not milk upon the flooring Soil thou not O Blood the meadows Nor the grass O crown of manhood Nor the hillocks gold of heroes In the heart should be thy dwelling And among the lungs dark cellars Thither then withdraw thou quickly There withdraw upon the instant three hundred seventy Do not issue like a river Nor as pond extend thy billows Trickling forth from out the marshes Nor to leak like boats when damaged Therefore dear one cease thy flowing Crimson Blood drip down no longer Not impeded but contented Dry were once the Falls of Tyrja Likewise Tuonela s dread river Dry the lake and dry the heaven three hundred eighty In the mighty droughts of summer In the evil times of bush fires If thou wilt not yet obey me Still I know another method And resort to fresh enchantments And I call for Hiisi s caldron And will boil the blood within it All the blood that forth has issued So that not a drop escapes me That the red blood flows no longer three hundred ninety Nor the blood to earth drops downward And the blood no more may issue But if manly strength has failed me Nor is Ukko s son a hero Who can stop this inundation Stem the swift arterial torrent Thou our Father in the heavens Jumala the clouds who rulest Thou hast manly strength sufficient Thou thyself the mighty hero four hundred Who shall close the blood s wide gateway And shall stem the blood escaping Ukko O thou great Creator Jumala aloft in heaven Hither come where thou art needed Hither come where we implore thee Press thy mighty hands upon it Press thy mighty thumbs upon it And the painful wound close firmly And the door whence comes the evil four hundred ten Spread the tender leaves upon it Leaves of golden water lily Thus to close the path of bleeding And to stem the rushing torrent That upon my beard it spirts not Nor upon my rags may trickle Thus he closed the bleeding opening Stemming thus the bloody torrent Sent his son into the smithy To prepare a healing ointment four hundred twenty From the blades of magic grasses From the thousand headed yarrow And from dripping mountain honey Falling down in drops of sweetness Then the boy went to the smithy To prepare the healing ointment On the way he passed an oak tree And he stopped and asked the oak tree Have you honey on your branches And beneath your bark sweet honey four hundred thirty And the oak tree gave him answer Yesterday throughout the evening Dripped the honey on my branches On my summit splashed the honey From the clouds dropped down the honey From the scattered clouds distilling Then he took the slender oak twigs From the tree the broken fragments Took the best among the grasses Gathered many kinds of herbage four hundred forty Herbs one sees not in this country Such were mostly what he gathered Then he placed them o er the furnace And the mixture brought to boiling Both the bark from off the oak tree And the finest of the grasses Thus the pot was boiling fiercely Three long nights he kept it boiling And for three days of the springtime While he watched the ointment closely four hundred fifty If the salve was fit for using And the magic ointment ready But the salve was still unfinished Nor the magic ointment ready Grasses to the mass he added Added herbs of many species Which were brought from other places Gathered on a hundred pathways These were culled by nine magicians And by eight wise seers discovered four hundred sixty Then for three nights more he boiled it And for nine nights in succession Took the pot from off the furnace And the salve with care examined If the salve was fit for using And the magic ointment ready Here there grew a branching aspen On the borders of the cornfield And in twain he broke the aspen And the tree completely severed four hundred seventy With the magic salve he smeared it Carefully the ointment tested And he spoke the words which follow As I with this magic ointment Smear the injured crown all over Let no harm be left upon it Let the aspen stand uninjured Even as it stood aforetime Then at once was healed the aspen Even as it stood aforetime four hundred eighty And its crown was far more lovely And the trunk below was healthy Then again he took the ointment And the salve again he tested And on broken stones he tried it And on shattered rocks he rubbed it And the stone with stone knit firmly And the cracks were fixed together From the forge the boy came homeward When the salve was fit for using four hundred ninety With the ointment quite perfected In the old man s hands he placed it Here I bring a perfect ointment And the magic salve is ready It could fuse the hills together In a single rock unite them With his tongue the old man tried it With his mouth the liquid tasted And the ointment tasted perfect And the salve was most efficient five hundred This he smeared on Vainamoinen And with this he healed the sufferer Stroked him downward stroked him upward Rubbed him also on the middle And he spoke the words which follow And expressed himself in this wise Tis not I who use my muscles But tis the Creator moves them With my own strength do not labour But with strength from the Almighty five hundred ten With my mouth I speak not to you Jumala s own mouth speaks with you If my speech is sweet unto you Jumala s own speech is sweeter Even if my hands are lovely The Creator s hands are fairer When the salve was rubbed upon him And the healing ointment touched him Almost fainting with the anguish Vainamoinen writhed and struggled five hundred twenty Turning this way turning that way Seeking ease but never finding Then the old man banned the suffering Far away he drove the anguish To the central Hill of Tortures To the topmost Mount of Suffering There to fill the stones with anguish And the slabs of rock to torture Then he took a silken fabric And in strips he quickly cut it five hundred thirty From the edge he tore the fragments And at once he formed a bandage Then he took the silken bandage And with utmost care he wound it Round the knees he wound it deftly Round the toes of Vainamoinen Then he spoke the words which follow And expressed himself in this wise Thus I use God s silken bandage The Creator s mantle wind I five hundred forty Round the great knees of the patient Round the toes of one most noble Watch thou Jumala most gracious Give thy aid O great Creator That we fall not in misfortune That no evil may o ertake us Then the aged Vainamoinen Felt he had regained his vigour And that he was healed completely And his flesh again was solid five hundred fifty And beneath it all was healthy In his body he was painless And his sides were quite uninjured From above the wounds had vanished Stronger felt he than aforetime Better than in former seasons On his feet he now was walking And could bend his knees in stamping Not the least of pain he suffered Not a trace remained of aching five hundred sixty Then the aged Vainamoinen Lifted up his eyes to heaven Gazing up to God most gracious Lifting up his head to heaven And he spoke the words which follow And expressed himself in this wise Thence all mercy flows for ever Thence comes aid the most effective From the heaven that arches o er us From the omnipotent Creator five hundred seventy Praise to Jumala most gracious Praise to thee O great Creator That thy aid thou hast vouchsafed me Granted me thy strong protection When my suffering was the greatest From the edge of sharpest Iron Then the aged Vainamoinen Further spoke these words of warning People henceforth in the future On your present welfare build not five hundred eighty Make no boat in mood of boasting Nor confide too much in boat ribs God foresees the course of by ways The Creator orders all things Not the foresight of the heroes Nor the might of all the great ones RUNO X THE FORGING OF THE SAMPO Argument Vainamoinen reaches home and urges Ilmarinen to depart to woo the Maiden of Pohja because he would be able to forge a Sampo one one hundred Ilmarinen refuses to go to Pohjola but Vainamoinen conveys him thither without his consent by a stratagem one hundred one two hundred Ilmarinen arrives in Pohjola where he is very well received and promises to forge a Sampo two hundred one two hundred eighty He forges the Sampo and the Mistress of Pohjola conceals it in the Rocky Mountain of Pohjola two hundred eighty one four hundred thirty two Ilmarinen asks for the maiden as his reward but she makes excuses saying that she is not yet ready to leave home four hundred thirty three four hundred sixty two Ilmarinen receives a boat returns home and informs Vainamoinen that he has forged the Sampo in Pohjola four hundred sixty three five hundred ten Vainamoinen old and steadfast Took his horse of chestnut colour And between the shafts he yoked him Yoked before the sledge the chestnut On the sledge himself he mounted And upon the seat he sat him Quickly then his whip he flourished Cracked his whip all bead embroidered Quick he sped upon his journey Lurched the sledge the way was shortened ten Loudly rang the birchwood runners And the rowan cumber rattled On he rushed with speed tremendous Through the swamps and open country O er the heaths so wide extending Thus he drove a day a second And at length upon the third day Reached the long bridge end before him Kalevala s extended heathlands Bordering on the field of Osmo twenty Then he spoke the words which follow And expressed himself in this wise Wolf do thou devour the dreamer Seize the Laplander O sickness He who said that I should never In my lifetime reach my homestead Nor again throughout my lifetime Nor as long as shines the moonlight Neither tread Vainola s meadows Kalevala s extended heathlands thirty Then the aged Vainamoinen Spoke aloud his songs of magic And a flower crowned birch grew upward Crowned with flowers and leaves all golden And its summit reached to heaven To the very clouds uprising In the air the boughs extended And they spread themselves to heaven Then he sang his songs of magic And he sang a moon all shining forty On the pine tree s golden summit And the Great Bear in the branches On he drove with speed tremendous Straight to his beloved homestead Head bowed down and thoughts all gloomy And his cap was tilted sideways For the great smith Ilmarinen He the great primeval craftsman He had promised as his surety That his own head he might rescue fifty Out of Pohjola s dark regions Sariola for ever misty Presently his horse he halted At the new cleared field of Osmo And the aged Vainamoinen In the sledge his head uplifted Heard the noise within the smithy And the clatter in the coal shed Vainamoinen old and steadfast Then himself the smithy entered sixty And he found smith Ilmarinen Wielding mightily his hammer Said the smith said Ilmarinen O thou aged Vainamoinen Where have you so long been staying Where have you so long been living Vainamoinen old and steadfast Answered in the words which follow There have I so long been staying There have I so long been living seventy In the gloomy land of Pohja Sariola for ever misty Long I coursed on Lapland snowshoes With the world renowned magicians Then the smith e en Ilmarinen Answered in the words which follow O thou aged Vainamoinen Thou the great primeval sorcerer Tell me of your journey thither Tell me of your homeward journey eighty Said the aged Vainamoinen Much indeed have I to tell you Lives in Pohjola a maiden In that village cold a virgin Who will not accept a suitor Mocks the very best among them Half of all the land of Pohja Praises her surpassing beauty From her temples shines the moonlight From her breasts the sun is shining ninety And the Great Bear from her shoulders From her back the starry Seven Thou thyself smith Ilmarinen Thou the great primeval craftsman Go thyself to woo the maiden And behold her shining tresses If you can but forge a Sampo With its many coloured cover You will then receive the maiden And the fair maid be your guerdon one hundred Said the smith e en Ilmarinen O thou aged Vainamoinen You have perhaps already pledged me To the gloomy land of Pohja That your own head you might rescue And might thus secure your freedom Not in course of all my lifetime While the golden moon is shining Hence to Pohjola I ll journey Huts of Sariola so dreary one hundred ten Where the people eat each other And they even drown the heroes Then the aged Vainamoinen Answered in the words which follow There is wonder after wonder There s a pine with flowery summit Flowery summit leaves all golden Near where Osmo s field is bordered On the crown the moon is shining In the boughs the Bear is resting one hundred twenty Said the smith e en Ilmarinen This I never can believe in If I do not go to see it And my own eyes have not seen it Said the aged Vainamoinen If you cannot then believe it We will go ourselves and witness Whether true or false the story Then they both went forth to see it View the pine with flowery summit one hundred thirty First walked aged Vainamoinen And smith Ilmarinen second When they reached the spot they sought for On the edge of Osmo s cornfield Then the smith his steps arrested In amazement at the pine tree With the Great Bear in the branches And the moon upon its summit Then the aged Vainamoinen Spoke the very words which follow one hundred forty Now thou smith my dearest brother Climb and fetch the moon above us Bring thou too the Great Bear shining On the pine tree s golden summit Then the smith e en Ilmarinen Climbed aloft into the pine tree Up he climbed into the daylight Climbed to fetch the moon above him And the Great Bear shining brightly On the pine tree s golden summit one hundred fifty Said the pine tree s golden summit Said the widely branching pine tree Mighty man of all most foolish O most thoughtless of the heroes In my branches fool thou climbest To my summit as a boy might And would saint grasp the moon s reflection And the false stars thou beholdest Then the aged Vainamoinen Lifted up his voice in singing one hundred sixty As he sang uprose a tempest And the wind rose wildly furious And he spoke the words which follow And expressed himself in thiswise In thy boat O wind convey him In thy skiff O breeze convey him Bear him to the distant regions Of the gloomy land of Pohja Then there rose a mighty tempest And the wind so wildly furious one hundred seventy Carried off smith Ilmarinen Hurried him to distant regions To the gloomy land of Pohja Sariola for ever misty Then the smith e en Ilmarinen Journeyed forth and hurried onwards On the tempest forth he floated On the pathway of the breezes Over moon and under sunray On the shoulders of the Great

in empty houses Otherwise indeed they threatened Otherwise events had happened For they wanted to o erthrow me Threatened they would sink me deeply one hundred sixty In the swamp when I was walking That in mire I might be sunken In the mud my chin pushed downward And my beard in filthy places But indeed a man they found me And they did not greatly fright me I myself put forth my magic And began my spells to mutter Sang the wizards with their arrows And the archers with their weapons one hundred seventy Sorcerers with their knives of iron Soothsayers with their pointed weapons Under Tuoni s mighty Cataract Where the surge is most terrific Underneath the highest cataract Neath the worst of all the whirlpools There the sorcerers now may slumber There repose beneath their blankets Till the grass may spring above them Through their heads and caps sprout upward one hundred eighty Through the arm pits of the sorcerers Piercing through their shoulder muscles While the wizards sleep in

went lively Lemminkainen To the gloomy land of Pohja Spite the warnings of his mother Gainst the aged woman s counsel First he armed him and he girt him In his coat of mail he clad him With a belt of steel encompassed And he spoke the words which follow two hundred twenty Stronger feels a man in armour In the best of iron mail coats And of steel a magic girdle As a wizard gainst magicians Then no trouble need alarm him Nor the greatest evil fright him Then he grasped his sword so trusty Took his blade like flame that glittered Which by Hiisi s self was whetted And by Jumala was polished two hundred thirty By his side the hero girt it Thrust in sheath with leather lining How shall now the man conceal him And the mighty hero hide him There a little time he hid him And the mighty one concealed him Neath the beam above the doorway By the doorpost of the chamber In the courtyard by the hayloft By the gate of all the furthest two hundred forty Thus it was the hero hid him From the

who stand behind me two hundred ninety And above me and beside me May be forced to own my power Crush the sorcerers with their arrows The magicians with their knife blades And the wizards with their sword blades All the scoundrels with their weapons Then the lively Lemminkainen He the handsome Kaukomieli From the bush his courser whistled From the grass the gold maned courser three hundred Thereupon the horse he harnessed In the shafts the fiery courser In the sledge himself he seated And the sledge began to rattle O er the horse his whip he flourished Cracked the whip and urged him

Who would raise their sticks against you Give you too a beast of burden And would drive you homeward rascal To your country wretched creature To the household of your father To the dwelling of your mother To the gateway of your brother To the threshold of your sister Ere this very day is ended Ere the sun has reached its setting three hundred sixty Little heeded Lemminkainen And he spoke the words which follow May they shoot the crone and club her On her pointed chin and kill her Then again he hurried onward Thundering on upon his journey On the highest of the pathways To the highest of the houses Then the lively Lemminkainen Reached the house to which he journeyed three hundred seventy And he spoke the words which follow And expressed himself in thiswise Stop the barker s mouth O Hiisi And the dog s jaws close O Lempo And his mouth securely muzzle That his gagged teeth may be harmless That he may not bark a warning When a man is passing by him As he came into the courtyard On the ground he slashed his whiplash three hundred eighty From the spot a cloud rose upward In the cloud a dwarf was standing And he quickly loosed the chest bands And the shafts he then let downward Then the lively Lemminkainen Listened with his ears attentive But no person there observed him So that no one present knew it Out of doors he heard a singing Through the moss he heard them speaking three hundred ninety Through the walls heard music playing Through the shutters heard a singing In the house he cast his glances Gazed into the room in secret And the house was full of wizards And the benches full of singers By the walls there sat musicians Seers were sitting in the doorway On the upper benches sorcerers By the hearth were soothsayers seated four hundred There a Lapland bard was singing Hoarsely singing songs of Hiisi Then the lively Lemminkainen Thought it wise to change his figure To another shape transformed him Left his hiding place and entered Thrust himself into the chamber And he spoke the words which follow Fine a song may be when ended Grandest are the shortest verses four hundred ten Wisdom better when unspoken Than in midmost interrupted Then came Pohjola s old Mistress On the floor advancing swiftly Till she reached the chamber s middle And she spoke these words in answer Once there was a dog among us And a shaggy iron haired puppy Eating flesh of bones a biter One who licked the blood when freshest four hundred twenty Who among mankind may you be Who among the list of heroes Boldly thus the house to enter Pushing right into the chamber Yet the dogs have never heard you Nor have warned us with their barking Said the lively Lemminkainen Surely I have not come hither Void of art and void of knowledge Void of strength and void of cunning four hundred thirty Taught not magic by my father And without my parents counsel That the dogs should now devour me And the barkers should attack me But it was my mother washed me When a boy both small and slender Three times in the nights of summer Nine times in the nights of autumn And she taught me all the pathways And the knowledge of all countries four hundred forty And at home sang songs of magic Likewise too in foreign countries Then the lively Lemminkainen He the handsome Kaukomieli Soon began his songs of magics All at once began his singing Fire flashed from his fur cloak s borders And his eyes with flame were shining With the songs of Lemminkainen As he sang his spells of magic four hundred fifty Sang the very best of singers To the worst of all the singers And he fed their mouths with pebbles And he piled up rocks above them On the best of all the singers And most skilful of magicians Then he sang the men thereafter Both to one side and the other To the plains all bare and treeless To the lands unploughed for ever four hundred sixty To the ponds devoid of fishes Where no perch has ever wandered To the dreadful falls of Rutja And amid the roaring whirlpools Underneath the foaming river To the rocks beneath the cataract There to burn as if mid fire And to scatter sparks around them Then the lively Lemminkainen Sang his songs against the swordsmen four hundred seventy Sang the heroes with their weapons Sang the young men sang the old men And the men of age between them And his songs spared one man only And he was a wicked cowherd Old with eyes both closed and sightless Markahattu then the cowherd Spoke the very words which follow O thou lively son of Lempi Thou hast banned the young and old men four hundred eighty Banned the men of age between them Wherefore hast not banned me likewise Said the lively Lemminkainen Therefore tis that I have spared thee That thou dost appear so wretched Pitiful without my magic In the days when thou wast younger Thou wast worst of all the cowherds Hast destroyed thy mother s children And disgraced thy very sister four hundred ninety All the horses hast thou crippled All the foals hast thou outwearied In the swamps or stony places Plashing through the muddy waters Markahattu then the cowherd Greatly vexed and greatly angry Through the open door went quickly Through the yard to open country Ran to Tuonela s deep river To the dreadful river s whirlpool five hundred Waited there for Kaukomieli Waited there for Lemminkainen Till on his return from Pohja He should make his journey homeward RUNO XIII HIISI S ELK Argument Lemminkainen asks the old woman of Pohja for her daughter but she demands that he should first capture the Elk of Hiisi on snowshoes one thirty Lemminkainen starts off in high spirits to hunt the elk but it escapes and he breaks his snowshoes and spear thirty one two hundred seventy Then the lively Lemminkainen Said to Pohjola s old Mistress Give me old one now your maiden Bring me here your lovely daughter She the best of all among them She the tallest of the maidens Then did Pohjola s old Mistress Answer in the words which follow Nay I will not give my maiden And you shall not have my daughter ten Not the best or worst among them Not the tallest not the shortest For you have a wife already Long the mistress of your household Said the lively Lemminkainen Kylli in the town lies fettered At the steps before the village By the gate where strangers enter So a better wife I wish for Therefore give me now your daughter twenty She the fairest of your daughters Lovely with unbraided tresses Then said Pohjola s old Mistress Never will I give my daughter To a vain and worthless fellow To a hero good for nothing Therefore you may woo my daughter Win the far famed flower crowned maiden If you hunt the elk on snowshoes In the distant field of Hiisi thirty Then the lively Lemminkainen Fixed the point upon his javelin And his bowstring made of sinew And with bone he tipped his arrows And he said the words which follow Now my javelin I have pointed All my shafts with bone have pointed And have strung my bow with sinew Not the snowshoe left put forward Nor the right one stamped behind it forty Then the lively Lemminkainen Pondered deeply and reflected How he should procure his snowshoes How they best should be constructed Then to Kauppi s house he hastened And to Lyylikki s forge hurried O thou wisest Vuojalainen Thou the handsome Lapland Kauppi Make me snowshoes that will suit me Fitted with the finest leather fifty I must chase the elk of Hiisi In the distant field of Hiisi Lyylikki then spoke as follows Kauppi gave him ready answer Vainly goest thou Lemminkainen Forth to hunt the elk of Hiisi For a piece of rotten timber Only will reward your labour Little troubled Lemminkainen And he spoke the words which follow sixty Make a snowshoe left to run with And a right one to put forward I must chase the elk on snowshoes In the distant field of Hiisi Lyylikki the smith of snowshoes Kauppi maker of the snowshoes In the autumn shaped the left one In the winter carved the right one And he fixed the frames on one day Fixed the rings upon another seventy Now the left was fit to run with And the right for wearing ready And the frames were now completed And the rings were also fitted Frames he lined with skins of otter And the rings with ruddy foxskin Then he smeared with grease the snowshoes Smeared them with the fat of reindeer And himself reflected deeply And he spoke the words which follow eighty Can you in this youthful frolic You a young and untried hero Forward glide upon the left shoe And push forward with the right one Said the lively Lemminkainen Answered him the ruddy rascal Yes upon this youthful frolic Of a young and untried hero I can glide upon the left shoe And push forward with the right one ninety On his back he bound his quiver And his new bow on his shoulder In his hands his pole grasped firmly On the left shoe glided forward And pushed onward with the right one And he spoke the words which follow In God s world may there be nothing Underneath the arch of heaven In the forest to be hunted Not a single four foot runner one hundred Which may not be overtaken And can easily be captured Thus by Kaleva s son with snowshoes And with Lemminkainen s snowshoes But the boast was heard by Hiisi And by Juutas comprehended And an elk was formed by Hiisi And a reindeer formed by Juutas With a head of rotten timber Horns composed of willow branches one hundred ten Feet of ropes the swamps which border Shins of sticks from out the marshes And his back was formed of fence stakes Sinews formed of dryest grass stalks Eyes of water lily flowers Ears of leaves of water lily And his hide was formed of pine bark And his flesh of rotten timber Hiisi now the elk instructed Thus he spoke unto the reindeer one hundred twenty Now rush forth thou elk of Hiisi On thy legs O noble creature To the breeding place of reindeer Grassy plains of Lapland s children Till the snowshoe men are sweating Most of all this Lemminkainen Then rushed forth the elk of Hiisi Sped away the fleeing reindeer Rushing past the barns of Pohja To the plains of Lapland s children one hundred thirty In the house the tubs kicked over On the fire upset the kettles Threw the meat among the ashes Spilt the soup among the cinders Then arose a great commotion On the plains of Lapland s children For the Lapland dogs were barking And the Lapland children crying And the Lapland women laughing And the other people grumbling one hundred forty He the lively Lemminkainen Chased the elk upon his snowshoes Glided o er the land and marshes O er the open wastes he glided Fire was crackling from his snowshoes From his staff s end smoke ascending But as yet the elk he saw not Could not see it could not hear it O er the hills and dales he glided Through the lands beyond the ocean one hundred fifty Over all the wastes of Hiisi Over all the heaths of Kalma And before the mouth of Surma And behind the house of Kalma Surma s mouth was quickly opened Down was bowed the head of Kalma That he thus might seize the hero And might swallow Lemminkainen But he tried and failed to reach him Failed completely in his effort one hundred sixty O er all lands he had not skated Nor had reached the desert s borders In the furthest bounds of Pohja In the distant realms of Lapland So he skated further onward Till he reached the desert s borders When he reached this distant region Then he heard a great commotion In the furthest bounds of Pohja On the plains of Lapland s children one hundred seventy And he heard the dogs were barking And the Lapland children crying And the Lapland women laughing And the other Lapps were grumbling Then the lively Lemminkainen Skated on in that direction Where he heard the dogs were barking On the plains of Lapland s children And he said on his arrival And he asked them on his coming one hundred eighty Wherefore are the women laughing Women laughing children crying And the older folks lamenting And the grey dogs all are barking Therefore are the women laughing Women laughing children crying And the older folks lamenting And the grey dogs all are barking Here has charged the elk of Hiisi With its hoofs all cleft and polished one hundred ninety In the house the tubs kicked over On the fire upset the kettles Shaken out the soup within them Spilt it all among the ashes Thereupon the ruddy rascal He the lively Lemminkainen Struck his left shoe in the snowdrift Like an adder in the meadow Pushed his staff of pinewood forward As it were a living serpent two hundred And he said as he was gliding Grasping firm the pole he carried Let the men who live in Lapland Help me all to bring the elk home And let all the Lapland women Set to work to wash the kettles And let all the Lapland children Hasten forth to gather splinters And let all the Lapland kettles Help to cook the elk when captured two hundred ten Then he poised himself and balanced Forward pushed his strength exerting And the first time he shot forward From before their eyes he vanished Once again he speeded onward And they could no longer hear him But the third time he rushed onward Then he reached the elk of Hiisi Then he took a pole of maple And he made a birchen collar two hundred twenty Hiisi s elk he tethered with it In a pen of oak he placed it Stand thou there O elk of Hiisi Here remain O nimble reindeer Then upon the back he stroked it Patted it upon the belly Would that I awhile might tarry And might sleep awhile and rest me Here beside a youthful maiden With a dove of blooming beauty two hundred thirty Then did Hiisi s elk grow furious And the reindeer kicked out wildly And it spoke the words which follow Lempo s self shall reckon with you If you sleep beside a maiden And beside a girl should tarry Then it gave a mighty struggle And it snapped the birchen collar And it broke the pole of maple And the pen of oak burst open two hundred forty And began to hurry forwards And the elk rushed wildly onwards Over land and over marshes Over slopes o ergrown with bushes Till the eyes no more could see it And the ears no longer hear it Thereupon the ruddy rascal Grew both sorrowful and angry Very vexed and very angry And would chase the elk of Hiisi two hundred fifty But as he was rushing forward In a hole he broke his left shoe And his snowshoe fell to pieces On the ground he broke the right one Broke the tips from off his snowshoes And the frames across the joinings While rushed on the elk of Hiisi Till its head he saw no longer Then the lively Lemminkainen Bowed his head in deep depression two hundred sixty Gazed upon the broken snowshoes And he spoke the words which follow Nevermore in all his lifetime May another hunter venture Confidently to the forest Chasing Hiisi s elk on snowshoes Since I went O me unhappy And have spoilt the best of snowshoes And the splendid frames have shattered And my spearpoint likewise broken two hundred seventy RUNO XIV LEMMINKAINEN S DEATH Argument Lemminkainen invokes the forest deities and at length succeeds in capturing the elk and brings it to Pohjola one two hundred seventy Another task is given him to bridle the fire breathing steed of Hiisi He bridles it and brings it to Pohjola two hundred seventy one three hundred seventy two A third task is assigned him to shoot a swan on the river of Tuonela Lemminkainen comes to the river but the despised cowherd who is lying in wait for him kills him and casts his body into the cataract of Tuoni The son of Tuoni then cuts his body to pieces three hundred seventy three four hundred sixty Then the lively Lemminkainen Deeply pondered and reflected On the path that he should follow Whither he should turn his footsteps Should he leave the elk of Hiisi And direct his journey homewards Should he make another effort And pursue the chase on snowshoes With the Forest Queen s permission And the favour of the wood nymphs ten Then he spoke the words which follow And in words like these expressed him Ukko thou of Gods the highest Gracious Father in the heavens Make me now two better snowshoes Leather snowshoes fit for sliding That I glide upon them swiftly Over land and over marshes Glide throughout the land of Hiisi And across the heaths of Pohja twenty There to chase the elk of Hiisi And to catch the nimble reindeer In the wood alone I wander Toil without another hero Through the pathways of Tapiola And beside the home of Tapio Welcome wooded slopes and mountains Welcome to the rustling pinewoods Welcome to the grey head aspens And to all who greet me welcome thirty Be propitious wood and thicket Gracious Tapio do thou aid me Bring the hero to the islands To the hills in safety lead him Where he can attain the quarry Whence he may bring back the booty Nyyrikki O son of Tapio Thou the mighty red capped hero Blaze the path across the country And erect me

noble mistress hearing Gracious queen of all the forest That she soon may hear the music And from her repose may rouse her For she does not hear at present And she but awakens rarely Though I supplicate for ever With my golden tongue imploring Then the lively Lemminkainen Wandered on but found no booty eighty Glided through the plains and marshes Glided through the trackless forests Where has Jumala his soot hills To the charcoal heaths of Hiisi Thus he skated one day two days And at length upon the third day Came he to a lofty mountain Where he climbed a rock stupendous And he turned his eyes to north west To the north across the marshes ninety And he saw the farms of Tapio With the doors all golden shining To the north across the marshes On the slope among the thickets Then the lively Lemminkainen Quickly to the spot approaching Pushed his way through all obstructions Under Tapio s very windows And he looked while stooping forward In the sixth among the windows one hundred There were resting game dispensers Matrons of the woods reposing All were in their work day garments And with filthy rags were covered Said the lively Lemminkainen Wherefore Mistress of the Forest Dost thou wear thy work day garments Dirty ragged thresher s garments You are very black to gaze on And your whole appearance dreadful one hundred ten For your breast is most disgusting And your form

it forward to the hero Do thou put thy hands together And on both sides do thou guide it one hundred ninety That the game may not escape me Rushing back in wrong direction If the game should seek to fly me Rushing in the wrong direction Seize its ear and drag it forward By the horns upon the pathway If there s brushwood on the pathway Drive it to the pathway s edges If a tree should block the pathway Then the tree trunk break asunder two hundred If a fence obstructs the pathway Thrust the fence aside before you Take five withes to hold it backward And seven posts whereon to bind them If a

silver I have gold as old as moonlight Silver old as is the sunlight Which I won in battle tumult In the contest of the heroes Useful in my purse I found it Where it jingled in the darkness If thy gold thou wilt not barter Perhaps thou wilt exchange thy silver two hundred thirty Thus the lively Lemminkainen For a week on snowshoes glided Sang a song throughout the forest There among the depths of jungle And appeased the forest s mistress And the forest s master likewise And delighted all the maidens Pleasing thus the girls of Tapio Then they hunted and drove onward From its lair the elk of Hiisi two hundred forty Past the wooded hills of Tapio Past the bounds of Hiisi s mountain To the man who waited for it To the sorcerer in his ambush Then the lively Lemminkainen Lifted his lasso and threw it O er the elk of Hiisi s shoulders Round the camel s neck he threw it That it should not kick in fury When upon its back he stroked it two hundred fifty Then the lively Lemminkainen Spoke aloud the words which follow Lord of woods of earth the master Fairest creature of the heathlands Mielikki the forest s mistress Loveliest of the game dispensers Come to take the gold I promised Come ye now to choose the silver On the ground lay down your linen Spreading out of flax the finest two hundred sixty Underneath the gold that glitters Underneath the shining silver That upon the ground it

the youthful bride I seek for two hundred seventy Louhi Pohjola s old Mistress Heard his words and then made answer I will only give my daughter Give the youthful bride you seek for If you rein the mighty gelding He the chestnut steed of Hiisi He the foaming foal of Hiisi On the bounds of Hiisi s meadow Then the lively Lemminkainen Took at once a golden bridle two hundred eighty Took a halter all of silver And he went to seek the courser Went to seek the yellow maned one On the bounds of Hiisi s meadow Then he hastened on his journey On his way went swiftly forward Through the green and open meadows To the sacred field beyond them And he sought there for the courser Seeking for the yellow maned one two hundred ninety At his belt the bit he carried And the harness on his shoulder Thus he sought one day a second And at length upon the third day Came he to a lofty mountain And upon a rock he clambered And he turned his eyes to eastward And he turned his head to sunwards On the sand he saw the courser Mid the firs the yellow maned one three hundred From his hair the flame was flashing From his mane the smoke was rising Thereupon prayed Lemminkainen Ukko thou of Gods the highest Ukko thou of clouds the leader Of the scattered clouds conductor Open now thy clefts in heaven And in all the sky thy windows Let the iron hail fall downwards Send thou down the frozen masses three hundred ten On the mane of that good courser On the back of Hiisi s courser Ukko then the great Creator Jumala mid clouds exalted Heard and rent the air asunder Clove in twain the vault of heaven Scattered ice and scattered iceblocks Scattered down the iron hailstones Smaller than a horse s head is Larger than a head of man is three hundred twenty On the mane of that good courser On the back

the bit adjusted On his silver head the bridle On his broad back then he mounted On the back of that good courser O er the horse his whip he brandished With a willow switch he struck him And a little

how he perished in the river of Tuonela and returns home with his mother five hundred fifty five six hundred fifty Lemminkainen s tender mother In her home was always thinking Where has Lemminkainen wandered Whereabouts is Kauko roaming For I do not hear him coming From his world extended journey Ah the hapless mother knew not Nor the hapless one imagined Where her own flesh now was floating Where her own blood now was flowing ten If he tracked the fir clad mountains Or among the heaths was roaming Or upon a lake was floating Out upon the foaming billows Or in some terrific combat In the most tremendous tumult With his legs with blood bespattered To the knees with blood all crimsoned Kyllikki the lovely housewife Wandered round and gazed about her twenty Through the home of Lemminkainen And through Kaukomieli s homestead On the comb she looked at evening On the brush she looked at morning And at length one day it happened In the early morning hours Blood from out the comb was oozing From the brush was gore distilling Kyllikki the lovely housewife Uttered then the words which follow thirty Lo my husband has departed And my handsome Kauko wandered In a country void of houses And throughout some trackless desert Blood from out the comb is oozing Gore is from the brush distilling Then did Lemminkainen s mother See herself the comb was bleeding And began to weep

she journeyed Asking where her son had wandered And she asked in words which follow Tell me Pohjola s old Mistress sixty Whither sent you Lemminkainen Whither has my son departed Louhi Pohjola s old Mistress Then replied in words which follow Of your son I know no tidings Where he went or where he vanished In his sledge I yoked a stallion Chose him out a fiery courser Perhaps he sank in ice when rotten O er the frozen lake when driving seventy Or among the wolves has fallen Or some dreadful bear devoured him Then said Lemminkainen s mother This indeed is shameless lying For no wolf would touch my offspring Not a bear touch Lemminkainen Wolves he d crush between his fingers Bears with naked hands would master If you will not truly tell me How you treated Lemminkainen eighty I the malthouse doors will shatter Break the hinges of the Sampo Then said Pohjola s old Mistress I have fed the man profusely And I gave him drink in plenty Till he was most fully sated In a boat s prow then I placed him That he thus should shoot the rapids But I really cannot tell you What befel the wretched creature ninety In the wildly foaming torrent In the tumult of the whirlpool Then said Lemminkainen s mother This indeed is shameless lying Tell me now the truth exactly Make an end of all your lying Whither sent you Lemminkainen Where has Kaleva s son perished Or most certain death

mighty beasts to bridle And to put the foals in harness Then I sent him forth swan hunting Seeking for the bird so sacred But I really cannot tell you If misfortune came upon him one hundred ten Or what hindrance he encountered Nought I heard of his returning For the bride that he demanded When he came to woo my daughter Then the mother sought the strayed one Dreading what mischance had happened Like a wolf she tracked the marshes Like a bear the wastes she traversed Like an otter swam the waters Badger like the plains she traversed one hundred twenty Passed the headlands like a hedgehog Like a hare along the lakeshores Pushed the rocks from out her pathway From the slopes bent down the tree trunks Thrust the shrubs beside her pathway From her track she cast the branches Long she vainly sought the strayed one Long she sought but found him never Of her son the trees she questioned For the lost one ever seeking one hundred thirty Said a tree then sighed a pine tree And an oak made answer wisely I myself have also sorrows For your son I cannot trouble For my lot s indeed a hard one And an evil day awaits me For they split me into splinters And they chop me into faggots In the kiln that I may perish Or they fell me in the clearing one hundred forty Long she vainly sought the strayed one Long she sought but found him never And whene er she crossed a pathway Then she bowed herself before it O thou path whom God created Hast thou seen my son pass over Hast thou seen my golden apple Hast thou seen my staff of silver But the path made answer wisely And it spoke and gave her answer one hundred fifty I myself have also sorrows For your son I cannot trouble For my lot s indeed a hard one And an evil day awaits me All the dogs go leaping o er me And the horsemen gallop o er me And the shoes walk heavy on me And the heels press hardly on me Long she vainly sought the strayed one Long she sought but found him never one hundred sixty Met the moon upon her pathway And before the moon she bowed her Golden moon whom God created Hast thou seen my son pass by you Hast thou seen my golden apple Hast thou seen my staff of silver Then the moon whom God created Made a full and prudent answer I myself have many sorrows For your son I cannot trouble one hundred seventy For my lot s indeed a hard one And an evil day awaits me Wandering lonely in the night time In the frost for ever shining In the winter keeping vigil But in time of summer waning Long she vainly sought the strayed one Long she sought but found him never Met the sun upon her pathway And before the sun she bowed her one hundred eighty O thou sun whom God created Hast thou seen my son pass by you Hast thou seen my golden apple Hast thou seen my staff of silver And the sun knew all about it And the sun made answer plainly There has gone your son unhappy He has fallen and has perished Down in Tuoni s murky river Manala s primeval river one hundred ninety There in the tremendous cataract Where the torrent rushes downward There on Tuonela s dark frontier There in Manala s deep valleys Then did Lemminkainen s mother Break out suddenly in weeping To the craftsman s forge she wended O thou smith O Ilmarinen Thou hast worked before and yestreen On this very day O forge me two hundred Forge a rake with copper handle Let the teeth of steel be fashioned Teeth in length a hundred fathoms And of fathoms five the handle Then the smith e en Ilmarinen He the great primeval craftsman Forged a rake with copper handle And the teeth of steel he fashioned Teeth in length a hundred fathoms And of fathoms five the handle two hundred ten Then did Lemminkainen s mother Take the mighty rake of iron And she rushed to Tuoni s river To the sun her prayer addressing O thou sun whom God created Brilliant work of the Creator Shine an hour with heat excessive Shine again with sultry shimmering And again with utmost vigour Lull to sleep the race of evil two hundred twenty And in Manala the strong ones Weary out the power of Tuoni Then the sun whom God created Shining work of the Creator Stooped upon a crooked birch tree Sank upon a crooked alder Shone an hour with heat excessive Shone again with sultry shimmering And again with utmost vigour Lulled to sleep the race of evil two hundred thirty And in Manala the strong ones Slept the young on sword hilt resting And the old folks staff supported And the spear men middle aged Then again he hastened upward Sought again the heights of heaven Sought again his former station To his first abode soared upward Then did Lemminkainen s mother Take the mighty rake of iron two hundred forty And to seek her son was raking All amid the raging cataract Through the fiercely rushing torrent And she raked yet found she nothing Then she went and sought him deeper Ever deeper in the water Stocking deep into the water Standing waist deep in the water Thus she sought her son by raking All the length of Tuoni s river two hundred fifty And she raked against the current Once and twice she raked the river And his shirt at length discovered Found the shirt of him unhappy And she raked again a third time And she found his hat and stockings Found his stockings greatly sorrowing Found his hat with heart wrung anguish Then she waded ever deeper Down in Manala s abysses two hundred sixty Raked once more along the river Raked again across the river And obliquely through the water And at length upon the third time Up she drew a lifeless carcass With the mighty rake of iron Yet it was no lifeless carcass But the lively Lemminkainen He the handsome Kaukomieli Sticking fast upon the rake prongs two hundred seventy Sticking by his nameless finger And the toes upon his left foot Thus she fished up Lemminkainen Kaleva s great offspring lifted On the rake all shod with copper To the light above the water Yet were many fragments wanting Half his head a hand was wanting Many other little fragments And his very life was wanting two hundred eighty As his mother pondered o er it Thus she spoke while sorely weeping Can a man from this be fashioned And a hero new created But by chance a raven heard her And he answered her in thiswise No man can from this be fashioned Not from what you have discovered For his eyes the powan s eaten And the pike has cleft his shoulders two hundred ninety Cast the man into the water Back in Tuonela s deep river Perhaps a cod may thence be fashioned Or a whale from thence developed Lemminkainen s mother would not Cast her son into the water But again began her raking With the mighty rake of copper All through Tuonela s deep river First along it then across it three hundred And his head and hand discovered And the fragments of his backbone Then she found his ribs in pieces Likewise many other fragments And her son she pieced together Shaped the lively Lemminkainen Then the flesh to flesh she fitted And the bones together fitted And the joints together jointed And the veins she pressed together three hundred ten Then she bound the veins together All their ends she knit together And with care their threads she counted And she spoke the words which follow Fairest goddess of the bloodveins Suonetar O fairest woman Lovely weaver of the veinlets Working with thy loom so slender With the spindle all of copper And the wheel composed of iron three hundred twenty Come thou here where thou art needed Hasten hither where I call thee With a lapful of thy veinlets And beneath thy arm a bundle Thus to bind the veins together And to knit their ends together Where the wounds are gaping widely And where gashes still are open If this is not yet sufficient In the air there sits a maiden three hundred thirty In a boat adorned with copper In a boat with stern of scarlet From the air descend O maiden Virgin from the midst of heaven Row thy boat throughout the veinlets Through the joints both forth and backwards Through the broken bones O steer thou And throughout the joints when broken Bind the veins together firmly Lay them in the right position three hundred forty End to end the larger bloodveins And the arteries fit together Duplicate the smaller bloodveins Join the ends of smallest veinlets Take thou then thy finest needle Thread it next with silken fibre Sew thou with the finest needle Stitch thou with thy tin made needle Sew the ends of veins together Bind them with thy silken fibre three hundred fifty If this is not yet sufficient Help me Jumala Eternal Harness thou thy foal of swiftness And equip thy mighty courser In thy little sledge then drive thou Through the bones and joints O drive thou Through the flesh that all is mangled Back and forth throughout the veinlets In the flesh the bone then fasten Ends of veins knit firm together three hundred sixty Twixt the bones O fix thou silver Fix the veins with gold together Where the skin is rent asunder Let the skin be brought together Where the veins have snapped asunder Let the veins be knit together Where through wounds the blood has issued Let the blood again be flowing Where the bones have broke to splinters Let the bones be fixed together three hundred seventy Where the flesh is torn asunder Let the flesh be knit together Fix it in the right position In its right position fix it Bone to bone and flesh to flesh fix Joint to joint unite thou firmly Thus did Lemminkainen s mother Form the man and shape the hero To his former life restore him To the form he wore aforetime three hundred eighty All the veins had now been counted And their ends were knit together But as yet the man was speechless Nor the child to speak was able Then she spoke the words which follow And expressed herself in thiswise Whence shall we obtain an ointment Whence obtain the drops of honey That I may anoint the patient And that I may cure his weakness three hundred ninety That the man his speech recovers And again his songs is singing O thou bee thou bird of honey King of all the woodland flowerets Go thou forth to fetch me honey Go thou forth to seek for honey Back from Metsola s fair meadows Tapiola for ever cheerful From the cup of many a flower And the plumes of grasses many four hundred As an ointment for the patient And to quite restore the sick one Then the bee the bird so active Flew away upon his journey Forth to Metsola s fair meadows Tapiola for ever cheerful Probed the flowers upon the meadows With his tongue he sucked the honey From the tips of six bright flowers From the plumes of hundred grasses four hundred ten Then came buzzing loud and louder Rushing on his homeward journey With his wings all steeped in honey And his plumage soaked with nectar Then did Lemminkainen s mother Take from him the magic ointment That she might anoint the patient And she thus might cure his weakness But from this there came no healing And as yet the man was speechless four hundred twenty Then she spoke the words which follow O thou bee my own dear birdling Fly thou in a new direction Over nine lakes fly thou quickly Till thou reach a lovely island Where the land abounds with honey Where is Tuuri s new built dwelling Palvonen s own roofless dwelling There is honey in profusion There is ointment in perfection four hundred thirty Fit to bind the veins together And to heal the joints completely From the meadow bring this ointment And the salve from out the meadow For upon the wounds I ll spread it And anoint the bruises with it Then the bee that active hero Flew again on whirring pinions And across nine lakes he travelled Half across the tenth he travelled four hundred forty On he flew one day a second And at length upon the third day Never on the reeds reposing Nor upon a leaf reposing Came he to the lovely island Where the land abounds with honey Till he reached a furious torrent And a holy river s whirlpool In this spot was cooked the honey And the ointment was made ready four hundred fifty In the little earthen vessels In the pretty little kettles Kettles of a thumb size only And a finger tip would fill them Then the bee that active hero Gathered honey in the meadow And a little time passed over Very little time passed over When he came on whirring pinions Coming with his mission finished four hundred sixty In his lap six cups he carried Seven upon his back he carried Brimming o er with precious ointment With the best of ointment brimming Then did Lemminkainen s mother Salve him with this precious ointment With nine kinds of ointment salved him And ten kinds of magic ointment Even yet there came no healing Still her toil was unavailing four hundred seventy Then she spoke the words which follow And expressed herself in thiswise O thou bee thou bird aerial Fly thou forth again the third time Fly thou up aloft to heaven And through nine heavens fly thou swiftly There is honey in abundance In the wood as much as needed Which was charmed by the Creator By pure Jumala was breathed on four hundred eighty When his children he anointed Wounded by the powers of evil In the honey dip thy pinions Soak thy plumage in the nectar Bring me honey on thy pinions In thy mantle from the forest As an ointment for the patient And anoint the bruises with it But the bee the bird of wisdom Answered her in words that follow four hundred ninety How can I perform thy bidding I a man so small and helpless Thou canst rise on high with swiftness Fly aloft with easy effort O er the moon below the daylight And amid the stars of heaven Flying windlike on the first day Past the borders of Orion On the second day thou soarest Even to the Great Bear s shoulders five hundred On the third day soaring higher O er the Seven Stars thou risest Thence the journey is a short one And the distance very trifling Unto Jumala s bright dwelling And the regions of the blessed From the earth the bee rose swiftly On his honeyed wings rose whirring And he soared on rapid pinions On his little wings flew upward five hundred ten Swiftly past the moon he hurried Past the borders of the sunlight Rose upon the Great Bear s shoulders O er the Seven Stars backs rose upward Flew to the Creator s cellars To the halls of the Almighty There the drugs were well concocted And the ointment duly tempered In the pots composed of silver Or within the golden kettles five hundred twenty In the midst they boiled the honey On the sides was sweetest ointment To the southward there was nectar To the northward there was ointment Then the bee that bird aerial Gathered honey in abundance Honey to his heart s contentment And but little time passed over Ere the bee again came buzzing Humming loudly on his journey five hundred thirty In his lap of horns a hundred And a thousand other vessels Some of honey some of liquid And the best of all the ointment Then did Lemminkainen s mother Raise it to her mouth and taste it With her tongue the ointment tasted With the greatest care she proved it Tis the ointment that I needed And the salve of the Almighty five hundred forty Used when Jumala the Highest The Creator heals all suffering Then did she anoint the patient That she thus might cure his weakness Salved the bones along the fractures And between the joints she salved him Salved his head and lower portions Rubbed him also in the middle Then she spoke the words which follow And expressed herself in thiswise five hundred fifty Rise my son from out thy slumber From thy dreams do thou awaken From this place so full of evil And a resting place unholy From his sleep arose the hero And from out his dreams awakened And at once his speech recovered With his tongue these words he uttered Woe s me long have I been sleeping Long have I in pain been lying five hundred sixty And in peaceful sleep reposing In the deepest slumber sunken Then said Lemminkainen s mother And expressed herself in thiswise Longer yet hadst thou been sleeping Longer yet hadst thou been resting But for thy unhappy mother But for her in pain who bore thee Tell me now my son unhappy Tell me that my ears may hear it five hundred seventy Who to Manala has sent thee There to drift in Tuoni s river Said the lively Lemminkainen And he answered thus his mother Markahattu he the cowherd Untamola s blind old rascal Down to Manala has sent me There to drift in Tuoni s river And he raised a water serpent From the waves a serpent lifted five hundred eighty Sent it forth to me unhappy But I could not guard against it Knowing nought of water evil Nor the evils of the reed beds Then said Lemminkainen s mother Mighty man of little foresight Boasting to enchant the sorcerers And to ban the sons of Lapland Knowing nought of water evil Nor the evils of the reed beds five hundred ninety Water snakes are born in water On the waves among the reed beds From the duck s brain springs the serpent In the head of the sea swallow Syojatar spat in the water Cast upon the waves the spittle And the water stretched it lengthwise And the sunlight warmed and softened And the wind arose and tossed it And the water breezes rocked it six hundred On the shore the waves they drove it And amid the breakers urged it Thus did Lemminkainen s mother Cause her son with all her efforts To resume his old appearance And ensured that in the future He should even be superior Yet more handsome than aforetime And she asked her son thereafter Was there anything he needed six hundred ten Said the lively Lemminkainen There is something greatly needed For my heart is fixed for ever And my inclination leads me To the charming maids of Pohja With their lovely locks unbraided But the dirty eared old woman Has refused to give her daughter Till I shoot the duck she asks for And the swan shall capture for her six hundred twenty Here in Tuonela s dark river In the holy river s whirlpool Then spoke Lemminkainen s mother And she answered him in thiswise Leave the poor swans unmolested Leave the ducks a peaceful dwelling Here on Tuoni s murky river Here amid the raging whirlpool Best it is to journey homeward With your most unhappy mother six hundred thirty Praise thou now thy happy future And to Jumala be praises That he granted his assistance And has thus to life awaked thee And from Tuoni s paths hath led thee And from Mana s realms hath brought thee I myself had never conquered And alone had nought accomplished But for Jumala s compassion And the help of the Creator six hundred forty Then the lively Lemminkainen Went at once his journey homeward With his mother she who loved him Homeward with the aged woman Here I part awhile with Kauko Leave the lively Lemminkainen Long from out my song I leave him While I quickly change my subject Turn my song in new directions And in other furrows labour six hundred fifty RUNO XVI VaINaMoINEN IN TUONELA Argument Vainamoinen orders Sampsa Pellervoinen to seek for wood for boat building He makes a boat but finds himself at a loss for want of three magic words one one hundred eighteen As he cannot otherwise obtain them he goes to Tuonela hoping to procure them there one hundred nineteen three hundred sixty two Vainamoinen finally escapes from Tuonela and after his return warns others not to venture there and describes what a terrible place it is and the horrible abodes in which men dwell there three hundred sixty three four hundred twelve Vainamoinen old and steadfast He the great primeval sorcerer Set to work a

And shall seek an oak tree for him For the boat of Vainamoinen And a keel to suit the minstrel So upon his path he wandered Through the regions to the north east twenty Through one district then another Journeyed after through a third one With his gold axe on his shoulder With his axe with copper handle Till he found an aspen standing Which in height three fathoms measured So he went to fell the aspen With his axe the tree to sever And the aspen spoke and asked him With its tongue it spoke in thiswise thirty What O man desire you from me Tell your need as far as may be Youthful Sampsa Pellervoinen Answered in the words which follow This is what I wish for from thee This I need and this require I Tis a boat for Vainamoinen For the minstrel s boat the timber And the aspen said astounded Answered with its hundred branches forty As a boat I should be leaking And would only sink beneath you For my branches they are hollow Thrice already in this summer Has a grub my heart devoured In my roots a worm has nestled Youthful Sampsa Pellervoinen Wandered further on his journey And he wandered deeply pondering In the region to the northward fifty There he found a pine tree standing And its height was full six fathoms And he struck it with his hatchet On the trunk with axe blade smote it And he spoke the words which follow O thou pine tree shall I take thee For the boat of Vainamoinen And as boatwood for the minstrel But the pine tree answered quickly And it cried in answer loudly sixty For a boat you cannot use me Nor a six ribbed boat can fashion Full of knots you

felled the oak tree And the beauteous tree had fallen First he hewed it through the summit All the trunk he cleft in pieces After this the keel he fashioned Planks so many none could count them For the vessel of the minstrel For the boat of Vainamoinen one hundred Then the aged Vainamoinen He the great primeval sorcerer Fashioned then the boat with wisdom Built with magic songs the vessel From the fragments of an oak tree Fragments of the shattered oak tree With a song the keel he fashioned With another sides he fashioned And he sang again a third time And the rudder he constructed one

sides should fix securely Fix the prow in right position And the stern should likewise finish Vainamoinen old and steadfast He the great primeval minstrel one hundred twenty Uttered then the words which follow Woe to me my life is wretched For my boat unlaunched remaineth On the waves the new boat floats not So he pondered and reflected How to find the words he needed And obtain the spells of magic From among the brains of swallows From the heads of flocks of wild swans From the shoulders of the goose flocks one hundred thirty Then he went the words to gather And a flock of swans he slaughtered And a flock of geese he slaughtered And beheaded many swallows But the spells he needed found not Not a word not e en a half one So he pondered and reflected I shall find such words by hundreds Neath the tongue of summer reindeer In the mouth of whitest squirrel one hundred forty So he went the words to gather That the spells he might discover And a field he spread with reindeer Loaded benches high with squirrels Many words he thus discovered But they all were useless to him So he pondered and reflected I should find such words by hundreds In the dark abodes of Tuoni In the eternal home of Mana one hundred fifty Then to Tuonela he journeyed Sought the words in Mana s kingdom And with rapid steps he hastened Wandered for a week through bushes Through bird cherry for a second And through juniper the third week Straight to Manala s dread island And the gleaming hills of Tuoni Vainamoinen old and steadfast Raised his voice and shouted loudly one hundred sixty There by

If you wish the boat to fetch you Tell me true without evasion Make an end at last of lying two hundred forty Why to Manala you travel Though disease has not subdued you Nor has death thus overcome you Nor some other fate o erwhelmed you Said the aged Vainamoinen True it is I lied a little And again I spoke a falsehood But at length I answer truly By my art a boat I fashioned By my songs a boat I builded two hundred fifty And I sang one day a second And at length upon the third day Broke my sledge as I was singing Broke the shaft as I was singing So I came for Tuoni s gimlet Sought in Manala a borer That my sledge I thus might finish And with this might form my song sledge Therefore bring your boat to this side Ferry me across the water two hundred sixty And across the straight convey me

not come hither Thus to drink from Mana s goblets Or to drink from Tuoni s tankards three hundred Those who drink this beer are drunken Drinking from such cans they perish Then said Tuonela s great mistress O thou aged Vainamoinen Why to Manala dost travel Why to Tuonela hast ventured Though by Tuoni never summoned To the land of Mana called not Said the aged Vainamoinen At my boat as I was working three hundred ten While my new boat I was shaping Then I found three words were wanting Ere the stern could be completed And the prow could be constructed But as I could find them nowhere In the world where er I sought them Then to Tuonela I travelled Journeyed to the land of Mana There to find the words I needed There the magic words to study three hundred twenty Then said Tuonela s great mistress And she spoke the words which follow Ne er the words will Tuoni give you Nor his spells will Mana teach you Never shall you leave these regions Never while your life remaineth Shall you ever journey homeward To your country home returning Sank the weary man in slumber And the traveller lay and slumbered three hundred thirty On the bed prepared by Tuoni There outstretched himself in slumber And the hero thus was captured Lay outstretched but quickly wakened There s in Tuonela a witch wife Aged crone with chin projecting And she spins her thread of iron And she draws out wire of

glowing four hundred ten Neath a coverlet of vipers Of the loathsome snakes of Tuoni RUNO XVII VaINaMoINEN AND ANTERO VIPUNEN Argument Vainamoinen goes to obtain magic words from Antero Vipunen and wakes him from his long sleep under the earth one ninety eight Vipunen swallows Vainamoinen and the latter begins to torture him violently in his stomach ninety nine one hundred forty six Vipunen

mortals Where beneath the earth thou restest In a sleep that long has lasted Vipunen in songs most famous Suddenly awoke from slumber Feeling he was roughly treated And with pain severe tormented Then he bit the stake of iron Bit the outer softer iron ninety But the steel he could not sever Could not eat the inner iron Then the aged Vainamoinen Just above his mouth was standing And his right foot

the words which follow Now destruction falls upon me And an evil day o ertakes me Prisoned here in Hiisi s stable Here in Kalma s narrow dungeon So he pondered and reflected How to live and how to struggle one hundred twenty In his belt a knife had Vaino And the haft was formed of maple And from this a boat he fashioned And a boat he thus constructed And he rowed the boat and urged it Back and forth throughout the entrails Rowing through the narrow channels And exploring every passage Vipunen the old musician Was not thus much incommoded one hundred thirty Then the aged Vainamoinen As a smith began to labour And began to work with iron With his shirt he made a smithy With his shirt sleeves made his bellows With the fur he made the wind bag With his trousers made the air pipe And the opening with his stockings And he used his knee for anvil And his elbow for a hammer one hundred forty Then he quick began to hammer Actively he plied his hammer Through the livelong night unresting

for whom so long I pined for Then said Pohjola s old Mistress In the very words which follow Trouble great befalls the suitor Comes to her for whom he waiteth One shoe still remains unfitted And unfitted is the other twenty But the bride is waiting for you And you may indeed receive her If you plough the field of vipers Where the writhing snakes are swarming But without a plough employing And without a ploughshare guiding Once the field was ploughed by Hiisi Lempo seamed it next with furrows With the ploughshare formed of copper With the plough in furnace smelted thirty But my own son most unhappy Left the half untilled behind him Then the smith e en Ilmarinen Sought the maiden in her chamber And he spoke the words which follow Night s own daughter twilight maiden Do you not the time remember When I forged the Sampo for you And the brilliant cover welded And a binding oath thou sweared saint forty By the God whom all men worship Fore the face of Him Almighty And you gave a certain promise Unto me the mighty hero You would be my friend for ever Dove like in my arms to nestle Nothing will your mother grant me Nor will she her daughter give me Till I plough the field of vipers Where the writhing snakes are swarming fifty Then his bride assistance lent him And advice the maiden gave him O thou smith O Ilmarinen Thou the great primeval craftsman Forge thyself a plough all golden Cunningly bedecked with silver Then go plough the field of serpents Where the writhing snakes are swarming Then the smith e en Ilmarinen Laid the gold upon the anvil sixty Worked the bellows on the silver And he forged the plough he needed And he forged him shoes of iron Greaves of steel he next constructed And with these his feet he covered Those upon his shins he fastened And he donned an iron mail coat With a belt of steel he girt him Took a pair of iron gauntlets Gauntlets like to stone for hardness seventy Then he chose a horse of mettle And he yoked the steed so noble And he went to plough the acre And the open field to furrow There he saw the heads all rearing Saw the heads that hissed unceasing And he spoke the words which follow O thou snake whom God created You who lift your head so proudly Who is friendly and will hearken eighty Rearing up your head so proudly And your neck so proudly lifting From my path at once remove you Creep thou wretch among the stubble Creeping down among the bushes Or where greenest grass is growing If you lift your head from out it Ukko then your head shall shatter With his sharp and steel tipped arrows With a mighty hail of iron ninety Then he ploughed the field of vipers Furrowed all the land of serpents From the furrows raised the vipers Drove the serpents all before him And he said returning homeward I have ploughed the field of vipers Furrowed all the land of serpents Driven before me all the serpents Will you give me now your daughter And unite me with my darling one hundred Then did Pohjola s old Mistress Answer in the words which follow I will only give the maiden And unite you with my daughter If you catch the Bear of Tuoni Bridle too the Wolf of Mana Far in Tuonela s great forest In the distant realms of

daughter With the cloud sieve sift thou quickly And disperse thy mists around me Where the beasts I seek are lurking one hundred forty That they may not hear me moving That they may not flee before me Then the Wolf s great jaws he muzzled And with iron the Bear he fettered On the barren heaths of Tuoni In the blue depths of the forest And he said returning homeward Give me now your daughter old one Here I bring the Bear of Tuoni And the Wolf of Mana muzzled one hundred fifty Then did Pohjola s old Mistress Answer in the words which follow I will give you first the duckling And the blue winged duck will give you When the pike so huge and scaly He the fish so plump and floundering You shall bring from Tuoni s river And from Manala s abysses But without a net to lift it Using not a hand to grasp it one hundred sixty Hundreds have gone forth to seek it Never one returned in safety Then there came distress upon him And affliction overwhelmed him As he sought the maiden s chamber And he spoke the words which follow Now a task is laid upon me Greater still than all the former For the pike so huge and scaly He the fish so plump and floundering one hundred seventy I must bring from Tuoni s river From the eternal stream of Mana But with neither snare nor drag net Nor with help of other tackle Then his bride assistance lent him And advice the maiden gave him O thou smith O Ilmarinen Do thou not be so despondent Forge thee now a fiery eagle Forge a bird of fire all flaming one hundred eighty This the mighty pike shall capture Drag the fish so plump and floundering From the murky stream of Tuoni And from Manala s abysses Then the smith e en Ilmarinen Deathless artist of the smithy Forged himself a fiery eagle Forged a bird of fire all flaming And of iron he forged the talons Forged the claws of steel the hardest one hundred ninety Wings like sides of boat constructed Then upon the wings he mounted On the eagle s back he sat him On the wing bones of the eagle Then he spoke unto the eagle And the mighty bird instructed O my eagle bird I fashioned Fly thou forth where I shall order To the turbid stream of Tuoni And to Manala s abysses two hundred Seize the pike so huge and scaly He the fish so plump and floundering Then the bird that noble eagle Took his flight and upward soarings Forth he flew the pike to capture Fish with teeth of size terrific In the river depths of Tuoni Down in Manala s abysses To the water stretched a pinion And the other touched the heavens two hundred ten In the sea he dipped his talons On the cliffs his beak he whetted Thus the smith e en Ilmarinen Journeyed forth to seek his booty In the depths of Tuoni s river While the eagle watched beside him From the water rose a kelpie And it clutched at Ilmarinen By the neck the eagle seized it And the kelpie s head he twisted two hundred twenty To the bottom down he forced it To the black mud at the bottom Then came forth the pike of Tuoni And the water dog came onward Not a small pike of the smallest Nor a large pike of the largest Long his tongue as twain of axe shafts Long his teeth as rake shaft measures Wide his gorge as three great rivers Seven boats length his back extended two hundred thirty And the smith he sought to seize on And to swallow Ilmarinen But the eagle rushed against him And the bird of air attacked him Not an eagle of the small ones Nor an eagle of the large ones Long his beak as hundred fathoms Wide his gorge as six great rivers Six spears length his tongue extended Five scythes length his talons measured two hundred forty And he saw the pike so scaly Saw the fish so plump and floundering Fiercely on the fish he darted Rushed against the fish so scaly Then the pike so large and scaly He the fish so plump and floundering Tried to drag the eagle s pinions Underneath the sparkling waters But the eagle swift ascended Up into the air he raised him two hundred fifty From the grimy ooze he raised him To the sparkling water o er it Back and forth the eagle hovered And again he made an effort And he struck one talon fiercely In the pike s terrific shoulders In the water dog s great backbone And he fixed the other talon Firmly in the steel hard mountain In the rocks as hard as iron two hundred sixty From the stone slipped off the talon Slipped from off the rocky mountain And the pike again dived downward In the water slid the monster Slipped from off the eagle s talons From the great bird s claws terrific But his sides were scored most deeply And his shoulders cleft asunder Once again with iron talons two hundred seventy Swooped again the furious eagle With his wings all fiery glowing And his eyes like flame that sparkled Seized the pike with mighty talons Grasped the water dog securely Dragged the huge and scaly monster Raised him from the tossing water From the depths beneath the billows To the water s sparkling surface Then the bird with claws of iron Made a third and final effort two hundred eighty Brought the mighty pike of Tuoni He the fish so plump and floundering From the river dark of Tuoni And from Manala s abysses Scarce like water flowed the water From the great pike s scales stupendous Nor like air the air extended When the great bird flapped his pinions Thus the iron taloned eagle Bore the pike so huge and scaly two hundred ninety To the branches of an oak tree To a pine tree s crown wide spreading There he feasted on the booty Open ripped the fish s belly Tore away the fish s breastbone And the head and neck he sundered Said the smith said Ilmarinen O thou wicked wicked eagle What a faithless bird I find you You have seized upon the quarry three hundred And you have feasted on the booty Open ripped the fish s belly Torn away the fish s breastbone And the head and neck have sundered But the iron taloned eagle Rose and soared away in fury High aloft in air he raised him To the borders of the cloudland Fled the clouds the heavens were thundering And the props of air bowed downward three hundred ten Ukko s bow in twain was broken In the moon the horns sharp pointed Then the smith e en Ilmarinen Took the pike s head which he carried To the old crone as a present And he spoke the words which follow Make of this a chair for ever In the halls of lofty Pohja Then he spoke the words which follow And in words like these expressed him three hundred twenty I have ploughed

room there came already Came a bird into our castle From the north east flew an eagle Through the sky a hawk came flying three hundred sixty In the air one wing was flapping On the sea the other rested With his tail he swept the ocean And to heaven his head he lifted And he gazed around and turned him Back and forth the eagle hovered Perched upon the heroes castle And his beak he whetted on it But the roof was formed of iron And he could not pierce within it three hundred seventy So he gazed around and turned him Back and forth the eagle hovered Perched upon the women s castle And his beak he whetted on it But the roof was formed of copper And he could not pierce within it So he gazed around and turned him Back and forth the eagle hovered Perched upon the maidens castle And his beak he whetted on it three hundred eighty And the roof was formed of linen And he forced his way within it Then he perched upon the chimney Then upon the floor descended Pushed aside the castle s shutter Sat him at the castle window Near the wall all green his feathers In the room his plumes a hundred Then he scanned the braidless maidens Gazing on the long haired maiden three hundred ninety On the best of all the maidens Fairest maid with hair unbraided And her head with beads was shining And her head with beauteous blossoms In his claws the eagle seized her And the hawk with talons grasped her Seized the best of all the party Of the flock of ducks the fairest She the sweetest voiced and tenderest She the rosiest and the whitest four hundred She the bird of air selected In his talons far he bore her She who held her head the highest And her form of all the shapeliest And her feathers of the finest And her plumage of the softest Then did Pohjola s old Mistress Answer in the words that follow Wherefore dost thou know my darling Or hast heard my golden apple four hundred ten How the maiden grew amongst us And her flaxen hair waved round her Perhaps the maiden shone with silver Or the maiden s gold was famous Has our sun been shining on you Or the moon afar been shining From the floor the child made answer And the growing child responded Therefore did your darling know it And your fostling learned to know it four hundred twenty In the far famed maidens dwelling In the home where dwells the fair one Good report rejoiced the father When he launched his largest vessel But rejoices more the mother When the largest loaf is baking And the wheaten bread is baking That the guests may feast profusely Thus it was your darling knew it Far around the strangers knew it four hundred thirty How the young maid grew in stature And how tall grew up the maiden Once I went into the courtyard And I wandered to the storehouse Very early in the morning In the earliest morning hours And the soot in streaks ascended And the smoke in clouds rose upward From the far famed maiden s dwelling From the blooming maiden s homestead four hundred forty And the maid herself was grinding Busy working at the handmill Rung the mill like call of cuckoo And the pestle quacked like wild geese And the sieve like bird was singing And the stones like beads were rattling Forth a second time I wandered And into the field I wandered In the meadow was the maiden Stooping o er the yellow heather four hundred fifty Working at the red stained dye pots Boiling up the yellow kettles When I wandered forth a third time Sat the maid beneath the window There I heard the maiden weaving In her hands the comb was sounding And I heard the shuttle flying As in cleft of rock the ermine And the comb teeth heard I sounding As the wooden shaft was moving four hundred sixty And the weaver s beam was turning Like a squirrel in the tree tops Then did Pohjola s old Mistress Answer in the words which follow Bravo bravo dearest maiden Have I not for ever told thee Not to sing among the pine trees Not to sing amid the valleys Not to arch thy neck too proudly Nor thy white arms leave uncovered four hundred seventy Nor thy young and beauteous bosom Nor thy shape so round and graceful I have warned thee all the autumn And besought thee all the summer Likewise in the spring have cautioned At the second springtide sowing To construct a secret dwelling With the windows small and hidden Where the maids may do their weaving And may work their looms in safety four hundred eighty All unheard by Suomi s gallants Suomi s gallants country lovers From the floor the child made answer And the fortnight old responded Easily a horse is hidden In the stall with fine tailed horses Hard it is to hide a maiden And to keep her long locks hidden Though you build of stone a castle And amid the sea shall rear it four hundred ninety Though you keep your maidens in it And should rear your darlings in it Still the girls cannot be hidden Nor attain their perfect stature Undisturbed by lusty gallants Lusty gallants country lovers Mighty men with lofty helmets Men who shoe with steel their horses Then the aged Vainamoinen Head bowed down and deeply grieving five hundred Wandered on his journey homeward And he spoke the words which follow Woe is me a wretched creature That I did not learn it sooner That In youthful days one weddeth And must choose a life companion All thing else a man may grieve for Save indeed an early marriage When in youth already children And a household he must care for five hundred ten Thus did warn old Vainamoinen Cautioned thus Suvantolainen That old men against the younger Should not struggle for a fair one Warned them not to swim too proudly Neither try to race in rowing Nor to seek to woo a maiden With a younger man contending RUNO XX THE GREAT OX AND THE BREWING OF THE ALE Argument An enormous ox is slaughtered in Pohjola one one hundred eighteen They brew ale and prepare a feast one hundred nineteen five hundred sixteen They dispatch messengers to invite the heroes to the wedding but Lemminkainen is expressly passed over five hundred seventeen six hundred fourteen How shall we our song continue And what legends shall we tell you Thus will we pursue our story These the legends we will tell you How in Pohjola they feasted And the drinking bout was Godlike Long prepared they for the wedding For the feast provided all things In the household famed of Pohja Halls of Sariola the misty ten What provisions were provided What did they collect together For a lengthy feast at Pohja For the multitude of drinkers For the feasting of the people For the multitude of feasters In Carelia grew a bullock Fat the ox they reared in Suomi Not a large one not a small one But a calf of middle stature twenty While he switched his tail in Hame Stooped his head to Kemi s river Long his horns one hundred fathoms Muzzle broad as half a hundred For a week there ran an ermine All along the yoke he carried All day long there flew a swallow Twixt the mighty ox s horn tips Striving through the space to hasten Nor found resting place between them thirty Month long ran a summer squirrel From his neck unto his tail end Nor did he attain the tail tip Till a month had quite passed over Twas this calf of size stupendous Twas this mighty bull of Suomi Whom they led forth from Carelia Till they reached the fields of Pohja By his horns a hundred led him And a thousand dragged his muzzle forty And they led the ox still further Till to Pohjola they brought him On his road the ox proceeded By the Sound of Sariola strayed Browsed the grass in marshy places While his back the clouds were touching But they could not find a butcher Who could fell the country s marvel On the list of Suomi s children Mid the mighty host of people fifty Not among the youthful people Nor among the very aged From afar an old man journeyed Virokannas from Carelia And he spoke the words which follow Wait thous wait thou ox unhappy While I go and fetch my mallet If I strike you with my mallet On the skull unhappy creature Never in another summer sixty Would you turn about your muzzle Or your tail would jerk around you Here among the fields of Pohja By the Sound of Sariola stray Then the old man went to strike him Virokannas moved against him Went to slay the ox unhappy But his head the ox was turning And his black eyes he was blinking To a pine tree sprang the old man seventy Virokannas in the bushes In the scrubby willow thicket After this they sought a butcher Who the mighty ox could slaughter From Carelia s lovely country From the vast expanse of Suomi From the peaceful land of Russia From the hardy land of Sweden From the regions wide of Lapland From the mighty land of Turja eighty And they sought through Tuoni s regions In the depths of Mana s kingdom And they sought but no one found they Long they searched but vainly searched they Yet again they sought a butcher Sought again to find a slaughterer On the ocean s shining surface On the wide extending billows From the dark sea rose a hero Rose a hero from the sea swell ninety From the shining surface rising From the wide expanse of water He was not among the greatest But in nowise of the smallest In a bowl would he lie sleeping And beneath a sieve stand upright Twas an old man iron fisted Iron coloured too to gaze on On his head a stony helmet Shoes of stone his feet protected one hundred In his hand a knife gold bladed And the haft o erlaid with copper Thus the people found a butcher And at length they found a slaughterer Who should fell the bull of Suomi And should fell the country s marvel Scarce had he beheld the quarry Than at once his neck he shattered On his knees he forced the bullock And upon his side he threw him one hundred ten Did he yield them much provisions Not so very much he yielded Of his flesh a hundred barrels And a hundred fathoms sausage Seven boat loads of blood they gathered Six large casks with fat were loaded All for Pohjola s great banquet Feast of Sariola the misty Then they built a house in Pohja Built a house with hall enormous one hundred twenty Fathoms nine its sides extended And the breadth thereof was seven If a cock crowed at the smoke hole Underneath they could not hear it If a dog at end was barking At the door they did not hear it Then did Pohjola s old Mistress Walk across the flooring s planking To the middle of the chamber And she pondered and reflected one hundred thirty How shall I get ale sufficient And shall brew the beer most wisely To prepare it for the wedding When the beer will much be needed How to brew the beer I know not Nor how ale was first concocted By the stove there sat an old man From the stove spoke up the old man Ale of barley is concocted And the drink with hops is flavoured one hundred forty Yet they brew not save with water And the aid of furious fire Hop is called the son of Revel Planted in the ground when little With a plough they ploughed the region Like an ant away they cast him Close to Kaleva s great well spring There where Osmo s field is sloping There the tender plant sprang upward And the green shoot mounted quickly one hundred fifty Up a little tree it mounted Rising to the leafy summit Sowed by chance an old man barley In the fresh ploughed field of Osmo And the barley sprouted bravely And It grew and flourished greatly On the new ploughed field of Osmo Kaleva s descendant s cornland But a little time passed over When the hops exclaimed from tree top one hundred sixty And upon the field the barley And in Kaleva s well water When shall we be yoked together Each with other be united Life in solitude is weary Better two or three together Osmotar the ale constructer She the maid who beer concocted Took on this the grains of barley Gathered six of grains of barley one hundred seventy Seven hop tassels next she gathered And eight ladles took of water Then upon the fire she placed it And allowed it there to simmer And she boiled the ale of barley Through the fleeting days of summer Out upon the cloudy headland Cape upon the shady island Poured it then in wooden barrels And in tubs of birchwood stored it one hundred eighty Thus she brewed the ale and stored it But the ale was not fermented And she pondered and reflected And she spoke the words which follow What must now be added to it What is needful to provide for That the ale may be fermented And the beer be brought to foaming Kalevatar beauteous maiden She the maid with slender fingers one hundred ninety Which she ever moves so deftly She whose feet are shod so lightly Felt about the seams of staving Groping all about the bottom Trying one and then the other In the midst of both the kettles Found a splinter at the bottom From the bottom took a splinter Then she turned it and reflected What might perhaps be fashioned from it two hundred In the hands of lovely maiden In the noble damsel s fingers Brought into the hands of maiden To the noble damsel s fingers In her hands the maiden took it In the noble damsel s fingers And she clapped her hands together Both her hands she rubbed together Rubbed them on her thighs together And a squirrel white created two hundred ten Then she gave her son directions And instructed thus the squirrel O thou squirrel gold of woodlands Flower of woodlands charm of country Speed then forth where I shall bid thee Where I bid thee and direct thee Forth to Metsola s bright regions And to Tapiola s great wisdom There a little tree upclimbing Heedful to the leafy summit two hundred twenty That the eagle may not seize thee Nor the bird of air may grasp thee From the pine tree bring me pine cones From the fir bring shoots of fir tree Bring them to the hands of maiden For the beer of Osmo s daughter Knew the squirrel now his pathway Trailed his bushy tail behind him And his journey soon accomplished Quickly through the open spaces two hundred thirty Past one wood and then a second And a third he crossed obliquely Into Metsola s bright regions And to Tapiola s great wisdom There he saw three lofty pine trees There he saw four slender fir trees Climbed a pine tree in the valley On the heath he climbed a fir tree And the eagle did not seize him Nor the bird of air did grasp him two hundred forty From the pine he broke the pine cones From the fir the leafy tassels In his claws he hid the pine cones And within his paws he rolled them To the maiden s hands he brought them To the noble damsel s fingers In the beer the maiden laid them In the ale she placed them likewise But the ale was not fermented Nor the fresh drink yet was working two hundred fifty Osmotar the ale preparer She the maid who beer concocted Pondered yet again the matter What must now be added to it That the ale shall be fermented And the beer be brought to foaming Kalevatar beauteous maiden She the maid with slender fingers Which she ever moves so deftly She whose feet are shod so lightly two hundred sixty Felt about the seams of staving Groping all about the bottom Trying one and then the other In the midst of both the kettles Found a chip upon the bottom Took the chip from off the bottom Then she turned it and reflected What might perhaps be fashioned from it In the hands of lovely maiden In the noble damsel s fingers two hundred seventy Brought into the hands of maiden To the noble damsel s fingers In her hands the maiden took it In the noble damsel s fingers And she clapped her hands together Both her hands she rubbed together Rubbed them on her thighs together And she made a gold breast marten Thus the marten she instructed Thus the orphan child directed two hundred eighty O my marten O my birdling O my fair one beauteous hided Thither go where I shall bid thee Where I bid thee and direct thee To the Bear s own rocky cavern Where the forest bears are prowling Where the bears are always fighting Where they lurk in all their fierceness With thy hands scrape foam together In thy paws the foam then carry two hundred ninety To the maiden s hands convey it And to Osmo s daughter s shoulders Understood the way the marten Forth the golden breasted hastened And his journey soon accomplished Quickly through the open spaces Past one wood and then a second And a third he crossed obliquely To the Bear s own rocky cavern To the caverns bear frequented three hundred Where the bears are always fighting Where they lurk In all their fierceness In the rocks as hard as iron And among the steel hard mountains From the bears mouths foam was dropping From their furious jaws exuding In his hands the foam he gathered With his paws the foam collected To the maiden s hands he brought it To the noble damsel s fingers three hundred ten In the ale the maiden poured it In the beer she poured it likewise But the ale was not fermented Nor the drink of men foamed over Osmotar the ale preparer She the maid who beer concocted Pondered yet again the matter What must now be added to it That the ale shall be fermented And the beer be brought to foaming three hundred twenty Kalevatar beauteous maiden She the maid with slender fingers Which she ever moves so deftly She whose feet are shod so lightly Felt about the seams of staving Groping all about the bottom Trying one and then the other Then the space between the kettles And a mustard pod she saw there From the ground the pod she lifted three hundred thirty Then she turned It and surveyed it What might perhaps be fashioned from it In the hands of lovely maiden In the noble damsel s fingers Brought into the hands of maiden To the noble damsel s fingers In her hands the maiden took it In the noble damsel s fingers And she clapped her hands together Both her hands she rubbed together three hundred forty Rubbed them on her thighs together And a bee she thus created And the bee she thus instructed And the bee she thus directed O thou bee thou bird so nimble King of all the flowery meadows Thither fly where I shall bid thee Where I bid thee and direct thee To an isle on ocean s surface Where the reefs arise from ocean three hundred fifty There a maiden lies in slumber With her belt of copper loosened By her side springs sweetest herbage On her lap rest honey grasses On thy wings bring sweetest honey Bring thou honey on thy clothing From the fairest of the herbage From the bloom of golden flowerets To the maiden s hands convey it And to Osmo s daughter s shoulders three hundred sixty Then the bee that bird so nimble Flew away and hastened onward And his journey soon accomplished Speeding o er the open spaces First across the sea along it Then in an oblique direction To an isle on ocean s surface Where the reefs arise from ocean There he saw the maiden sleeping With a tin brooch on her bosom three hundred seventy Resting in an unmowed meadow All among the fields of honey By her side grew golden grasses At her belt sprang silver grasses Then he soaked his wings with honey Plunged his plumes in liquid honey From the brightest of the herbage From the tips of golden flowerets To the maiden s hands he brought it To the noble damsel s fingers three hundred eighty In the ale the maiden cast it In the beer she poured it likewise And the beer at length fermented And the fresh drink now foamed upward From within the new made barrels From within the tubs of birchwood Foaming upward to the handles Rushing over all the edges To the ground it wished to trickle And upon the floor ran downward three hundred ninety But a little time passed over Very little time passed over When the heroes flocked to drink it Chief among them Lemminkainen Drunk was Ahti drunk was Kauko Drunken was the ruddy rascal With the ale of Osmo s daughter And the beer of Kalevatar Osmotar the ale preparer She the maid who beer concocted four hundred Uttered then the words which follow Woe is me my day is wretched For I brewed the ale so badly And the beer so ill concocted That from out the tubs tis flowing And upon the floor is gushing From a tree there sang a bullfinch From the roof tree sang a throstle No the ale is not so worthless Tis the best of ale for drinking four hundred ten If into the casks you pour it And should store it in the cellar Store it in the casks of oakwood And within the hoops of copper Thus was ale at first created Beer of Kaleva concocted Therefore is it praised so highly Therefore held in greatest honour For the ale is of the finest Best of drinks for prudent people four hundred twenty Women soon it brings to laughter Men it warms into good humour And it makes the prudent merry But it brings the fools to raving Then did Pohjola s old Mistress When she heard how ale was fashioned Water pour in tubs the largest Half she filled the new made barrels Adding barley as twas needed Shoots of hop enough she added four hundred thirty And the ale began she brewing And the beer began its working In the new tubs that contained it And within the tubs of birch wood Twas for months the stones were glowing And for summers water boiling Trees were burning on the islands Water from the wells was carried Bare of trees they left the islands And the lakes were greatly shrunken four hundred forty For the ale was in the barrels And the beer was stored securely For the mighty feast of Pohja For carousing at the mansion From the island smoke was rising On the headland fire was glowing Thick the clouds of smoke were rising In the air there rose the vapour For the fire was burning fiercely And the fire was brightly glowing four hundred fifty Half it filled the land of Pohja Over all Carelia spreading All the people gazed upon it Gazed and then they asked each other Wherefore is the smoke arising In the air the vapour rising Tis too small for smoke of battle Tis too large for herdsman s bonfire Then rose Lemminkainen s mother At the earliest dawn of morning four hundred sixty And she went to fetch some water Clouds of smoke she saw arising Up from Pohjola s dominions And she spoke the words which follow Perhaps it is the smoke of combat Perhaps it is the fire of battle Ahti dweller on the island He the handsome Kaukomieli Wandered round and gazed about him And he pondered and reflected four hundred seventy I must go and look upon it From a nearer spot examine Whence the smoke is thus ascending Filling all the air with vapour If it be the smoke of combat If it be the fire of battle Kauko went to gaze about him And to learn whence smoke was rising But it was not fire of battle Neither was it fire of combat four hundred eighty But twas fire where ale was brewing Likewise where the beer was brewing Near where Sound of Sariola spreads Out upon the jutting headland Then did Kauko gaze around him And one eye he rolled obliquely And he squinted with the other And his mouth he pursed up slowly And at last he spoke while gazing And across the sound he shouted four

waves were breaking On the strand no shingle rattling Twas my son in law s assemblage Twice a hundred men in number How shall I detect the bridegroom In the concourse of the people He is known among

dimensions In this very lowly cottage In this wretched house of firwood In this house of pine constructed O my little waiting maiden Thou the village maid I hired Bring a piece of lighted birchbark To a tarry torch apply it one hundred ninety That I may behold the bridegroom And the bridegroom s eyes examine Whether they are blue or reddish Whether they are white as linen Then the little waiting maiden She the little village maiden Brought a piece of lighted birchbark To a tarry torch applied it From the bark the flame springs spluttering From the tar black smoke s ascending two hundred So his eyes might perhaps be sooted And his handsome face be blackened Therefore bring a torch all flaming Of the whitest wax constructed Then the little waiting maiden She the little village maiden Lit

Vainamoinen First and oldest of the singers He the minstrel most illustrious He the greatest of the Sages two hundred sixty First of all the ale he lifted Then he spoke the words which follow O thou ale thou drink delicious Let the drinkers not be moody Urge the people on to singing Let them shout with mouth all golden Till our lords shall wonder at it And our ladies ponder o er it For the songs already falter And the joyous tongues are silenced two hundred seventy When the ale is ill concocted And bad drink is set before us Then the minstrels fail in singing And the best of songs they sing not And our cherished guests are silent And the cuckoos call no longer Therefore who shall chant unto us And whose tongue shall sing unto us At the wedding feast of Pohja This carouse at Sariola held two hundred eighty Benches will not sing unto us Save when people sit upon them Nor will floors hold cheerful converse Save when people walk upon them Neither are the windows joyful If the lords should gaze not from them Nor resound the table s edges If men sit not round the tables Neither do the smoke holes echo If men sit not neath the smoke holes two hundred ninety On the floor a child was sitting On the stove bench sat a milkbeard From the floor exclaimed the infant And the boy spoke from the stove bench I am not in years a father Undeveloped yet my body But however small I may be If

children sing befits not Nor these feeble folk should carol three hundred ten Children s songs are only falsehoods And the songs of girls are foolish Let the wisest sing among us Who upon the bench is seated Then the aged Vainamoinen Answered in the words which follow Are there any who are youthful Of the noblest of the people Who will clasp their hands together Hook their hands in one another three hundred twenty And begin to speak unto us Swaying back and forth in singing That the day may be more joyful And the evening be more blessed From the stove there spoke the old man Never was it heard among us Never heard or seen among us Nor so long as time existed That there lived a better minstrel One more skilled in all enchantment three hundred thirty Than myself when I was warbling As a child when I was singing Singing sweetly by the water Making all the heath re echo Chanting loudly in the firwood Talking likewise In the forest Then my voice was loud and tuneful And its tones were most melodious Like the flowing of a river Or the murmur of a streamlet three hundred forty Gliding as o er snow the snowshoes Like a yacht across the billows But tis hard for me to tell you How my wisdom has departed How my voice so strong has failed me And its sweetness has departed Now it flows no more like river Rising like the tossing billows But it halts like rake in stubble Like the hoe among the pine roots three hundred fifty Like a sledge in sand embedded Or a boat on rocks when stranded Then the aged Vainamoinen In such words as these expressed him If no other bard comes forward To accompany my singing Then alone my songs I ll carol And will now commence my singing For to sing was I created As an orator was fashioned three hundred sixty How I ask not in the village Nor I learn my songs from strangers Then the aged Vainamoinen Of the song the lifelong pillar Set him to the pleasant labour Girt him for the toil of singing Loud he sang his songs so pleasing Loud he spoke his words of wisdom Sang the aged Vainamoinen Sang by turns and spoke his wisdom three hundred seventy Nor did words that suited fall him Neither were his songs exhausted Sooner stones in rocks were missing Or a pond lacked water lilies Therefore thus sang Vainamoinen Through the evening for their pleasure And the women all were laughing And the men in high good humour While they listened and they wondered At the chants of Vainamoinen three hundred eighty For amazement filled the hearers Wonder those who heard him singing Said the aged Vainamoinen When at length his song he ended This is what I have accomplished As a singer and magician Little can I thus accomplish And my efforts lead me nowhere But If sang the great Creator Speaking with his mouth of sweetness three hundred ninety He would sing his songs unto you As a singer and magician He would sing the sea to honey And to peas would sing the gravel And to malt would sing the seasand And to salt would sing the gravel Forest broad would sing to cornland And the wastes would sing to wheatfields Into cakes would sing the mountains And to hens eggs change the mountains four hundred As a singer and magician He would speak and he would order And would sing unto this homestead Cowsheds ever filled with cattle Lanes o erfilled with beauteous blossoms And the plains o erfilled with milch kine Full a hundred horned cattle And with udders full a thousand As a singer and magician He would speak and he would order four hundred ten For our host a coat of lynxskin For our mistress cloth wrought dresses For her daughters boots with laces And her sons with red shirts furnish Grant O Jumala thy blessing Evermore O great Creator Unto those we see around us And again in all their doings Here at Pohjola s great banquet This carouse at Sariola held four hundred twenty That the ale may stream in rivers And the mead may flow in torrents Here in Pohjola s great household In the halls at Sariola built That by day we may be

there from here thou lieutenant find it In another house tis different one hundred Other tunes the horns are blowing Other doors thou hearest jarring Other gates thou hearest creaking Other voices at

their hearts the trouble Such as I unhappy carry Blackest trouble rests upon me one hundred seventy Black as coal my heart within me Coal black trouble weighs upon me Such the feelings of the blessed

bottom And thy pleasant meadow bartered For a dreary waste of heathland two hundred ninety And thy hills of berries bartered For the hard stumps of a clearing Didst thou think O youthful maiden Think O dove full fledged at present Care would end and toil be lessened With the party of this evening When to rest thou shalt betake thee And to sleep thou art conducted But to rest they will not lead thee Nor to sleep will they conduct thee three hundred Nought awaits thee now but watching Nought awaits thee now save trouble Heavy thoughts will come upon thee Saddened thoughts will overwhelm thee

way to sorrow Let not gloomy thoughts oppress thee Do not O ye noble people Do not speak to me in thiswise Far more troubles weigh upon me Than in a cascade are pebbles four hundred forty Than in swampy ground the willows Or the heath upon the marshland Never can a horse pull forward And a shod horse struggle onward And the sledge sway not behind him And the collar shall not tremble Even thus I feel my trouble And oppressed by dark forebodings From the floor there sang an infant From the hearth a growing infant four hundred fifty Wherefore dost thou weep O maiden Yielding to such grievous

seekest Follow not thy husband s notions As was done by me unhappy Larks have tongues and husbands notions But a lover s heart is greater five hundred I was as a flower that flourished As a wild rose in the thicket And I grew as grows a sapling Grew into a slender maiden I was beauteous as a berry Rustling in its golden beauty In my father s yard a duckling On my mother s floor a gosling Water bird unto my brother And a goldfinch to my sister five hundred ten Flowerlike walked I on the pathway As upon the plain the raspberry Skipping on the sandy lakeshore Dancing on the flower clad hillocks Singing loud in every valley Carolling on every hill top Sporting in the leafy forests In the charming woods rejoicing As the trap the fox mouth seizes And the tongue entraps the ermine five hundred twenty Towards a man inclines a maiden And the ways of other households So created is the maiden That the daughter s inclination Leads her married as step daughter As the slave of husband s mother As a berry grows in marshland And in other waters cherry Like a cranberry sought I sorrow Like a strawberry exhortation five hundred thirty Every tree appeared to bite me Every alder seemed to tear me Every birch appeared to scold me Every aspen to devour me As my husband s bride they brought me To my mother in law they led me Here there were as they had told me Waiting for the wedded maiden Six large rooms of pine constructed And of bedrooms twice as many five hundred forty Barns along the forest borders By the roadside flowery gardens By the ditches fields of barley And along the heaths were oatfields Chests of corn threshed out already Other chests awaiting threshing Hundred coins received already And a hundred more expected Foolishly had I gone thither Recklessly my hand had given five hundred fifty For six props the house supported Seven small poles the house supported And the woods were filled with harshness And with lovelessness the forests By the roadsides dreary deserts In the woodlands thoughts of evil Chests containing spoilt provisions Other chests beside them spoiling And a hundred words reproachful And a hundred more to look for five hundred sixty But I let it not distress me Hoping there to live in quiet Wishing there to dwell in honour And a peaceful life to live there But when first the room I entered Over chips of wood I stumbled On the door I knocked my forehead And my head against the doorposts At the door were eyes of strangers Darksome eyes were at the entrance five hundred seventy Squinting eyes in midst of chamber In the background eyes most evil From the mouths the fire was flashing From beneath the tongues shot firebrands From the old man s mouth malicious From beneath his tongue unfriendly But I let it not distress me In the house I dwelt unheeding Hoping still to live in favour And I bore myself with meekness five hundred eighty And with legs of hare went skipping With the step of ermine hurried Very late to rest retired Very early rose to suffering But unhappy won no honour Mildness brought me only sorrow Had I tossed away the torrents Or the rocks in twain had cloven Vainly did I grind coarse flour And with pain I crushed its hardness five hundred ninety That my mother in law should eat it And her ravenous throat devour it At the table end while sitting From a dish with golden borders But I ate unhappy daughter Flour scraped up to handmill cleaving With my ladle from the hearthstone With my spoon from off the pestle Oft I brought O me unhappy I the son s wife to his dwelling six hundred Mosses from the

pitchfork Even as a labourer toiling Even as a hired servant And my mother in law for ever Evermore for me selected Worst of all the flails for threshing Heaviest mallet from the bathroom six hundred twenty From the beach the heaviest mallet In the stall the largest pitchfork Never did they think me weary Nor my weakness e er considered Though my work had wearied heroes Or the strength of foals exhausted Thus did I a girl unhappy Work at proper time for working And my shoulders stooped with weakness And at other times they ordered six hundred thirty That the fire should now be kindled With my hands that I should stir it To their hearts desire they scolded With their tongues they heaped reproaches On my spotless reputation On my character though stainless Evil words they heaped upon me And abuse they showered upon me Like the sparks from furious fire Or a very hail of iron six hundred forty Until then despaired I never And had spent my life as erstwhile There to aid the harsh old woman To her fiery tongue submitting But twas this that brought me evil This that caused me greatest anguish When to wolf was changed my husband To a growling bear converted Turned his side to me when eating Turned his back asleep or working six hundred fifty I myself broke out in weeping And I pondered in the storehouse And my former life remembering And my life in former seasons In the homestead of my father In my sweetest mother s dwelling Then in words I spoke my feelings And I spoke the words which follow Well indeed my dearest mother Understood to rear her apple six hundred sixty And the tender shoot to cherish But she knew not where to plant it For the tender shoot is planted In a very evil station In a very bad position Mid the hard roots of a birch tree There to weep while life remaineth And to spend the months lamenting Surely surely I am worthy Of a home than this much better six hundred seventy Worthy of a larger homestead And a floor more wide extended Worthy of a better partner And a husband far more handsome With a birchbark shoe I m fitted With a slipshod shoe of birchbark Like a very crow s his body With a beak like any raven And his mouth like wolf s is greedy And his form a bear resembles six hundred eighty Such a one I might have found me If I d wandered to the mountains Picked from off the road a pine stump From the wood a stump of alder For his face the turf resembles And his beard the moss from tree trunks Head of clay and mouth all stony And his eyes like coals of fire Knobs of birch his ears resemble And his legs are forking willows six hundred ninety While my song I thus was singing Sighing in my grievous trouble He my husband chanced to hear it At the wall as he was standing When I heard him then approaching At the storehouse gate when standing I was conscious of his coming For I recognized his footstep And his hair in wind was tossing And his hair was all disordered seven hundred And his gums with rage were grinning And his eyes with fury staring In his hand a stick of cherry Neath his arm a club he carried And he hurried to attack me And upon the head he struck me When the evening came thereafter And there came the time for sleeping At his side a rod he carried Took from nail a whip of leather seven hundred ten Not designed to flay another But alas for me unhappy Then when I myself retired To my resting place at evening By my husband s side I stretched me By my side my husband rested When he seized me by the elbows With his wicked hands he grasped me And with willow rods he beat me And the haft of bone of walrus seven hundred twenty From his cold side then I raised me And I left the bed of coldness But behind me ran my husband From the door came wildly rushing In my hair his hands he twisted Grasping it in all his fury In the wind my hair he scattered To the winds of spring abandoned What advice should now be followed Where had I to look for counsel seven hundred thirty Shoes of steel I put upon me Bands of copper put upon me As I stood beyond the house wall In the street for long I listened Till the wretch should calm his fury And his passion had subsided But his anger never slumbered Neither for a time abated At the last the cold o ercame me In my hiding place so dismal seven hundred forty Where I stood beyond the house wall And without the door I waited And I pondered and reflected This I cannot bear for ever Nor can bear their hatred longer Longer can I not endure it In this dreadful house of Lempo In this lair of evil demons From the handsome house I turned me And my pleasant home abandoned seven hundred fifty And commenced my weary wanderings Through the swamps and through the lowlands Past the open sheets of water Past the cornfields of my brother There the dry pines all were rustling And the crowns of fir trees singing All the crows were croaking loudly And the magpies all were chattering Here for thee no home remaineth In the house thy birth which witnessed seven hundred sixty But I let it not distress me As I neared my brother s homestead But the gates themselves addressed me And the cornfields all lamented Wherefore hast thou thus come homeward What sad news to hear O wretched Long ago has died thy father Perished has thy sweetest mother All estranged is now thy brother And his wife is like a Russian seven hundred seventy But I let it not distress me And at once the house I entered At the door I grasped the handle Cold within my hand I felt it After when the room I entered In the doorway I was standing And the mistress stood there proudly But she did not come to meet me Nor to me her hand she offered I myself was proud as she was seven hundred eighty And I would not go to meet her And my hand I would not offer On the stove my hand I rested Cold I felt the very hearthstones To the burning coals I reached it In the stove the coals were frozen On the bench there lay my brother Lazy on the bench extended On his shoulders soot by fathoms And by spans upon his body seven hundred ninety On his head glowed coals a yard high And of hard caked soot a quartful Asked my brother of the stranger Of the guest he thus inquired Stranger why hast crossed the water And on this I gave him answer Dost thou then not know thy sister Once the daughter of thy mother We are children of one mother Of one bird are we the nestlings eight hundred By one goose have we been nurtured In one grouse s nest been fostered Then my brother broke out weeping From his eyes the tears were falling To his wife then said my brother And he whispered to his darling Bring some food to give my sister But with mocking eyes she brought me Cabbage stalks from out the kitchen Whence the whelp the fat had eaten eight hundred ten And the dog had licked the salt from And the black dog had his meal of To his wife then said my brother And he whispered to his darling Fetch some ale to give the stranger But with mocking eyes she carried Water only for the stranger But instead of drinking water Water she had washed her face in And her sister washed her hands in eight hundred twenty From my brother s house I wandered Left the house that I was born in Hurried forth O me unhappy Wandered on O me unhappy Wretched on the shores to wander Toiling on for ever wretched Always to the doors of strangers Always to the gates of strangers On the beach with poorest children Sufferers of the village poorhouse eight hundred thirty There were many of the people Many were there who abused me And with evil words attacked me And with sharpest words repulsed me Few there are among the people Who have spoken to me kindly And with kindly words received me And before the stove who led me When I came from out the rainstorm Or from out the cold came shrinking eight hundred forty With my dress with rime all covered While the snow my fur cloak covered In my youthful days I never I could never have believed it Though a hundred told me of it And a thousand tongues repeated Such distress should

bought her Every sort of fish I bought her Bought her all sorts of provisions Home brewed ale the best I bought her Likewise wheat from foreign countries But she let it not content her Nor did it improve her temper two hundred eighty For one day the room she entered And she grasped my hair and tore it And her face was quite distorted And her eyes were wildly rolling Always scolding in her fury To her heart s contentment scolding Heaping foul abuse upon me Roaring at me as a sluggard But I knew another method Knew another way to tame her two hundred ninety So I peeled myself a birch shoot When she came and called me birdie But when juniper I gathered Then she stooped and called me darling When I lifted rods of willow On my neck she fell embracing Now the hapless girl was sighing Sighing much and sobbing sadly Presently she broke out weeping And she spoke the words which follow three hundred Soon most now depart the others And the time is fast approaching But my own departure

sparkling waters Leave the sandy shore behind me three hundred seventy Where the village women bathe them And the shepherd boys are splashing I must leave the quaking marshes And the wide extending lowlands And the peaceful alder thickets And the tramping through the heather And the strolling past the hedgerows And the loitering on the pathways And my dancing through the farmyards And my standing by the house walls three hundred eighty And the cleaning of the planking And the scrubbing of the flooring Leave the fields where leap the reindeer And the woods where run the lynxes And the wastes where flock the wild geese And the woods where birds are perching Now indeed I am departing All the rest I leave behind me In the folds of nights of autumn On the thin ice of the springtime three hundred ninety On the ice I leave no traces On the slippery ice no footprints From my dress no thread upon it Nor in snow my skirt s impression If I should return in future And again my home revisit Mother hears my voice no longer Nor my father heeds my weeping Though I m sobbing in the corner Or above their heads am speaking four hundred For the young grass springs already And the juniper is sprouting O er the sweet face of my mother And the cheeks of her who bore me If I should return in future To the wide extended homestead I shall be no more remembered Only by two little objects At the lowest hedge are hedge bands At the furthest field are hedge stakes four hundred ten These I fixed when I was little As a girl with twigs I bound them But my mother s barren heifer Unto which I carried water And which as a calf I tended She will low to greet my coming From the dunghill of the farmyard Or the wintry fields around it She will know me when returning As the daughter of the household four hundred twenty Then my father s splendid stallion Which I fed when I was little Which as girl I often foddered He will neigh to greet my coming From the dunghill of the farmyard Or

the coursers And he spoke the words which follow Now farewell to all the lakeshores Shores of lakes and slopes of meadows All the pine trees on the hill sides And the tall trees in the firwoods four hundred seventy And behind the house the alders And the junipers by well sides In the plains all berry bushes Berry bushes stalks of grasses Willow bushes stumps of fir trees Alder leaves and bark of birch trees Thus at length smith Ilmarinen Forth from Pohjola departed With the children farewells singing And they sang the words which follow four hundred eighty Hither flew a bird of blackness Through the wood he speeded swiftly Well he knew to lure our duckling And entice from us our berry And he took from us our apple Drew the fish from out the water Lured her with a little money And enticed her with his silver Who will fetch us now the water Who will take us to the river four hundred ninety Now remain the buckets standing And the yoke is idly rattling And the floor unswept

journey From the magic coast of Pohja five hundred By the shore of Sound of Sima On he drove across the sandhills Shingle crashed and sand was shaking Swayed the sledge the pathway rattled Loudly rang the iron runners And the frame of birch resounded And the curving laths were rattling Shaking was the cherry collar And the whiplash whistling loudly And the rings of copper shaking five hundred ten As the noble horse sprang forward As the White front galloped onward Drove the smith one day a second Driving likewise on the third day With one hand the horse he guided And with one embraced the damsel One foot on the sledge side rested Underneath the rug the other Quick they sped and fast they journeyed And at length upon the third day five hundred twenty Just about the time of sunset Hove in sight the smith s fair dwelling And they came to Ilma s homestead And the smoke in streaks ascended And the smoke rose thickly upward From the house in wreaths arising Up amid the clouds ascending

children s feet were freezing By the wall as they were standing ten Mid aged folks their shoes were spoiling As upon the beach they wandered And at length upon a morning Just about the time of sunrise From the wood they heard a rattling As the sledge came rushing onward Lokka then the kindest hostess Kaleva s most handsome matron Uttered then the words which follow Tis my son s sledge now approaching twenty As from Pohjola he cometh And he brings the youthful damsel Straight he journeys to this country To the homestead hastens onward To the house his father gave him Which his parents had constructed Therefore thus did Ilmarinen Hasten forward to the homestead To the house his father gave him Which his parents had constructed thirty Hazel grouse were twittering blithely On the collar formed of saplings And the cuckoos all were calling On the sledge s sides while sitting And the squirrels leaped and frolicked On the shafts of maple fashioned Lokka then the kindest hostess Kaleva s most beauteous matron Uttered then the words which follow And in words like these expressed her forty For the new moon waits the village And the young await the sunrise Children search where grow the berries And the water waits the tarred boat For no half moon have I waited Nor the sun have I awaited But I waited for my brother For my brother and step daughter Gazed at morning gazed at evening Knew not what had happened to them fifty If a child he had been rearing Or a lean one he had fattened That he came not any sooner Though he faithfully had promised Soon to turn his footsteps homeward Ere defaced had been his footprints Ever gazed I forth at morning And throughout the day I pondered If my brother was not coming Nor his sledge was speeding onward sixty Swiftly to this little homestead To this very narrow dwelling Though the horse were but a straw one And the sledge were but two runners Yet a sledge I still would call it And a sledge would still esteem it If it homeward brought my brother And another fair one with him Thus throughout my life I wished it This throughout the day I looked for seventy Till my head bowed down with gazing And my hair bulged up in ridges And my bright eyes were contracted Hoping for my brother s coming Swiftly to this little household To this very narrow dwelling And at length my son is coming And in truth is coming swiftly

his songs for ever Sang and chanted spells of magic Sang a song and sang a second But as he the third was singing six hundred eighty Clashed against a rock the runners Crashed the shafts against a tree stump And the sledge broke off his chanting And the runners stopped his singing And the shafts in fragments shattered And the boards broke all asunder Spoke the aged Vainamoinen In the very words

again to Tuoni s country Journeyed to the home of Mana Fetched from Tuonela the auger Brought from Mana s home the auger Then the aged Vainamoinen Sang a blue wood up before him In the forest rose an oak tree And a splendid mountain ashtree seven hundred twenty And from these a sledge he fashioned And he shaped his runners from them And for shafts prepared them likewise And the frame he thus constructed Made a sledge to suit his purpose And a new sledge he constructed In the shafts the horse he harnessed Yoked before the sledge the chestnut In the sledge himself he seated And upon the

called brothers RUNO IV four Bath whisks are used to heighten the circulation after bathing The leaves are left on the stems The bath whisks for the winter are all made early in the summer when the leaves are softest Of course they become quite dry but before using they are steeped in hot water till they become soft and fragrant A M seventy five The storehouses where the peasant girls keep their clothes and ornaments are sometimes very pretty and the girls always sleep there in summer There are other storehouses for food A M one hundred twenty one According to Speke Central African women are compelled to drink large quantities of milk to make them inordinately fat which is considered a great beauty two hundred six Fuligala glacialis two hundred ninety five Prof Krohn thinks the sea and not a lake is here intended three hundred eight This passage is hardly intelligible I have heard some people suggest that Aino perhaps took a birch branch to be used as a bath whisk A M three hundred seventy seven There are many popular tales in Finnish relating to animals especially the bear wolf and fox but this is the only illustration of the true beast epos in the Kalevala four hundred thirteen The sauna or bath house is always a separate building and there Finnish people take extremely hot baths almost every evening A M It is also used for confinements RUNO V two hundred twenty Here a human mother rather than Ilmatar seems to be ascribed to Vainamoinen Visits to parents graves for advice and assistance are common in Scandinavian and Esthonian literature Commentators have also quoted the story of Achilles and Thetis but this is hardly a parallel case RUNO VI one hundred twenty This passage is again inconsistent with the legend of Vainamoinen being the son of Ilmatar RUNO VII nineteen The word used here is poika which literally means a boy or a son fifty one fifty two The original admirably expresses the hovering motion of the bird Lenteleikse liiteleikse Katseleikse kaanteleikse one hundred forty two In the original the song of a cock s child one hundred seventy seven one hundred seventy eight Weeping appears no more disgraceful to the heroes of the Kalevala than to those of the Iliad Still Vainamoinen not unfrequently plays a very undignified part when in difficulties two hundred forty one Louhi recognized him though he would not mention his name two hundred eighty six Virsu is a shoe made of birch bark A M three hundred eleven It appears that the magic mill called a Sampo could only be forged by a competent smith from materials which Louhi alone possessed and which perhaps she could not again procure Otherwise Ilmarinen could have forged another for himself and it would have been unnecessary for the heroes to steal it The chain forged by the dwarfs according to the Prose Edda for binding the wolf Fenrir was also composed of materials which could not again be procured It was fashioned out of six things to wit the noise made by the footfall of a cat the beards of women the roots of stones the sinews of bears the breath of fish and the spittle of birds RUNO VIII three four The daughter of Louhi is never mentioned again in connection with the rainbow and it is quite incorrect to call her the Maiden of the Rainbow as some writers have done for no such title is ever applied to her in the poem thirty five There are so many instances of maidens being carried off or enticed into sledges in the Kalevala that it seems almost to have been a recognized legal form of marriage by capture fifty seven Finnish magicians profess to understand the language of birds but the passage in the text is probably intended only in jest one hundred fifty two In the Icelandic saga of Grettir the hero mortally wounds himself in the leg while trying to chop up a piece of driftwood on which a witch had laid her curse one hundred seventy nine The Finns supposed that if the origin of any hostile agent was known and could be recited to it its power for evil was at an end In Denmark the naming of any person or thing was an evil omen and liable to bring about its destruction two hundred seventeen two hundred eighteen Finnish hamlets are sometimes built on a hillside in the manner described RUNO IX thirty five thirty six Here we seem to have an allusion to the first chapter of Genesis forty four The same epithet Luonnotar is sometimes applied to Ilmatar and thus Vainamoinen might literally be called the brother of Iron one hundred eleven one hundred twelve Pallas Athene sprang armed from the brain of Zeus Karna in India the son of the Sun was born with armour and earrings and Mexitli in Mexico was born with a spear in his hand two hundred thirty one Hornets often build their nests under the eaves of houses two hundred forty two Both frogs and toads exude a more or less poisonous secretion from the skin four hundred thirty three Honeydew seems to be meant here five hundred twenty five five hundred twenty six An imaginary mountain to which the sorcerers professed to be able to banish pain and sickness RUNO X three hundred six Compare the account of the forging of the Gold and Silver Bride in Runo XXXVII three hundred eleven Ilmarinen first employs ordinary servants and then calls the winds to his assistance K K three hundred thirty one In the Icelandic sagas we read of the sword Tyrfing forged by dwarfs which if ever drawn could not again be sheathed till it had slain at least one victim three hundred thirty two Literally on best days four hundred fourteen In the story of Ala Ed Deen Abush Shamat in the ten oh one Nights we read of a magic bead with five facets on which were engraved a camel an armed horseman a pavilion a couch et cetera according to the use intended to be made of each facet RUNO XI thirty one forty two Salme and Linda are similarly wooed by the Sun the Moon and a Star in the Esthonian poem Kalevipoeg see Kirby s Hero of Esthonia I pp ten fifteen two hundred sixty four two hundred sixty six These names mean respectively Blackies Strawberries Cranberries I think Lemminkainen means that he has no cows and only calls these different berries his cows A M three hundred six Lemminkainen appears to have been afraid that some one else might carry off his wife if she showed herself in public especially Untamo says Prof Krohn three hundred eighty five The Snow Bunting Plectrophanes nivalis a white bird more or less varied with black RUNO XII twenty five The meaning is a little uncertain Literally the only boy as Madame Malmberg suggests The commentary renders it the gallant youth ninety three The Finns and Lapps often hide money in the ground The word used in l ninety four is penningin from penni a word common to most Teutonic and Northern languages two hundred eleven two hundred twelve Such omens of death are common in fairy tales as for instance the bleeding knives in the story of the Envious Sisters in the ten oh one Nights The bleeding trees in mediaeval romance belong to rather a different category of ideas two hundred thirty three Lemminkainen seems to have hidden himself to escape further remonstrances from his mother and Kyllikki two hundred sixty two Probably a creature like a kelpie or Phooka four hundred seventy four We are not told how Louhi escaped but she seems to have come to no harm RUNO XIII one hundred five The part played by Hiisi in the Kalevala usually resembles that played by Loki in the Scandinavian Mythology one hundred nine Animals et cetera are often thus constructed in Finnish Esthonian and Siberian mythology by gods demons and magicians They do not seem able to create from nothing but to manufacture what they please or what they can from pre existing materials however incongruous one hundred eleven I suppose rushes are here intended RUNO XIV thirty three The word here translated islands properly means a wooded hill surrounded by marshland forty seven forty eight Mielikki s gold and silver are the spoils of the chase sixty nine Honey is sometimes used in the Kalevala for anything sweet and agreeable just as golden is used for anything beautiful one hundred three one hundred four It appears that the hunter s fortune in the chase was foretold by the rich or shabby garments worn by the forest deities one hundred forty two Finnish women often wear a blouse over their other garments two hundred sixteen Kuningas king is a Teutonic word which rarely occurs in the Kalevala The heroes are patriarchs or chiefs of clans not kings as in Homer two hundred forty eight There is often much confusion of terms in the Kalevala The creature here mentioned is generally called an elk but often a reindeer and in this line a camel foal three hundred four When the inferior deities are deaf or too weak the heroes appeal to the higher Gods three hundred five The reference here seems to be to general vii eleven The whole passage is of Christian origin K K RUNO XV seven Compare Homer Iliad III three hundred eleven three hundred fourteen two hundred forty This episode slightly resembles the story of Isis and Osiris four hundred ninety eight The constellation of Orion is variously called by the Finns the Moonshine the Sword of Kaleva and the Scythe of Vainamoinen five hundred fifty nine five hundred sixty two This conceit is common in fairy tales especially in Russian ones in the case of heroes wakened from the dead Sometimes it takes a comic form and sometimes as in the present case a pathetic one six hundred seventeen Dirty nosed is a common opprobrious expression in Esthonia RUNO XVI twenty seven The account of the boat building in Hiawatha s Sailing is evidently imitated from this passage one hundred twenty eight In Roman times divination from birds was chiefly taken from their flight or feeding RUNO XVII twenty Roads of this description are thoroughly Oriental in character eighty six In Icelandic sagas we often find heroes roused from their graves but this is usually attempted in order to obtain a sword which has been buried with them ninety three one hundred four Hiawatha was also swallowed by the sturgeon Nahma but the circumstances were quite different two hundred eleven Note the resonance of the line Kuusista kuhisevista two hundred thirty seven Ahava a dry cold wind that blows in March and April probably corresponding to our cold spring east wind two hundred eighty five two hundred eighty six Vipunen here refers to himself as a little man which I presume is to be understood figuratively as I have rendered it RUNO XVIII three hundred seventy nine Compare Cuchullain s wooing of Eimer in Irish story RUNO XIX thirty three This episode is very like the story of Jason and Medea two hundred ten The wolf Fenrir opens his enormous mouth the lower jaw reaches to the earth and the upper one to heaven and would in fact reach still further were there space to admit of it Prose Edda two hundred seventeen Vetehinen a water spirit three hundred eleven Ukko s bow here means the rainbow broken by the fiery eagle It may be worth noting that in the Scandinavian Mythology the sons of Fire Muspell are to ride over the rainbow and break it to pieces on their way to battle with the gods four hundred eighty three In the Danish Ballads there are several stories of children speaking in their cradles but generally to vow vengeance against an enemy RUNO XX seventeen The Great Ox is a stock subject in Finnish and Esthonian ballad literature RUNO XXI one hundred sixty one The Glutton or wolverine a well known animal in sub Arctic Europe Asia and America one hundred eighty two one hundred eighty six These civilities sound very Oriental three hundred ninety three This curious passage may have been partly suggested by the coats of skin and the land flowing with milk and honey of the Old Testament RUNO XXII seventy six The word used here for father Is taatto which curiously recalls the Welsh tad English dad one hundred ninety four In the Scandinavian Mythology the giantess Skadi was required to choose a husband from among the gods by looking at their feet only RUNO XXIII three hundred thirty The usual word to express a long time is viikko a week four hundred sixty nine four hundred seventy These infernal damsels play various parts in the Kalevala as boat women death bringers et cetera and here we find them in the character of Furies four hundred eighty seven The term snowy month is used for the period between Feb twenty and March twenty I have rendered it March seven hundred eighty seven seven hundred ninety two Perhaps this is only figurative as in the case of the unpropitious forest deities RUNO XXIV one hundred nineteen The roots of the marsh arum Calla palustris not a British plant though naturalized in a pond at Ripley The most usual substitute for more wholesome food in times of famine is bread composed of a mixture of fir bark and rye two hundred forty Slav peasant women are said sometimes to regard beating as a sign of affection on the part of their husbands but this does not seem to be the case with the Finns In the Kalevala we read a good deal about wife beating in theory but find very little of it in practice and even the licentious and violent Lemminkainen never thinks of beating his wife when he quarrels with her two hundred seventy nine two hundred ninety six A similar story is told to the Princess by her confidante Olga in the Russian opera Rusalka water nymph Act III scene i And now I d better sing a little song As they passed in our street A man besought his wife Why don t you look pleasant You are my delight Darling Mashenka But the woman was obstinate And averted her little head Oh I don t want your caresses Nor your pretty speeches I m not very well And I ve got a headache But under a birch tree The man taught his wife Wait a bit my darling I ll beat that tune out of you In my own way Then the woman was sorry Bowed low as the waistband Don t frighten yourself dearest And do not be troubled I find myself better My headache has gone four hundred forty six four hundred fifty four hundred fifty four The commentary explains the word used here to mean wander round thee an alteration which I consider unnecessary except in the last line four hundred sixty seven From the sarcastic tone of this speech Ilmarinen seems to have been quite tired and disgusted with all the fuss in which most of our readers will probably sympathize with him RUNO XXV forty seven According to popular usage a son is ennobled by being called a brother ninety seven In some of the legends of Sigurd and Brynhilda Brynhilda is represented as lying asleep in a tower of glass encompassed by a circle of fire through which Sigurd had to ride to wake her In this story she is the prototype of the Sleeping Beauty one hundred fifty seven We often read in Russian folk tales of revolving huts supported on fowls legs one hundred fifty nine The favourite weapon of the Icelander Skarphedin the son of Njal was a bell which rang out shortly before any person was to be killed by it one hundred sixty nine In the dales of Yorkshire it used to be considered very inhospitable not to leave the door open at mealtimes two hundred eighty nine two hundred ninety Saxony and Viro are Germany and Esthonia five hundred sixty four Apparently a sort of master of the ceremonies at Finnish weddings corresponding to the Russian svat or matchmaker five hundred ninety six The scoter duck Oidemia nigra six hundred forty two Brows literally eyelashes six hundred forty six Her shift collar six hundred sixty five six hundred sixty six The beautiful Esthonian story of the Dawn the Moon and the Morning and Evening Twilight will be found in Jones and Kropf s Folk Tales of the Magyars pp three hundred twenty six
