none	none	retorted missus McGuire nettled in her turn I guess I ve known Dan l Burton as long as you have an as for his bein your master he can t call his soul his own when you re around an you know it But Susan with a disdainful sniff picked up her now empty clothes basket and marched into the house Down the road Keith had reached the turn and was climbing the hill that led to old mister Harrington s shabby cottage The boy s eyes were fixed straight ahead A squirrel whisked his tail alluringly from the bushes at the left and a robin twittered from a tree branch on the right But the boy neither saw nor heard and when before had Keith Burton failed to respond to a furred or feathered challenge like that To day there was an air of dogged determination about even the way he set one foot before the other He had the air of one who sees his goal ahead and cannot reach it soon enough Yet when Keith arrived at the sagging open gate before the Harrington cottage he stopped short as if the gate were closed and his next steps were slow and hesitant Walking on the grass at the edge of the path he made no sound as he approached the stoop on which sat an old man At the steps as at the gate Keith stopped and waited his gaze on the motionless figure in the rocking chair The old man sat with hands folded on his cane top his eyes apparently looking straight ahead Slowly the boy lifted his right arm and waved it soundlessly He lifted his left but there was no waving flourish Instead it fell impotently almost before it was lifted On the stoop the old man still sat motionless his eyes still gazing straight ahead Again the boy hesitated then with an elaborately careless air he shuffled his feet on the gravel walk and called cheerfully Hullo Uncle Joe Hullo Oh hullo It s Keith Burton ain t it The old head turned with the vague indecision of the newly blind and a trembling hand thrust itself aimlessly forward It IS Keith ain t it Oh yes sir I m Keith The boy with a quick look about him awkwardly shook the fluttering fingers Keith was not in the habit of shaking hands with people least of all with Uncle Joe Harrington He sat down then on the step at the old man s feet What did ye bring ter day my boy asked the man eagerly then with a quick change of manner he sighed but I m afraid I can t fix it anyhow Oh no sir you don t have to I didn t bring anything to be mended to day Unconsciously Keith had raised his voice He was speaking loudly and very politely The old man fell back in his chair He looked relieved yet disappointed Oh well that s all right then I m glad That is of course if I could have fixed it for you His sentence remained unfinished A profound gloom settled over his countenance But I didn t bring anything for you to fix reiterated the boy in a yet louder tone There there my boy you don t have to shout The old man shifted uneasily hi his seat I ain t deaf I m only I suppose you know Keith what s come to me in my old age Yes sir I I do The boy hitched a little nearer to the two ill shod feet on the floor near him And and I wanted to ask you Yours hurt a lot didn t they I mean your eyes they they ached didn t they before they they got blind He spoke eagerly almost hopefully The old man shook his head No not much I s pose I ought to be thankful I was spared that The boy wet his dry lips and swallowed But Uncle Joe most always I guess when when folks are going to be blind they they DO ache don t they Again the old man stirred restlessly I don t know I only know about myself But well anyhow it never comes till you re old real old does it Keith s voice vibrated with confidence this time Old I ain t so very old I m only seventy five bridled Harrington resentfully Besides anyhow the doctor said age didn t have nothin ter do with this kind of blindness It comes ter young folks real young folks sometimes Oh h The boy wet his lips and swallowed again a bit convulsively With eyes fearful and questioning he searched the old man s face Twice he opened his mouth as if to speak but each time he closed it again with the words left unsaid Then with a breathless rush very much like desperation he burst out But it s always an awful long time comin isn t it Blindness is It s years and years before it really gets here isn t it Hm m well I can t say I can only speak for myself Keith Yes sir I know sir and that s what I wanted to ask about you plunged on Keith feverishly When did you notice it first and what was it The old man drew a long sigh Why I don t know as I can tell exactly T was quite a spell comin on I know that and t wasn t much of anything at first T was just that I couldn t see ter read clear an distinct It was all sort of blurred Kind of run together Just above his breath Keith asked the question Yes that s it exactly An I thought somethin ailed my glasses an so I got some new ones An I thought at first maybe it helped But it didn t Then it got so that t wa n t only the printin ter books an papers that was blurred but ev rything a little ways off was in a fog like an I couldn t see anything real clear an distinct Oh but things other things don t look a mite foggy to me cried the boy Course they don t Why should they They didn t to me once retorted the man impatiently But now Again he left a sentence unfinished But how soon did did you get all blind after that stammered the boy breaking the long uncomfortable silence that had followed the old man s unfinished sentence Oh five or six months maybe more I don t know exactly I know it came that s all I guess if t was you it wouldn t make no difference HOW it came if it came boy N no of course not chattered Keith springing suddenly to his feet But I guess it isn t coming to me of course t isn t coming to me Well good bye Uncle Joe I got to go now Good bye He spoke fearlessly blithely and his chin was at a confident tilt He even whistled as he walked down the hill But in his heart in his heart Keith knew that beside him that very minute stalked that shadowy intangible creature that had dogged his footsteps ever since his fourteenth birthday gift from his father and he knew it now by name The Great Terror CHAPTER II DAD Keith s chin was still high and his gaze still straight ahead when he reached the foot of Harrington Hill Perhaps that explained why he did not see the two young misses on the fence by the side of the road until a derisively gleeful shout called his attention to their presence Well Keith Burton I should like to know if you re blind challenged a merry voice The boy turned with a start so violent that the girls giggled again gleefully Dear dear did we scare him We re so sorry The boy flushed painfully Keith did not like girls that is he SAID he did not like them They made him conscious of his hands and feet and stiffened his tongue so that it would not obey his will The prettier the girls were the more acute was his discomfiture Particularly therefore did he dislike these two girls they were the prettiest of the lot They were Mazie Sanborn and her friend Dorothy Parkman Mazie was the daughter of the town s richest manufacturer and Dorothy was her cousin from Chicago who made such long visits to her Eastern relatives that it seemed sometimes almost as if she were as much of a Hinsdale girl as was Mazie herself To day Mazie s blue eyes and Dorothy s brown ones were full of mischief Well why don t you say something Why don t you apologize demanded Mazie Pol pologize What for In his embarrassed misery Keith resorted to bravado in voice and manner Why for passing us by in that impertinent fashion returned Mazie loftily Do you think that is the way ladies should be treated Mazie was thirteen and Dorothy fourteen The idea For a minute Keith stared helplessly shifting from one foot to the other Then with an inarticulate grunt he turned away But Mazie was not to be so easily thwarted With a mere flit of her hand she tossed aside a score of years and became instantly nothing more than a wheedling little girl coaxing a playmate Aw Keithie don t get mad I was only fooling Say tell me HAVE you been up to Uncle Joe Harrington s Because Mazie had caught his arm and now held it tightly the boy perforce came to a stop Well what if I have he resorted to bravado again And is he blind honestly Mazie s voice became hushed and awestruck Uh huh The boy nodded his head with elaborate unconcern but he shifted his feet uneasily And he can t see a thing not a thing breathed Mazie Course he can t if he s blind Keith showed irritation now and pulled not too gently at the arm still held in Mazie s firm little fingers Blind Ugghh interposed Miss Dorothy shuddering visibly Oh how can you bear to look at him Keith Burton I couldn t A sudden wave of red surged over the boy s face The next instant it had receded leaving only a white strained terror Well he ain t to blame for it if he is blind is he chattered the boy a bit incoherently If you re blind you re blind and you can t help yourself And with a jerk he freed himself from Mazie s grasp and hurried down the road toward home But when he reached the bend of the road he turned and looked back The two girls had returned to their perch on the fence and were deeply absorbed in something one of them held in her hand And she said she couldn t bear to look at em if they were blind he whispered Then wheeling about he ran down the road as fast as he could Nor did he stop till he had entered his own gate Well Keith Burton I should like to know where you ve been cried the irate voice of Susan Betts from the doorway Oh just walking Why Because I ve been huntin and huntin for you But oh dear me You re worse n a flea 
6288_63105_000070_000000	train-clean-360	So what s the use 
none	none	of talkin You always say As you did to day I ve just been out a walkin But what did you want me for I didn t want you Your pa wanted you But then for that matter he s always wantin you Any time if you look at him real good an hard enough to get his attention he ll stare a minute an then say Where s Keith An when he gets to the other shore I suppose he ll do it all the more Oh no he won t not if it s talking poetry Father never talks poetry What makes you talk it so much Susan Nobody else does Susan laughed good humoredly Lan sakes child I don t know only I jest can t help it Why everything inside of me jest swings along to a regular tune kind of keeps time like It s always been so Why Keithie boy it s been my joy There you see jest like that I didn t know that was comin It jest jest came That s all I can make a rhyme most any time Oh of course most generally when I write real poems I have to sit down with a pencil an paper an write em out It s only the spontaneous combustion kind that comes all in a minute without predisposed thinkin Now run along to your pa child He wants you He s been frettin the last hour for you jest because he didn t know exactly where you was Goodness me I only hope I ll never have to live with him if anything happens to you The boy had crossed the room but with his hand on the door knob he turned sharply W what do you mean by that Susan Betts gave a despairing gesture Lan sakes child how you do hold a body up I meant what I said that I didn t want the job of livin with your pa if anything happened to you You know as well as I do that he thinks you re the very axle for the earth to whirl round on But there I don t know as I wonder jest you left so The boy abandoned his position at the door and came close to Susan Betts s side That s what I ve always wanted to know Other boys have brothers and sisters and a mother But I can t ever remember anybody only dad Wasn t there ever any one else Susan Betts drew a long sigh There were two brothers but they died before you was born Then there was your mother But I never knew her No child When they opened the door of Heaven to let you out she slipped in poor lamb An then you was all your father had left So of course he dotes on you Goodness me there ain t no end to the fine things he s goin ter have you be when you grow up Yes I know The boy caught his breath convulsively and turned away I guess I ll go to dad At the end of the hall upstairs was the studio Dad would probably be there Keith knew that Dad was always there when he wasn t sleeping or eating or out tramping through the woods He would be sitting before the easel now puttering over a picture as Susan called it Susan said he was a very insufficient uncapacious man but that was when she was angry or tried with him She never let any one else say such things about him Still dad WAS very different from other dads Keith had to acknowledge that to himself Other boys dads had offices and stores and shops and factories where they worked or else they were doctors or ministers and there was always money to get things with things that boys needed shoes and stockings and new clothes and candy and baseball bats and kites and jack knives Dad didn t have anything but a studio and there never seemed to be much money What there was was an annual Susan said whatever that was Anyway whatever it was it was too small and not nearly large enough to cover expenses Susan had an awful time to get enough to buy their food with sometimes She was always telling dad that she d GOT to have a little to buy eggs or butter or meat with And there were her wages dad was always behind on those And when the bills came in at the first of the month it was always awful then dad worried and frowning and unhappy and apologetic and explaining Susan cross and half crying Strange men not overpleasant looking ringing the doorbell peremptorily And never a place at all where a boy might feel comfortable to stay Dad was always talking then especially how he was sure he was going to sell THIS picture But he never sold it At least Keith never knew him to And after a while he would begin a new picture and be SURE he was going to sell THAT But not only was dad different from other boys dads but the house was different First it was very old and full of very old furniture and dishes Then blinds and windows and locks and doors were always getting out of order and they were apt to remain so for there was never any money to fix things with There was also a mortgage on the house That is Susan said there was and by the way she said it it would seem to be something not at all attractive or desirable Just what a mortgage was Keith did not exactly understand but for that matter quite probably Susan herself did not Susan always liked to use big words and some of them she did not always know the meaning of dad said To day in the hallway Keith stood a hesitant minute before his father s door Then slowly he pushed it open Did you want me dad he asked The man at the easel sprang to his feet He was a tall slender man with finely cut features and a pointed blond beard Susan had once described him as an awfully nice man to take care of but not worth a cent when it comes to takin care of you Yet there was every evidence of loving protection in the arm he threw around his boy just now Want you I always want you he cried affectionately Look Do you remember that moss we brought home
6288_63105_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 yesterday 
none	none	Well I ve got its twin now Triumphantly he pointed to the lower left hand corner of the picture on the easel where was a carefully blended mass of greens and browns Oh yes why so t is Keith had long since learned to see in his father s pictures what his father saw Say dad I wish t you d tell me about my little brothers Won t you please And Keith look do you recognize that little path It s the one we saw yesterday I m going to call this picture The Woodland Path and I think it s going to be about the very best thing I ever did Keith was not surprised that his question had been turned aside questions that his father did not like to answer were always turned aside Usually Keith submitted with what grace he could muster but to day he was in a persistent mood that would not be denied Dad WHY won t you tell me about my brothers Please what were their names and how old were they and why did they die Illustration Want you I always want you God knows why they died I don t The man s arm about the boy s shoulder tightened convulsively But how old were they Ned was seven and Jerry was four and they were the light of my eyes and But why do you make me tell you Isn t it enough Keith that they went one after the other not two days apart And then the sun went out and left the world gray and cold and cheerless for the next day your mother went And how about me dad The man did not seem to have heard Still with his arm about the boy s shoulder he had dropped back into the seat before the easel His eyes now were somberly fixed out the window Wasn t I anywhere dad With a start the man turned His arm tightened again His eyes grew moist and very tender Anywhere You re everywhere now my boy I m afraid at the first the very first I didn t like to see you very well perhaps because you were ALL there was left Then little by little I found you were looking at me with your mother s eyes and touching me with the fingers of Ned and Jerry And now why boy you re everything You re Ned and Jerry and your mother all in one my boy my boy Keith stirred restlessly A horrible tightness came to his throat yet there was a big lump that must be swallowed Er that that Woodland Path picture is going to be great dad great he said then in a very loud though slightly husky voice Come on let s From the hall Susan s voice interrupted chanting in a high pitched singsong Dinner s ready dinner s ready Hurry up or you ll be late Then you ll sure be cross and heady If there s nothin left to ate Keith gave a relieved whoop and bounded toward the door Never had Susan s dinner bell been a more welcome sound Surely at dinner his throat would have to loosen up and that lump could then be swallowed More slowly Keith s father rose from his chair How impossible Susan is he sighed I believe she grows worse every day Still I suppose I ought to be thankful she s good natured which that absurd doggerel of hers proves that she is However I should like to put a stop to it I declare I believe I will put a stop to it too I m going to insist on her announcing her meals in a proper manner Oh Susan he began resolutely as he flung open the dining room door Well sir Susan stood at attention her arms akimbo Susan I I insist that is I wish You was sayin she reminded him coldly as he came to a helpless pause Yes That is I was saying His eyes wavered and fell to the table Oh hash red flannel hash That s fine Susan But Susan was not to be cajoled Her eyes still regarded him coldly Yes sir hash We most generally does have beet hash after b iled dinner sir You was sayin Nothing Susan nothing I I ve changed my mind murmured the man hastily pulling out his chair Well Keith will you have some of Susan s nice hash Yes sir said Keith Susan said nothing But was there a quiet smile on her lips as she left the room If so neither the man nor the boy seemed to notice it As for the very obvious change of attitude on the part of the man Keith had witnessed a like phenomenon altogether too often to give it a second thought And as for the doggerel that had brought about the situation that also was too familiar to cause comment It had been years since Susan first called them to dinner with her poem but Keith could remember just how pleased she had been and how gayly she had repeated it over and over so as not to forget it Oh of course I know that ate ain t good etiquette in that place she had admitted at the time It should be eat But eat don t rhyme an ate does So I m goin to use it An I can anyhow It s poem license an that ll let you do anything Since then she had used the verse for every meal except when she was out of temper and by substituting breakfast or supper for dinner she had a call that was conveniently universal The fact that she used it ONLY when she was good natured constituted an unfailing barometer of the atmospheric condition of the kitchen and was really in a way no small convenience especially for little boys in quest of cookies or bread and jam As for the master of the house this was not the first time he had threatened an energetic warfare against that absurd doggerel which he had cordially abhorred from the very first neither would it probably be the last time that Susan s calm Well sir should send him into ignominious defeat before the battle was even begun And really after all was said and done there was still that one unfailing refuge for his discomforted recollection he could be thankful when he heard it that she was good natured and with Susan that was no small thing to be thankful for as everybody knew who knew Susan To day therefore the defeat was not so bitter as to take all the sweetness out of the red flannel hash and the frown on Daniel Burton s face was quite gone when Susan brought in the dessert Nor did it return that night even when Susan s shrill voice caroled through the hall Supper s ready supper s ready Hurry up or you ll be late Then you ll sure be cross and heady If there s nothin left to ate CHAPTER III FOR JERRY AND NED It was Susan Betts who discovered that Keith was not reading so much that summer An him with his nose always in a book before as she said one day to missus McGuire An he don t act natural somehow neither ter my way of thinkin Have YOU noticed anything Why no I don t know as I have answered missus McGuire from the other side of the fence except that he s always traipsin off to the woods with his father But then he s always done that more or less Indeed he has But always before he s lugged along a book sometimes two an now why he hain t even read the book his father give him on his birthday I know cause I asked him one day what t was about an he said he didn t know he hadn t read it Deary me Susan Well what if he hadn t I shouldn t fret about that My gracious Susan if you had four children same as I have instead of one I guess you wouldn t do no worryin jest because a boy didn t read a book Though as for my John he Susan lifted her chin I wasn t talkin about your children Mis McGuire she interrupted An I reckon nobody d do no worryin if they didn t read But Master Keith is a different supposition entirely He s very intelligible Master Keith is and so is his father before him Books is food to them real food Hain t you ever heard of folks devourin books Well they do it Of course I don t mean literaryly but metaphysically Oh land o love Susan Betts cried missus McGuire throwing up both hands and turning away scornfully Of course when you get to talkin like that NOBODY can say anything to you However in the world that poor mister Burton puts up with you I don t see I wouldn t not a day not a single day And by way of emphasis she entered her house and shut the door with a slam Susan Betts left alone shrugged her shoulders disdainfully Well nobody asked you sir she said she quoted under her breath and slammed her door also by way of emphasis Yet both Susan and missus McGuire knew very well that the next day would find them again in the usual friendly intercourse over the back yard fence Susan Betts was a neighbor s daughter She had lived all her life in the town and she knew everybody Just because she happened to work in Daniel Burton s kitchen was no reason to her mind why she should not be allowed to express her opinion freely on all occasions and on all subjects and to all persons Such being her conviction she conducted herself accordingly

none	none	always lived up to her convictions In the kitchen to day she found Keith Oh I say Susan I was looking for you Dad wants you What for I don t know but I GUESS it s because he wants to have something besides beans and codfish and fish hash to eat Anyhow he SAID he was going to speak to you about it Susan stiffened into inexorable sternness So he s goin ter speak ter me is he Well t will be mighty little good that ll do as
6288_63105_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 he ought to 
none	none	know very well Beefsteaks an roast fowls cost money Has he got the money for me Without waiting for an answer to her question she strode through the door leading to the dining room and shut it crisply behind her The boy did not follow her Alone in the kitchen he drummed idly on the window pane watching the first few drops of a shower that had been darkening the sky for an hour past After a minute he turned slowly and gazed with listless eyes about the kitchen On the table lay a folded newspaper After a moment s hesitation he crossed the room toward it He had the air of one impelled by some inner force against his will He picked the paper up but did not at once look at it In fact he looked anywhere but at it Then with a sudden jerk he faced it Shivering a little he held it nearer then farther away then nearer again Then with an inarticulate little cry he dropped the paper and hurried from the room No one knew better than Keith himself that he was not reading much this summer Not that he put it into words but he had a feeling that so long as he was not SEEING how blurred the printed words were he would not be sure that they were blurred Yet he knew that always whenever he saw a book or paper his fingers fairly tingled to pick it up and make sure Most of the time however Keith tried not to notice the books and papers Systematically he tried to forget that there were books and papers and he tried to forget the Great Terror Sometimes he persuaded himself that he was doing this He contrived to keep himself very busy that summer Almost every day when it did not rain he was off for a long walk with his father in the woods His father liked to walk in the woods Keith never had to urge him to do that And what good times they had except that Keith did wish that his father would not talk quite so much about what great things he Keith was going to do when he should have become a man and a great artist One day he ventured to remonstrate But dad maybe I I shan t be a great artist at all Maybe I shan t be even a little one Maybe I shall be just a a man Keith never forgot his father s answer nor his father s anguished face as he made that answer Keith I don t ever want you to let me hear you say that again I want you to KNOW that you re going to succeed And you will succeed God will not be so cruel as to deny me that I have failed You needn t shake your head boy and say Oh dad like that I know perfectly well what I m talking about I HAVE FAILED though it is not often that I ll admit it even to myself But when I heard you say to day Keith listen to me You ve got to succeed You ve got to succeed not only for yourself but for Jerry and Ned and for me All my hopes for Jerry and Ned and for myself are in you boy That s why in all our walks together and at home in the studio I m trying to teach you something that you will want to know by and by Keith never remonstrated with his father after that He felt worse than ever now when his father talked of what great things he was going to do but he knew that remonstrances would do no good but rather harm and he did not want to hear his father talk again as he had talked that day about Jerry and Ned and himself As if it were not bad enough under the best of conditions to have to be great and famous for one s two dead brothers and one s father while if one were blind But Keith refused to think of that He tried very hard also to absorb everything that his father endeavored to teach him He listened and watched and said yes sir and he did his best to make the chalks and charcoal that were put into his hands follow the copy set for him To be sure in this last undertaking his efforts were not always successful The lines wavered and blurred and were far from clear Still they were not half so bad as the print in books and if it should not get any worse Besides had he not always loved to draw cats and dogs and faces ever since he could hold a pencil And so with some measure of hope as to the results he was setting himself to be that great and famous artist that his father said he must be But it was not all work for Keith these summer days There were games and picnics and berry expeditions with the boys and girls all of which he hailed with delight one did not have to read or even study wavering lines and figures on picnics or berrying expeditions And that WAS a relief To be sure there was nearly always Mazie and if there was Mazie there was bound to be Dorothy And Dorothy had said Some way he could never see Dorothy without remembering what she did say on that day he had come home from Uncle Joe Harrington s Not that he exactly blamed her either For was not he himself acting as if he felt the same way and did not like to look at blind persons Else why did he so persistently keep away from Uncle Joe now Not once since that first day had he been up to see the poor old blind man And before why before he used to go several times a week CHAPTER IV SCHOOL And so the summer passed and September came And September brought a new problem school And school meant books Two days before school began Keith sought Susan Betts in the kitchen Say Susan that was awfully good johnny cake we had this morning Susan picked up another plate to dry and turned toward her visitor Her face was sternly grave though there was something very like a twinkle in her eye There ain t no cookies if that s what you re wantin she said Aw Susan I never said a word about cookies Then what is it you want It s plain to be seen there s something I ween My how easy you do make rhymes Susan What s that I ween mean Now Keith Burton this beatin the bush like this don t do one mite of good You might jest as well out with it first as last Now what is it you want Keith drew a long sigh Well Susan there IS something a little something only I meant what I said about the johnny cake and the rhymes truly I did Well Susan was smiling faintly Susan you know you can make dad do anything Susan began to stiffen and Keith hastened to disarm her No no truly This is the part I want You CAN make dad do anything and I want you to do it for me
6288_63111_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Do what 
none	none	Make him let me off from school any more Let you off from school In her stupefied amazement Susan actually forgot to pick up another plate from the dishpan Yes Tell him I m sick or t isn t good for me And truly t isn t good for me And truly I am quite a little sick Susan I don t feel well a bit There s a kind of sinking feeling in my stomach and But Susan had found her wits and her tongue by this time and she gave free rein to her wrath Let you off from school indeed Why Keith Burton I m ashamed of you an you that I ve always boasted of What do you want to do grow up a perfect ignominious Keith drew back resentfully and uptilted his chin No Susan Betts I m not wanting to be a a ignominious and I don t intend to be one either I m going to be an artist a great big famous artist and I don t NEED school for that How are multiplication tables and history and grammar going to help me paint big pictures That s what I want to know But I m afraid that dad Say WON T you tell dad that I don t NEED books any more and But he stopped short so extraordinary was the expression that had come to Susan Betts s face If it were possible to think of Susan Betts as crying he should think she was going to cry now Need books Why child there ain t nobody but what needs books An I guess I know What do you suppose I wouldn t give now if I could a had books an book learnin when I was young I could a writ real poetry then that would sell I could a spoke out an said things that are in my soul an that I CAN T say now cause I don t know the words that that will impress what I mean Now look a here Keith Burton you re young You ve got a chance Do you see to it that you make good An it s books that will help you do it But books won t help me paint Susan They will too Books will help you do anything Then you won t ask dad Indeed I won t But I don t see how books With a long sigh Keith turned away In the studio the next morning he faced his father Dad you can t learn to paint pictures by just READING how to do it can you You certainly cannot my boy There I told Susan Betts so but she wouldn t LISTEN to me And so I don t have to go to school any more do I Don t have to go to school any more Why Keith what an absurd idea Of course you ve got to go to school But just to be an artist and paint pictures I don t see But his father cut him short and would not listen Five minutes later a very disappointed disheartened young lad left the studio and walked slowly down the hall There was no way out of it If one were successfully to be Jerry and Ned and dad and one s self all in one there was nothing but school and more school and yes college that would give one the proper training Dad had said it Keith went to school the next morning With an oh well I don t care air he slung his books over his shoulder and swung out the gate whistling blithely It might not be so bad after all he was telling himself Perhaps the print would be plainer now Anyway he could learn a lot in class listening to the others and maybe some of the boys would study with him and do the reading part But it was not to be so easy as Keith hoped for To begin with the print had not grown any clearer It was more blurred than ever To be sure it was much worse with one eye than with the other but he could not keep one eye shut all the time Besides his eyes ached now if he tried to use them much and grew red and inflamed and he was afraid his father would notice them He began to see strange flashes of rainbow light now too And sometimes little haloes around the lamp flame As if one could study books with all that True he learned something in class but naturally he was never called upon to recite what had already been given so he invariably failed miserably when it came to his turn Even the boy to study with proved to be a delusion and a snare for no boy was found who cared to do all the reading without being told the reason why it was expected of him and that was exactly what Keith was straining every nerve to keep to himself And so week in and week out Keith stumbled along through those misery filled days each one seemingly a little more unbearable than the last Of course it could not continue indefinitely and Keith in his heart knew it Almost every lesson was more or less of a failure and recitation hour was a torture and a torment The teacher alternately reproved and reproached him with frequent appeals to his pride holding up for comparison his splendid standing of the past His classmates gibed and jeered mercilessly And Keith stood it all Only a tightening of his lips and a new misery in his eyes showed that he had heard and understood He made neither apology nor explanation Above all by neither word nor sign did he betray that because the print in his books was blurred he could not study Then came the day when his report card was sent to his father and he himself was summoned to the studio to answer for it Well my son what is the meaning of that Keith had never seen his father look so stern He was holding up the card face outward Keith knew that the damning figures were there and he suspected what they were though he could see only a blurred mass of indistinct marks With one last effort he attempted still to cling to his subterfuge What what is it he stammered What is it and in the face of a record like that cried his father sternly That s exactly what I want to know What is it Is this the way Keith that you re showing me that you don t want to go to school I haven t forgotten you see that you tried to beg off going this fall Now what is the matter Keith shifted his position miserably His face grew white and strained looking I I couldn t seem to get my lessons dad Couldn t You mean you wouldn t Keith Surely you re not trying to make me think you couldn t have made a better record than this if you d tried There was no answer Keith There was only pleading in the voice now pleading with an unsteadiness more eloquent than words Have you forgotten so soon what I told you how now you hold all the hopes of Jerry and Ned and of dad in your own two hands Keith do you think do you really think you re treating Jerry and Ned and dad square For a moment there was no answer then a very faint constrained voice asked What were those figures dad Read for yourself With the words the card was thrust into his hand Keith bent his head His eyes apparently were studying the card Suppose you read them aloud Keith There was a moment s pause then with a little convulsive breath the words came I can t dad The man smiled grimly Well I don t know as I wonder They are pretty bad However I guess we ll have to have them Read them aloud Keith But honest dad I can t I mean they re all blurred and run together The boy s face was white like paper now Daniel Burton gave his son a quick glance Blurred Run together He reached for the card and held it a moment before his own eyes Then sharply he looked at his son again You mean Can t you read any of those figures the largest ones 
6288_63111_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Keith shook his head 
none	none	Why Keith how long A sudden change came to his face You mean is that the reason you haven t been able to get your lessons boy Keith nodded dumbly miserably But my dear boy why in the world didn t you say so Look here Keith how long has this been going on There was no answer Since the very first of school Before that How long before that Last spring on my birthday I noticed it first then Good Heavens As long as that and never a word to me Why Keith what in the world possessed you Why didn t you tell me We d have had that fixed up long ago Fixed up Keith s eyes were eager incredulous To be sure We d have had some glasses of course Keith shook his head All the light fled from his face Uncle Joe Harrington tried that but it didn t help any Uncle Joe But Uncle Joe is Daniel Burton stopped short A new look came to his eyes Into his son s face he threw a glance at once fearful searching rebellious Then he straightened up angrily Nonsense Keith Don t get silly notions into your head he snapped sharply It s nothing but a little near sightedness and we ll have some glasses to remedy that in no time We ll go down to the optician s to morrow Meanwhile I ll drop a note to your teacher and you needn t go to school again till we get your glasses Near sightedness Keith caught at the straw and held to it fiercely Near sightedness Of course it was that and not blindness like Uncle Joe s at all Didn t dad know Of course he did Still if it was near sightedness he ought to be able to see near to and yet it was just as blurred But then of course it WAS near sightedness Dad said it was They went to the optician s the next morning It seemed there was an oculist too and he had to be seen When the lengthy and arduous examinations were concluded Keith drew a long breath Surely now after all that Just what they said Keith did not know He knew only that he did not get any glasses and that his father was very angry and very much put out about something and that he kept declaring that these old idiots didn t know their business anyway and the only thing to do was to go to Boston where there was somebody who DID know his business They went to Boston a few days later It was not a long journey but Keith hailed it with delight and was very much excited over the prospect of it Still he did not enjoy it very well for with his father he had to go from one doctor to another and none of them seemed really to understand his business that is not well enough to satisfy his father else why did he go to so many And there did not seem to be anywhere any glasses that would do any good Keith began to worry then for fear that his father had been wrong and that it was not near sightedness after all He could not forget Uncle Joe and Uncle Joe had not been able to find any glasses that did any good Besides he heard his father and the doctors talking a great deal about an accident and a consequent injury to the optic nerve and he had to answer a lot of questions about the time when he was eleven years old and ran into the big maple tree with his sled cutting a bad gash in his forehead But as if that so long ago could have anything to do with things looking blurred now But it did have something to do with it several of the doctors said that and they said it was possible that a slight operation now might arrest the disease They would try it Only one eye was badly affected at present So it was arranged that Keith should stay a month with one of the doctors letting his father go back to Hinsdale It was not a pleasant experience and it seemed to Keith anything but a slight operation but at the end of the month the bandages were off and his father had come to take him back home The print was not quite so blurred now though it was still far from clear and Keith noticed that his father and the doctors had a great deal to say to each other in very low tones and that his father s face was very grave Then they started for home On the journey his father talked cheerfully even gayly but Keith was not at all deceived For perhaps half an hour he watched his father closely Then he spoke Dad you might just as well tell me Tell you what About those doctors what they said Why they said all sorts of things Keith You heard them yourself The man spoke lightly still cheerily Oh yes they said all sorts of things but they didn t say anything PARTICULAR before me They always talked to you soft and low on one side I want to know what they said then Why really Keith they Dad interposed the boy a bit tensely when his father s hesitation left the sentence unfinished you might just as well tell me I know already it isn t good or you d have told me right away And if it s bad I might just as well know it now cause I ll have to know it sometime Dad what did they say Don t worry I can stand it honest I can I ve GOT to stand it Besides I ve been expecting it ever so long Keith you re going to be blind I wish t you d say it right out like that if you ve got to say it But the man shuddered and gave a low cry No no Keith never I ll not say it You re not going to be blind But didn t they say I was They said they said it MIGHT be They couldn t tell yet The man wet his lips and cleared his throat huskily They said it would be some time yet before they could tell for sure And even then if it came there might be another operation that But for now Keith we ve got to wait that s all I ve got some drops and there are certain things you ll have to do each day You can t go to school and you can t read of course but there are lots of things you can do And there are lots of things we can do together you ll see And it s coming out all right It s bound to come out all right Yes sir Keith said the two words then shut his lips tight Keith could not trust himself to talk much just then Babies and girls cried of course but men and boys who were almost men they did not cry For a long minute he said nothing then with his chin held high and his breath sternly under control he said Of course dad if I do get blind you won t expect me to be Jerry and Ned and and you all in a bunch then will you This time it was dad who could not speak except with a strong right arm that clasped with a pressure that hurt CHAPTER V WAITING Not for some days after his return from Boston did Keith venture out upon the street He knew then at once that the whole town had heard all about his trip to Boston and what the doctors had said He tried not to see the curious glances cast in his direction He tried not to care that the youngest McGuire children stood at their gate and whispered with fingers plainly pointing toward himself He did not go near the schoolhouse and he stayed at the post office until he felt sure all the scholars must have reached home Then just at the corner of his own street he met Mazie Sanborn and Dorothy Parkman face to face He would have passed quickly with the briefest sort of recognition but Mazie stopped him short Keith oh Keith it isn t true is it she cried breathlessly You aren t going to be blind Mazie how could you cried Dorothy sharply And because she shuddered and half turned away Keith saw only the shudder and the turning away and did not realize that it was rebuke and remonstrance and not aversion that Dorothy was expressing so forcibly Keith stiffened Say Keith I m awfully sorry and so s Dorothy Why she hasn t talked about a thing hardly but that since she heard of it Mazie I have too protested Dorothy sharply Well anyway it was she who insisted on coming around this way to day teased Mazie wickedly and when I I m going home whether you are or not cut in Miss Dorothy with dignity And with a low chuckle Mazie tossed a good bye to Keith and followed her lead Keith his chin aggressively high strode in the opposite direction I suppose she wanted to see how really bad I did look he was muttering fiercely under his breath Well she needn t worry If I do get blind I ll take good care she don t have to look at me nor Mazie nor any of the rest of them Keith went out on the street very little after that and especially he kept away from it after school hours They were not easy those winter days The snow lay deep in the woods and it was too cold for long walks He could not read nor paint nor draw nor use his eyes about anything that tried them But he was by no means idle He had found now the boy to do the reading his father For hours every day they studied together Keith memorizing where it was necessary what his father read always discussing and working out the problems together That he could not paint or draw was a great cross to his father he knew Keith noticed too and noticed it with a growing heartache that nothing was ever said now about his being Jerry and Ned and dad himself all in a bunch And he understood of course that if he was going to be blind he could not be Jerry and But Keith was honestly trying not to think of that and he welcomed most heartily anything or anybody that helped him toward that end Now there was Susan Not once had Susan ever spoken to him of his eyes whether he could or could not see But Susan knew about it He was sure of that First he suspected it when he found her the next day after his return from Boston crying in the pantry SUSAN CRYING Keith stood in the doorway and stared unbelievingly He had not supposed that Susan could cry Why Susan he gasped What IS the matter He never forgot the look on Susan s face as she sprang toward him or the quick cry she gave Oh Keith my boy my boy Then instantly she straightened back caught up a knife and began to peel an onion from a pan on the shelf before her Cryin Nonsense she snapped quaveringly Can t a body peel a pan of onions without being accused of cryin about somethin Shucks What should I be cryin for anyway to be sure Some things need a knife An some things need a pill An some things jest a laugh ll make a cure But jest you bet your life You may cry jest fit to kill An never cure nothin that is sure That s what I always say when I see folks cryin An it s so too Here Keith want a cooky An take a jam tart too I made em this mornin specially for you With which astounding procedure for her Susan pushed a plate of cookies and tarts toward him then picked up her pan of onions and hurried into the kitchen Once again Keith stared Cookies and jam tarts and made for him If anything this was even more incomprehensible than were the tears in Susan s eyes Then suddenly the suspicion came to him SUSAN KNEW And this was her way The suspicion did not become a certainty however until two days later Then he overheard Susan and missus McGuire talking in the kitchen He had slipped into the pantry to look for another of those cookies made for him when he heard missus McGuire burst into the kitchen and accost Susan agitatedly And her first words were such that he could not bring himself to step out into view Susan she had cried it ain t true is it IS it true that Keith Burton is going BLIND My John says Sh h You don t have to shout it out like that do ye demanded Susan crossly yet in a voice that was far from steady Besides that s a very extravagated statement You mean exaggerated I suppose retorted missus McGuire impatiently Well I m sure I m glad if it is of course But can t you tell me anything about it Or don t you know Keith knew though he could not see her just how Susan was drawing herself up to her full height I guess I know all there is to know Mis McGuire she said then coldly But there ain t anybody KNOWS anything We re jest waitin to see Her voice had grown unsteady again You mean he MAY be blind later Yes Oh the poor boy Ain t that terrible How CAN they stand it I notice there are things in this world that have to be stood An when they have to be stood they might as well be stood an done with it Yes I suppose so sighed missus McGuire Then after a pause But what is it that s makin him blind I don t know They ain t sayin I thought maybe t was a catamount but they say t ain t that But when is it liable to come Come How do I know How does anybody know snapped Susan tartly Look a here Mis McGuire you must excuse me from discoursin particulars We don t talk em here None of us don t Well you needn t be so short about it Susan Betts I m only tryin to show a little sympathy You don t seem to realize at all what a dreadful thing this is My John says Don t I DON T I Susan s voice shook with emotion Don t you s pose that I know what it would be with the sun put out an the moon an the stars an never a thing to look at but black darkness all the rest of your life Never to be able to see the blue sky or your father s face or But talkin about it don t help any Look a here if somethin awful was goin to happen to you would YOU want folks to be talkin to you all the time about it No I guess you wouldn t An so we don t talk here We re just waitin It may come in a year it may come sooner or later It may not come at all An while we ARE waitin there ain t nothin we can do except to do ev rything the doctor tells us an hope t won t ever come Even missus McGuire could have had no further doubt about Susan s caring No one who heard Susan s voice then could have doubted it missus McGuire for a moment made no answer then with an inarticulate something that might have passed for almost any sort of comment she rose to her feet and left the house In the pantry Keith the cookies long since forgotten shamelessly listened at the door and held his breath to see which way Susan s footsteps led Then when he knew that the kitchen was empty he slipped out still cookyless and hurried upstairs to his own room Keith understood after that why Susan did not talk to him about his eyes and because he knew she would not talk he felt at ease and at peace with her It was not so with others With others except with his father he never knew when a dread question or a hated comment was to be made And so he came to avoid those others more and more At the first signs of spring and long before the snow was off the ground Keith took to the woods When his father did not care to go he went alone It was as if he wanted to fill his inner consciousness with the sights and sounds of his beloved out of doors so that when his outer eyes were darkened his inner eyes might still hold the pictures Keith did not say this even to himself but when every day Susan questioned him minutely as to what he had seen and begged him to describe every budding tree and every sunset he wondered was it possible that Susan too was trying to fill that inner consciousness with visions Keith was thrown a good deal with Susan these days Sometimes it seemed as if there were almost no one but Susan Certainly all those others who talked and questioned he did not want to be with them And his father sometimes it seemed to Keith that his father did not like to be with him as well as he used to And of course if he was going to be blind Dad never had liked disagreeable subjects Had HE become a disagreeable subject And so there seemed indeed at times no one but Susan Susan however was a host in herself Susan was never cross now and almost always she had a cooky or a jam tart for him She told lots of funny stories and there were always her rhymes and jingles She had a new one every day sometimes two or three a day There was no subject too big or too little for Susan to put into rhyme Susan said that something inside of her was a gushing siphon of poems anyway and she just had to get them out of her system And she told Keith that spring always made the siphon gush worse than ever for some reason She didn t know why Keith suspected that she said this by way of an excuse for repeating so many of her verses to him just now But Keith was not deceived He had not forgotten what Susan had said to missus McGuire in the kitchen that day and he knew very well that all this especial attention to him was only Susan s way of trying to help him wait CHAPTER VI LIGHTS OUT And so Keith waited through the summer and into another winter And April came Keith was not listening to Susan s rhymes and jingles now nor was he tramping through the woods in search of the first sign of spring Both eyes had become badly affected now Keith knew that and THE FOG HAD COME Keith had seen the fog for several days before he knew what it was He had supposed it to be really fog Then one day he said to Susan Where s the sun We haven t had any BRIGHT sun for days and days just this horrid old foggy fog Fog Why there ain t any fog exclaimed Susan The sun is as bright She stopped short Keith could not see her face very clearly Keith was not seeing anything clearly these days Nonsense Keith of course the sun is shinin snapped Susan Now don t get silly notions in your head Then she turned and hurried from the room And Keith knew And he knew that Susan knew Keith did not mention the fog to his father dad did not like disagreeable subjects But somebody must have mentioned it Susan perhaps At all events before the week was out Keith went with his father again to Boston It was a sorry journey Keith did not need to go to Boston Keith knew now There was no one who could tell him anything Dad might laugh and joke and call attention to everything amusing that he wanted to it would make no difference Besides as if he could not hear the shake in dad s voice under all the fun and as if he could not feel the tremble in dad s hand on his shoulder Boston was the same dreary round of testing talk and questions hushed voices and furtive glances hurried trips from place to place only this time it was all sharper shorter more decisive and there was no operation It was not the time for that now the doctors said Moreover this time dad did not laugh or joke or even talk on the homeward journey But that too made no difference Keith already knew He knew so well that he did not question him at all But if he had not known he would have known from Susan the next day For he found Susan crying three times the next forenoon and each time she snapped out so short and sharp about something so entirely foreign from what he asked her that he would have known that Susan knew Keith did wonder how many months it would be Some way he had an idea it would be very few now As long as it was coming he wished it would come and come quick This waiting business On the whole he was glad that Susan was cross and that his father spent his days shut away in his own room with orders that he was not to be disturbed For as for talking about this thing It was toward the last of July that Keith discovered how indistinct were growing the outlines of the big pictures on the wall at the end of the hall Day by day he had to walk nearer and nearer before he could see them at all He wondered just how many steps would bring him to the wall itself He was tempted once to count them but he could not bring himself to do that so he knew then that in his heart he did not want to know just how many days it would be before But there came a day when he was but two steps away He told himself it would be in two days then But it did not come in two days It did not come in a week Then very suddenly it came He woke up one morning to find it quite dark For a minute he thought it WAS dark then the clock struck seven and it was August Something within Keith seemed to snap then The long pent strain of months gave way With one agonized cry of Dad it s come it s come he sprang from the bed then stood motionless in the middle of the room his arms outstretched But when his father and Susan reached the room he had fallen to the floor in a dead faint It was some weeks before Keith stood upright on his feet again His illness was a long and serious one Late in September missus McGuire hanging out her clothes accosted Susan over the back yard fence I heard down to the store last night that Keith Burton was goin to get well Of course he s goin to get well retorted Susan with emphasis I knew he was all the time All the same I think it s a pity he is missus McGuire s lips came together a bit firmly He s stone blind I hear an my John says Well what if he is demanded Susan almost fiercely You wouldn t kill the child would you Besides SEEIN is only one of his facilities He s got all the rest left I reckon he ll show you he can do somethin with them missus McGuire shook her head mournfully Poor boy poor boy How s he feel himself Has he got his senses his real senses yet He s just beginnin to The harshness in Susan s voice betrayed her difficulty in controlling it Up to now he hain t sensed anything much Of course part of the time he hain t known ANYTHING jest lay there in a stupid Then other times he s jest moaned of of the dark always the dark At first he when he talked seemed to be walkin through the woods an he d tell all about what he saw the purple sunsets an dancin leaves an the merry little brooks hurryin down the hillside till you could jest SEE the place he was talkin about But now now he s comin to full conscientiousness the doctor says an he don t talk of anything only only the dark An pretty quick he ll know An yet you want that poor child to live Susan Betts Of course I want him to live But what can he DO Do There ain t nothin he can t do Why Mis McGuire listen I ve been readin up First I felt as you do a little I I didn t WANT him to live Then I heard of somebody who was blind an what he did He wrote a great book I ve forgotten its name but it was somethin about Paradise PARADISE an he was in prison too Think of writin about Paradise when you re shut up in jail an blind at that Well I made up my mind if that man could see Paradise through them prison bars with his poor blind eyes then Keith could An I was goin to have him do it too An so I went down to the library an asked Miss Hemenway for a book about him An I read it An then she told me about more an more folks that was blind an what they had done An I read about them too Well gracious me Susan Betts if you ain t the limit commented missus McGuire half admiringly half disapprovingly Well I did An why Mis McGuire you hain t any inception of an idea of what those men an women an yes children did Why one of em wasn t only blind but deaf an dumb too She was a girl An now she writes books an gives lecturin s an oh ev rything Maybe I ain t sayin they don t But I guess somebody else has to do a part of it Look at Keith right here now How are you goin to take care of him when he gets up an begins to walk around Why he can t see to walk or or feed himself or anything Has the nurse gone Susan shook her head Her lips came together grimly No Goes next week though Land s sakes but I hope that woman is expulsive enough Them entrained nurses always cost a lot I guess But we ve just had to have her while he was so sick But she s goin next week But what ARE you goin to do You can t tag him around all day an do your other work too Of course there s his father His father Good Heavens woman I wonder if you think I d trust that boy to his father demanded Susan indignantly Why once let him get his nose into that paint box an he don t know anything not anything Why I wouldn t trust him with a baby rabbit if I cared for the rabbit Besides he don t like to be with Keith nor see him nor think of him He feels so bad Humph Well if he does feel bad I don t think that s a very nice way to show it Not think of him indeed Well I guess he ll find SOME one has got to think of him now But there that s what you might expect of Daniel Burton I s pose moonin all day over those silly pictures of his As my John says They re not silly pictures cut in Susan flaring into instant wrath He HAS to paint pictures in order to get money to live don t he Well then let him paint He s an artist an extinguished artist not just a common storekeeper mister McGuire it might be mentioned in passing kept a grocery store An if you re artistical you re different from other folks You have to be Nonsense Susan That s all bosh an you know it What if he does paint pictures That hadn t ought to hinder him from takin proper care of his own son had it Yes if he s blind Susan spoke with firmness and decision You don t seem to understand at all Mis McGuire mister Burton is an artist Artists like flowers an sunsets an clouds an brooks They don t like disagreeable things They don t want to see em or think about em I know It s that way with mister Burton Before when Keith was all right he couldn t bear him out of his sight an he was goin to have him do such big fine splendid things when he grew up Now since he s blind he can t bear him IN his sight He feels that bad He just won t be with him if he can help it But he ain t forgettin him He s thinkin of him all the time I KNOW An it s tellin on him He s lookin thin an bad an sick You see he s so disappointed when he d counted on such big things for that boy Humph Well I ll risk HIM It s Keith I m worry in about Who is going to take care of him Susan Betts frowned Well I could I think But there s a sister of mister Burton s she s comin Not Nettie Colebrook Yes Mis Colebrook That s her name She s a widow an hain t got anything needin her She wrote an offered an mister Burton said yes if she d be so kind An she s comin When Next week The day the nurse goes Why What makes you look so queer Do you know Mis Colebrook Know Nettie Burton Colebrook Well I should say I did I went to boardin school with her Humph Susan threw a sharp glance into missus McGuire s face Susan looked as if she wanted to ask another question But she did not ask it Humph she grunted again and turned back to the sheet she was hanging on the line There was a brief pause then missus McGuire commented dryly I notice you ain t doin no rhymin to day Susan Ain t I Well perhaps I ain t Some way they don t come out now so natural an easy like What s the matter Ain t the machine workin Susan shook her head Then she drew a long sigh Picking up her empty basket she looked at it somberly Not the way it did before Some way there don t seem anything inside of me now only dirges an funeral marches Everywhere all day everything I do an everywhere I go I jest hear Keith s blind Keith s blind till it seems as if I jest couldn t bear it With something very like a sob Susan turned and hurried into the house CHAPTER VII SUSAN TO THE RESCUE It was when the nurse was resting and Susan was with Keith that the boy came to a full realizing sense of himself 
6284-63091-0000	train-other-500	on his lips the time worn question asked by countless other minds back from that mysterious land of delirium Where am I Susan sprang to her feet then dropped on her knees at the bedside In your own bed honey Is that
6284-63091-0001	train-other-500	Susan No wonder he asked the question Whenever before had Susan talked like that Sure it s Susan But I can t see you or anything
none	none	 Oh h With a shudder and a quivering cry the boy flung out his hands 
6284-63091-0002	train-other-500	then covered his eyes with them I know now I know It s come it s come I am BLIND There there honey don t please don t You ll break Susan s heart An you re SO much better now Better Yes
6284-63091-0003	train-other-500	You ve been sick very sick How long Oh several weeks It s October now And I ve been blind all that time Yes But I haven t known I was blind No I want to go back
none	none	 I want to go back 
6284-63091-0004	train-other-500	where I didn t know again Nonsense Keith Susan was beginning to talk more like herself Go back to be sick Of course you don t want to go back an be sick Listen Don t you worry an don t you fret Somethin better is comin yet Somethin fine What ll you bet
6284-63091-0005	train-other-500	It s jest the thing you re wantin ter get Come come We re goin to have you up an out in no time now boy I don t want to be up and out I m blind Susan An there s your dad He ll be mighty glad to know you re better I ll call him No no Susan don t
6284-63091-0006	train-other-500	Don t call him He won t want to see me Nobody will want to see me now I m blind Susan blind Shucks Everybody will want to see you so s to see how splendid you are even if you are blind Now don t talk any more please don t there s a good boy
6284-63091-0007	train-other-500	You re gettin yourself all worked up an then oh my how that nurse will scold I shan t be splendid moaned the boy I shan t be anything now I shan t be Jerry or Ned or dad
none	none	 I shall be just ME 
6284-63091-0008	train-other-500	And I ll be pointed at everywhere and they ll whisper and look and stare and say He s blind he s blind he s blind I tell you Susan I can t stand it I can t I can t I want to go back I want to go back to where I didn t KNOW
6284-63091-0009	train-other-500	The nurse came in then and of course Susan was banished in disgrace Of course too Keith was almost in hysterics and his fever had gone away up again He still talked in a high shrill voice
6284-63091-0010	train-other-500	and still thrashed his arms wildly about till the little white powder the nurse gave him got in its blessed work And then he slept Keith was entirely conscious the next day when Susan came in to sit with him while the nurse took her rest
6284-63091-0011	train-other-500	But it was a very different Keith It was a weary spent nerveless Keith that lay back on the pillow with scarcely so much as the flutter of an eyelid to show life Is there anything I can get you Keith she asked
none	none	 when a long drawn sigh convinced her that he was awake 
6284-63091-0012	train-other-500	Only a faint shake of the head answered her The doctor says you re lots better Keith There was no sort of reply to this and for another long minute Susan sat tense and motionless watching the boy s face
6284-63091-0013	train-other-500	Then with almost a guilty look over her shoulder she stammered Keith I don t want you to talk to me but I do wish you d just SPEAK to me But Keith only shook his head again faintly and turned his face away to the wall
6284-63091-0014	train-other-500	By and by the nurse came in and Susan left the room She went straight to the kitchen and she did not so much as look toward Keith s father whom she met in the hall In the kitchen Susan caught up a cloth and vigorously began to polish a brass faucet
6284-63091-0015	train-other-500	The faucet was already a marvel of brightness but perhaps Susan could not see that One cannot always see clearly through tears Keith was like this every day after that when Susan came in to sit with him silent
6284-63091-0016	train-other-500	listless seemingly devoid of life Yet the doctor declared that physically the boy was practically well And the nurse was going at the end of the week On the last day of the nurse s stay Susan accosted her in the hall somewhat abruptly
6284-63091-0017	train-other-500	Is it true that by an by there could be an operator on that boy s eyes Oper er oh operation Yes there might be if he could only get strong enough to stand it But it might not be successful even then But there s a chance
6284-63091-0018	train-other-500	Yes there s a chance I s pose it it would be mighty expulsive though Expulsive The young woman frowned slightly then suddenly she smiled
none	none	 Oh Oh yes I I m afraid it would er cost a good deal of money she nodded over her shoulder as she went on into Keith s room 
6284-63091-0019	train-other-500	That evening Susan sought her employer in the studio Daniel Burton spent all his waking hours in the studio now The woods and fields were nothing but a barren desert of loneliness to Daniel Burton without Keith The very poise of Susan s head
6284-63091-0020	train-other-500	spelt aggressive determination as she entered the studio and Daniel Burton shifted uneasily in his chair as he faced her Nor did he fail to note that she carried some folded papers in her hand Yes yes Susan I know
6284-63091-0021	train-other-500	Those bills are due and past due he cried nervously before Susan could speak And I hoped to have the money both for them and for your wages long before this But
none	none	 Susan stopped him short with an imperative gesture T ain t bills mister Burton 
6284-63091-0022	train-other-500	an t ain t wages It s it s somethin else Somethin very importune There was a subdued excitement in Susan s face and manner that was puzzling yet most promising
6284-63091-0023	train-other-500	Unconsciously Daniel Burton sat a little straighter and lifted his chin though his eyes were smiling Something else Yes It s poetry
none	none	 Oh SUSAN 
6284-63091-0024	train-other-500	It was as if a bubble had been pricked leaving nothing but empty air But you don t know you don t understand yet pleaded Susan unerringly reading the disappointment in her employer s face It s to sell to get some money you know for the operator on the poor lamb s eyes
6284-63091-0025	train-other-500	I I wanted to help some way An this is REAL poetry truly it is not the immaculate kind that I jest dash off I ve worked an worked over this an I m jest sure it ll sell It s GOT to sell mister Burton We ve jest got to have that money An now I I want to read em to you
6284-63091-0026	train-other-500	Can t I please And this from Susan this palpitating pleading please Daniel Burton with a helpless gesture that expressed embarrassment dismay bewilderment and resignation threw up both hands and settled back in his chair
none	none	 Why of of course Susan 
6284-63091-0027	train-other-500	read them he muttered as clearly as he could considering the tightness that had come into his throat And Susan read this SPRING Oh gentle Spring I love thy rills I love thy wooden rocky rills
6284-63091-0028	train-other-500	I love thy budsome beauty But oh I hate o er anything Thy mud an slush oh gentle Spring When rubbers are a duty That s the shortest the other is longer explained Susan
6284-63091-0029	train-other-500	still the extraordinary palpitating Susan with the shining pleading eyes Yes go on
none	none	 Daniel Burton had to clear his throat before he could say even those two short words 
6284-63091-0030	train-other-500	I called this Them Things That Plague said Susan An it s really true too Don t you know Things DO plague worse nights when you can t sleep An you get to thinkin an thinkin Well that s what made me write this
6284-63091-0031	train-other-500	And she began to read THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE They come at night them things that plague An gather round my bed They cluster thick about the foot An lean on top the head
6284-63091-0032	train-other-500	They like the dark them things that plague For then they can be great They loom like doom from out the gloom An shriek I am your Fate But after all them things that plague Are cowards Say not you
6284-63091-0033	train-other-500	To strike a man when he is down An in the darkness too For if you ll watch them things that plague Till comin of the dawn You ll find when once you re on your feet Them things that plague are gone
6284-63091-0034	train-other-500	There ain t that true every word of it she demanded An there ain t hardly any poem license in it too I think they re a ways lots better when there ain t but sometimes of course you jest have to use it
none	none	 There an now I ve read em both to you an how much do you s pose I can get for em the two of em either singly or doubly 
6284-63091-0035	train-other-500	Susan was still breathless still shining eyed a strange exotic Susan that Daniel Burton had never seen before I ve heard that writers some writers get lots of money mister Burton an I can write more lots more
6284-63091-0036	train-other-500	Why when I get to goin they jest come autocratically poems do without any thinkin at all an But how much DO you think I ought to get Get Good Heavens woman
6284-63091-0037	train-other-500	Daniel Burton was on his feet now trying to shake off the conflicting emotions that were all but paralyzing him Why you can t get anything for those da Just in time he pulled himself up At that moment too he saw Susan s face He sat down limply
6284-63091-0038	train-other-500	Susan He cleared his throat and began again He tried to speak clearly judiciously kindly Susan I m afraid that is I m not sure Oh hang it all woman he was on his feet now
6284-63091-0039	train-other-500	send them if you want to but don t blame me for the consequences And with a gesture as of flinging the whole thing far from him he turned his back and walked away You mean
none	none	 you don t think I can get hardly anything for em An extraordinarily meek fearful Susan asked the question 
6284-63091-0040	train-other-500	Only a shrug of the back turned shoulders answered her But mister Burton we we ve got to have the money for that operator an anyhow I I mean to try With a quick indrawing of her breath she turned abruptly and left the studio
6284-63091-0041	train-other-500	That evening in her own room Susan pored over the two inexpensive magazines that came to the house
none	none	 She was searching for poems and for addresses 
6284-63091-0042	train-other-500	As she worked she began to look more cheerful Both the magazines published poems and if they published one poem they would another of course especially if the poem were a better one and Susan could not help feeling that they were better those poems of hers
6284-63091-0043	train-other-500	than almost any she saw there in print before her There was some SENSE to her poems while those others why some of them didn t mean anything not anything and they didn t even rhyme With real hope and courage therefore
6284-63091-0044	train-other-500	Susan laboriously copied off the addresses of the two magazines directed two envelopes
none	none	 and set herself to writing the first of her two letters 
6284-63091-0045	train-other-500	That done she copied the letter word for word except for the title of the poem submitted It was a long letter Susan told first of Keith and his misfortune and the imperative need of money for the operation
6284-63091-0046	train-other-500	Then she told something of herself and of her habit of turning everything into rhyme for she felt it due to them she said that they know something of the person with whom they were dealing She touched again on the poverty of the household
6284-63091-0047	train-other-500	and let it plainly be seen that she had high hopes of the money these poems were going to bring She did not set a price She would leave that to their own indiscretion she said in closing It was midnight before Susan had copied this letter and prepared the two manuscripts for mailing
6284-63091-0048	train-other-500	Then tired but happy she went to bed It was the next day that the nurse went and that missus Colebrook came The doctor said that Keith might be dressed now any day that he should be dressed in fact and begin to take some exercise
6284-63091-0049	train-other-500	He had already sat up in a chair every day for a week and he was in no further need of medicine except a tonic to build him up In fact all efforts now should be turned toward building him up the doctor said That was what he needed
6284-63091-0050	train-other-500	All this the nurse mentioned to mister Burton and to Susan as she was leaving She went away at two o clock and missus Colebrook was not to come until half past five At one minute past two Susan crept to the door of Keith s room and pushed it open softly
6284-63091-0051	train-other-500	The boy his face to the wall lay motionless But he was not asleep Susan knew that for she had heard his voice not five minutes before bidding the nurse good bye For one brief moment Susan hesitated Then briskly she stepped into the room with a cheery
6284-63091-0052	train-other-500	Well Keith here we are just ourselves together The nurse is gone an I am on how do you like the weather Yes I know she said she was going The boy spoke listlessly wearily without turning his head
none	none	 What do you say to gettin up 
6284-63091-0053	train-other-500	Keith stirred restlessly I was up this morning Ho Susan tossed her head disdainfully I don t mean THAT way I mean up really up with your clothes on The boy shook his head again I couldn t I I m too tired
6284-63091-0054	train-other-500	Nonsense A great boy like you bein too tired to get up Why Keith it ll do you good You ll feel lots better when you re up an dressed like folks again The boy gave a sudden cry That s just it Susan Don t you see I ll never be like folks again
6284-63091-0055	train-other-500	Nonsense Jest as if a little thing like bein blind was goin to keep you from bein like folks again Susan was speaking very loudly very cheerfully though with first one hand then the other she was brushing away the hot tears that were rolling down her cheeks Why Keith
6284-63091-0056	train-other-500	you re goin to be better than folks jest common folks You re goin to do the most wonderful things that But I can t I m blind I tell you cut in the boy I can t do anything now But you can an you re goin to insisted Susan again You jest wait till I tell you
none	none	 an it s because you ARE blind that it s goin to be so wonderful 
6284-63091-0057	train-other-500	But you can t do it jest lyin abed there in that lazy fashion Come I m goin to get your clothes an put em right on this chair here by the bed then I m goin to give you twenty minutes to get into em I shan t give you but fifteen tomorrow
6284-63091-0058	train-other-500	Susan was moving swiftly around the room now opening closet doors and bureau drawers No no Susan I can t get up moaned the boy turning his face back to the wall I can t I can t Yes you can Now listen They re all here everything you need
6284-63091-0059	train-other-500	on these two chairs by the bed But how can I dress me when I can t see a thing
none	none	 You can feel can t you Y yes But feeling isn t seeing You don t KNOW Susan gave a sudden laugh she would have told you it was a laugh but it sounded more like a sob 
6284-63091-0060	train-other-500	But I do know an that s the funny part of it Keith she cried Listen
none	none	 What do you s pose your poor old Susan s been doin 
6284-63091-0061	train-other-500	You d never guess in a million years so I m goin to tell you For the last three mornin s she s tied up her eyes with a handkerchief an then DRESSED herself jest to make sure it COULD be done you know Susan did you really For the first time a faint trace of interest came into the boy s face
6284-63091-0062	train-other-500	Sure I did An Keith it was great fun really jest to see how smart I could be doin it An I timed myself too It took me twenty five minutes the first time Dear dear but I was clumsy But I can do it lots quicker now though I don t believe I ll ever do it as quick as you will
6284-63091-0063	train-other-500	Do you think I could do it really I know you could I could try faltered Keith dubiously You ain t goin to TRY you re goin to DO it declared Susan Now listen I m goin out but in jest twenty minutes I m comin back
none	none	 an I shall expect to find you all dressed 
6284-63091-0064	train-other-500	I I shall be ashamed of you if you ain t And without another glance at the boy and before he could possibly protest Susan hurried from the room Her head was still high and her voice still determinedly clear but in the hall outside the bedroom
6284-63091-0065	train-other-500	Susan burst into such a storm of sobs that she had to hurry to the kitchen and shut herself in the pantry lest they be heard Later
none	none	 when she had scornfully lashed herself into calmness 
6284-63091-0066	train-other-500	she came out into the kitchen and looked at the clock An I ve been in there five minutes I ll bet ye over that fool cry in she stormed hotly to herself Great one I am to take care of that boy if I can t control myself better than this At the end of what she deemed to be twenty minutes
6284-63091-0067	train-other-500	and after a fruitless puttering about the kitchen Susan marched determinedly upstairs to Keith s room At the door she did hesitate a breathless minute then resolutely she pushed it open The boy fully dressed stood by the bed
6284-63091-0068	train-other-500	His face was alight almost eager I did it I did it Susan And if it hasn t been more than twenty minutes I did it sooner than you Susan tried to speak but the tears were again chasing each other down her cheeks
none	none	 and her face was working with emotion 
6284-63091-0069	train-other-500	Susan The boy put out his hand gropingly turning his head with the pitiful uncertainty of the blind Susan you are there aren t you
none	none	 Susan caught her breath chokingly and strode into the room with a brisk clatter 
6284-63091-0070	train-other-500	Here Sure I m here but so dumb with amazement an admiration that I couldn t open my head to see you standin there all dressed like that What did I tell you I knew you could do it Now come let s go see dad She was at his side now her arm linked into his But the boy drew back
none	none	 No no Susan not there He he wouldn t like it Truly he he doesn t want to see me 
6284-63091-0071	train-other-500	You know he he doesn t like to see disagreeable things Disagreeable things indeed exploded Susan her features working again Well I guess if he calls it disagreeable to see his son dressed up an walkin around But Keith interrupted her once more with an even stronger protest
6284-63091-0072	train-other-500	and Susan was forced to content herself with leading her charge out on to the broad veranda that ran across the entire front of the house There they walked back and forth back and forth She was glad afterward that this was all she did
6284-63091-0073	train-other-500	for at the far end of the veranda Daniel Burton stepped out from a door and stood for a moment watching them But it was for only a moment And when she begged mutely for him to come forward and speak he shook his head fiercely covered his eyes with his hand and plunged back into the house
6284-63091-0074	train-other-500	What was that Susan What was that demanded the boy Nothin child nothin only a door shuttin somewhere or a window At that moment a girl s voice caroled shrilly from the street Hullo Keith how do you do We re awfully glad to see you out again
6284-63091-0075	train-other-500	The boy started violently but did not turn his head except to Susan
none	none	 Susan I I m tired I want to go in now he begged a little wildly under his breath 
6284-63091-0076	train-other-500	Keith it s Mazie Mazie and Dorothy caroled the high pitched voice again But Keith with a tug so imperative that Susan had no choice but to obey turned his head quite away as he groped for the door to go in In the hall he drew a choking breath Susan
6284-63091-0077	train-other-500	I don t want to go out there to walk any more NOT ANY MORE I don t want to go anywhere where anybody ll see me Shucks Susan s voice was harshly unsteady again See you indeed Why we re goin to be so proud of you we ll want the whole world to see you
6284-63091-0078	train-other-500	You jest wait An see the fate That I ve cut out for you We ll be so proud We ll laugh aloud An you ll be laughin too I made that up last night when I laid awake thinkin of all the fine things we was goin to have you do
6284-63091-0079	train-other-500	But Keith only shook his head again and complained of feeling oh so tired And Susan looking at his pale constrained face did not quote any more poetry to him or talk about the glorious future in store for him
none	none	 She led him to the easiest chair in his room and made him as comfortable as she could Then she went downstairs and shut herself in the pantry until she could stop her fool cryin over nothin CHAPTER VIII AUNT NETTIE MEETS HER MATCH missus Nettie Colebrook came at half past five She was a small nervous looking woman with pale blue eyes and pale yellow hair She greeted her brother with a burst of tears Oh Daniel Daniel how can you stand it how can you stand it she cried throwing herself upon the man s somewhat unresponsive shoulder There there Nettie control yourself do besought the man uncomfortably trying to withdraw himself from the clinging arms But how CAN you stand it your only son blind wailed missus Colebrook with a fresh burst of sobs I notice some things have to be stood observed Susan grimly Susan with missus Colebrook s traveling bag in her hand was waiting with obvious impatience to escort her visitor upstairs to her room Susan s terse comment accomplished what Daniel Burton s admonition had been quite powerless to bring about missus Colebrook stopped sobbing at once and drew herself somewhat haughtily erect And pray who is this she demanded looking from one to the other Well this happens to be the hired girl an she s got some biscuits in the oven explained Susan crisply If you ll be so good ma am I ll show you upstairs to your room Daniel appealed missus Colebrook plainly aghast But her brother with a helpless gesture had turned away and Susan bag in hand was already halfway up the stairs With heightened color and a muttered Impertinence missus Colebrook turned and followed Susan to the floor above A little way down the hall Susan threw open a door I swept but I didn t have no time to dust she announced as she put down the bag There s a duster in that little bag there Don t lock the door Somethin ails it If you do you ll have to go out the window down a ladder There s towels in the top drawer an you ll have to fill the pitcher every day cause there s a crack an it leaks an you can t put in the water only to where the crack is Is there anything more you want Thank you If you ll kindly take me to Master Keith s room that will be all that I require answered missus Colebrook frigidly as she unpinned her hat and laid that on top of her coat on the bed All right ma am He s a whole lot better He s been up an dressed to day but he s gone back to bed now His room is right down here jest across the hall finished Susan throwing wide the door There was a choking cry a swift rush of feet then missus Colebrook on her knees was sobbing at the bedside Oh Keithie Keithie my poor blind boy What will you do How will you ever live Never to see again never to see again Oh my poor boy my poor blind boy Susan at the door flung both hands above her head then plunged down the stairs Fool FOOL FOOL she snarled at the biscuits in the oven Don t you know ANYTHING Yet the biscuits in the oven were puffing up and browning beautifully as the best of biscuits should When Susan s strident call for supper rang through the hall missus Colebrook was with her brother in the studio She had been bemoaning and bewailing the cruel fate that had overtaken that dear boy and had just asked for the seventh time how he could stand it when from the hall below came Supper s ready supper s ready Hurry up or you ll be late Then you ll sure be cross an heady If there s nothin left to ate Daniel what in the world is the meaning of that she interrupted sharply That Oh that is Susan s er supper bell shrugged the man with a little uneasy gesture You mean that you ve heard it before that that is her usual method of summoning you to your meals Y yes when she s good natured returned the man with a still more uneasy shifting of his position Come shall we go down DANIEL And you stand it Oh come come You don t understand conditions here Besides I ve tried to stop it TRIED to stop it Yes Oh well try yourself if you think it s so easy I give you my full and free permission Try it TRY it I shan t TRY anything of the sort I shall STOP it Humph shrugged the man Oh very well then Suppose we go down But what does that poor little blind boy eat How can he eat anything Why I I don t know The man gave an irritably helpless gesture The nurse she used to You ll have to ask Susan She ll know Susan That impossible woman Daniel how DO you stand her Daniel Burton shrugged his shoulders again Then suddenly he gave a short grim laugh I notice there are some things that have to be stood he observed so exactly in imitation of Susan that it was a pity only missus Nettie Colebrook s unappreciative ears got the benefit of it In the dining room a disapproving Susan stood by the table I thought you wasn t never comin The hash is gettin cold missus Colebrook gasped audibly Yes yes I know murmured mister Burton conciliatingly But we re here now Susan What will Master Keith have for his supper questioned missus Colebrook lifting her chin a little He s already had his supper ma am I took it up myself What was it missus Colebrook asked the question haughtily imperiously Susan s eyes grew cold like steel It was what he asked for ma am an he s ate it Do you want your tea strong or weak ma am missus Colebrook bit her lip I ll not take any tea at all she said coldly And Susan Yes ma am Susan turned her hand on the doorknob Hereafter I will take up Master Keith s meals myself He is in my charge now There was no reply in words But the dining room door after Susan shut with a short crisp snap After supper missus Colebrook went out into the kitchen You may prepare oatmeal and dry toast and a glass of milk for Master Keith to morrow morning Susan I will take them up myself He won t eat em He don t like em not none of them things I think he will if I tell him to At all events they are what he should eat and you may prepare them as I said Very well ma am Susan s lips came together in a thin white line and missus Colebrook left the kitchen Keith did not eat his toast and oatmeal the next morning though his aunt sat on the edge of the bed called him her poor afflicted darling boy and attempted to feed him herself with a spoon Keith turned his face to the wall and said he didn t want any breakfast Whereupon his aunt sighed and stroked his head and Keith hated to have his head stroked as Susan could have told her Of course you don t want any breakfast you poor sightless lamb she moaned And I don t blame you Oh Keithie Keithie when I see you lying there like that with your poor useless eyes But you must eat dear you must eat Now come just a weeny teeny mouthful to please auntie But Keith turned his face even more determinedly to the wall and moved his limbs under the bed clothes in a motion very much like a kick He would have nothing whatever to do with the weeny teeny mouthfuls not even to please auntie And after a vain attempt to remove his tortured head entirely away from those gently stroking ringers he said he guessed he would get up and be dressed Oh Keithie are you well enough dear Are you sure you are strong enough I m sure you must be ill this morning You haven t eaten a bit of breakfast And if anything should happen to you when you were in MY care Of course I m well enough insisted the boy irritably Then I ll get your clothes dear and help you dress if you will be careful not to overdo I don t want any help Why Keithie you ll HAVE to have some one help you How do you suppose your poor blind eyes are going to let you dress yourself all alone when you can t see a thing Why dear child you ll have to have help now about everything you do Now I ll get your clothes Where are they dear In this closet I don t know I don t want em I I ve decided I don t want to get up after all You ARE too tired then Yes I m too tired And Keith with another spasmodic jerk under the bedclothes turned his face to the wall again All right dear you shan t That s the better way I think myself sighed his aunt I wouldn t have you overtax yourself for the world Now isn t there anything ANYTHING I can do for you And Keith said no not a thing not a single thing And his face was still to the wall Then if you re all right absolutely all right I ll go out to walk and get a little fresh air Now don t move Don t stir TRY to go to sleep if you can And if you want anything just ring I ll put this little bell right by your hand on the bed and you must ring if you want anything ANYTHING Then Susan will come and get it for you There the bell s right here See Oh no no you CAN T see she broke off suddenly with a wailing sob Why will I keep talking to you as if you could Well I wish you WOULD talk to me as if I could see stormed Keith passionately sitting upright in bed and flinging out his arms I tell you I don t want to be different It s because I AM different that I am so But his aunt aghast interrupted him and pushed him back Oh Keithie darling lie down You mustn t thrash yourself around like that she remonstrated Why you ll make yourself ill There that s better Now go to sleep I m going out before you can talk any more and get yourself all worked up again she finished hurrying out of the room with the breakfast tray A little later in the kitchen she faced Susan a bit haughtily Master Keith is going to sleep she said putting down the breakfast tray I have left a bell within reach of his hand and he will call you if he wants anything I am going out to get a little air All right ma am Susan kept right on with the dish she was drying You are sure you can hear the bell Oh yes my hearin ain t repaired in the least ma am Susan turned her back and picked up another dish Plainly for Susan the matter was closed missus Colebrook after a vexed biting of her lip and a frowning glance toward Susan s substantial back shrugged her shoulders and left the kitchen A minute later still hatless she crossed the yard and entered the McGuires side door Take the air indeed muttered Susan watching from the kitchen window A whole lot of fresh air she ll get in Mis McGuire s kitchen With another glance to make sure that missus Nettie Colebrook was safely behind the McGuires closed door Susan crossed the kitchen and lifted the napkin of the breakfast tray Humph she grunted angrily surveying the almost untouched breakfast I thought as much But I was ready for you my lady Toast an oatmeal indeed With another glance over her shoulder at the McGuire side door Susan strode to the stove and took from the oven a plate of crisply browned hash and a hot corn muffin Two minutes later with a wonderfully appetizing looking tray she tapped at Keith s door and entered the room Here s your breakfast boy she announced cheerily I didn t want any breakfast came crossly from the bed Of course you didn t want THAT breakfast scoffed Susan airily but you just look an see what I VE brought you Look and see Susan s dismayed face showed that she fully realized what she had said and that she dreaded beyond words its effect on the blind boy in the bed She hesitated and almost dropped the tray in her consternation But the boy turned with a sudden eagerness that put to rout her dismay and sent a glow of dazed wonder to her face instead What HAVE you got Let me see He was sitting up now Hash and johnny cake he crowed as she set the tray before him and he dropped his fingers lightly on the contents of the tray And don t they smell good I don t know I guess I am hungry after all Of course you re hungry Susan s voice was harsh and she was fiercely brushing back the tears Now eat it quick or I ll be sick Jest think what ll happen to Susan if that blessed aunt of yours comes an finds me feedin you red flannel hash an johnny cake Now I ll be up in ten minutes for the tray See that you eat it up every scrap she admonished him as she left the room Susan had found by experience that Keith ate much better when alone She was not surprised therefore though she was very much pleased at sight of the empty plates awaiting her when she went up for the tray at the end of the ten minutes An now what do you say to gettin up she suggested cheerily picking up the tray from the bed and setting it on the table Can I dress myself Of course you can What ll you bet you won t do it five minutes quicker this time too I ll get your clothes Halfway back across the room clothes in hand she was brought to a sudden halt by a peremptory What in the world is the meaning of this It was missus Nettie Colebrook in the doorway I m gettin Keith s clothes He s goin to get up But MASTER Keith said he did not wish to get up Changed his mind maybe The terseness of Susan s reply and the expression on her face showed that the emphasis on the Master was not lost upon her Very well then that will do 
6288_63101_000023_000001	train-clean-360	You may go 
none	none	I will help him dress I don t want any help declared Keith Why Keithie darling of course you want help You forget dear you can t see now and Oh no I don t forget cut in Keith bitterly You don t let me forget a minute not a minute I don t want to get up now anyhow What s the use of gettin up I can t DO anything And he fell back to his old position with his face to the wall There there dear you are ill and overwrought cried missus Colebrook hastening to the bedside It is just as I said you are not fit to get up Then to Susan sharply You may put Master Keith s clothes back in the closet He will not need them to day No ma am I don t think he will need them now Susan s eyes flashed ominously But she hung the clothes back in the closet picked up the tray and left the room Susan s eyes flashed ominously indeed all the rest of the morning while she was about her work and at noon when she gave the call to dinner there was a curious metallic incisiveness in her voice which made the call more strident than usual It was when missus Colebrook went into the kitchen after dinner for Keith s tray that she said coldly to Susan Susan I don t like that absurd doggerel of yours Doggerel Plainly Susan was genuinely ignorant of what she meant Yes that extraordinary dinner call of yours As I said before I don t like it There was a moment s dead silence The first angry flash in Susan s eyes was followed by a demure smile Don t you Why I thought it was real cute now Well I don t You ll kindly not use it any more Susan replied missus Colebrook with dignity Once again there was the briefest of silences then quietly came Susan s answer Oh no of course not ma am I won t when I work for you There Mis Colebrook here s your tray all ready And missus Colebrook without knowing exactly how it happened found herself out in the hall with the tray in her hands CHAPTER IX SUSAN SPEAKS HER MIND How s Keith It was Monday morning and as usual missus McGuire seeing Susan in the clothes yard had come out ostensibly to hang out her own clothes in reality to visit with Susan while she was hanging out hers About as usual Susan snapped out the words and a pillow case with equal vehemence Is he up an dressed I don t know I hain t seen him this mornin but it s safe to say he ain t But I thought he was well enough to be up an dressed right along now He is WELL ENOUGH or rather he WAS Susan snapped open another pillow case and hung it on the line with spiteful jabs of two clothespins Why Susan is he worse You didn t say he was any worse You said he was about as usual Well so he is That s about as usual Look a here Mis McGuire flared Susan turning with fierce suddenness wouldn t YOU be worse if you wasn t allowed to do as much as lift your own hand to your own head Why Susan what do you mean What are you talkin about I m talkin about Keith Burton an Mis Nettie Colebrook I ve GOT to talk about em to somebody I m that full I shall sunburst if I don t She won t let him do a thing for himself not a thing that woman won t But how can he do anything for himself with his poor sightless eyes demanded missus McGuire I don t think I should complain Susan Betts because that poor boy s got somebody at last to take proper care of him But it AIN T takin proper care of him not to let him do things for himself stormed Susan hotly How s he ever goin to mount to anything that s what I want to know if he don t get a chance to begin to mount All them fellers them fellers that was blind an wrote books an give lecturin s an made things perfectly wonderful things with their hands how much do you s pose they would have done if they d had a woman round who said Here let me do it oh you mustn t do that Keithie dear every time they lifted a hand to brush away a hair that was ticklin their nose Oh Susan Well it s so Look a here listen Susan dropped all pretense of work now and came close to the fence She was obviously very much in earnest That boy hain t been dressed but twice since that woman came a week ago She won t let him dress himself alone an now he don t want to be dressed Says he s too tired An she says Of course you re too tired Keithie dear An there he lies day in an day out with his poor sightless eyes turned to the wall He won t eat a thing hardly except what I snuggle up when she s out airin herself He ain t keen on bein fed with a spoon like a baby No boy with any spunk would be But can he feed himself Of course he can if he gets a chance But that ain t all He don t want to be told all the time that he s different from other folks He can t forget that he s blind of course but he wants you to act as if you forgot it I know I ve seen him But she don t forget it a minute not a minute She s always cryin an wringin her hands an sighin Oh Keithie Keithie my poor boy my poor blind boy till it s enough to make a saint say Gosh Well that s only showin sympathy Susan defended missus McGuire I m sure she ought not to be blamed for that He don t want sympathy or if he does he hadn t ought to have it Why Susan Betts I m ashamed of you grudgin that poor blind boy the comfort of a little sympathy My John said yesterday T ain t sympathy he needs Sympathy s a nice soft little paw that pats him to sleep What he needs is a good sharp scratch that will make him get up an do somethin Susan how can you talk like that Cause somebody s got to Susan s voice was shaking now Her hands were clenched so tightly on the fence pickets that the knuckles showed white with the strain Mis McGuire there s a chance maybe that that boy can see There s somethin they can do to his eyes if he gets strong enough to have it done Really To see again Maybe There s a chance They ain t sure But they can t even TRY till he gets well an strong An how s he goin to get well an strong lyin on that bed face to the wall That s what I want to know Hm m I see nodded missus McGuire soberly Then with a sidewise glance into Susan s face she added But ain t that likely to cost some money Yes t is Susan went back to her work abruptly With stern efficiency she shook out a heavy sheet and hung it up Stooping she picked up another one But she did not shake out this With the same curious abruptness that had characterized her movements a few moments before she dropped the sheet back into the basket and came close to the fence again Mis McGuire won t you please let me take a copy of them two women s magazines that you take That is they they do print poetry don t they Why y yes Susan I guess they do Thinkin of sendin em some of yours The question was asked in a derision that was entirely lost on Susan Yes to get some money It was the breathless palpitating Susan that Daniel Burton had seen a week ago and like Daniel Burton on that occasion missus McGuire went down now in defeat before it To to get some money she stammered Yes for Keith s eyes you know panted Susan An when I sell these I m goin to write more lots more Only I ve got to find a place first of course to sell em An I did send em off last week But they was jest cheap magazines an they sent a letter all printed sayin as how they regretted very much they couldn t accept em Like enough they didn t have money enough to pay much for em anyway but of course they didn t say that right out in so many words But as I said they wasn t anything but cheap magazines anyway That s why I want yours jest to get the addressin s of I mean THEY RE first class magazines an they ll pay me a good price I m sure They ll have to to get em Why Mis McGuire I ve got to have the money There ain t nobody but me TO get it An you don t s pose we re goin to let that boy stay blind all his life do you jest for the want of a little money A little money It ll cost a lot of money an you know it Susan Betts cried missus McGuire stirred into sudden speech An the idea of you tryin to EARN it writin poetry For that matter the idea of your earnin it anyway even if you took your wages Oh I d take my wages in a minute if Susan stopped short Her face had grown suddenly red That is I I think I d rather take the poetry money anyway she finished lamely But missus McGuire was not to be so easily deceived Poetry money indeed she scoffed sternly Susan Betts do you know what I believe I believe you don t GET any wages I don t believe that man pays you a red cent from one week s end to the other Now does he You don t dare to answer Susan drew herself up haughtily But her face was still very red Certainly I dare to answer Mis McGuire but I don t care to What mister Burton pays me discerns him an me an I don t care to discourse it in public If you ll kindly lend me them magazines I asked you for a minute ago I ll be very much obliged an I ll try to retaliate in the same way for you some time if I have anything you want Oh good lan Susan Betts if you ain t the beat of em ejaculated missus McGuire I d like to shake you though you don t deserve a shakin I ll admit You deserve well never mind I ll get the magazines right away That s the most I CAN do for you I s pose she flung over her shoulder as she hurried into the house CHAPTER X AND NETTIE COLEBROOK SPEAKS HERS missus Colebrook had been a member of the Burton household a day less than two weeks when she confronted her brother in the studio with this terse statement Daniel either Susan or I leave this house tomorrow morning You can choose between us Nonsense Nettie don t be a fool frowned the man You know very well that we need both you and Susan Susan s a trial I ll admit in a good many ways but I ll wager you d find it more of a trial to get along without her and try to do her work and yours too Nobody thought of getting along without SOMEBODY returned missus Colebrook with some dignity I merely am asking you to dismiss Susan and hire somebody else that is of course if you wish me to stay Change maids that s all The man made an impatient gesture All indeed Very simple the way you put it But see here Nettie this thing you ask is utterly out of the question You don t understand matters at all You mean that you don t intend to dismiss Susan Yes if you will have it put that way just that Very well Since that is your decision I shall have to govern myself accordingly of course I will see you in the morning to say good bye And she turned coldly away What do you mean by that Why that I am going home of course since you think more of having that impossible outrageously impertinent servant girl here than you do me missus Colebrook was nearing the door how Shucks You know better than that Come come if you re having any trouble with Susan settle it with the girl herself won t you Don t come to me with it You KNOW how I dislike anything like this At the door missus Colebrook turned back suddenly with aggressive determination Yes I do know You dislike anything that s disagreeable You always have from the time when you used to run upstairs to the attic and let us make all the explanations to pa and ma when something got lost or broken But see here Daniel Burton you ve GOT to pay attention to this It s your son and your house and your maid And you shall listen to me Well well all right go ahead sighed the man despairingly throwing himself back in his chair What is the trouble What is it that Susan does that annoys you so What does she do What doesn t she do retorted missus Colebrook dropping herself wearily into a chair facing her brother In the first place she s the most wretchedly impertinent creature I ever dreamed of It s always Keith instead of Master Keith and I expect every day it ll be Daniel and Nettie for you and me She shows no sort of respect or deference in her manner or language and well what are you looking like that for she interrupted herself aggrievedly I was only thinking or rather I was TRYING to think of Susan and deference murmured the man dryly Yes that s exactly it missus Colebrook reproved him severely You re laughing You ve always laughed I suspect at her outrageous behavior and that s why she s so impossible in every way Why Daniel Burton I ve actually heard her refuse REFUSE to serve you with something to eat that you d ordered Oh well well what if she has Very likely there was something we had to eat up instead to keep it from spoiling Susan is very economical Nettie I dare say at times when it suits her to be so especially if she can assert her authority over you Why Daniel she s a perfect tyrant to you and you know it She not only tells you what to eat but what to wear and when to wear it your socks your underclothes Why Daniel she actually bosses you Yes yes well never mind shrugged the man a bit irritably We re talking about how she annoys YOU not me remember Well don t you suppose it annoys me to see my own brother so completely under the sway of this serving maid And such a maid Daniel will you tell me where she gets those long words of hers that she mixes up so absurdly Daniel Burton laughed Susan lived with Professor Hinkley for ten years before she came to me The Hinkleys never used words of one or two syllables when they could find one of five or six that would do just as well Susan loves long words So I should judge And those ridiculous rhymes of hers did she learn those also from Professor Hinkley queried missus Colebrook And as for that atrocious dinner call of hers it s a disgrace to any family a positive disgrace Well well why don t you stop her doing it then demanded Daniel Burton still more irritably Go to HER not me Tell her not to I have The tone of her voice was so fraught with meaning that the man looked up sharply Well She said she wouldn t do it when she worked for me Daniel Burton gave a sudden chuckle I can imagine just how she d say that he murmured appreciatively Daniel Burton are you actually going to abet that girl in her wretched impertinence demanded missus Colebrook angrily I tell you I will not stand it Something has got to be done Why she even tries to interfere with the way I take care of your son presumes to give me counsel and advice on the subject if you please Dares to criticize me ME Daniel Burton I tell you I will not stand it You MUST give that woman her walking papers Why Daniel I shall begin to think she has hypnotized you that you re actually afraid of her Was it the scorn in her voice Or was it that Daniel Burton s endurance had snapped at this last straw Whatever it was the man leaped to his feet threw back his shoulders and thrust his hands into his pockets Nettie look here Once for all let us settle this matter I tell you I cannot dismiss Susan and I mean what I say when I use the words can not I literally CAN NOT To begin with she s the kindest hearted creature in the world and she s been devotion itself all these years since since Keith and I have been alone But even if I could set that aside there s something else I can t overlook I I owe Susan considerable money You owe her MONEY Yes her wages She has not had them for some time I must owe her something like fifty or sixty dollars You see we we have had some very unusual and very heavy expenses and I have overdrawn my annuity borrowed on it Susan knew this and insisted on my letting her wages go on for the present More than that she has refused a better position with higher wages I know that The pictures I had hoped to sell He stopped tried to go on failed obviously to control his voice then turned away with a gesture more eloquent than any words could have been missus Colebrook stared frowned and bit her lip Nervously she tapped her foot on the floor as she watched with annoyed eyes her brother tramping up and down up and down the long narrow room Then suddenly her face cleared Oh well that s easily remedied after all She sprang to her feet and hurried from the room Almost immediately she was back a roll of bills in her hand There I thought I had enough money to do it she announced briskly as she came in Now Daniel I LL pay Susan her back wages Indeed you will not 
5984_63095_000059_000000	train-clean-360	The man wheeled sharply 
none	none	an angry red staining his cheeks Oh but Daniel don t you see that ll simplify everything She ll be working for ME then and I But I tell you I won t have interrupted the man then stopped short Susan herself stood in the doorway I guess likely you was talkin so loud you didn t hear me call you to dinner she was saying I ve called you two times already If you want anything fit to eat you d better come quick It ain t gettin any fitter waitin Susan Before Susan could turn away missus Colebrook detained her peremptorily mister Burton tells me that he owes you for past wages Now NETTIE warned the man sharply But with a blithe Nonsense Daniel let me manage this missus Colebrook turned again to Susan The man not unlike the little Daniel of long ago who fled to the attic shrugged his shoulders with a gesture of utter irresponsibility turned his back and walked to the farther side of the room Susan began missus Colebrook again still blithely but with just a shade of haughtiness my brother tells me your wages are past due that he owes you at least fifty dollars Now I m going to pay them for him Susan In fact I m going to pay you sixty dollars so as to be sure to cover it Will that be quite satisfactory Susan stared frankly You mean ME take money from you ma am to pay my back wages she asked Yes But Susan paused and threw a quick glance toward the broad back of the man at the end of the room Then she turned resolutely to missus Colebrook her chin a little higher than usual Oh no thank you I ain t needin the money Mis Colebrook an I d ruther wait for mister Burton anyway she finished cheerfully as she turned to go Nonsense Susan of COURSE you need the money Everybody can make use of a little money I guess Surely there s SOMETHING you want With her hand almost on the doorknob Susan suddenly whisked about her face alight Oh yes yes I forgot Mis Colebrook she cried eagerly There is somethin I want an I ll take it please an thank you kindly There that s better nodded missus Colebrook And I ve got it right here so you see you don t have to wait even a minute she smiled holding out the roll of bills Still with the eager light on her face Susan reached for the money Thank you oh thank you An it will go quite a ways won t it for Keith I mean The But with sudden sharpness missus Colebrook interrupted her Susan how many times have I told you to speak of my nephew as Master Keith Furthermore I shall have to remind you once more that you are trying to interfere altogether too much in his care In fact Susan I may as well speak plainly For some time past you have failed to give satisfaction You are paid in full now I believe with some to spare perhaps You may work the week out After that we shall no longer require your services The man at the end of the room wheeled sharply and half started to come forward Then with his habitual helpless gesture he turned back to his old position Susan her face eloquent with amazed unbelief turned from one to the other You mean you don t mean Mis Colebrook be you tryin to dismissal me missus Colebrook flushed and bit her lip I am dismissing you yes Once more Susan in dazed unbelief looked from one to the other Her eyes dwelt longest on the figure of the man at the end of the room mister Burton do you want me to go she asked at last The man turned irritably with a shrug and a swift outflinging of his hands Of course I don t want you to go Susan But what can I do I have no money to pay you as you know very well I have no right to keep you of course I should advise you to go And he turned away again Susan s face cleared Pooh Oh that s all right then she answered pleasantly Mis Colebrook I m sorry to be troublin you but I shall have to give back that ere notice I ain t goin Once again missus Colebrook flushed and bit her lip That will do Susan You forget You re not working for mister Burton now You re working for me For YOU Certainly Didn t I just pay you your wages for some weeks past Susan s tight clutch on the roll of bills loosened so abruptly that the money fell to the floor But at once Susan stooped and picked it up The next moment she had crossed the room and thrust the money into missus Colebrook s astonished fingers I don t want your money Mis Colebrook not on them terms even for Keith I know I hain t earned any the other way yet but I hain t tried all the magazines There s more lots more Her voice faltered and almost broke I ll do it yet some way you see if I don t But I won t take this Why Mis Colebrook do you think I d leave NOW with that poor boy blind an his father so wrought up he don t have even his extraordinary common sense about his flannels an socks an what to eat an no money to pay the bills with either An him bein pestered the life out of him with them intermittent dunnin grocers an milkmen Well I guess not You couldn t hire me to go Mis Colebrook Daniel are you going to stand there and permit me to be talked to like this appealed missus Colebrook What can I do Was there a ghost of a twinkle in Daniel Burton s eyes as he turned with a shrug and a lift of his eyebrows If YOU haven t the money to hire her But missus Colebrook with an indignant toss of her head had left the room mister Burton Before the man could speak Susan had the floor again Can t you do somethin sir Can t you Do something Susan frowned the man Yes with your sister urged Susan I don t mean because she s so haughty an impious I can stand that It s about Keith I m talkin about mister Burton Keith won t never get well never so s he can have that operator on his eyes unless he takes some exercise an gets his strength back The nurse an the doctor they both said he wouldn t Yes yes I know Susan fumed the man impatiently beginning to pace up and down the room And that s just what we re trying to do get his strength back But he ain t he won t he can t choked Susan feverishly mister Burton I KNOW you don t want to talk about it but you ve got to I m all Keith s got to look out for him The father of Keith gave an inarticulate gasp but Susan plunged on unheeding An he ll never get well if he ain t let to get up an stand an walk an eat an sit down himself But Mis Colebrook won t let him She won t let him do anything She keeps sayin Don t do it oh don t do it all the time when she ought to say Do it do it do it mister Burton cryin an wringin your hands an moanin Oh Keithie darling won t make a boy grow red blood an make you feel so fine you want to knock a man down mister Burton I want you to tell that woman to let me take care of that boy for jest one week ONE WEEK an her not to come near him with her snivelin an But Daniel Burton with two hands upflung and a head that ducked as if before an oncoming blow had rushed from the room For the second time that day Daniel Burton had fled to the attic

5984_63095_000003_000000	train-clean-360	missus Colebrook went home the next day 
5984_63095_000003_000001	train-clean-360	She wore the air of an injured martyr at breakfast 
5984_63095_000003_000002	train-clean-360	She told her brother that of course if he preferred to have an ignorant servant girl take care of his poor afflicted son she had nothing to say but that certainly he could not expect HER to stay too especially after being insulted as she had been 
none	none	Daniel Burton had remonstrated feebly shrugged his shoulders and flung his arms about in his usual gestures of impotent annoyance 
5984_63095_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Susan in the kitchen went doggedly about her work singing meanwhile what Keith called her mad song 
none	none	When Susan was particularly worked up over something jest b ilin inside as she expressed it she always sang this song her own composition to the tune of When Johnny Comes Marching Home I ve taken my worries an taken my woes I have I have An shut em up where nobody knows I have I have I chucked em down that s what I did An now I m sittin upon the lid An we ll all feel gay when Johnny comes marchin home I m sittin upon the lid I am 
5984_63095_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Hurrah 
none	none	Hurrah I m tryin to be a little lamb Hurrah Hurrah But I m feelin more like a great big slam Than a nice little peaceful woolly lamb But we ll all feel gay when Johnny comes marchin home When Daniel Burton this morning therefore heard Susan singing this song he was in no doubt as to Susan s state of mind a fact which certainly did not add to his own serenity 
5984_63095_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Upstairs Keith wearily indifferent as to everything that was taking place about him lay motionless as usual his face turned toward the wall 
5984_63095_000010_000000	train-clean-360	And at ten o clock missus Colebrook went 
5984_63095_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Five minutes later Daniel Burton entered the kitchen a proceeding so extraordinary that Susan broke off her song in the middle of a Hurrah and grew actually pale 
5984_63095_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 What is it KEITH 
5984_63095_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Is anything the matter with Keith she faltered 
5984_63095_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Ignoring her question the man strode into the room 
5984_63095_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Susan this time you ve done it he ejaculated tersely 
5984_63095_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Done it to Keith ME 
5984_63095_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Why mister Burton what do you mean 
5984_63095_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Is Keith worse chattered Susan with dry lips 
none	none	It was only a little hash I took up He simply won t eat that oatmeal stuff an
5984_63095_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 No no I don t mean the hash interrupted the man irritably 
5984_63095_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 Keith is all right that is he is just as he has been 
5984_63095_000015_000002	train-clean-360	It s my sister missus Colebrook 
5984_63095_000015_000003	train-clean-360	She s gone 
5984_63095_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Gone for good 
5984_63095_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes she s gone home 
5984_63095_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Glory be 
5984_63095_000018_000001	train-clean-360	The color came back to Susan s face in a flood and frank delight chased the terror from her eyes 
5984_63095_000018_000002	train-clean-360	 Now we can do somethin worthwhile 
5984_63095_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I reckon you ll find you have to do something Susan 
none	none	You know very well I can t afford to hire a nurse now
5984_63095_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t want one 
5984_63095_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 But there s all the other work too 
none	none	Work Why mister Burton I won t mind a little work if I can have that blessed boy all to myself with no one to feed him oatmeal mush with a spoon an snivel over him You jest wait The first elemental thing is to learn him self defiance so he can do things for himself Then he ll begin to get his health an strength for the operator You re forgetting the money Susan It costs money for that 
5984_63095_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Susan s face fell 
none	none	Yes sir I know She hesitated then went on her color deepening An I hain t sold none o them poems yet But there s other magazines a whole lot of em that I hain t tried Somebody s sure to take em some time
5984_63095_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I m glad your courage is still good Susan but I m afraid the dear public is going to appreciate your poems about the way it does my pictures shrugged the man bitterly as he turned and left the room 
5984_63095_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Not waiting to finish setting her kitchen in order Susan ran up the back stairs to Keith s room 
none	none	Well your aunt is gone an I m on An here we are together We ll chuck our worries into pawn An how do you like the weather she greeted him gayly
5984_63095_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 How about gettin up 
none	none	Come on 
5984_63095_000029_000003	train-clean-360	Such a lazy boy 
none	none	Here it is away in the middle of the forenoon an you abed like this 
5984_63095_000030_000000	train-clean-360	But it was not to be so easy this time 
5984_63095_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Keith was not to be cajoled into getting up and dressing himself even to beat Susan s record Steadfastly he resisted all efforts to stir him into interest or action and a dismayed disappointed Susan had to go downstairs in acknowledged defeat 
5984_63095_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 But land s sake what could you expect she muttered to herself after a sorrowful meditation before the kitchen fire 
5984_63095_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 You can t put a backbone into a jellyfish by jest showin him the bone an that s what his aunt has made him a flappy transparallel jellyfish 
5984_63095_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Drat her 
none	none	But I ain t goin to give up Not much I ain t And Susan attacked the little kitchen stove with a vigor that would have brought terror to the clinkers of a furnace fire pot 
5984_63095_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Susan did not attempt again that day to get Keith up and dressed and she gave him his favorite pop overs for supper with a running fire of merry talk and jingles that contained never a reference to the unpleasant habit of putting on clothes But the next morning after she had given Keith his breakfast not of toast and oatmeal she suggested blithely that he get up and be dressed 
5984_63095_000032_000001	train-clean-360	When he refused she tried coaxing mildly then more strenuously 
5984_63095_000032_000002	train-clean-360	When this failed she tried to sting his pride by telling him she did not believe he could get up now anyhow and dress himself 
5984_63095_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 All right Susan 
5984_63095_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 All right Susan let it go that I can t 
5984_63095_000033_000001	train-clean-360	I don t want to anyhow sighed the boy with impatient weariness 
5984_63095_000033_000002	train-clean-360	 Say can t you let a fellow alone 
5984_63095_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Susan drew a long breath and held it suspended for a moment 
5984_63095_000034_000001	train-clean-360	She had the air of one about to make a dreaded plunge 
5984_63095_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 No I can t let you alone Keith she replied voice and manner now coldly firm 
5984_63095_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not 
none	none	What s the use when I don t want to get up How about thinkin for once what somebody else wants young man Susan caught her breath again and glanced furtively at the half averted face on the pillow Then doggedly she went on Maybe you think I hain t got anything to do but trespass up an down them stairs all day waitin on you when you are perfectly capacious of waitin on yourself SOME
5984_63095_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Why SUSAN There was incredulous hurt amazement in the boy s voice but Susan was visibly steeling herself against it 
none	none	What do you think that I m loafin all day an your aunt gone now an me with it all on my hands she demanded her stony gaze carefully turned away from the white face on the pillow An to have to keep runnin up here all the mornin when I ve got to do the dishes an bake bread an make soap an
5984_63095_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 If you ll get my clothes Susan I ll get up said Keith very quietly from the bed 
none	none	And Susan not daring to unclose her lips wrested the garments from the hooks dropped them on to the chair by the bed and fled from the room But she had not reached the hall below when the sobs shook her frame An me talkin like that when I d be willin to walk all day on my hands an knees if t would help him one little minute she choked Barely had Susan whipped herself into presentable shape again when Keith s voice at the kitchen door caused her to face about with a startled cry
5984_63095_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I m downstairs Susan The boy s voice challenged hers for coldness now 
5984_63095_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll take my meals down here after this 
5984_63095_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Why Keith however in the world did you Then Susan pulled herself up 
5984_63095_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 Good boy Keith 
5984_63095_000045_000002	train-clean-360	That WILL make it lots easier she said cheerfully impersonally turning away and making a great clatter of pans in the sink 
5984_63095_000046_000000	train-clean-360	But later at least once every half hour through that long forenoon Susan crept softly through the side hall to the half open living room door where she could watch Keith 
none	none	She watched him get up and move slowly along the side of the room picking his way 
5984_63095_000046_000002	train-clean-360	She watched him pause and move hesitating fingers down the backs of the chairs that he encountered 
5984_63095_000046_000003	train-clean-360	But when she saw him stop and finger the books on the little table by the window she crept back to her kitchen and rattled still more loudly the pots and pans in the sink 
5984_63095_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Just before the noon meal Keith appeared once more at the kitchen door 
5984_63095_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Susan would it bother you very much if I ate out here with you he asked 
5984_63095_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 With me 
none	none	Nonsense You ll eat in the dinin room with your dad of course Why what would he say to your eatin out here with me That s just it 
5984_63095_000050_000001	train-clean-360	It s dad 
5984_63095_000050_000002	train-clean-360	He d like it I m sure insisted the boy feverishly 
5984_63095_000050_000003	train-clean-360	 You know sometimes I I don t get any food on my fork when I eat an I have to to feel for things an it it must be disagreeable to see me 
none	none	An you know he never liked disagreeable
5984_63095_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Now Keith Burton you stop right where you are interrupted Susan harshly 
none	none	You re goin to eat with your father where you belong An do you now run back to the settin room I ve got my dinner to get 
5984_63095_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Keith had not disappeared down the hall however before Susan was halfway up the back stairs 
5984_63095_000052_000001	train-clean-360	A moment later she was in the studio 
none	none	Daniel Burton you re goin to have
5984_63095_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 company 
none	none	to dinner she panted Company Yes 
5984_63095_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Your son KEITH 
5984_63095_000055_000002	train-clean-360	The man drew back perceptibly 
none	none	There now Daniel Burton don t you go to scowlin an lookin for a place to run just because you hate to see him feel round for what he eats
5984_63095_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 But Susan it breaks my heart moaned the man turning quite away 
5984_63095_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 What if it does 
5984_63095_000058_000001	train-clean-360	Ain t his broke too 
5984_63095_000058_000002	train-clean-360	Can t you think of him a little 
none	none	Let me tell you this Daniel Burton that boy has more consolation for your feelin s than you have for his every time Didn t he jest come to me an beg to eat with me cause his dad didn t like to see disagreeable things an The man wheeled sharply
5984_63095_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Did Keith do that 
none	none	He did jest now sir All right Susan 
5984_63095_000062_000001	train-clean-360	I I don t think you ll have to say any more 
5984_63095_000063_000000	train-clean-360	And Susan after a sharp glance into the man s half averted face said no more 
5984_63095_000063_000001	train-clean-360	A moment later she had left the room 
none	none	At dinner that day with red eyes but a vivacious manner she waited on a man who incessantly talked of nothing in particular and a boy who sat white faced and silent eating almost nothing CHAPTER XII CALLERS FOR KEITHIE And so inch by inch Susan fought her way and inch by inch she gained ground Sometimes it was by coaxing sometimes by scolding perhaps most often by taunts and dares and shrewd appeals to Keith s pride But by whatever it was each day saw some stride forward some new victory that Keith had won over his blindness until by the end of the week the boy could move about the house and wait upon himself with a facility almost unbelievable when one remembered his listless helplessness of a week before Then one day there entered into the case a brand new element a dainty element in white muslin and fluttering blue ribbons Mazie Sanborn and Dorothy Parkman We heard Keithie was lots better and up and dressed now chirped Mazie when Susan answered her ring and so we ve brought him some flowers Please can t we see him Susan hesitated Susan had not forgotten Keith s feverish retreat from Mazie s greeting called up to the veranda the month before But then for that matter had he not retreated from everything until she determinedly took him in hand And he must some time begin to mingle with the world outside the four walls of his house Why not now What better chance could she hope to have for him to begin than this Where could she find two more charmingly alluring ambassadors of that outside world than right here on the door step now Susan s lips snapped together with a little defiant nod of her head then parted in a cordial smile Sure you may see him she cried an it s glad that I am to have you come It ll do him good Come in come in And with only a heightened color to show her trepidation as to the reception that might be accorded her charges she threw open the sitting room door Well Keith here s company come on purpose to see you An they ve brought you some flowers she announced gayly No no Susan I I don t want to see them stammered the boy He had leaped to his feet a painful red flooding his face Well I like that bridled Mazie with playful indignation and when Dorothy and I have taken all this trouble to come and Is Dorothy here too interrupted the boy sharply Yes Keith I am here Dorothy was almost crying and her voice sounded harsh and unnatural And we brought you these interposed Mazie brightly crossing the room to his side and holding out the flowers Then with a little embarrassed laugh as he did not take them she thrust them into his fingers Oh I forgot You can t see them can you Mazie remonstrated the half smothered voice of Dorothy But it was Susan who came promptly to the rescue Yes an ain t they pretty she cried taking them from Keith s unresisting fingers Here let me put em in water an you two sit down I always did love coronation pinks she declared briskly as she left the room She was not gone long Very quickly she came back with the flowers in a vase Keith had dropped back into his chair but he was plainly so unwilling a host that Susan evidently thought best to assist him She set the vase on a little stand near Keith s chair then dropped herself on to the huge haircloth sofa near by My but I don t mind settin myself awhile she smiled Guess I m tired I should think you would be Mazie grown suddenly a bit stiff and stilted was obviously trying to be very polite and grown up There must be an awful lot to do here Mother says she don t see how you stand it Pooh Not so very much scoffed Susan instantly on her guard Keith here s gettin so smart he won t let me do anything hardly for him now Oh but there must be a lot of things began Mazie that he can t do and Er what a lovely big sunny room interrupted Dorothy hastily so hastily that Susan threw a sharp glance into her face to see if she were really interrupting Mazie for a purpose I love big rooms Yes so do I chimed in Mazie And I always wanted to see the inside of this house too What for Keith s curiosity got the better of his vexed reticence and forced the question from his lips Oh just cause I ve heard folks say twas so wonderful old you know and full of rare old things and there wasn t another for miles around like it But I don t see That is she corrected herself stumbling a little you probably don t keep them in this room anyway Why they do too interfered Dorothy with suddenly pink cheeks This room is just full of the loveliest kind of old things just like the things father is always getting only nicer Now that right there in the corner all full of drawers We ve got one almost just exactly like that out home and father just dotes on it That IS a a highboy isn t it she appealed to Susan And it is very old isn t it A highboy Old Lan sakes child laughed Susan Maybe tis I ain t sayin tisn t though I m free to confess I never heard it called that But it s old enough if that s all it needs it s old enough to be a highMAN by this time I reckon chuckled Susan mister Burton was tellin me one day how it belonged to his great grand mother Kind of funny looking though isn t it commented Mazie Father d love it so d Aunt Hattie avowed Dorothy evidently not slow to detect the lack of appreciation in Mazie s voice And I do too she finished with a tinge of defiance Mazie laughed Well all right you may for all I care she retorted Then to Keith she turned with sudden disconcerting abruptness Say Keith what do you do all day It was Susan who answered this Indeed it was Susan who answered a good many of the questions during the next fifteen minutes Some she answered because she did not want Keith to answer them More she answered because Keith would not answer them To tell the truth Keith was anything but a polite gracious host He let it be plainly understood that he was neither pleased at the call nor interested in the conversation And the only semblance of eagerness in his demeanor that afternoon was when his young visitors rose to go In spite of Keith s worse than indifference however Susan was convinced that this call and others like it were exactly what was needed for Keith s best welfare and development With all her skill and artifice therefore she exerted herself to make up for Keith s negligence She told stories rattled off absurd jingles and laughed and talked with each young miss in turn determined to make the call so great a success that the girls would wish to come again When she had bowed them out and closed the door behind them she came back to Keith intending to remonstrate with him for his very ungracious behavior But before she could open her lips Keith himself had the floor Susan Betts he began passionately as soon as she entered the room don t you ever let those girls in again I won t have them I WON T HAVE THEM I tell you Oh for shame Keith and when they were so kind and thoughtful too It wasn t kindness and thoughtfulness resented the boy It was spying out They came to see how I took it I know em And that Dorothy Parkman I don t know WHY she came She said long ago that she couldn t bear to look at em Look at them Yes blind folks Her father is a big oculist doctors eyes you know She told me once And she said she couldn t bear to look at them that An eye doctor a big one Susan was suddenly excited alert Yes yes And Where s he live I don t know Where she does I s pose I don t know where that is She s here most of the time and Is he a real big one a really truly big one Yes yes I guess so Keith had fallen wearily back in his chair his strength spent Dad said he was one of the biggest in the country And of course lots of of blind people go there and she sees them Only she says she can t bear to see them that she won t look at them And and she shan t come here she shan t Susan to look at me and But Susan was not listening now With chin up tilted and a new fire in her eyes she had turned toward the kitchen door Two days later on her way to the store Susan spied Dorothy Parkman across the street Without hesitation or ceremony she went straight across and spoke to her Is it true that your father is a big occultist one of the biggest there is she demanded A what Dorothy frowned slightly Occultist doctors folks eyes you know Is he I heard he was Oh Y yes yes he is Miss Dorothy was giggling a bit now Then listen In her eagerness Susan had caught the girl s sleeve and held it Can t you get him to come on an see you right away quick Don t he want to take you home or or something Dorothy laughed merrily Why Susan are you in such a hurry as all that to get rid of me Did I act so bad the other day that A sudden change crossed her face Her eyes grew soft and luminous Was it for Keith that you wanted father Susan Yes Susan s eyes blurred and her voice choked Well then I m glad to tell you he is coming by and by He s coming to take me home for Christmas But he isn t going to stay long That s all right that s all right retorted Susan a little breathlessly If he d jest look at the boy s eyes an tell if if he could fix em later You see we we couldn t have it done now cause there ain t any money to pay But we ll have it later We ll sure have it later an then Of course he ll look at them interrupted Dorothy eagerly He ll love to I know He s always so interested in eyes and new cases And and don t worry about the other part the money you know nodded Dorothy hurrying away then before Susan could protest As it happened Keith was more difficult than usual that afternoon and Susan thinking to rouse him from his lassitude suddenly determined to tell him all about the wonderful piece of good fortune in store for him How d you like to have that little Miss Dorothy s daddy see your eyes honey she began eagerly an tell I wouldn t let him see them Keith spoke coldly decisively Oh but he s one of the biggest occultists there is an I suppose you mean oculist Susan interrupted Keith still more coldly but that doesn t make any difference I don t want him But Keith if he I tell you I won t have him snapped Keith irritably But you ve got to have somebody an if he s the biggest All the eager light had died out of Susan s face I don t care if he is the biggest he s Dorothy Parkman s father and that s enough I WON T HAVE HIM No no well all right And Susan terrified and dismayed hurried from the room But though Susan was dismayed and terrified she was far from being subdued In the kitchen she lifted her chin defiantly All right Master Keith she muttered to herself You can say what you want to but you ll have him jest the same only you won t know he s HIM I ll jest tell him to call hisself another name for you An some time I ll find out what there is behind that Dorothy Parkman business But tain t till Christmas an that s most two months off yet Time enough for trouble when trouble knocks at the door an till it does knock jest keep peggin away CHAPTER XIII FREE VERSE A LA SUSAN And persistently systematically Susan did indeed keep peggin away No sooner had she roused Keith to the point of accomplishing one task than she set for him another No sooner could he pilot himself about one room than she inveigled him into another And when he could go everywhere about the house she coaxed him out into the yard It was harder here for Keith had a morbid fear of being stared at And only semi occasionally would he consent at all to going out It was then that with stern determination Susan sought Daniel Burton Look a here Daniel Burton she accosted him abruptly I ve done all I can now an it s up to you The man looked up plainly startled Why Susan you don t mean you aren t GOING are you Goin nothin shucks tossed Susan to one side disdainfully I mean that Keith ain t goin to get that good red blood he s needin sittin round the house here He s got to go off in the woods an walk an tramp an run an scuff leaves An you ve got to go with him I can t can I The man shifted his position irritably Do you think that boy will let me lead him through the streets Susan Well I know he won t I didn t say lead him I said go WITH him There s an awful lot of difference between leadin an accommodatin We don t none of us like to be led but we don t mind goin WITH folks most anywheres Put your arm into his an walk together He ll walk that way I ve tried it An to see him you wouldn t know he was blind at all Oh yes I know you re hangin back an don t want to I know you hate to see him or be with him cause it makes you KNOW what a terrible thing it is that s come to you an him But you ve got to Daniel Burton You an me is all he s got to stand between him an utter misery I can feed his stomach an make him do the metaphysical things but it s you that s got to feed his soul an make him do the menial things Oh Susan Susan half groaned the man There was a smile on his lips but there were tears in his eyes Well it s so argued Susan earnestly Oh I read to him of course I read him everything I can get hold of especially about men an women that have become great an famous an extinguished even if they was blind or deaf an dumb or lame especially blind But I can t learn him books mister Burton You ve got to do that You ve got to be eyes for him an he s got to go to school to you mister Burton Susan s voice grew husky and unsteady you ve got a chance now to paint bigger an grander pictures than you ever did before only you won t be paintin em on canvas backs You ll be paintin em on that boy s soul an you ll be usin words instead of them little brushes You ve put that very well Susan It was the man who spoke unsteadily huskily now I don t know about that but I do know that them pictures you re goin to paint for him is goin to be the makin of him Why mister Burton we can t have him lazin behind cause when he does get back his eyes we don t want him to be too far behind his class But what if he doesn t ever get his eyes Susan Then he ll need it all the more But he s goin to get em mister Burton Don t you remember The nurse said if he got well an strong he could have somethin done I ve got the doctor an all I need now is the money An an that makes me think She hesitated growing suddenly pink and embarrassed Then resolutely she put her hand into the pocket of her apron and pulled out two folded papers I was goin to tell you about these anyhow so I might as well do it now she explained You know them them other poems didn t sell much there was only one went an the man wouldn t take that till he d made me promise he could print my letter too that I d wrote with it jest as if that was worth anything but he only paid a measly dollar anyhow Susan s voice faltered a little though her chin was at a brave tilt An I guess now I know the reason Them kind of poems ain t stylish no longer Rhymes has gone out Everything s free verse now I ve been readin up about it So I ve wrote some of em They re real easy to do jest lines chopped off free an easy anywheres that it happens only have some long an some short for notoriety you know like this And she read A great big cloud That was black Came up Out of the West An I knew Then For sure That a storm was brewin An it brewed Now that was dead easy anybody could see that But it s kind of pretty I think too jest the same Them denatured poems are always pretty I think about trees an grass an flowers an the sky you know Don t you Why er y yes of course murmured the man faintly I tried a love poem next I don t write them very often They re so common You see em everywhere you know But I thought I would try it twould be different anyhow in this new kind of verses So I wrote this Oh love of mine I love Thee Thy hair is yellow like the Golden squash Thy neck so soft An slender like a goose Is encompassed in filtered lace So rich an Rare Thy eyes in thy pallid face like Blueberries in a Saucer of milk Oh love of mine I love Thee Have you sent any of these away yet Susan Daniel Burton was on his feet now his back carefully turned No not yet but I m goin to pretty quick an I guess them will sell Susan nodded happily and smiled But almost instantly her face grew gravely earnest again But all the money in the world ain t goin to do no good mister Burton unless we do our part an our part is to get him well an strong for that operator Now I m goin to send Keith in to you I ain t goin to TELL him he s goin to walk with you cause if I did he wouldn t come But I m expectin you to take him jest the same she finished severely as she left the room Keith and his father went to walk It was the first of many such walks Almost every one of these crisp November days found the two off on a tramp somewhere And because Daniel Burton was careful always to accompany never to lead the boy s step gained day by day in confidence and his face in something very like interest And always for cold and stormy days there were the books at home Daniel Burton was not painting pictures pigment pictures these days His easel was empty The Woodland Path long since finished had been sent away to be sold Most of Daniel Burton s paintings were sent away to be sold so that was nothing new What was new however was the fact that no fresh canvas was placed on the easel to take the place of the picture sent away Daniel Burton had begun no new picture The easel indeed was turned face to the wall And yet Daniel Burton was painting pictures wonderful pictures His brushes were words his colors were the blue and gold and brown and crimson of the wide autumn landscape his inspiration was the hungry light on a boy s face and his canvas was the soul of the boy behind it Most assuredly Daniel Burton was giving himself now heart and mind and body to his son Even the lynx eyed alert Susan had no fault to find Daniel Burton most emphatically was doing his part CHAPTER XIV A SURPRISE ALL AROUND The week before Christmas Dorothy Parkman brought a tall dignified looking man to the Burtons shabby but still beautiful colonial doorway Dorothy had not seen Keith except on the street since her visit with Mazie in October Two or three times the girls had gone to the house with flowers or fruit but Keith had stubbornly refused to see them in spite of Susan s urgings To day Dorothy with this evidently in mind refused Susan s somewhat dubious invitation to come in Oh no thank you I ll not come in she smiled I only brought father that s all And oh I do hope he can do something she faltered unsteadily And Susan saw that her eyes were glistening with tears as she turned away In the hall Susan caught the doctor s arm nervously doctor Parkman there s somethin My name is Stewart interrupted the doctor What s that What s that cried Susan unconsciously tightening her clasp on his arm Ain t you Dorothy Parkman s father I m her stepfather She was nine when I married missus Parkman her mother Then your name ain t Parkman at all Oh glory be ejaculated Susan ecstatically Well if that ain t the luckiest thing ever Lucky frowned the doctor looking thoroughly mystified and not altogether pleased Susan gave an embarrassed laugh There now if that ain t jest like me to fly off on a tandem like that without a word of exploitation It s jest that I m so glad I won t have to ask you to come under a resumed name Under a what madam The doctor was looking positively angry now Moreover with no uncertain determination he was trying to draw himself away from Susan s detaining fingers Oh please doctor please don t be mad Susan had both hands hold of his arm now Twas for Keith an I knew you d be willin to do anything for him when you understood jest as I am You see I didn t want him to know you was Dorothy s father she plunged on breathlessly an so I was goin to ask you to let me call you somethin else not Parkman An then when I found that you didn t have to have a resumed name that you was already somebody else that is that you was really you only Keith wouldn t know you was you I was so glad Oh I see The doctor was still frowning though his lips were twitching a little But er do you mind telling me why I can t be I What s the matter with Dorothy s father Nothin sir It s jest a notion Keith won t see Dorothy nor Mazie nor none of em He thinks they come jest to spy out how he looks an acts an he got it into his head that if you was Dorothy s father he wouldn t see you He hates to be pitied an stared at Oh I see A sympathetic understanding came into the doctor s eyes The anger was all gone now Very well As it happens I m really doctor Stewart So you may call me that with all honesty and we ll be very careful not to let the boy know I ever heard of Dorothy Parkman How about the boy s father Does he know Yes sir I told him who you was an that you was comin an I told him we wasn t goin to let Keith know An he said twas absurd an we couldn t help lettin him know But I told him I knew better an twas all right Oh you did The doctor was regarding Susan with a new interest in his eyes Yes an tis you see Where is mister Burton In his studio shut up He ll see you afterwards I told him he d GOT to do that Eh What The doctor s eyes flew wide open See you afterwards I told him he d ought to be in the room with you when you was examplin Keith s eyes But I knew he wouldn t do that He never will do such like things makes him feel too bad An he wanted ME to find out what you said But I told him HE D got to do that But oh doctor I do hope oh please please say somethin good if you can An now I ll take you in It s right this way through the sittin room By Jove what a beauty Halfway across the living room the doctor had come to a pause before the mahogany highboy THAT Yes that The whimsical smile in the doctor s eyes showed that he was not unappreciative of the scorn in Susan s voice By George it IS a beauty I ve got one myself but it doesn t compare with that for a minute H m And that s not the only treasure you have here I see he finished his admiring gaze roving about the room We ve got some newer better stuff in the parlor These are awful old things in here apologized Susan Yes I see they are old things The whimsical smile had come back to the doctor s eyes as he followed Susan through the doorway Keith s upstairs in his room an I m takin you up the back way so s mister Burton won t hear He asked me to He didn t want to know jest exactly when you was here mister Burton must be a brave man commented the doctor dryly He ain t not when it comes to seein disagreeable things or folks hurt answered the literal Susan cheerfully But he ll see you all right when it s over Her lips came together with a sudden grimness The next moment throwing open Keith s door her whole expression changed She had eyes and thoughts but for the blind boy over by the window The doctor too obviously by the keen professional alertness that transfigured his face at that moment had eyes and thoughts but for that same blind boy over by the window Well Keith here s doctor Stewart to see you boy doctor Stewart Keith was on his feet startled uncertain Yes doctor Stewart Susan repeated the name with clear emphasis He was in town an jest came up to look at you He s a big kind doctor dear an you ll like him I know At the door Susan turned to the doctor An when when you re done sir if you ll jest come down them stairs to the kitchen please TO THE KITCHEN she repeated hurrying out before Keith could remonstrate Down in the kitchen Susan took a pan of potatoes to peel and when long hours later after the doctor had come downstairs had talked with mister Burton and had gone Susan went to get those potatoes to boil for dinner she found that all but two of them had been peeled and peeled and peeled until there was nothing left but peelings Susan was peeling the next to the last potato when the doctor came down to the kitchen Well She was on her feet instantly The doctor s face was grave yet his eyes were curiously alight They seemed to be looking through and beyond Susan I don t know I THINK I have good news but I m not sure But there s a chance Yes but There was a moment s silence then with an indrawing of his breath the doctor s soul seemed to come back from a long journey I think I know what is the matter The doctor was looking at Susan now not through her If it s what I think it is it s a very rare disease one we do not often find But could you can you is it possible to to cure it We can operate yes but it s six to half a dozen whether it s successful or not They ve just about broken even so far the cases I ve known about But they ve been interesting most interesting The doctor was far away again But there s a chance and if there is a chance I d want to take it cried Susan Wouldn t you There was no answer Susan hesitated threw a hurried glance into the doctor s preoccupied face then hurried on again feverishly Doctor there s somethin I ve got to to speak to you about before you see mister Burton It it it ll cost an awful lot I s pose There was no answer Susan cleared her throat It it ll cost an awful lot won t it doctor she asked in a louder voice Eh What Cost Oh yes yes it is an expensive operation The doctor spoke unconcernedly He merely glanced at Susan then resumed his fixed gaze into space Well doctor Susan cleared her throat again This time she caught hold of the doctor s sleeve as if to pull him bodily back to a realizing sense of her presence About the money we haven t got it An that s what I wanted to speak to you about mister Burton hain t got any He s already spent more n he s got part of next year s annual I mean Some day he ll have more a whole lot more when Mis Holworthy his third cousin dies Twas her husband that gave him the annual you understand an when she dies it ll come to him in a plump sum But tain t his now an course it won t be till she goes an course tain t for us to dodge her footsteps hopin she ll jest naturally stop walkin some day though I m free to confess she has lost most all her facilities bein deaf an lame an some blind an I can t exactly see the harm in wishin she had got em all back in Heaven I mean But course I don t say so to him An as I said before we hain t got money now not any An an his last pictures didn t sell any better than the others she went on a little breathlessly Then there was me that is I WAS goin to get some money but but well MY pictures didn t sell either She paused to wet her lips But I ve thought it all out an there s a way You you d have to have Keith with you somewheres wouldn t you To operate Oh yes yes A long time Eh What Oh yes we would have to have him a long time probably In fact time is one of the very biggest factors in such cases for the after treatment you know And we must have him where we can watch him of course Oh Then that s all right then I can manage it fine sighed Susan showing by the way her whole self relaxed how great had been the strain Then I ll come right away to work for you To what The doctor suddenly came back to earth To work for you in your kitchen I mean nodded Susan I ll send mister Burton to his sister s then I ll come to you an I ll come impaired to stay till I ve paid it up every cent Good Heavens woman ejaculated the man What are you talking about Oh please please don t say that I can t besought Susan her fearful eyes on his perturbed face I ll work real well truly I will An I m a real good cook honest I am when I have a super abundance to do it with butter an eggs an nice roasts An I won t bother you a mite with my poetry I don t make it much now anyhow An oh doctor you ve GOT to let me do it it s the only way there is to p pay Her voice choked into silence Susan turned her back abruptly Not even for Keith could Susan let any one see her cry Pay And do you think you d live long Just in time the doctor pulled himself up short Thrusting his hands into his pockets he took a nervous turn about the kitchen then sharply he wheeled about My dear woman let us talk no more about the money question See here I shall be glad to take that boy into my charge and take care of him for the sheer love of it indeed I shall Do you mean without ANY pay Susan had drawn herself up haughtily Yes So far as money goes it is of no consequence anyway I m glad Thank you but we ain t charitable folks doctor Stewart cut in Susan coldly Maybe it is infinitesimal to you whether we pay or not but t ain t to us We don t want But I tell you it s pay enough just to do it interrupted the doctor impatiently It s a very rare case and I m glad A door banged open Susan hasn t that doctor a new voice cut in then stopped short The doctor turned to see a pallid faced blond bearded man with rumpled hair standing in the doorway mister Burton hazarded the doctor crisply Yes And you doctor Stewart And I d like a little talk with you please if you can talk sense This last was added under his breath but Daniel Burton was not listening in any case He was leading the way to the studio In the studio the doctor did not wait for questions but plunged at once into his story Without going into technical terms mister Burton I will say that your son has a very rare trouble There is only one known relief and that is a certain very delicate operation Even with that the chances are about fifty fifty that he regains his sight But there s a chance Yes there s a chance And anyway it won t do any harm to try It is the only thing possible and if it fails well he ll only be blind as he is now It must be done right away however Even now it may be too late And I may as well tell you if it DOESN T fail there is a strong probability of another long period of treatment and a second operation before there s a chance of ultimate success Could could that time be spent here Daniel Burton s lips had grown a little white No I should want the boy where I could see him frequently with me in fact And that brings me to what I was going to propose With your permission I will take the boy back with me next week to Chicago and operate at once And let me say that from sheer interest in the case I shall be glad to do this entirely without cost to you Thank you but of course you must understand that I could not allow that for a moment A painful color had flamed into Daniel Burton s face Nonsense Don t be foolish man I tell you I m glad to do it It ll be worth it to me the rarity of the case How much would it cost interposed Daniel Burton peremptorily with an unsteadiness of voice that the doctor did not fail to read aright Why man alive it would cost With his eyes on Daniel Burton s sternly controlled face the doctor came to an abrupt pause Then turning he began to tramp up and down the room angrily Oh hang it all man why can t you be sensible I tell you I don t want any Once again his tongue stopped His feet also had come to an abrupt pause He was standing before an old colonial mirror Then suddenly he wheeled about By Jove there IS something I want If you ll sell me two or three of these treasures of yours here you will be more than cancelling your debt and Thank you interrupted the other coldly but with a still deeper red staining his face As I happen to know of the unsalability of these pictures however I cannot accept your generosity there either Pictures The doctor turning puzzled eyes back to the mirror saw now that a large oil painting hung beside it on the wall I wasn t talking about your pictures man he scoffed then I was looking at that mirror there and I d like the highboy downstairs if I could persuade you to part with them and WOULD you be willing to part with them What do you think So marvelous was the change and so great was the shining glory in Daniel Burton s face that the doctor caught himself actually blinking Do you think there s anything ANYTHING that I wouldn t part with if I thought I could give that boy a chance Make your own selection doctor I only hope you ll want really WANT enough of them to amount to something The doctor threw a keen glance into his face Amount to something Don t you know the value of these things here Daniel Burton laughed and shrugged his shoulders Oh I suppose they are valuable But I shall have to confess I DON T know very much about it They re very old I can vouch for that Old Humph The doctor was close to the mirror now examining it with the appreciative eyes of the real lover of the antique I should say they were Jove that s a beauty And I ve got just the place that s hungering for it Good Suppose we look about the house then a little suggested Daniel Burton Perhaps we ll find some more things er good for a hungry stomach eh And with a light on his face such as had not been there for long months past Daniel Burton led the way from the studio CHAPTER XV AGAIN SUSAN TAKES A HAND That evening Daniel Burton told Susan Keith is to go home with doctor Stewart next week The doctor will operate as soon as possible Keith will live at the sanatorium connected with the doctor s home and be under his constant supervision Susan tried to speak but instead of speaking she burst into tears Why Susan exclaimed the man I know I know she choked angrily dashing the drops from her eyes An me cryin like this when I m gettin jest what I want too But there s no certainty Susan that it ll be successful remember that warned the man his face clouding a little We can only hope An there s the the pay Susan looked up her voice vibrating with fearful doubts Oh that s all right The man lifted his head with the air of one who at last has reached firm ground after a dangerous crossing on thin ice The doctor s going to buy the highboy and that mirror in the studio and oh several other things You mean that old chest of drawers in the settin room scorned Susan openly Yes Daniel Burton s lips twitched a little But will he PAY anything for em mister Burton you can t get nothin hardly for second hand furniture My mother had a stove an a real nice bedstead an a red plush parlor set an she sold em But she didn t get anything not hardly anything for em an they was most new some of em too That s the trouble Susan they were too new probably laughed the man It s because these are old very old that he wants them I suspect An he ll really pay MONEY for em Plainly Susan still had her doubts He certainly will I d be almost ashamed to tell you HOW much he ll pay Susan smiled the man It seemed to me sheer robbery on my part But he assures me they are very valuable and that he s more than delighted to have them even at that price Lan sakes An when I d been worryin an worryin so about the money sighed Susan an now to have it fall plump into your lap like that It jest shows you not to hunt for bridges till you get your feet wet don t it An he s goin jest next week Yes The doctor and his daughter start Tuesday You don t mean that girl Dorothy s goin too Susan had almost bounced out of her chair Why yes doctor Stewart SAID she was What s the matter Matter Matter enough Why if she goes Say why IS she taggin along anyhow demanded Susan wrathfully Well I shouldn t exactly call it taggin along to go home with her father for the Christmas vacation shrugged the man As I understand it Dorothy s mother died several years ago That s why the girl is here in the East so much with her relatives going to school The doctor s home has become practically a sanatorium not the most desirable place in the world to bring up a young daughter in I should say Let s see how old is Miss Dorothy Sixteen Keith says I asked him one day She s about his age Hm m well however that may be Susan I don t see how we can help ourselves very well I fancy Miss Dorothy ll still tag along he finished whimsically Maybe an then maybe not mumbled Susan darkly as she turned away For two days after this Susan s kitchen and even Keith himself showed almost neglect persistently and systematically Susan was running down street every hour or two ostensibly on errands yet she bought little She spent most of her time tramping through the streets and stores scrutinizing especially the face of every young girl she met On the afternoon of the second day she met Dorothy Parkman coming out of the post office Well I ve got you at last she sighed though I m free to confess I was beginnin to think I never would see you Oh yes about Keith cried the girl joyously Isn t it splendid I m so glad And he s going home with us right away you know Yes I know An that s what that is I wanted stammered Susan growing red in her misery Oh Miss Dorothy you WOULD do anything for that poor blind boy wouldn t you Why y yes of course faltered Dorothy stammering in her turn I knew you would Then please don t go home with your father this time Don t go home with my father exclaimed the girl in puzzled wonder No Because if you do That is Oh I know it s awful for me to say this but I ve got to do it for Keith You see if you go Keith won t If I go he I don t think I quite understand The girl drew back a little haughtily Her face showed a painful flush No no of course you don t An please PLEASE don t look like that begged Susan It s jest this I found out I wormed it out of him the other day why he won t let you come to see him He says that once long ago you said how you couldn t bear to look at blind people an Oh I never never could have said such a cruel thing to to a blind boy interposed the girl He wasn t blind then He said he wasn t But it was when he was fraid he was goin to be blind an he see you an Mazie Sanborn at the foot of Harrington Hill one day It was just after the old man had got blind an Keith had been up to see him It seems that Keith was worryin then for fear HE was goin to be blind He WAS Yes things blurred an all that Well at the foot of the hill he see you an Mazie an you shuddered at his goin up to see mister Harrington an said how could he bear to look at folks that was blind That YOU couldn t An he never forgot it Bein worried for fear he himself was goin blind you see he was especially acceptable to anything like that Oh but I I At home I always did hate to see all the poor blind people that came to see father she stammered But it it was only because I felt so bad for them And that s one reason why father doesn t keep me at home any more He says But about Keith I I didn t mean to Dorothy came to a helpless pause Yes I know You didn t mean to hurt him nodded Susan But it did hurt him An now he always thinks of it if he knows you re round You see worse n anything else he hates to be stared at or to have folks think he s different There ain t anything I can ever say to him that makes him half so happy as to act as if he wa n t blind Yes I see breathed Dorothy her eyes brimming An so now you won t go will you Because if you go he won t Miss Dorothy frowned in deep thought for a moment I shall have to go she said at last slowly Father is just counting on my being there Christmas and he is so lonely I couldn t disappoint him But Keith I won t have to see much of him anyway I ll explain it to father He won t mind He s used to his patients taking notions It ll be all right Don t worry she nodded her face clearing But you ll have to be with Keith some Oh yes a little But he won t know who I am I m just doctor Stewart s daughter Don t you see But he ll know your voice I shan t talk much Besides he never did hear me talk much It was always Mazie that talked most And he hasn t heard me any for a year or more except that little bit that day at the house But your name Dorothy still argued Susan dubiously Father never calls me that I m always Puss to him And there won t be anybody else with us on the journey Don t you worry You just send Keith right along and trust me for the rest You ll see she nodded again brightly as she turned away Susan went home then to her neglected work There seemed really nothing else that she could do But that she was far from following Miss Dorothy s blithe advice not to worry was very evident from her frowning brow and preoccupied air all the rest of the time until Tuesday morning when Keith went until indeed mister Burton came home from seeing Keith off on his journey Then her pent up perturbation culminated in an onslaught of precipitate questions Was he all right Was that girl there Did he know who she was Do you think he ll find out One at a time Susan one at a time laughed the man Yes he was all right He went off smiling with the doctor s arm about his shoulders Yes the young lady was there but she kept well away from Keith so far as I could see Friends had come evidently to see her off but I noticed she contrived to keep herself and them as far away from Keith as possible Of course on the journey there ll be just the three of them The test will come then But I wouldn t worry Susan Remember your own advice about those bridges of yours He s started and he s with the doctor I don t think he ll turn back now No I s pose not sighed Susan But

none	none	really KNOW how things are she finished as she took up her work again Thirty six hours later came the telegram from the doctor telling of their safe arrival and a week later came a letter from Keith himself to Susan It was written in lead pencil on paper that had been carefully perforated so as to form lines not too near together At the top of the page in parentheses were these words DEAR SUSAN If you think dad would like it you may read him a part or the whole of this letter I was afraid I wouldn t write very well and that he wouldn t like to see it So I write to you instead I know you won t mind Below came the letter DEAR SUSAN How do you and dad do I am well and hope you are the same This is an awfully pretty place with trees and big lawns all around it and walks and seats everywhere in the summer they say We aren t sitting outdoors to day though It s only four below We had a jolly trip out The doctor s great He spent half his time talking to me about the things we were seeing out the window We went through a wonderful country and saw lots of interesting things The doctor s daughter was along too But she didn t have much to say on the trip I ve seen quite a lot of her since we ve been here though and she s ALL RIGHT At first I didn t like her very well It was her voice I guess It reminded me of somebody I didn t like to be reminded of But after I got used to it I found she was really very nice and jolly She knows lots of games and we play together a lot now She s so different from that girl she sounded like that I don t mind her voice now And I don t think she minds here a rather unsuccessful erasure showed that playing with me had been substituted for being with blind folks She gave me this paper and told me the folks at home would like a letter she knew That s why I m writing it And I guess that s enough for this time Love to all KEITH BURTON P S I m going to have the operation to morrow but they won t know for quite a while whether it s successful or not the doctor says KEITH Susan read this letter then took it at once to the studio and read it again aloud Now ain t that great she crowed as soon as she had finished Y yes but he didn t say much about himself or his treatment demurred the man Susan made an impatient gesture Why yes he did too Lan sakes mister Burton he didn t talk about nothin else but himself an his treatment all the way through Oh I know he didn t say anything about his occultist treatment if that s what you mean But I didn t do no worryin about that part It was the other part The other part Yes They re treatin him as if he wa n t different an queer An didn t you notice the way he wrote Happy as a king tellin about what he SAW on the way out an the wonderful country they went through They re all right them two are I shan t do no more worryin about Keith An her fixin that paper so cute for him to write on I declare I m that zealous of her I don t know what to do Why couldn t I a thought of that she sighed as she rose to leave the room Two days later came a letter from the doctor The operation had been performed and so far as they could judge all was well though as Keith had written the real results would not show until the bandages were removed some time later When the schools opened again in January Dorothy Parkman came back to Hinsdale Susan had been counting the days ever since Christmas for she knew Dorothy was coming and she could scarcely wait to see her This time however she did not have to tramp through the streets and stores looking for her for Miss Dorothy came at once to the house and rang the bell I knew you d want to hear all about mister Keith she smiled brightly into Susan s eyes And I m glad to report that he s doing all right Be them bandages off yet Do you mean he can see demanded Susan excitedly leading the way to the sitting room Oh no no not that cried the girl quickly I mean he s doing all right so far It s a week yet before the bandages can be removed and even then he probably won t see much if at all There ll have to be another one later father says maybe two more Oh Susan fell back plainly disappointed Then suddenly a new interest flamed into her eyes An he ain t sensed yet who you are she questioned Miss Dorothy blushed and Susan noticed suddenly how very pretty she was No Though I must confess that at first when he heard my voice he looked up much startled and even rose from his seat But I told him lots of folks thought I talked like Dorothy Parkman and I just laughed and turned it off and made nothing of it And so pretty quick he made nothing of it too After that we got along beautifully I should say you did retorted Susan almost enviously An you fixin up that paper so fine for him to write on Miss Dorothy blushed again and again Susan noticed how very charming was the combination of brown eyes and yellow gold hair Yes he did like that paper smiled the young girl He never mentioned the lines and neither did I When I first suggested the letter home he was all ready to refuse I could see but I wouldn t give him the chance Before he could even speak I had thrust the paper into his hands and I could see the wonder interest and joy in his face as his fingers discovered the pricked lines and followed their course from edge to edge But he didn t let ME know he d found them not much Well I don t know but they would like a letter was all he said casually I knew then that I had won Well I should say you had But HOW did you know how cried Susan Oh you told me first that I must talk to him as if he were not blind Then father told me the same thing He said lots of his patients were like that So I always tried to do it that way And it s wonderful how when you give it a little thought you can manage to tell them so much that they can turn about and tell somebody else just as if they really had seen it I know I know nodded Susan An Miss Dorothy her voice grew unsteady he really IS goin to see by an by ain t he The girl s face clouded They aren t at all sure of that But they can t tell YET Susan had grown a little white Oh no not sure An they re goin to give him all the chances there is Certainly I only spoke because I don t want you to be too disappointed if if we lose You must remember that fully half of the cases do lose Susan drew a long sigh Then determinedly she lifted her chin Well I like to think we ain t goin to belong to that half she said CHAPTER XVI THE WORRY OF IT There was a letter from the doctor when the bandages were removed Daniel Burton began to read the letter but his eyes blurred and his hand shook so that Susan had to take it up where he had dropped it Yet the letter was very short The operation had been as successful perhaps as they could expect under the circumstances Keith could discern light now faintly to be sure but unmistakably He was well and happy Meanwhile he was under treatment for the second operation to come later But that could not be performed for some time yet so they must not lose their patience That was all Well I s pose we ought to be glad he can see light even a little sighed Susan but I m free to confess I was hopin he could do a little more than that Yes so was I said Daniel Burton And Susan looking at his face turned away without another word There were times when Susan knew enough not to talk Then came the days when there were only Keith s letters and an occasional short note from the doctor to break the long months of waiting In the Burton homestead at Hinsdale living was reduced to the simplest formula possible On the whole there was perhaps a little more money Dunning tradesmen were not so numerous But all luxuries and some things that were almost necessities were rigorously left out And the money was saved always for Keith A lodger a young law student in Keith s old room helped toward defraying the family expenses Susan had given up trying to sell her poems She had become convinced at last that a cruel and unappreciative editorial wall was forever to bar her from what she still believed was an eagerly awaiting public She still occasionally wrote jingles and talked in rhyme but undeniably she had lost her courage and her enthusiasm As she expressed it to missus McGuire she did not feel a mite like a gushing siphon inside her now As the summer came and passed Susan and missus McGuire talked over the back yard fence even more frequently Perhaps because Susan was lonely without Keith Perhaps because there was so much to talk about First there was Keith Keith was still under treatment preparatory to the second operation He had not responded quite as they had hoped the doctor said which meant that the operation must be postponed for perhaps several months longer All this Susan talked over with missus McGuire and there was always too the hushed discussion as to what would happen if after all it failed and Keith came home hopelessly blind But even that ain t the worst thing that could happen maintained Susan stoutly I can tell you Keith Burton ain t goin to let a little thing like that floor him missus McGuire however did not echo Susan s optimistic prophecies But missus McGuire s own sky just now was overcast which perhaps had something to do with it missus McGuire had troubles of her own It was the summer of nineteen fourteen and the never to be forgotten August had come and passed firing the match that was destined to set the whole world ablaze missus McGuire s eldest son John of whom she boasted in season and out and whom she loved with an all absorbing passion had caught the war fever gone to Canada and enlisted missus McGuire herself was a Canadian by birth and all her family still lived there She was boasting now more than ever about John but proud as she was of her soldier boy his going had plunged her into an abyss of doubt and gloom He ll never come back he ll never come back she moaned to Susan I can just feel it in my bones that he won t Shucks a great strong healthy boy like John McGuire Of course he ll come back retorted Susan Besides likely the war ll be all over with fore he gets there anyhow An as for feelin it in your bones Mis McGuire that s a very facetious doctrine an ain t no more to be depended upon than my flour sieve for an umbrella They re gay receivers every time bones are Why lan sakes Mis McGuire if all things happened that my bones told me was goin to happen there wouldn t none of us be livin by now nor the sun shinin nor the moon moonin I found out after awhile how they DIDN T happen half the time an I wrote a poem on it like this Trust em not them fickle bones Always talkin moans an groans Jest as if inside of you Lived a thing could tell you true Whether it was goin to rain Whether you would have a pain Whether him or you would beat Whether you d have nuf to eat Bones was give to hold us straight Not to tell us bout our Fate Yes yes I s pose so sighed missus McGuire But when I think of John my John lyin there so cold an still Well he ain t lyin there yet cut in Susan impatiently Time enough to hunt bears when you see their tracks Mis McGuire CAN T you see that worryin don t do no good You ll have it ALL for nothin if he don t get hurt an if he does you ll have all this extra for nothin anyway that you didn t need till the time came Ever hear my poem on worryin Without waiting for a reply Susan never asked such questions with a view to having them answered she chanted this Worry never climbed a hill Worry never paid a bill Worry never led a horse to water Worry never cooked a meal Worry never darned a heel Worry never did a thing you d think it oughter Yes yes I know I know sighed missus McGuire again But John is so well you don t know my John Nobody knows John as I do He d have made a big man if he d lived John would If he d lived repeated Susan severely Well I never Mis McGuire if you ain t talkin already as if he was dead You don t have to begin to write his obliquity notice yet do you But he is dead moaned missus McGuire catching at the one word in Susan s remark and paying no attention to the rest He s dead to everything he was goin to do He was ambitious my John was He was always studyin and readin books nights an Sundays an holidays when he didn t have to be in the store He was takin a course you know Yes I know one of them respondin schools nodded Susan John s a clever lad he is I m free to confess Under the sunshine of Susan s appreciation missus McGuire drew a step nearer He was studyin so he could mount to somethin John was declared missus McGuire He was goin to be she paused and threw a hurried look over her shoulder he was keepin it secret but he won t mind my tellin NOW He was goin to be a writer some day he hoped Susan s instantly alert attention was most flattering Sho You don t say Poems I don t know missus McGuire drew back and spoke a little coldly Now that the secret was out missus McGuire was troubled evidently with qualms of conscience He never said much He didn t want it talked about Susan drew a long breath Yes I know Tain t so pleasant if folks know when you can t sell em Now in my case But missus McGuire with a hurried word about the beans in her oven had hastened into the house missus McGuire was not the only one with whom Susan was having long talks September had come bringing again the opening of the schools which in turn had brought Miss Dorothy Parkman back to Hinsdale Miss Dorothy was seventeen now and prettier than ever in Susan s opinion She had been again to her father s home and Susan never could hear enough of her visit or of Keith Nor was Miss Dorothy evidently in the least loath to talk of her visit or of Keith Patiently even interestedly each time she saw Susan she would repeat for her the details of Keith s daily life telling everything that she knew about him But I ve told you all there is before she said laughingly one day at last when Susan had stopped her as she was going by the house I ve told it several times before Yes I know you have nodded Susan drawing a long breath but I always get somethin new in it just as I do in the Bible you know You always tell me somethin you hadn t mentioned before Now to day you never told me before about them dominoes you an him played together Didn t I An added color came into Miss Dorothy s cheeks Well we played them quite a lot Poor fellow Time hung pretty heavily on his hands and we HAD to do something for him There were other games too that we played together But how can he play dominoes an those others when when he can t see Oh the points of the dominoes are raised of course and the board has little round places surrounded by raised borders for him to keep his dominoes in The cards are marked with little raised signs in the corners and there are dice studded with tiny nailheads The checker board has little grooves to keep the men from sliding Of course we already had all these games you know They use them for all father s patients But of course Keith had to be taught first And you taught him Well I taught him some of them The added color was still in Miss Dorothy s cheeks An you told me last week you read to him Yes oh yes I read to him quite a lot The anxiously puckered frown on Susan s face suddenly dissolved into a broad smile Lan sakes if that ain t the limit she chuckled Well what do you mean by that bridled Miss Dorothy looking not exactly pleased Nothin It s only that I was jest a thinkin how you was foolin him Fooling him Miss Dorothy was looking decidedly not pleased now Yes an you all the time Dorothy Parkman an he not knowin it Oh The color on Miss Dorothy s face was one pink blush now Then she laughed lightly After all do you know I hardly ever thought of that after the very first He called me Miss Stewart of course but lots of folks out there do that They don t think or don t know about my name being different you see The patients coming and going all the time know me as the doctor s daughter and naturally call me Miss Stewart So it doesn t seem so queer when mister Keith does it Good exclaimed Susan with glowing satisfaction An now here s to hopin he won t never find out who you really be Is he so very bitter then against Dorothy Parkman The girl asked the question a little wistfully He jest is nodded Susan with unflattering emphasis If you d heard him when he jest persisted that he wouldn t have anybody that was Dorothy Parkman s father even look at his eyes you d have thought so I guess An why he even wrote about it way back last Christmas I mean when he first told us about you He said the doctor had a daughter an she was all right but he didn t like her at all at first cause her voice kept remindin him of somebody he didn t want to be reminded of Did he really write THAT Them s the identifyin words avowed Susan So you ll jest have to keep it secret who you be you see she warned her Yes I see murmured the girl All the pretty color had quite gone from her face now leaving it a little white and strained looking I ll try to Of course when he gets back his sight he ll find out that is Miss Dorothy he IS going to get it back ain t he Susan s own face now had become a little white and strained looking Miss Dorothy shook her head I don t know Susan but I m afraid Afraid You don t mean he AIN T goin to Susan caught Miss Dorothy s arm in a vise like grip No no not that but we aren t SURE And and the symptoms aren t quite so good as they were hurried on the girl a bit feverishly But I thought he could see light faltered Susan He could at first but it s been getting dimmer and dimmer and now the girl stopped and wet her lips there s to be a second operation you know Father hopes to have it by Christmas or before but I know father is afraid that is he thinks He don t like the way things is goin cut in Susan grimly Ain t that about it I m afraid it is faltered Miss Dorothy wetting her lips again And when I think of that boy She turned away her head leaving her sentence unfinished Well we ain t goin to think of it till it comes declared Susan stoutly An then well if it does come we ve all got to set to an help him forget it That s all Yes of course murmured the girl turning away again And this time she turned quite away and went on down the street leaving Susan by the gate alone Nice girl an a mighty pretty one too whispered Susan looking after the trim little figure in its scarlet cap and sweater An she s got a good kind heart in her too a carin like that about that poor boy s bein Susan stopped short A new look had come to her face a look of wonder questioning and dawning delight Lan sakes why hain t I never thought of that before she muttered her eyes still on the rapidly disappearing little red figure down the street Oh course they re nothin but babies now but by an by Still if he ever found out she was Dorothy Parkman an of course he d have to find it out if he married Oh lan sakes what fools some folks be With which somewhat cryptic statement Susan turned and marched irritably into the house

none	none	 DANIEL BURTON TAKES THE PLUNGE doctor Stewart s second operation on Keith s eyes took place late in November It was not a success Far from increasing his vision it lessened it Only dimly now could he discern light at all In a letter to Daniel Burton doctor Stewart stated the case freely and frankly yet he declared that he had not given up hope yet He had a plan which with mister Burton s kind permission he would carry out 
6288_63101_000004_000002	train-clean-360	He then went on to explain 
none	none	In Paris there was a noted specialist in whom he had great confidence He wished very much that this man could see Keith To take Keith over now however as war conditions were would of course be difficult and hazardous Besides as he happened to know this would not be necessary for the great man was coming to this country some time in May To bring Keith to his attention then would be a simple matter and a chance well worth waiting for 
6288_63101_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Meanwhile the boy was as comfortable where he was as he could be anywhere and moreover there were certain treatments which should still be continued 
none	none	With Daniel Burton s kind permission therefore the doctor would keep Keith where he was for the present pending the arrival of the great specialist 
6288_63101_000006_000000	train-clean-360	It was a bitter blow 
none	none	For days after the letter came Daniel Burton shut himself up in his studio refusing to see any one but Susan and almost refusing to see her Susan indeed heart broken as she was herself had no time to indulge her own grief so busy was she trying to concoct something that would tempt her employer to break a fast that was becoming terrifying to her 
6288_63101_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Then came Keith s letter 
none	none	He wrote cheerfully hopefully He told of new games that he was playing new things of interest that he was seeing He said nothing whatever about the operation He did say that there was a big doctor coming from Paris whom he was going to see in May however That was all When the doctor s letter had come telling of the failure of the second operation Susan had read it and accepted it with sternly controlled eyes that did not shed one tear But when Keith s letter came not even mentioning the operation her self control snapped and she burst openly into tears I don t care she sobbed in answer to Daniel Burton s amazed exclamation When I think of the way that blessed boy is holdin up his head an marchin straight on an you an me here oh lan sakes what s the use of TRYIN to say it she despaired turning and hurrying from the room In December doctor Stewart came on again to take his daughter back for the holidays He called at once to see mister Burton and the two had a long conference in the studio while Susan feverishly moved from room to room downstairs taking up and setting down one object after another in the aimless fashion of one whose fingers are not controlled by the mind When the doctor had gone Susan did not wait for Daniel Burton to seek her out 
6288_63101_000011_000001	train-clean-360	She went at once to the studio 
none	none	No he had nothing new to say about Keith began the man answering the agonized question in her eyes before her lips could frame the words But didn t he say NOTHIN Oh yes he said a great deal but it was only a repetition of what he had said before in the letter Daniel Burton spoke wearily constrainedly 
6288_63101_000014_000001	train-clean-360	His face had grown a little white 
none	none	The doctor bought the big sofa in the hall downstairs and the dropleaf table in the dining room Humph 
6288_63101_000015_000001	train-clean-360	But will he PAY anything for them things 
none	none	Yes he will pay well for them And Susan Yes sir Something in the man s face and voice put a curious note of respect into Susan s manner as sudden as it was unusual I ve been intending to tell you for some time I I shall want breakfast at seven o clock to morrow morning I I am going to work in McGuire s store You are goin to what Susan s face was aghast To work I said repeated Daniel Burton sharply
6288_63101_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 I shall want breakfast at seven o clock Susan He turned away plainly indicating that for him the matter was closed 
6288_63101_000021_000000	train-clean-360	But for Susan the matter was not closed 
none	none	Daniel Burton you ain t goin to demean yourself like that she gasped an artistical gentleman like you Why I d rather work my hands to the bones That will do Susan You may go 
6288_63101_000024_000000	train-clean-360	And Susan went 
none	none	There were times when Susan did go 
6288_63101_000025_000000	train-clean-360	But not yet for Susan was the matter closed 
none	none	Only an hour later missus McGuire ran over with a letter from her John to read to Susan But barely had she finished reading the letter aloud when the real object of her visit was disclosed by the triumphant Well Susan Betts I notice even an artist has to come down to bein a common storekeeper sometimes Susan drew herself up haughtily Of course Mis McGuire t ain t for me to pretense that I don t know what you re inferrin to But jest let me tell you this it don t make no difference how many potatoes an molasses jugs an kerosene cans Daniel Burton hands over the counter he won t never be jest a common storekeeper He ll be THINKIN flowers an woods an sunsets jest the same Furthermore an moreover in my opinion it s a very honorary an praiseful thing for him to do to go out in the hedges an byways an earn money like that when if the world only knew enough to know a good thing when they see it they d be buy in them pictures of his an not subjugate him to the mystification of earnin his bread by the sweat of his forehead Oh good gracious me Susan Betts how you do run on when you get started ejaculated missus McGuire impatiently yet laughingly An I might have known what you d say too if I d stopped to think Well I must be goin anyhow I only came over to show you the letter from my John I m sure I wish t was him comin back to his old place behind the counter instead of your Daniel Burton she sighed I d buy every picture he ever painted if I had the money if t would only bring my John back away from all those awful bombs an shells an shrapnel that he s always writin about Them be nice letters he writes I m free to confess commented Susan graciously Not that they tell so much what he s doin though but I s pose they re censured anyhow all them letters be 
6288_63101_000031_000000	train-clean-360	missus McGuire her eyes dreamily fixed out the window nodded her head slowly 
none	none	Yes I s pose so but there s a lot left there s always a lot left And everything he writes I can just see 
6288_63101_000032_000001	train-clean-360	It was always like that with my John 
none	none	Let him go downtown an come back you d think he d been to the circus the wonderful things he d tell me he d seen on the way An he d set em out an describe em until I could just see em myself 
6288_63101_000032_000003	train-clean-360	I ll never forget 
6288_63101_000032_000004	train-clean-360	One day he went to a fire 
none	none	The old Babcock house burned an he saw it 
6288_63101_000032_000006	train-clean-360	He was twelve years old 
none	none	I was sick in bed an he told me about it I can see him now standin at the foot of the bed his cheeks red his eyes sparklin an his little hands flourishin right an left in his excitement As he talked I could just see that old house burn I could hear the shouts of the men the roar an cracklin of the flames an see em creepin creepin gainin gainin Oh it was wonderful an there I was right in my own bed all the time 
6288_63101_000032_000012	train-clean-360	It was just the way he told it 
none	none	That s why I know he could have been a writer 
6288_63101_000032_000014	train-clean-360	He could make others see everything But now that s all over now 
none	none	He ll never be anything I can see him I can see all that horrible battle field with the reelin men the flames the smoke the burstin shells an oh God my John Will he ever ever come back to me There there Mis McGuire I jest wouldn t But missus McGuire with a shake of her head and her eyes half covered with her hand turned away and stumbled out of the kitchen Susan looking after her drew a long sigh Worry never climbed a hill Worry never There s some times when it s frank impertinence to tell folks not to worry she muttered severely to herself attacking the piled up dishes before her Daniel Burton went to work in McGuire s grocery store the next morning after a particularly appetizing breakfast served to him by a silent red eyed but very attentive Susan An twas for all the world like a lamb to the slaughter house Susan moaned to the law student lodger when she met him on the stairs at eight o clock that morning An if you want to see a real slaughter house you jest come in here she beckoned him leading the way to the studio But but that is well stammered the young fellow looking not a little startled as he followed her with half reluctant feet In the studio Susan flourished accusing arms Look at that an that an that she cried Why it s like jest any extraordinary common sense room now that anybody might have with them pictures all put away an his easel hid behind the door an not a brush or a cube of paint in sight an him dolin out vinegar an molasses down to that old store 
6288_63101_000041_000002	train-clean-360	I tell you it made me sick mister Jenkins sick 
none	none	Yes yes that s so murmured mister Jenkins vaguely
6288_63101_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Well it did 
none	none	Why it worked me up so I jest sat right down an made up a poem on it 
6288_63101_000043_000002	train-clean-360	I couldn t help it 
none	none	An it came easy too most like the spontaneous combustion kind that I used to write only I made it free verse 
6288_63101_000043_000004	train-clean-360	You know that s all the rage now 
6288_63101_000043_000005	train-clean-360	Like this she finished producing from somewhere about her person a half sheet of note paper 
none	none	Alone an dark The studio Waited Waited for the sun of day But when it rose Alas No lovely pictures greeted The fiery gob Only their backs showed White an sorry an some dusty No easel sprawled long legs To trip An make you slip No cubes of pig lent gray Or black Nor any other color lent brightness To this dank world An he the artist The bright soul who Bossed this ranch Alas Doomed to hide his bright talons In smelly kegs of kerosene An molasses brown an sticky Alas that I should see an Know this Day There now ain t that about the way tis she demanded feelingly Er yes yes it is That s so mister Jenkins was backing out of the room and looking toward the stairway mister Jenkins had been a member of the Burton household long enough to have learned to take Susan at her own valuation with no questions asked Yes that s so he repeated as he plunged down the stairs To Daniel Burton himself Susan made no further protests or even comments except the silent comment of eager service with some favorite dish for every meal As Christmas drew near and Daniel Burton s hours grew longer Susan still made no audible comment but she redoubled her efforts to make him comfortable the few hours left to him at home CHAPTER XVIII MISS STEWART It was just after Christmas that another letter came from Keith It was addressed as usual to Susan Keith had explained in his second letter that he was always going to write to Susan so that she might read it to his father thus saving him the disagreeableness of seeing how crooked and uneven some of his lines were His father had remonstrated feebly but Keith still wrote to Susan Keith had been improving in his writing very rapidly however since those earliest letters and most of his letters now were models of even lines and carefully formed characters But this letter Susan saw at once was very different It bore unmistakable marks of haste agitation and lack of care It began abruptly after the briefest of salutations Why didn t you tell me you knew Miss Stewart She says she knows you real well and father too and that she s been to the house lots of times and that she s going back to Hinsdale next week and that she is going to school there this year and will graduate in June Oh she didn t tell me all this at once you bet your sweet life I had to worm it out of her little by little But what I want to know is why you folks didn t tell me anything about it that you knew her and all that But you never said a word not a word Neither you nor dad But she says she knows dad real well Funny dad never mentioned it Miss Stewart sure is a peach of a girl all right and the best ever to me She s always hunting up new games for me to play She s taught me two this time and she s read two books to me There s a new fellow here named Henty and we play a lot together I am well and getting along all right Guess that s all for this time Love to all KEITH P S Now don t forget to tell me why you never said a thing that you knew Miss Stewart K Well now I guess the kettle is in the fire all right ejaculated Susan folding the letter with hands that shook a little What do you mean asked Daniel Burton Why about that girl of course He ll find out now she s Dorothy Parkman He can t help findin it out Well what if he does demanded the man a bit impatiently What if he does repeated Susan with lofty scorn I guess you ll find what tis when that boy does find out she s Dorothy Parkman an then won t have nothin more to do with her nor her father nor her father s new doctor nor anything that is hers Nonsense Susan don t be silly snapped the man still more irritably Nor her father nor her father s new doctor nor anything that is hers indeed You sound for all the world as if you were chanting a catechism What s the matter Doesn t the boy like Miss Dorothy Why Daniel Burton you know he don t I told you long ago all about it when I explained how we d got to give her father a resumed name so Keith wouldn t know an Oh THAT What she said about not wanting to see blind people Nonsense Susan that was years ago when they were children Why Keith s a man nearly You re forgetting he ll be eighteen next June Susan That s all right mister Burton Susan s lips snapped together grimly and her chin assumed its most defiant tilt I ain t sayin he ain t But there s some cases where age don t make a mite of difference an you ll find this is one of em You mark my words Daniel Burton I have seen jest as big fools at eighteen an eighty for that matter as I have at eight T ain t a matter of decree at all Keith Burton got it into his head when he was first goin blind that Dorothy Parkman would hate to look at him if ever he did get blind an he just vowed an determined that if ever he did get that way she shouldn t see him Well now he s blind An if you think he s forgot what Dorothy Parkman said you d oughter been with me when she came to see him with Mazie Sanborn one day or even when they just called up to him on the piazza one mornin Well well very likely conceded the man irritably but I still must remind you Susan that all this was some time ago Keith s got more sense now Maybe an then again maybe not 
6288_63111_000046_000002	train-clean-360	However we ll see 
none	none	what we will see she mumbled as she left the room with a little defiant toss of her head Susan did not answer Keith s letter at once Just how she was going to answer that particular question concerning their acquaintance with Miss Stewart she did not know nor could she get any assistance from Daniel Burton on the subject Why tell him the truth of course was all that Daniel Burton would answer with a shrug in reply to her urgent appeals for aid in the matter This Susan in utter horror refused to do But surely you don t expect to keep it secret forever who she is do you demanded Daniel Burton scornfully one day Of course I don t But I m going to keep it jest as long as I can avowed Susan doggedly An maybe I can keep it till he gets his blessed eyes back I shan t care if he does find out then I don t think we ll any of us mind anything then Susan said the man softly a little brokenly And Susan looking into his face turned away suddenly to hide her own That evening Susan heard that Dorothy Parkman was expected to arrive in Hinsdale in two days I ll jest wait then an intervene the young lady my own self she mused as she walked home from the post office This tryin to settle Dorothy Parkman s affairs without Dorothy Parkman is like havin omelet with omelet left out she finished nodding to herself all in the dark as she turned in at the Burton gateway Dorothy Parkman came two days later As was usual now she came at once to the house Susan on the watch met her at the door before she could touch the bell Come in come in My but I m glad to see you exclaimed Susan fervently fairly pulling her visitor into the house Now tell me everything every single thing Why there isn t much to tell Susan mister Keith is about the same and No no I mean about YOU interrupted Susan motioning the girl to a chair and drawing her own chair nearer About your bein in Hinsdale an knowin us an all that an his finding it out Oh THAT The color flew instantly into Miss Dorothy s cheeks Then he s he s written you Written us I should say he had An he wants to know why we hain t told him we know you An lan sakes Miss Dorothy what can we tell him I I don t know Susan But how d you get in such a mess How d he find out to begin with demanded the woman Miss Dorothy drew a long sigh Oh it was my fault of course I forgot Still it s a wonder I hadn t forgotten before You see inadvertently I happened to drop a word about mister Burton Do you know my dad he burst out Then he asked another and another question Of course I saw right away that I must turn it off as if I supposed he d known it all the time It wouldn t do to make a secret of it and act embarrassed because he d found it out for of course then he d suspect something wrong right away Yes yes I s pose so admitted Susan worriedly But lan sakes look at us What are we goin to say Now he wants to know why we hain t told him about knowin you I don t know Susan I don t know The girl shook her head and caught her breath a bit convulsively Of course when I first let it go that I was Miss Stewart I never realized where it was going to lead nor how how hard it might be to keep it up I ve been expecting every day he d find out from some one there But he hasn t yet Of course Aunt Hattie who keeps house for father is in the secret and SHE D never give it away Most of the patients don t know much about me anyway You see I ve never been there much They just know vaguely of the doctor s daughter and they just naturally call her Miss Stewart Yes yes I see I see nodded Susan again still worriedly But what I m thinkin of is US Miss Dorothy How are we goin to get round not mentionin you all this time without his findin out who you be an demandin a full exposition of the whole affair Say look a here would it be be very bad if he DID find out you was Dorothy Parkman I m afraid it would be Susan The girl spoke slowly a bit unsteadily She had gone a little white at the question Has he SAID anything Nothing only he When we were talking that day and he was flinging out those questions one after another about Hinsdale and what I knew of it he he asked if I knew Dorothy Parkman Miss Dorothy he didn t But he did It was awful Susan I felt like like Of course you did interposed Susan her face all sympathy a sailin under false premises like that an when you were perfectly innocuous too of any sinfulness an was jest doing it for his best good an peace of mind Lan sakes what a prediction to be in What DID you say Why I said yes of course I had to say yes And I tried to turn it off right away and not talk any more about it But that was easy anyway for for mister Keith himself dropped it But I knew by the way he looked and said yes I know her too in that quiet stern way of his that that I d better not let him find out I was she not if I wanted to to stay in the room she finished laughing a little hysterically Lan sakes you don t say frowned Susan Yes and so that s what makes me know that whatever you do you mustn t let him know that I am Dorothy Parkman cried the girl feverishly not now not until he s seen the Paris doctor for there s no knowing what he d do He d be so angry you see He d never forgive me for on top of all the rest is the deceit that I ve been with him all these different times and let him call me Miss Stewart But how can we do that demanded Susan Why just turn it off lightly Say of course you know me and seem surprised that you never happened to mention it before Tell him oh yes I come quite often to tell you and mister Burton how he s getting along and all that Just make nothing of it take it as a matter of course not worth mentioning See Then go on and talk about something else That ll fix it all right I m sure Susan Hm m maybe so an then again maybe not observed Susan with frowning doubt As I was tellin mister Burton this mornin we ve got to be specially careful about Keith jest now It s the most hypercritical time there can be with him waitin to see that big doctor an all an he mustn t be upset no matter what happens nor how many white lies we have to prognosticate here at home I guess that s so Susan Miss Dorothy s eyes were twinkling now And by the way where is mister Burton I haven t seen him yet He ain t here You don t mean he has gone out of town The girl had looked up in surprise at the crisp terseness of Susan s reply Oh no he s in Hinsdale Painting any new pictures these days Miss Dorothy was on her feet to go She asked the question plainly not for information but to fill the embarrassing pause that Susan s second reply had brought to the conversation No he ain t spoke up Susan with a vehemence as disconcerting as it was sudden He ain t paintin nothin an he ain t drawin nothin neither only molasses an vinegar an kerosene He s clerkin down to McGuire s grocery store if you want to know That s where he is Why SUSAN Yes I know You don t have to say nothin Miss Dorothy Besides I wouldn t let you say it if you did I won t let nobody say it but me But I will say this much When folks has set one foot in the cemetery an a lame one at that an can t see nor hear nor think straight I don t think it s no hilarious offense to wish they d hurry up an get to where they could have all them handy facilities back again an leave their money to folks what has got their full complaint of senses ready to enjoy life if they get a chance Oh yes I know you don t know what I m talkin about an perhaps it s jest as well you don t Miss Dorothy I hadn t oughter said it anyhow Well I s pose I ve got to go write that letter to Keith now Seein as how you ve come I can t put it off no longer Goodness only knows though what I m goin to say she sighed as her visitor nodded back a wistful eyed good bye CHAPTER XIX A MATTER OF LETTERS Susan said afterward in speaking of that spring that twas nothin but jest one serious of letters And indeed life did seem to be mostly made up of letters At the sanatorium Keith was waiting for spring and the new doctor and that the waiting was proving to be a little nerve racking was proved by the infrequency of his letters home and the shortness and uncommunicativeness of such as did come Letters to him from Hinsdale were longer and were invariably bright and cheery Yet they did not really tell so much after all To be sure they did contain frequent reference to your Miss Stewart and gave carefully casual accounts of what she did and said In the very first letter Susan had hit upon the idea of always referring to the young lady as your Miss Stewart Then we won t be tellin no lies she had explained to mister Burton cause she IS his Miss Stewart See She certainly don t belong to no one else under that name that s sure But however communicative as regards Miss Stewart the letters were they were very far from that as regarded some other matters For instance neither in Daniel Burton s letters nor in Susan s was there any reference to the new clerk in McGuire s grocery store So far as anything that Keith knew to the contrary his father was still painting unsalable pictures in the Burton home stead studio But even these were not all the letters that spring There were the letters of John McGuire from far away France really wonderful letters letters that brought to the little New England town the very breath of the battle field itself the smell of its smoke the shrieks of its shells And with mister Burton with Susan with the whole neighborhood indeed missus McGuire shared them They were even printed occasionally in the town s weekly newspaper And they were talked of everywhere day in and day out No wonder then that to Susan the spring seemed but a serious of letters It was in May that the great Paris doctor was expected but late in April came a letter from doctor Stewart saying that owing to war conditions the doctor had been delayed He would not reach this country now until July which meant two more months of weary waiting for Keith and for Keith s friends at home It was just here that Susan s patience snapped When you get yourself screwed up to stand jest so much an then they come along with jest a little more somethin s got to break I tell you Well I ve broke Whether as a result of the break or not Susan did not say neither did she mention whether it was to assuage her own grief or to alleviate Keith s but whatever it was Susan wrote these verses and sent them to Keith BY THE DAY When our back is nigh to breakin An our strength is nearly gone An along there comes the layin Of another burden on If we ll only jest remember No matter what s to pay That tisn t yet December An we re livin by the day Most any one can stand it What jest TO DAY has brought It s when we try to lump it An take it by the lot Why any back would double An any legs ll bend If we pile on all the trouble Meant to last us till the end So if we ll jest remember Half the woe from life we ll rob If we ll only take it by the day An not live it by the job Of course that tisn t yet December is poem license and hain t really got much sense to it wrote Susan in the letter she sent with the verses I put it in mostly to rhyme with remember There simply wasn t a thing to rhyme with that word But do you know after I got it down I saw it really could mean somethin after all kind of diabolical like for the end of life you know like December is the end of the year Well anyhow they done me lots of good them verses did an I hope they will you In June Dorothy Parkman was graduated from the Hinsdale Academy Both mister Burton and Susan attended the exercises though not together Then Susan sat down and wrote a glowing account of the affair to Keith dilating upon the fine showing that your Miss Stewart made It can t last forever of course this subtractin Miss Stewart s name for Dorothy Parkman she said to mister Burton when she handed him the letter to mail But I m jest bound an determined it shall last till that there Paris doctor gets his hands on him An she ain t goin back now to her father s for quite a spell Miss Dorothy I mean further explained Susan I guess she don t want to take no chances herself of his findin out jest yet declared Susan with a sage wag of her head Anyhow she s had an inspiration to go see a girl down to the beach an she s goin So we re safe for a while But oh if July d only hurry up an come And yet when July came They were so glad afterward that doctor Stewart wrote the letter that in a measure prepared them for the bad news He wrote the day before the operation He said that the great oculist was immensely interested in the case and eager to see what he could do though he could hold out no sort of promise that he would be able to accomplish the desired results doctor Stewart warned them therefore not to expect anything though of course they might hope Hard on the heels of the letter came the telegram The operation had been performed and had failed they feared They could not tell surely however until the bandages were removed which would be early in August But even if it had failed there was yet one more chance the doctor wrote He would say nothing about that however until he was obliged to In August he wrote about it He was obliged to The operation had been so near a failure that they might as well call it that The Paris oculist however had not given up hope There was just one man in the world who might accomplish the seemingly impossible and give back sight to Keith s eyes at least a measure of sight he said This man lived in London He had been singularly successful in several of the few similar cases known to the profession Therefore with their kind permission the great Paris doctor would take Keith back with him to his brother oculist in London He would like to take ship at once as soon as arrangements could possibly be made There would be delay enough anyway as it was So far as any question of pay was concerned the indebtedness would be on their side entirely if they were privileged to perform the operation for each new case of this very rare malady added knowledge of untold value to the profession hence to humanity in general He begged therefore a prompt word of permission from Keith s father Don t you give it don t you give it chattered Susan with white lips when the proposition was made clear to her Why Susan I thought you d be willing to try anything ANYTHING for Keith s sake An so I would sir anything in season But not this Do you think I d set that blessed boy afloat on top of them submarines an gas mines an to go to London for them German Zepherin s to rain down bombs an shrapnel on his head an he not bein able to see a thing to dodge em when he sees em comin Why Daniel Burton I m ashamed of you to think of it for a minute There there Susan that will do You mean well I know but this is a matter that I shall have to settle for myself for myself he muttered with stern dignity rising to his feet Yet when he left the room a moment later head and shoulders bowed he looked so old and worn that Susan gazing after him put a spasmodic hand to her throat An I jest know I m goin to lose em both now she choked as she turned away Keith went to London Then came more weeks of weary anxious waiting Letters were not so regular now nor so frequent Definite news was hard to obtain Yet in the end it came all too soon and it was piteously definite Keith was coming home The great London doctor too had failed CHAPTER XX WITH CHIN UP Keith came in April The day before he was expected Susan sweeping off the side porch was accosted by missus McGuire It was the first warm spring like day and missus McGuire bareheaded and coatless had opened the back yard gate and was picking her way across the spongy turf My but isn t this a great day Susan she called with an ecstatic indrawn breath I only wish it was as nice under foot Hain t you got no rubbers on Susan s disapproving eyes sought missus McGuire s feet missus McGuire laughed lightly No That s the one thing I leave off the first possible minute Some way I feel as if I was helpin along the spring Humph Well I should help along somethin sides spring I guess if I did it Besides it strikes me rubbers ain t the only thing you re leavin off Susan s disapproving eyes had swept now to missus McGuire s unprotected head and shoulders Oh I m not cold I love it As if this glorious spring sunshine could do any one any harm Susan it s LIEUTENANT McGuire now I came over to tell you My John s been promoted Sho you don t say Ain t that wonderful now Susan s broom stopped in midair Not when you know my John The proud mother lifted her head a little For bravery an valiant service Lieutenant McGuire Oh Susan Susan but I m the proud woman this mornin Yes of course of course I ain t wonderin you be Susan drew a long sigh and fell to sweeping again missus McGuire looking into Susan s face came a step nearer Her own face sobered An me braggin like this when you folks I know you re thinkin of that poor blind boy An it s just to morrow that he comes isn t it Susan nodded dumbly An it s all ended now an decided he can t ever see I s pose went on missus McGuire I heard em talkin down to the store last night It seems terrible Yes it does Susan was sweeping vigorously now over and over again in the same place I wonder how he ll take it Susan stopped sweeping and turned with a jerk Take it He s got to take it hain t he she demanded fiercely He s GOT TO An things you ve got to do you do That s all You ll see Keith Burton ain t no quitter He ll take it with his head up an his shoulders braced I know You ll see Don t I remember the look on his blessed face that day he went away an stood on them steps there callin back his cheery good bye But Susan there was hope then an there isn t any now an you haven t seen him since You forget that No I don t retorted Susan doggedly I ain t forgettin nothin But you ll see An he s older He realizes more Why he must be How old is he anyway He ll be nineteen next June Almost a man Poor boy poor boy an him with all these years of black darkness ahead of him I tell you Susan I never appreciated my eyes as I have since Keith lost his Seems as though anybody that s got their eyes hadn t ought to complain of anything I was thinkin this mornin comin over how good it was just to SEE the blue sky an the sunshine an the little buds breakin through their brown jackets Why Susan I never realized how good just seein was till I thought of Keith who can t never see again Yes Well I ve got to go in now Mis McGuire Good bye Words manner and tone of voice were discourtesy itself but missus McGuire looking at Susan s quivering face brimming eyes and set lips knew it for what it was and did not mistake it for discourtesy But because she knew Susan would prefer it so she turned away with a light Yes so ve I Good bye which gave no sign that she had seen and understood doctor Stewart came himself with Keith to Hinsdale and accompanied him to the house It had been the doctor s own suggestion that neither the boy s father nor Susan should meet them at the train Perhaps the doctor feared for that meeting Naturally it would not be an easy one Naturally too he did not want to add one straw to Keith s already grievous burden So he had written I will come to the house As I am a little uncertain as to the train I can catch from Boston do not try to meet me at the station Jest as if we couldn t see through that subterranean Susan had muttered to herself over the dishes that morning I guess he knows what train he s goin to take all right He jest didn t want us to meet him an make a scenic at the depot I wonder if he thinks I would Don t he think I knows anything But after all it was very simple very quiet very ordinary doctor Stewart rang the bell and Susan went to the door And there they stood Keith big and strong and handsome Susan had forgotten that two years could transform a somewhat awkward boy into so fine and stalwart a youth the doctor pale and with an apprehensive uncertainty in his eyes Well Susan how are you Keith s voice was strong and steady and the outstretched hand gripped hers with a clasp that hurt Then in some way never quite clear to her Susan found herself in the big living room with Keith and the doctor and Daniel Burton all shaking hands and all talking at once They sat down then and their sentences became less broken less incoherent But they said only ordinary things about the day the weather the journey home John McGuire the war the President s message the entry of the United States into the conflict There was nothing whatever said about eyes that could see or eyes that could not see or operations that failed And by and by the doctor got up and said that he must go To be sure the good byes were a little hurriedly spoken and the voices were at a little higher pitch than was usual and when the doctor had gone Keith and his father went at once upstairs to the studio and shut the door Susan went out into the kitchen then and took up her neglected work She made a great clatter of pans and dishes and she sang lustily at her mad song and at several others But every now and then between songs and rattles she would stop and listen intently and twice she climbed halfway up the back stairs and stood poised her breath suspended her anxious eyes on that closed studio door Yet supper that night was another very ordinary occurrence with Keith and his father talking of the war and Susan waiting upon them with a cheerfulness that was almost obtrusive In her own room that night however Susan addressed an imaginary Keith all in the dark You re fine an splendid an I love you for it Keith my boy she choked but you don t fool your old Susan Your chin is up jest as I said twould be an you re marchin straight ahead But inside your heart is breakin Do you think I don t KNOW But we ain t goin to let each other KNOW we know Keith my boy Not much we ain t An I guess if you can march straight ahead with your chin up the rest of us can all right We ll see And Susan was singing again the next morning when she did her breakfast dishes At ten o clock Keith came into the kitchen Where s dad Susan He isn t in the studio and I ve looked in every room in the house and I can t find him anywhere Keith spoke with the aggrieved air of one who has been deprived of his just rights Susan s countenance changed Why Keith don t you that is your father Didn t he tell you stammered Susan Tell me what Why that that he was goin to be away No he didn t What do you mean Away where How long Why er working Sketching in this storm Nonsense Susan Besides he d have taken me He always took me Susan what s the matter Where IS dad A note of uncertainty almost fear had crept into the boy s voice You re keeping SOMETHING from me Susan caught her breath and threw a swift look into Keith s unseeing eyes Then she laughed hysterically a bit noisily Keepin somethin from you Why sure we ain t boy Didn t I jest tell you He s workin down to McGuire s WORKING Down to MCGUIRE S Keith plainly did not yet understand Sure An he s got a real good position too Susan spoke jauntily enthusiastically But the McGuires never buy pictures frowned Keith or want He stopped short Face voice and manner underwent a complete change Susan you don t mean that dad is CLERKING down there behind that grocery counter Susan saw and recognized the utter horror and dismay in Keith s lace and quailed before it But she managed in some way to keep her voice still triumphant Sure he is An he gets real good wages too an But Keith with a low cry had gone Before the noon dinner however he appeared again at the kitchen door His face was very white now Susan how long has dad been doing this Oh quite a while Funny now Hain t he ever told you No But there seem to be quite a number of things that you people haven t told me Susan winced but she still held her ground jauntily Oh yes quite a while she nodded cheerfully An he gets But doesn t he paint any more at all interrupted the boy sharply Why no no I don t know that he does tossed Susan airily An of course if he s found somethin he likes better Susan you don t have to talk like that to me interposed Keith quietly I understand of course There are some things that can be seen without eyes Oh but honest Keith he But once again Keith had gone and Susan found herself talking to empty air When Susan went into the dining room that evening to wait at dinner she went with fear and trepidation and she looked apprehensively into the faces of the two men sitting opposite each other But in the kitchen a few minutes later she muttered to herself Pooh I needn t have worried They ve got sense both of em an they know that what s got to be has got to be That s all An that it don t do no good to fuss I needn t have worried But Susan did worry She did not like the look on Keith s face She did not like the nervous twitching of his hands She did not like the exaggerated cheerfulness of his manner And Keith WAS cheerful He played solitaire with his marked cards and whistled He worked at his raised picture puzzles and sang snatches of merry song He talked with anybody who came near him talked very fast and laughed a great deal But behind the whistling and the singing and the laughter Susan detected a tense strain and nervousness that she did not like And at times when she knew Keith thought himself alone there was an expression on his face that disturbed Susan not a little But because outwardly it was all cheerfulness Susan kept her peace but she also kept her eyes on Keith CHAPTER XXI THE LION Keith had not been home a week before it was seen that Hinsdale was inclined to make a lion of the boy Women brought him jelly and fruit and men clapped him on the shoulder and said How are you my boy in voices that were not quite steady Young girls brought him flowers and asked Susan if they could not read or sing or do SOMETHING to amuse him Children stood about the gate and stared talking in awe struck whispers happy if they could catch a glimpse of his face at the window A part of this Susan succeeded in keeping from Keith Susan had a well founded belief that Keith would not care to be a lion But a great deal of it came to his knowledge of course in spite of anything she could do However she told herself that she need not have worried for if Keith had recognized it for what it was he made no sign and even Susan herself could find no fault with his behavior He was cordial cheery almost gay outwardly 
6288_63105_000005_000003	train-clean-360	But inwardly 
none	none	Susan was still keeping her eyes on Keith missus McGuire came often to see Keith She said she knew he would want to hear John s letters And there were all the old ones besides the new ones that came from time to time 
6288_63105_000007_000003	train-clean-360	She brought them all and read them to him 
none	none	She talked about the young soldier too a great deal to the blind boy She explained to Susan that she wanted to do everything she could to get him out of himself and interest him in the world outside and that she didn t know any better way to do it than to tell him of these brave soldiers who were doing something so really worth while in the world An he s so interested the dear boy she concluded with a sigh An so brave I think he s the bravest thing I ever saw Susan Betts Yes he is brave said Susan a little shortly so shortly that missus McGuire opened her eyes a bit and wondered why Susan s lips had snapped tight shut in that straight hard line But what ails the woman she muttered to herself vexedly as she crossed the back yard to her own door Wasn t she herself always braggin about his bein so brave Humph There s no such thing as pleasin some folks it seems finished missus McGuire as she entered her own door But missus McGuire was not the only frequent caller There was Mazie Sanborn Mazie began by coming every two or three days with flowers and fudge Then she brought the latest novel one day and suggested that she read it to Keith Susan was skeptical of this even fearful She had not forgotten Keith s frenzied avoidance of such callers in the old days But to her surprise now Keith welcomed Mazie joyously so joyously that Susan began to suspect that behind the joyousness lay an eagerness to welcome anything that would help him to forget himself She was the more suspicious of this during the days that followed as she saw this same nervous eagerness displayed every time any one called at the house Susan s joy then at Keith s gracious response to visitors attentions changed to a vague uneasiness Behind and beyond it all lay an intangible something upon which Susan could not place her finger but which filled her heart with distrust And so still she kept her eyes on Keith In June Dorothy Parkman came to Hinsdale She came at once to see Susan But she would only step inside the hall and she spoke low and hurriedly looking fearfully toward the closed doors beyond the stairway I HAD to come to see how he was she began a little breathlessly And I wanted to ask you if you thought I could do any good or or be any help to him either as Miss Stewart or Dorothy Parkman Only I I suppose I would HAVE to be Dorothy Parkman now I couldn t keep the other up forever of course But I don t know how to tell She stopped and looked again fearfully toward the closed doors
6288_63105_000016_000004	train-clean-360	 Susan how how IS he she finished unsteadily 
none	none	He s well very well He sees people Mazie says he sees everybody now Yes oh yes he sees people That s why I thought perhaps he wouldn t mind ME now I mean the real me faltered the girl wistfully Maybe Susan s sigh and frown expressed doubt But he s real brave challenged the girl quickly Mazie SAID he was I know Everybody says he s brave There was an odd constraint in Susan s voice but the girl was too intent on her own problem to notice it And that s why I hoped about me you know that he wouldn t mind now And of course it can t make any difference about his eyes for he doesn t need father or or any one now Her voice broke Oh Susan I want to help some way if I can 
6288_63105_000023_000002	train-clean-360	WOULD he see me do you think 
none	none	He ought to He sees everybody else I know Mazie says Does Mazie know about you interrupted Susan
6288_63105_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 I mean about your being Miss Stewart 
6288_63105_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 A little but not much 
none	none	I told her once that he most always called me Miss Stewart but I never made anything of it and I never told her how much I saw of him out home 
6288_63105_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Some way I She stopped short with a quick indrawing of her breath 
6288_63105_000027_000003	train-clean-360	In the doorway down the hall stood Keith 
6288_63105_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Susan I thought I heard WAS Miss Stewart here he demanded excitedly 
none	none	With only the briefest of hesitations and a half despairing half relieved look into Susan s startled eyes the young girl hurried forward
6288_63105_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed I m here she cried gayly giving a warm clasp to his eagerly outstretched hand How do you do 
none	none	Susan was just saying But Susan was gone with upflung hands and a look that said No you don t rake me into this thing young lady as plainly as if she had spoken the words themselves In the living room a minute later Keith began eager questioning
6288_63105_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 When did you come 
none	none	Yesterday And you came to see me the very next day Weren t you good You knew how I wanted to see you
6288_63105_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh but I didn t she laughed a little embarrassedly 
6288_63105_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 You re at home now and you have all your old friends and 
none	none	But they re not you There s not any one like you cut in the youth fervently And now you re going to stay a long time aren t you Y yes several weeks probably Good And you ll come every day to see me W well as to that It s too much to ask of course broke off Keith contritely And truly I don t want to impose on you
6288_63105_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 No no it isn t that protested the girl quickly 
6288_63105_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 It s only There are so many 
none	none	But I told you there isn t anybody like you Miss Stewart 
6288_63105_000043_000001	train-clean-360	There isn t any one here that UNDERSTANDS like you 
none	none	And it was you who first taught me to do so many things His voice faltered Illustration YOU VE HELPED MORE THAN YOU LL EVER KNOW He paused wet his lips then plunged on hurriedly
6288_63105_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 Miss Stewart I don t say this sort of thing very often 
6288_63105_000045_000002	train-clean-360	I never said it before to anybody 
none	none	But I want you to know that I understood and appreciated just what you were doing all those weeks for me out there at the sanatorium 
6288_63105_000045_000004	train-clean-360	And it was the WAY you did it with never a word or a hint that I was different 
none	none	You did things and you made me do things without reminding me all the time that I was blind I shall never forget that first day when you told me dad would want to hear from me and then before I could say a word you put that paper in my hands and my fingers fell on those lines that I could feel 
6288_63105_000045_000007	train-clean-360	And how I blessed you for not TELLING me those lines were there 
none	none	Don t you see Everybody here that comes to see me TELLS me the lines are there Yes I know The girl s voice was low a little breathless And that s why I need you so much If anybody in the whole world can make me forget for a minute you can 
6288_63105_000047_000002	train-clean-360	You will come 
none	none	Why of course I ll come and be glad to You know I will And I m so glad if I ve helped any You ve helped more than you ll ever know 
6288_63105_000049_000001	train-clean-360	But come look 
none	none	I ve got a dandy new game here And Keith very obviously to hide the shake in his voice and the emotion in his face turned gayly to a little stand near him and picked up a square cardboard box Half an hour later Dorothy Parkman passing through the hall on her way to the outer door was waylaid by Susan Sh h Don t speak here but come with me she whispered leading the way through the diningroom In the kitchen she stopped and turned eagerly Well did you tell him she demanded Miss Dorothy shook her head mutely despairingly You mean he don t know yet that you re Dorothy Parkman
6288_63105_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 I mean just that 
none	none	But child alive he ll find out he can t help finding out now I know it But I just couldn t tell him I COULDN T Susan I tried to do it two or three times Indeed I did 
6288_63105_000056_000004	train-clean-360	But the words just wouldn t come 
none	none	And now I don t know when I can tell him But he was tickled to death to see you He showed it Miss Dorothy I know A soft pink suffused the young girl s face But it was Miss Stewart he was glad to see not Dorothy Parkman And after the things he said She stopped and looked back over her shoulder toward the room she had just left But Miss Dorothy don t you see It ll be all right now You ve SHOWN him that you don t mind being with blind folks a mite So now he won t care a bit when he knows you are Dorothy Parkman But the girl shook her head again Yes I know He might not mind that part PERHAPS but I know he d mind the deceit all these long months and it wouldn t be easy to to make him understand 
6288_63105_000061_000002	train-clean-360	He d never forgive it I know he wouldn t to think I d taken advantage of his not being able to see 
none	none	Nonsense Of course he would He wouldn t You don t know Just to day he said something about about some one who had tried to deceive him in a little thing because he was blind and I could see how bitter he was But what ARE you goin to do I don t know Susan It s harder than ever now almost moaned the girl You re COMIN AGAIN Yes oh yes I shall come as long as he ll let me I know he wants me to I know I HAVE helped a little 
6288_63105_000067_000004	train-clean-360	He spoke beautifully about that to day 
none	none	But whether after he finds out Her voice choked into silence and she turned her head quite away There there dear don t you fret Susan comforted her You jest go home and think no more about it 
6288_63105_000069_000000	train-clean-360	When thinkin won t mend it Then thinkin won t end it 
none	none	So what s the use When you get ready you jest come again an you keep a comin too It ll all work out right You see if it don t Thank you Susan Oh I ll come as long as I can sighed the girl turning to go But I m not so sure how it ll turn out she finished with a wistful smile over her shoulder as she opened the door CHAPTER XXII HOW COULD YOU MAZIE As Miss Dorothy herself had said it could not of course continue She came once and once again to see Keith and in spite of her efforts to make her position clear to him her secret still remained her own Then on the third visit the dreaded disclosure came naturally and in the simplest most unexpected way yet in a way that would most certainly have been the last choice of Miss Dorothy herself could she have had aught to say about it The two Keith and Dorothy had had a wonderful hour over a book that Dorothy had brought to read They had been sitting on the porch and Dorothy had risen to go when there came a light tread on the front walk and Mazie Sanborn tripped up the porch steps Well Dorothy Parkman is this where you were she cried gayly I was hunting all over the house for you half an hour ago DOROTHY PARKMAN Keith was on his feet His face had grown very white Dorothy too her eyes on Keith s face had grown very white yet she managed to give a light laugh and her voice matched Mazie s own for gayety Were you Well I was right here But I m going now You but Miss Stewart Keith s colorless lips spoke the words just above his breath Why Keith Burton what s the matter laughed Mazie You look as if you d seen a ghost I mean oh forgive that word Keith she broke off in light apology I m always forgetting and talking as if you could really SEE But you looked so funny and you brought out that Dorothy Parkman with such a surprised air Just as if you didn t ever call her that in the old school days Keith Burton Oh Dorothy told me you called her Miss Stewart a lot now but Yes I have called her Miss Stewart quite a lot lately interposed Keith in a voice so quietly self controlled that even Dorothy herself was almost deceived But not quite Dorothy saw the clenched muscles and white knuckles of his hands as he gripped the chair back before him and she knew too much to expect him to offer his hand in good bye So she backed away and she still spoke lightly inconsequently though she knew her voice was shaking as she made her adieus Well good bye I must be going now sure I ll be over to morrow though to finish the book Good bye Good bye said Keith And Dorothy wondered if Mazie noticed that he quite omitted a polite Come again and if Mazie saw that as he said the terse Good bye he put both hands suddenly and resolutely behind his back Dorothy saw it and at home long hours later she was still crying over it She went early to the Burtons the next forenoon I came to finish the book I was reading to mister Keith she told Susan brightly as her ring was answered I thought I d come early before anybody else got here She would have stepped in but Susan s ample figure still barred the way Well now that s too bad Susan s voice expressed genuine concern and personal disappointment Ain t it a shame Keith said he wa n t feelin nohow well this mornin an that he didn t want to see no one An under no circumstances not to let no one in to see him But maybe if I told him t was you No no don t don t do that cried the girl hurriedly I I ll come again some other time On the street a minute later she whispered tremulously He did it on purpose of course He KNEW I would come this morning But he can t keep it up forever He ll HAVE to see me some time And when he does Oh if only Mazie Sanborn hadn t blurted it out like that Why didn t I tell him Why didn t I tell him But I will tell him He can t keep this up forever When on a second and a third and a fourth morning however Dorothy had found Susan s figure barring the way and had received the same distressed He says he won t see no one Miss Dorothy from Susan s plainly troubled lips Dorothy began to think Keith did mean to keep it up forever But what IS it Susan she faltered Is he sick really sick I don t know Miss Dorothy frowned Susan But I don t like the looks of it anyhow He says he ain t sick not physicianly sick but he jest don t want to talk an see folks An he s been like that most a week now An I m free to confess I don t like it But what does he do all day asked the girl Nothin that I can see sighed Susan profoundly Oh he plays that solitary some an putters a little with some of his raised books but mostly he jest sits still an thinks An I don t like it If only his father was here But with him gone peddlin molasses an no one lowed into the house there ain t anything for him to do but to think An tain t right nor good for him I ve watched him an I know But he used to see people Susan I know it He saw everybody Do you know why he won t now asked the girl a little faintly I hain t the faintest inception of an idea It came as sudden as that declared Susan snapping her finger Then he hasn t said anything special about not wanting to see me Why no He Do you mean HAS he found out demanded Susan interrupting herself excitedly Yes He found out last Monday afternoon Mazie ran up on to the porch and called me by name right out Oh Susan it was awful I shall never forget the look on that boy s face as long as I live Lan sakes MONDAY breathed Susan An Tuesday he began refusin to see folks Then course that was it But why won t he see other folks They hain t anything to do with you I don t know unless he didn t want to tell you specially not to let me in and so he said not to let anybody in Was he awful mad It wasn t so much anger as it was grief and hurt and oh I can t express what it was But I saw it and I never shall forget it You see to have it blurted out to him like that without any warning and of course he couldn t understand But didn t you explain things how twas in the first place She shook her head I couldn t not with Mazie there I said I d come the next morning to to finish the book I thought he d understand I was going to explain then He probably did and that s why he won t let me in He doesn t want any explanations sighed the girl tremulously Well he ought to want em asserted Susan with vigor Tain t fair nor right nor sensible for him to act like this makin a mountain out of an ant hill I declare Miss Dorothy he ought to be made to see you The girl flushed and drew back Most certainly not Susan I I am not in the habit of MAKING people see me when they don t wish to Do you suppose I m going to beg and tease PLEASE won t you let me see you Hardly He need not worry I shall not come again Oh Miss Dorothy remonstrated Susan Why of course I won t Susan cried the girl Do you suppose I m going to keep him from seeing other people just because he s afraid he ll have to let me in too Nonsense Susan Even you must admit I cannot allow that You may tell mister Keith please that he may feel no further uneasiness I shall not trouble him again Oh Miss Dorothy begged Susan agitatedly once more But Miss Dorothy with all the hurt dignity of her eighteen years turned haughtily away leaving Susan impotent and distressed looking after her Two minutes later Susan sought Keith in the living room Her whole self spelt irate determination but Keith could not see that Keith listless and idle handed sat in his favorite chair by the window Dorothy Parkman jest rang the bell began Susan an But I said I d see no one interrupted Keith instantly alert That s what I told her an she s gone Oh all right Keith relaxed into his old listlessness An she said to please tell you she d trouble you no further so you might let in the others now as soon as you please Keith sat erect in his chair with a jerk What did she mean by that I guess you don t need me to tell you observed Susan grimly With a shrug and an irritable gesture Keith settled back in his chair I don t care to discuss it Susan I don t wish to see ANY one We ll let it go at that if you please he said But I don t please Susan was in the room now close to Keith s chair Her face was quivering with emotion Keith won t you listen to reason It ain t like you a mite to sit back like this an refuse to see a nice little body like Dorothy Parkman what s been so kind Susan Keith was sitting erect again His face was white and carried a stern anguish that Susan had never seen before I don t care to discuss Miss Parkman with you or with anybody else Neither do I care to discuss the fact that I thoroughly understand of course that you or she or anybody else can fool me into believing anything you please and I can t help myself No no Keith don t take it like that please don t Is there any other way I CAN take it Do you think Miss Stewart could have made such a fool of me if I d had EYES to see Dorothy Parkman But she was only tryin to HELP you an I don t want to be helped stormed the boy hotly Did it ever occur to you Susan that I might sometimes like to HELP somebody myself instead of this everlastingly having somebody help me But you do help You help me asserted Susan feverishly working her nervous fingers together An you d help me more if you d only let folks in to see you an All right all right interrupted Keith testily Let them in Let everybody in I don t care What s the difference But please PLEASE Susan stop talking any more about it all now And Susan stopped There were times when Susan knew enough to stop and this was one of them But she took him at his word and when missus McGuire came the next day with a letter from her John Susan ushered her into the living room where Keith was sitting alone And Keith welcomed her with at least a good imitation of his old heartiness missus McGuire said she had such a funny letter to read to day She knew he d enjoy it and Susan would too particularly the part that John had quoted from something that had been printed by the British soldiers in France and circulated among their comrades in the trenches and hospitals and everywhere John had written it off on a separate piece of paper and this was it Don t worry there s nothing to worry about You have two alternatives either you are mobilized or you are not If not you have nothing to worry about If you are mobilized you have two alternatives you are in camp or at the front If you are in camp you have nothing to worry about If you are at the front you have two alternatives either you are on the fighting line or in reserve If in reserve you have nothing to worry about If you are on the fighting line you have two alternatives either you fight or you don t If you don t you have nothing to worry about If you do you have two alternatives either you get hurt or you don t If you don t you have nothing to worry about If you are hurt you have two alternatives either you are slightly hurt or badly If slightly you have nothing to worry about If badly you have two alternatives either you recover or you don t If you recover you have nothing to worry about If you don t and have followed my advice clear through you have done with worry forever missus McGuire was in a gale of laughter by the time she had finished reading this so too was Susan Keith also was laughing but his laughter did not have the really genuine ring to it which fact did not escape Susan Well anyhow he let Mis McGuire in an that s somethin she muttered to herself as missus McGuire took her departure Besides he talked to her real pleasant an that s more As the days passed others came also and Keith talked with them He even allowed Dorothy Parkman to be admitted one day Illustration HE GAVE HER ALMOST NO CHANCE TO SAY ANYTHING HERSELF Dorothy had not come until after long urging on the part of Susan and the assurance that Keith had said he would see her Even then nothing would have persuaded her she told Susan except the great hope that she could say something in some way that would set her right in Keith s eyes So with fear and trembling and with a painful embarrassment on her face but with a great hope in her heart she entered the room and came straight to Keith s side For a moment the exultation of a fancied success sent a warm glow all through her for Keith had greeted her pleasantly and even extended his hand But almost at once the glow faded and the great hope died in her heart for she saw that even while she touched his hand he was yet miles away from her He laughed and talked with her oh yes but he laughed too much and talked too much He gave her almost no chance to say anything herself And what he said was so inconsequential and so far removed from anything intimately concerning themselves that the girl found it utterly impossible to make the impassioned explanation which she had been saying over and over again all night to herself and from which she had hoped so much Yet at the last just before she bade him good bye she did manage to say something But in her disappointment and excitement and embarrassment her words were blurted out haltingly and ineffectually and they were not at all the ones she had practiced over and over to herself in the long night watches nor were they received as she had palpitatingly pictured that they would be with Keith first stern and hurt and then just dear and forgiving and UNDERSTANDING Keith was neither stern nor hurt He still laughed pleasantly and he tossed her whole labored explanation aside with a light Certainly of course to be sure not at all You did quite right I assure you And then he remarked that it was a warm day wasn t it And Dorothy found herself hurrying down the Burton front walk with burning cheeks and a chagrined helplessness that left her furious and with an ineffably cheap feeling yet not able to put her finger on any discourteous flaw in Keith s punctilious politeness I wish I d never said a word not a word she muttered hotly to herself as she hurried down the street I wonder if he thinks I ll ever open my head to him about it again Well he needn t worry But oh Keith Keith how could you she choked brokenly Then abruptly she turned down a side street lest Mazie Sanborn coming toward her should see the big tears that were rolling down her cheeks CHAPTER XXIII JOHN McGUIRE So imperative was the knock at the kitchen door at six o clock that July morning that Susan almost fell down the back stairs in her haste to obey the summons Lan sakes Mis McGuire what a start you did give why Mis McGuire what is it she interrupted herself aghast as missus McGuire white faced and wild eyed swept past her and began to pace up and down the kitchen floor moaning frenziedly It s come it s come I knew t would come Oh what shall I do What shall I do What s come Oh John John my boy my boy You don t mean he s dead No no worse than that worse than that moaned the woman wringing her hands Oh what shall I do what shall I do With a firm grasp Susan caught the twisting fingers and gently but resolutely forced their owner into a chair Do You ll jest calm yourself right down an tell me all about it Mis McGuire This rampagin round the kitchen like this don t do no sort of good an it s awful on your nerves An furthermore an moreover no matter what t is that ails your John it can t be worse n death for while there s life there s hope you know But it is it is I tell you sobbed missus McGuire still swaying her body back and forth Susan my boy is BLIND With the utterance of the dread word missus McGuire stiffened suddenly into rigid horror her eyes staring straight into Susan s MIS MCGUIRE breathed Susan in dismay then hopefully But maybe twas a mistake The woman shook her head She went back to her swaying from side to side No twas a dispatch It came this mornin Just now mister McGuire was gone an there wasn t anybody there but the children an they re asleep That s why I came over I HAD to I had to talk to some one Of course you did An you shall you poor lamb You shall tell me all about it What was it What happened I don t know I just know he s blind an that he s comin home He s on his way now My John blind Oh Susan what shall I do what shall I do Then he probably ain t sick or hurt anywheres else if he s on his way home leastways he ain t hurt bad You can be glad for that Mis McGuire I don t know I don t know Maybe he is It didn t say It just said blinded chattered missus McGuire feverishly They get them home just as soon as they can when they re blinded We were readin about it only yesterday in the paper how they did send em home right away Oh how little I thought that my son John would be one of em my John But your John ain t the only one Mis McGuire There s other Johns too Look at our Keith here I know I know An I wonder how he ll take this about your John HE LL know what it means choked missus McGuire He sure will an he ll feel bad I know that He ain t hisself anyway these days He ain t missus McGuire asked the question abstractedly her mind plainly on her own trouble but Susan intent on HER trouble did not need even the question to spur her tongue No he ain t Oh he s brave an cheerful He s awful cheerful even cheerfuler than he was a month ago He s too cheerful Mis McGuire There s somethin back of it I don t like He But missus McGuire was not listening Wringing her hands she had sprung to her feet and was pacing the floor again moaning Oh what shall I do what shall I do A minute later only weeping afresh at Susan s every effort to comfort her she stumbled out of the kitchen and hurried across the yard to her own door Watching her from the window Susan drew a long sigh I wonder how he WILL take But lan sakes this ain t gettin my breakfast she ejaculated with a hurried glance at the clock on the little shelf over the stove There was nothing apparently to distinguish breakfast that morning from a dozen other breakfasts that had gone before Keith and his father talked cheerfully of various matters and Susan waited upon them with her usual briskness If Susan was more silent than usual and if her eyes sought Keith s face more frequently than was her habit no one apparently noticed it Susan did fancy however that she saw a new tenseness in Keith s face a new nervousness in his manner but that perhaps was because she was watching him so closely and because he was so constantly in her mind owing to her apprehension as to how he would take the news of John McGuire s blindness From the very first Susan had determined not to tell her news until after mister Burton had left the house She could not have explained it even to herself but she had a feeling that it would be better to tell Keith when he was alone She planned also to tell him casually as it were in the midst of other conversation not as if it were the one thing on her mind In accordance with this therefore she forced herself to finish her dishes and to set her kitchen in order before she sought Keith in the living room But Keith was not in the living room neither was he on the porch or anywhere in the yard With a troubled frown on her face Susan climbed the stairs to the second floor Keith s room was silent and empty so far as human presence was concerned So too was the studio and every other room on that floor At the front of the attic stairs Susan hesitated The troubled frown on her face deepened as she glanced up the steep narrow stairway She did not like to have Keith go off by himself to the attic and already now twice before she had found him up there poking in the drawers of an old desk that had been his father s He had shut the drawers quickly and had laughingly turned aside her questions when she had asked him what in the world he was doing up there And he had got up immediately and had gone downstairs with her But she had not liked the look on his face And to day as she hesitated at the foot of the stairs she was remembering that look But for only a moment Resolutely then she lifted her chin ran up the stairs and opened the attic door Over at the desk by the window there was a swift movement but not so swift that Susan did not see the revolver pushed under some loose papers Is that you Susan asked Keith sharply Yes honey I jest came up to get somethin Susan s face was white like paper and her hands were cold and shaking but her voice except for a certain breathlessness was cheerfully steady With more or less noise and with a running fire of inconsequent comment she rummaged among the trunks and boxes gradually working her way to ward the desk where Keith still sat At the desk with a sudden swift movement she thrust the papers to one side and dropped her hand on the revolver At the same moment Keith s arm shot out and his hand fell covering hers She saw his young face flush and harden and his mouth set into stern lines Susan you ll be good enough please to take your hand off that he said then sharply There was a moment s tense silence Susan s eyes agonized and pleading were on his face But Keith could not see that He could only hear her words a moment later light words with a hidden laugh in them yet spoken with that same curious breathlessness Faith honey an how can I with your own hand holdin mine so tight Keith removed his hand instantly His set face darkened This is not a joke Susan and I shall have to depend on your honor to let that revolver stay where it is Unfortunately I am unable to SEE whether I am obeyed or not It was Susan s turn to flush She drew back at once leaving the weapon uncovered on the desk between them I m not takin the pistol Keith The laugh was all gone from Susan s voice now So too was the breathlessness The voice was steady grave but very gentle We take matches an pizen an knives away from CHILDREN not from grown men Keith The pistol is right where you can reach it if you want it Illustration KEITH S ARM SHOT OUT AND HIS HAND FELL COVERING HERS She saw the fingers of Keith s hand twitch and tighten Otherwise there was no answer After a moment she went on speaking But let me say jest this tain t like you to be a quitter Keith She saw him wince but she did not wait for him to speak An after you ve done this thing there ain t any one in the world goin to be so sorry as you ll be You mark my words It was like a sharp knife cutting a taut cord The tense muscles relaxed and Keith gave a sudden laugh True it was a short laugh and a bitter one but it was a laugh You forget Susan If if I carried that out I wouldn t be in the world to care Shucks You d be in some world Keith Burton an you know it An you d feel nice lookin down on the mess you d made of THIS world wouldn t you Well if I was LOOKING I d be SEEING wouldn t I cut in the youth grimly Don t forget Susan that I d be SEEING please Seein ain t everything Keith Burton Jest remember that There is some things you d rather be blind than see An that s one of em Besides seein ain t the only sensible you ve got an there s such a lot of things you can do an Oh yes I know interrupted Keith fiercely flinging out both his hands I can feel a book and eat my dinner and I can hear the shouts of the people cheering the boys that go marching by my door But I m tired of it all I tell you I can t stand it I CAN T Susan Yes I know that s a cheap way out of it he went on after a choking pause with a wave of his hand toward the revolver on the desk and a cowardly one too I know all that And maybe I wouldn t have have done it to day even if you hadn t come I found it last week and it fascinated me It seemed such an easy way out of it Since then I ve been up here two or three times just to to feel of it Somehow I liked to know it was here and that if if I just couldn t stand things another minute But I ve tried to be decent honest I have But I m tired of being amused and tended to like a ten year old boy I don t want flowers and jellies and candies brought in to me I don t want to read and play solitaire and checkers week in and week out I want to be over there doing a man s work Look at Ted and Tom and Jack Green and John McGuire John McGuire It was a faltering cry from Susan but Keith did not even hear What are they doing and what am I doing Yet you people expect me to sit here contented with a dice box and a deck of playing cards and be GLAD I can do that much Oh well I suppose I ought to be But when I sit here alone day after day and think and think But Keith we don t want you to do that interposed Susan feverishly Now there s Miss Dorothy if you d only let her But I tell you I don t want to be babied and pitied and tended to by young women who are SORRY for me I want to do the helping part of the time And if I see a girl I I could care for I want to be able to ask her like a man to marry me and then if she says yes I want to be able to take care of her myself not have her take care of me and marry me out of pity and feed me fudge and flowers And there s dad Keith s voice broke and stopped Susan watching his impassioned face wet her lips and swallowed convulsively Then Keith began again Susan do you know the one big thing that drives me up here every time in spite of myself It s the thought of dad How do you suppose I feel to think of dad peddling peas and beans and potatoes down to McGuire s grocery store dad Susan lifted her head defiantly Well now look a here Keith Burton let me tell you that peddlin peas an beans an potatoes is jest as honorary as paintin pictures an I m not saying it isn t cut in the boy incisively I m merely saying that as I happen to know he prefers to paint pictures and I prefer to have him And he d be doing it this minute if it wasn t for his having to support me and you know it Susan Well what of it It don t hurt him any It hurts me Susan And when I think of all the things he hoped of me I was going to be Jerry and Ned and myself and I was going to make him so proud Susan so proud I was going to make up to him all that he had lost All day under the trees up on the hill I used to lie and dream of what I was going to be some day the great pictures I was going to paint for dad The great fame that was going to come to me for dad The money I was going to earn for dad I saw dad old and white haired leaning on me I saw the old house restored all the locks and keys and sagging blinds the cracked ceilings and tattered wallpaper all made fresh and new And dad so proud and happy in it all so proud and happy that perhaps he d think I really had made up for Jerry and Ned and his own lost hopes And now look at me Useless worse than useless all my life a burden to him and to everybody else Susan I can t stand it I CAN T That s why I want to end it all It would be so simple such an easy way out Yes twould for quitters Quitters always take easy ways out But you ain t no quitter Keith Burton Besides t wouldn t end it You know that Twould jest be shuttin the door of this room an openin the one to the next You ve had a good Christian bringin up Keith Burton an you know as well as I do that your eternal immoral soul ain t goin to be snuffled out of existence by no pistol shot no matter how many times you pull the jigger Keith laughed and with the laugh his tense muscles relaxed All right Susan he shrugged a little grimly I ll concede your point You made it perhaps better than you know But well it isn t so pleasant always to be the hook you know he finished bitterly The hook frowned Susan Keith laughed again grimly Perhaps you ve forgotten but I haven t I heard you talking to missus McGuire one day You said that everybody was either a hook or an eye and that more than half the folks were hooks hanging on to somebody else And that s why some eyes had more than their share of hooks hanging on to them You see I remembered I knew then when you said it that I was a hook and Keith Burton I never thought of you when I said that interrupted Susan agitatedly Perhaps not but I did Why Susan of course I m a hook an old bent rusty hook But I can hang on oh yes I can hang on to anybody that will let me But Susan don t you see sometimes it seems as if I d give the whole world if just for once I could feel that I that some one was hanging on to me that I was of some use somewhere An so you re goin to be honey I know you be urged Susan eagerly Just remember all them fellers that wrote books an give lecturing an Oh yes I know interposed Keith with a faint smile You were a good old soul Susan to read me all those charming tales and I understood of course what you were doing it for You wanted me to go and do likewise But I couldn t write a book to save my soul Susan and my voice would stick in my throat at the second word of a lecturing But there ll be somethin Keith I know there ll be somethin God never locked up the doors of your eyes without givin you the key to some other door It s jest that you hain t found it yet Perhaps I certainly haven t found it that s sure retorted the lad bitterly And just why He saw fit to send me this blindness We don t have to know interposed Susan quickly an questionin about it don t settle nothin anyhow If we ve got it we ve got it an if it s somethin we can t possibly help the only questionin worth anything then is how are we goin to stand it You see there s more n one way of standin things Yes I know there is Keith stirred restlessly in his seat An some ways is better than others There there Susan I know just what you re going to say and it s all very true of course cried Keith stirring still more restlessly But you see T don t happen to feel like hearing it just now Oh yes I know I ve got lots to be thankful for I can hear and feel and taste and walk and I should be glad for all of them And I am of course I should declare that all s well with the world and that both sides of the street are sunny and that there isn t any shadow anywhere There you see I know all that you would say Susan and I ve said it so as to save you the trouble Humph commented Susan bridling a little then suddenly she gave a sly chuckle That s all very well an good Master Keith Burton but there s one more thing I would have said if I was doin the sayin Well About that both sides of the street bein sunny it seems to me that the man what says yes he knows one side is shady an troublous but that he thinks it ll be healthier an happier for him an everybody else round him if he walks on the sunny side an then WALKS THERE it seems to me he s got the spots all knocked off that feller what says there AIN T no shady side Keith gave a low laugh a laugh more nearly normal than Susan had heard him give for several days All right Susan I ll accept your amendment and we ll let it go that one side is shady and that I m supposed to determinedly pick the sunny side Anything more M more That you came up to say to me yes You know I have just saved you the trouble of saying part of it Oh Susan laughed light heartedly This was Keith her Keith that she knew No that s all I She stopped short in dismay All the color and lightness disappeared from her face leaving it suddenly white and drawn That is she faltered there was somethin else I was goin to say about about John McGuire He I don t care to hear it Keith had frozen instantly into frigid aloofness Stern lines had come to his boyish mouth But but Keith missus McGuire came over to To read another of those precious letters of course cut in Keith angrily but I tell you I don t want to hear it Do you suppose a caged bird likes to hear of the woods and fields and tree tops while he s tied to a three inch swing between two gilt bars Well hardly There s lots that I do have to stand Susan but I don t have to stand that Susan caught her breath with a half sob But Keith I wasn t going to tell you of of woods an fields an tree tops this time You see now he s in a cage himself What do you mean He s coming home He s blind Keith leaped from his chair BLIND JOHN McGUIRE Yes Oh h h Long years of past suffering and of future woe filled the short little word to bursting as Keith dropped back into his chair For a moment he sat silent his whole self held rigid Then unsteadily he asked the question What happened They don t know It was a dispatch that came this mornin He was blinded an is on his way home That s all That s enough Yes I knew you d understand Yes I do understand Susan hesitated Keith still sat with his unseeing gaze straight ahead his body tense and motionless On the desk within reach lay the revolver Cautiously Susan half extended her hand toward it then drew it back She glanced again at Keith s absorbed face then turned and made her way quietly down the stairs At the bottom of the attic flight she glanced back He won t touch it now I m sure she breathed An anyhow we only take knives an pizen away from children not grown men CHAPTER XXIV AS SUSAN SAW IT It was the town talk of course the home coming of John McGuire Men gathered on street corners and women clustered about back yard fences and church doorways Children besieged their parents with breathless questions and repeated to each other in awe struck whispers what they had heard Everywhere was horror sympathy and interested speculation as to how he d take it Where explicit information was so lacking imagination and surmise eagerly supplied the details and missus McGuire s news of the blinding of John McGuire was not three days old before a full account of the tragedy from beginning to end was flying from tongue to tongue an account that would have surprised no one so greatly as it would have surprised John McGuire himself To Susan Dorothy Parkman came one day with this story Well t ain t true disavowed Susan succinctly when the lurid details had been breathlessly repeated to her You mean he isn t blind demanded the young girl Oh yes he s blind all right poor boy But it s the rest I mean about his killin twenty eight Germans single handed an bein all shot to pieces hisself an benighted for bravery But what did happen We don t know We just know he s blind an comin home Mis McGuire had two letters yesterday from John but From John himself Yes but they was both writ long before the apostrophe an course they didn t say nothin about it He was well an happy he said She had had only one letter before these for a long time An now to have this Yes I know It s terrible How does mister Keith take it Susan opened wide her eyes Why you ve seen him you see him yesterday yourself Miss Dorothy Oh I saw him in a way but not the real him Susan He s miles away now always You mean he ain t civil an polite demanded Susan Oh he s very civil too civil Susan Every time I go I say I won t go again Then when I get to thinking of him sitting there alone all day and of how he used to like to have me read to him and play with him I I just have to go and see if he won t be the same as he used to be But he never is I know Susan shook her head mournfully An he ain t the same Miss Dorothy He don t ever whistle nor sing now nor play solitary nor any of them things he used to do Oh when folks comes in he braces back an talks an laughs YOU know that But in the exclusion of his own home here he jest sits an thinks an thinks an thinks An Miss Dorothy I ve found out now what he s thinkin of Yes It s John McGuire an them other soldiers what s comin back blind from the war An he talks an talks about em an mourns an takes on something dreadful He says HE knows what it means an that nobody can know what hain t had it happen to em An he broods an broods over it I can imagine it The girl said it with a little catch in her voice An an there s somethin else I want to tell you about I ve got to tell somebody I want to know if you think I done right An you re the only one I can tell I ve thought it all out Daniel Burton is too near an Mis McGuire an all them others is too far You ain t a relation an yet you care You do care don t you about mister Keith Why of of course I care a great deal Susan Miss Dorothy spoke very lightly very impersonally but there was a sudden flame of color in her face Susan however was not noticing this Furtively she was glancing one way and another over her shoulder Yes Well the other day he he tried to that is well I I found him with a pistol in his hand an Susan The girl had gone very white Oh he didn t do it Well that ain t a very sensitive statement is it For if he had done it he wouldn t be alive now would he broke off Susan with a faint smile But what I mean is he didn t do it an I don t think he s goin to do it But oh Susan faltered the girl you didn t leave that that awful thing with him did you Didn t you take it away No Susan s mouth set grimly An that s what I wanted to ask you about if I did right you know Oh no no Susan I m afraid shuddered the girl Can t you get it away now Maybe I know where tis I was up there yesterday an see it T was in the desk drawer in the attic jest where it used to be Then get it Susan get it Oh please get it begged the girl I m afraid to have it there a single minute But Miss Dorothy stop wait jest a minute Think How s he goin to get self defiance an make a strong man of hisself if we take things away from him like he was a little baby I know Susan but if he SHOULD be tempted He won t He ain t no more I m sure of that I talked with him Besides I hain t caught him up there once since that day last week Oh I m free to confess I HAVE watched him admitted Susan defensively with a faint smile But what did happen that day you you found him Oh he had it handlin it an when he heard me he jumped a little an hid it under some papers My Miss Dorothy twas awful I was that scared an frightened I thought I couldn t move But I knew I d got to an I knew I d got to move RIGHT too or I d spoil everything This wa n t no ten cent melodydrama down to the movies but I had a humane soul there before me an I knew maybe it s whole internal salvation might depend on what I said an did But what DID you say I don t know I only know that somehow when it was over I had a feelin that he wouldn t never do that thing again That somehow the MAN in him was on top an would stay on top An I m more sure than ever of it now He ain t thinkin of hisself these days It s John McGuire and them others An ain t it better that he let that pistol alone of his own free will an accordance an know he was a man an no baby than if I d taken it away from him I suppose it was Susan but I don t think I d have been strong enough to make him strong Yes you would if you d been there I reckon we re all goin to learn to do a lot of things we never did before now that the war has come Yes I know A quivering pain swept across the young girl s face Somehow the war never seemed real to me before T was jest somethin way off a lot of Dagoes an Dutchmen like the men what dug up the McGuires frozen water pipes last spring fightin Not our kind of folks what talked English Even when I read the papers an the awful things they did over there it didn t seem as if t was folks on our earth It was like somethin you read about in them old histronic days or somethin happenin up on the moon or on that plantation of Mars Oh of course I knew John McGuire had gone but somehow I never thought of him as fightin not with guns an bloody gore in spite of them letters of his Some way in my mind s eyes I always see him marchin with flags flyin an folks cheerin an I thought the war d be over anyhow by the time he got there But now Why now they re all gone our own Teddy Somers an Tom Spencer an little Jacky Green that I used to hold on my knee Some of em in France an some of em in them army canteens down to Ayer an Texas an everywhere An poor Tom s died already of pneumonia right here in our own land An now poor John McGuire I tell you Miss Dorothy it brings it right home now to your own heart where it hurts It certainly does Susan An let me tell you What do you s pose more n anything else made me see how really big it all is I don t know Susan Well I ll tell you Twas because I couldn t write a poem on it Sure enough Susan I don t believe I ve heard you make a rhyme to day smiled Miss Dorothy Susan sighed and shook her head Yes I know I don t make em much now Somehow they don t sing all the time in my heart an burst out natural like as they used to I think them days when I tried so hard to sell my poems an couldn t kinder took the jest out of poetizin for me Somehow when you find out somethin is invaluable to other folks it gets so it s invaluable to you I s pose Still even now when I set right down to it I can most always write em right off most as quick as I used to But I couldn t on this war I tried it But it jest wouldn t do I begun it Oh woe is me said the bayonet Oh woe is me said the sword Then the whole awful frightfulness of it an the bigness of it seemed to swallow me up an I felt like a little pigment overtopped an surrounded by great tall mountains of horror that were tumblin down one after another on my head an bury in me down so far an deep that I couldn t say anything only to moan Oh Lord how long oh Lord how long An I knew then t was too big for me I didn t try to write no more I can see how you couldn t faltered the girl as she turned away I m afraid we re all going to find it too big for us CHAPTER XXV KEITH TO THE RESCUE John McGuire had not been home twenty four hours before it was known that he took it powerful hard To Keith Susan told what she had learned They say he utterly refuses to see any one outside the family an that he d rather not see even his own folks that he s always askin em to let him alone Is he ill or wounded otherwise asked Keith No he ain t hurt outwardly or infernally except his eyes an he says that s the worst of it one woman told me He s as sound as a nut an good for a hundred years yet If he d only been smashed up good an solid so s he d have some hope of dyin pretty quick he wouldn t mind it he says But to live along like this oh he s in an awful state of mind everybody says I can imagine it sighed Keith And by the way he turned away Susan knew that he did not care to talk any more An hour later missus McGuire hurried into Susan s kitchen missus McGuire was looking thin and worn these days From her half buttoned shoes to her half combed hair she was showing the results of strain and anxiety With a long sigh she dropped into one of the kitchen chairs Well Mis McGuire if you ain t the stranger Susan greeted her cordially Yes I know sighed missus McGuire But you see I can t leave him As she spoke she looked anxiously through the window toward her own door mister McGuire s with him now so I got away But there s Bess an Harry began Susan We don t leave him with the children ever interposed missus McGuire with another hurried glance through the window We don t dare to You see once we found we found him with his father s old pistol Oh Susan it it was awful Yes it must have been Susan after one swift glance into her visitor s face had turned her back suddenly She was busy now with the dampers of her kitchen stove Of course we took it right away went on missus McGuire an put it where he ll never get it again But we re always afraid there ll be somethin somewhere that he WILL get hold of You see he s SO despondent in such a terrible state Yes I know nodded Susan Susan had abandoned her dampers and had turned right about face again If only he d see folks now Yes an that s what I came over to talk to you about cried missus McGuire eagerly We haven t been able to get him to see anybody not anybody But I ve been wonderin if he wouldn t see Keith if we could work it right You see he says he just won t be stared at an Keith poor boy COULDN T stare an John knows it Oh Susan do you suppose we could manage it Why of course I ll tell him right away an he ll go over I know he ll go exclaimed Susan all interest at once Oh but that wouldn t do at all cried missus McGuire Don t you see John refuses absolutely refuses to see any one an he wouldn t see Keith if I should ASK him to But he s interested in Keith I KNOW he s that for once when I was talkin to mister McGuire about Keith John broke in an asked two or three questions an he s NEVER done that before about anybody An so I was pretty sure it was because Keith was blind you know like himself Yes I see I see An if I can only manage it so they ll meet without John s knowin they re goin to I believe he ll get to talkin with him before he knows it an that it ll do him a world of good Anyway somethin s got to be done Susan it s GOT to be to get him out of this awful state he s in Well we ll do it I know we can do it some way You think Keith ll do his part missus McGuire s eyes were anxious I m sure he will when he understands Then listen proposed missus McGuire eagerly I ll get my John out on to the back porch to morrow mornin That s the only place outdoors I CAN get him he can t be seen from the street there you know I ll get him there as near ten o clock as I can You be on the watch an as soon as I get him all nicely fixed you get Keith to come out into your yard an stroll over to the fence an speak to him an then come up on to the porch an sit down just naturally He can do that all right can t he It s just wonderful the way he gets around everywhere with that little cane of his Yes oh yes Well I thought he could An tell him to keep right on talkin every minute so my John won t have a chance to get up an go into the house Of course I shall be there myself at first We never leave him alone you know But as soon as Keith comes I shall go They ll get along better by themselves I m sure only of course I shall be where I can keep watch out of the window Now do you understand Yes an we can do it I know we can do it All right then I m not so sure we can but we ll try it anyway sighed missus McGuire rising to her feet the old worry back on her face Well I must be goin mister McGuire ll have a fit He s as nervous as a witch when he s left alone with John There What did I tell you she broke off with an expressive gesture and glance as a careworn looking man appeared in the doorway of the house across the two back yards and peered anxiously over at the Burtons kitchen door Now don t forget ten o clock to morrow mornin I won t forget promised Susan cheerfully Now do you go home an set easy Mis McGuire an don t you fret no more It s comin out all right all right I tell you she reiterated as missus McGuire hurried through the doorway But when missus McGuire was gone Susan drew a dubious sigh and her cheery smile had turned to a questioning frown as she went in search of Keith Very evidently Susan was far from feeling quite so sure about Keith s cooperation as she would have missus McGuire think Keith was in the living room his head bowed in his two hands his elbows on the table before him At the first sound of Susan s steps he lifted his head with a jerk I was lookin for you began Susan the moment she had crossed the threshold Susan had learned that Keith hated above all things to have to speak first or to ask Who is it Mis McGuire s jest been here Yes I heard her voice returned the boy indifferently She was tellin about her John How is he getting along He s in a bad way Oh he s real well physicianally but he s in a bad way in his mind Well you don t wonder do you Oh no course not Still well for one thing he don t like to see folks Strange Now I d think he d just dote on seeing folks wouldn t you Susan caught the full force of the sarcasm but superbly she ignored it Well I don t know maybe but anyhow he don t an Mis McGuire s that worried she don t know what to do You see she found him once with his daddy s pistol Susan was talking very fast now an course that worked her up somethin terrible I m afraid he hain t got much backbone They don t dare to leave him alone a minute not a minute An Mis McGuire she was wonderin if if you couldn t help em out some way I The short ejaculation was full of amazement Yes That s what she come over for this mornin I They forget Keith fell back bitterly John McGuire might get hold of a dozen revolvers and I wouldn t know it Oh twa n t that They didn t want you to WATCH him They wanted you to Well it s jest this Mis McGuire thought as how if she could get her John out on the back porch an you happened to be in our back yard an should go over an speak to him maybe you d get to talkin with him an go up an sit down She thought maybe twould get him out of hisself that way You see he won t talk to to most folks He don t like to be stared at Susan threw a furtive glance into Keith s face then looked quickly away But she thought maybe he WOULD talk to you Yes I see Keith drew in his breath with a little catch An so she said there wa n t anybody anywhere that could help so much as you if you would Why of course if I really could HELP Susan did not need to look into Keith s face to catch the longing and heart hunger and dawning hope in the word left suspended on his lips She felt her own throat tighten but in a moment she managed to speak with steady cheerfulness Well you can You can help a whole lot I m sure you can An Mis McGuire is too An what s more you re the only one what can help em in this case So we ll keep watch to morrow mornin an when he comes out on the porch well we ll see what we will see And Susan just as if her own heart was not singing a triumphant echo of the song she knew was in his turned away with an elaborate air of indifference Yet when to morrow came and when Keith went out into the yard in response to the presence of John McGuire on his back porch the result was most disappointing to Susan To Keith it did not seem to be so much so But perhaps Keith had not expected quite what Susan had expected At all events Keith came back to the house with a glow on his face and a springiness in his step that Susan had not seen there for months Yet all that had happened was that Keith had called out from the gate a pleasant Good morning to the blinded soldier and had followed it with an inconsequential word or two about the weather John McGuire had answered a crisp cold something and had risen at once to go into the house Keith at the first sound of his feet on the porch floor had turned with a cheery Well I must be going back to the house Whereupon John McGuire had sat down again and missus McGuire who at Keith s first words had started to her feet dropped back into her chair Apparently not much accomplished certainly yet there was the glow on Keith s face and the springiness in Keith s step and when he reached the kitchen he said this to Susan The next time John McGuire is on the back porch please let me know And Susan let him know both then and at subsequent times It was a pretty game and one well worth the watching Certainly Susan and missus McGuire thought it so On the one side were persistence and perseverance and infinite tact On the other were a distrustful antagonism and a palpable longing for an understanding companionship At first the intercourse between the two blind youths consisted of a mere word or two tossed by Keith to the other who gave a still shorter word in reply And even this was not every day for John McGuire was not out on the porch every day But as the month passed he came more and more frequently and one evening missus McGuire confided to Susan the fact that John seemed actually to fret now if a storm kept him indoors An he listens for Keith to come along the fence I know he does she still further declared Oh I know he doesn t let him say much yet but he hasn t jumped up to go into the house once since those first two or three times an that s somethin An what s more he let Keith stay a whole minute at the gate talkin yesterday she finished in triumph Yes an the best of it is chimed in Susan it s helpin Keith Burton hisself jest as much as tis John McGuire Why he ain t the same boy since he s took to tryin to get your John to talkin An he asks me a dozen times a mornin if John s out on the porch yet An when he IS out there he don t lose no time in goin out hisself Yet it was the very next morning that Keith after eagerly asking if John McGuire were on the back porch did not go out Instead he settled back in his chair and picked up one of his embossed books Susan frowned in amazed wonder and opened her lips as if to speak But after a glance at Keith s apparently absorbed face she turned and went back to her work in the kitchen Twice during the next ten minutes however she invented an excuse to pass again through the living room where Keith sat Yet though she said a pointed something each time about John McGuire on the back porch Keith did not respond save with an indifferent word or two And greatly to her indignation he was still sitting in his chair with his book when at noon John McGuire on the porch across the back yard rose from his seat and went into the house Susan was still more indignant when the next morning the same programme was repeated except for the fact that Susan s reminders of John McGuire s presence on the back porch were even more pointed than they had been on the day before Again the third morning it was the same Susan resolved then to speak She said to herself that patience had ceased to be virtuous and she lay awake half that night rehearsing a series of arguments and pleadings which she meant to present the next morning She was the more incited to this owing to missus McGuire s distracted reproaches the evening before Why John has asked for him actually ASKED for him missus McGuire had wept An it is cruel the cruelest thing I ever saw to get that poor boy all worked up to the point of really WANTIN to talk with him an then stay away three whole days like this On the fourth morning therefore when John McGuire appeared on the back porch Susan went into the Burton living room with the avowed determination of getting Keith out of the house and into the back yard or of telling him exactly what she thought of him She had all of her elaborate scheming for nothing however for at her first terse announcement that John McGuire was on the back porch Keith sprang to his feet with a cheery So Well I guess I ll go out myself And Susan was left staring at him with open eyes and mouth yet not too dazed to run to the open window and watch what happened And this is what Susan saw and heard Keith with his almost uncannily skillful stick to guide him sauntered down the path and called a cheery greeting to John McGuire a John McGuire who in his eagerness to respond leaned away forward in his chair with a sudden flame of color in his face Keith still sauntered toward the dividing fence pausing only to feel with his fingers and pick the one belated rose from the bush at the gate He pushed the gate open then still talking cheerfully and the next moment Susan was holding her breath for Keith had gone straight up the walk and up the steps and had dropped himself into the vacant chair beside John McGuire and John McGuire after a faint start as if to rise had fallen back in his seat and had turned his face uncertainly fearfully yet with infinite longing toward the blind youth at his side Susan looked then at missus McGuire missus McGuire too was plainly holding her breath suspended On her face too were uncertainty fearfulness and infinite longing For a moment she watched the two boys intently Then she rose and with cautious steps made her way into the house After supper that night she came over and told Susan all about it Her face was beaming Did you see them she began breathlessly Wasn t it wonderful A whole half hour those two blessed boys sat there an talked an John laughed twice actually laughed Yes I know nodded Susan her own face no less beaming An to think how just last night I was scoldin an blamin Keith because he didn t come over these last three days An I never saw at all what he was up to Up to frowned Susan Yes yes Don t you see He did it on purpose stayed away three whole days so John would miss him an WANT him An John DID miss him Why he listened for him all the time I could just SEE he was listenin An that s what made me so angry because Keith didn t come The idea My boy wantin somebody an that somebody not there But I know now I understand An I love him for it He did it to make him want him An it worked Why if he d come before every day just as usual John wouldn t have talked with him I know he wouldn t But now oh Susan it was wonderful wonderful I watched em from the window I HAD to watch I was afraid still An of course I heard some things An oh Susan it was wonderful the way that boy understood You mean Keith Yes You see first John began to talk just as he talks to us ravin because he s so strong an well an likely to live to be a hundred an of how he ll look one of these days with his little tin cup held out for pennies an his sign Please Help the Blind an of what he s got to look forward to all his life Oh Susan it it s enough to break the heart of a stone when he talks like that Susan drew in her breath Don t you s pose I know Well I guess I do But what did Keith say to him Nothin An that was the first wonderful thing You see we we always talk an try to comfort him when he talks like that But Keith didn t He just let him talk with nothin but just a sympathetic word now an then But it wasn t long before I noticed a wonderful thing was happenin Keith was beginnin to talk not about that awful tin cup an the pennies an the sign but about other things first about the rose in his hand An pretty quick John was talkin about it too He had the rose an was smellin of it Then Keith had a new knife an he passed that over an pretty quick I saw that John had that little link puzzle of Keith s an was havin a great time tryin to straighten it out That s the first time I heard him laugh I began to realize then what Keith was doin He was fillin John s mind full of somethin else beside himself for just a minute an was showin him that there were things he could call by name like the rose an the knife an the puzzle even if he couldn t SEE em Oh Keith didn t SAY anything like that to him trust him for that But before John knew it he was DOIN it callin things by name I mean An Keith is comin again to morrow John TOLD me so An if you could have seen his face when he said it Oh Susan isn t it wonderful she finished fervently as she turned to go It is indeed wonderful murmured Susan But Susan s eyes were out the window on Keith s face Keith and his father were coming up the walk talking and on Keith s face was a light Susan had never seen there before CHAPTER XXVI MAZIE AGAIN It came to be the accepted thing almost at once then that Keith Burton and John McGuire should spend their mornings together on the McGuires back porch In less than a fortnight young McGuire even crossed the yard arm in arm with Keith to the Burtons back porch and sat there one morning After that it was only a question as to which porch it should be That it would be one of them was a foregone conclusion Sometimes the two boys talked together Sometimes they worked on one of Keith s raised picture puzzles Sometimes Keith read aloud from one of his books Whatever they did their doing it was the source of great interest to the entire neighborhood Not only did missus McGuire and Susan breathlessly watch from their respective kitchens but friends and neighbors fabricated excuses to come to the two houses in order to see for themselves and children gathered along the divisional fence and gazed with round eyes of wonder But they gazed silently Everybody gazed silently Even the children seemed to understand that the one unpardonable sin was to let the blind boys on the porch know that they were the objects of any sort of interest One day Mazie Sanborn came She brought a new book for missus McGuire to read an attention she certainly had never before bestowed on John McGuire s mother She talked one half minute about the book and five minutes about the beautiful new friendship between the two blind young men She insisted on going into the kitchen where she could see the two boys on the porch Then before missus McGuire could divine her purpose and stop her she had slipped through the door and out on to the porch itself How do you do gentlemen she began blithely I just But the terrified missus McGuire had her by the arm and was pulling her back into the kitchen before she could finish her sentence On the porch the two boys had leaped to their feet John McGuire in particular looking distressed and angry Who was that Is anybody there he demanded No dear not now In the doorway missus McGuire was trying to nod assurance to the boys and frown banishment to Mazie Sanborn at one and the same moment But there was some one insisted her son sharply Just some one that brought a book to me dearie an she s gone now Frantically missus McGuire was motioning Mazie to make her assertion the truth John McGuire sat down then So too did Keith But all the rest of the morning John was nervously alert for all sounds And his ears were frequently turned toward the kitchen door He began to talk again too bitterly of the little tin cup for the pennies and the sign Pity the Poor Blind He lost all interest in Keith s books and puzzles and when he was not railing at the tragedy of his fate he was sitting in gloomy silence Keith told Susan that afternoon that if missus McGuire did not keep people away from that porch when he was out there with John he would not answer for the consequences Susan told missus McGuire and missus McGuire told Mazie Sanborn at the same time returning the loaned book all of which did not tend to smooth Miss Mazie s already ruffled feelings To Dorothy Mazie expressed her mind on the matter I don t care I ll never go there again never she declared angrily nor speak to missus McGuire nor that precious son of hers nor Keith Burton either So there Oh Mazie but poor Keith isn t to blame remonstrated Dorothy earnestly the color flaming into her face He is too He s just as bad as John McGuire He jumped up and looked just as cross as John McGuire did when I went out on to that porch And he doesn t ever really want to see us You know he doesn t He just stands us because he thinks he s got to be polite But Mazie dear he s so sensitive and he feels his affliction keenly and Oh yes that s right stand up for him I knew you would snapped Mazie crossly And everybody knows it too running after him the way you do RUNNING AFTER HIM Dorothy s face was scarlet now Yes running after him reiterated the other incisively and you always have trotting over there all the time with books and puzzles and candy and flowers And For shame Mazie interrupted Dorothy with hot indignation As if trying to help that poor blind boy to while away a few hours of his time were RUNNING AFTER HIM But he doesn t WANT you to while away an hour or two of his time And I should think you d see he didn t You could if you weren t so dead in love with him and Mazie gasped Dorothy aghast Well it s so Anybody can see that the way you color up every time his name is mentioned and the way you look at him with your heart in your eyes and Mazie Sanborn gasped Dorothy again Her face was not scarlet now It had gone dead white She was on her feet horrified dismayed and very angry Well I don t care It s so Everybody knows it And when a fellow shows so plainly that he d rather be let alone how you can keep thrusting yourself But Dorothy had gone With a proud lifting of her head and a sharp Nonsense Mazie you are wild We ll not discuss it any longer please she had turned and left the room But she remembered She must have remembered for she did not go near the Burton homestead for a week Neither did the next week nor the next see her there Furthermore though the little stand in her room had shown two new picture puzzles and a new game especially designed for the blind it displayed them no longer after those remarks of Mazie Sanborn s Not that Keith had them however Indeed no They were buried deep under a pile of clothing in the farther corner of Dorothy s bottom bureau drawer At the Burton homestead Susan wondered a little at her absence She even said to Keith one day Why where s Dorothy We haven t see her for two weeks I don t know I m sure The way Keith s lips came together over the last word caused Susan to throw a keen glance into his face Now Keith I hope you two haven t been quarreling again she frowned anxiously Again Nonsense Susan we never did quarrel Don t be silly The youth shifted his position uneasily I m thinkin tain t always me that s silly observed Susan with another keen glance That girl was gettin so she come over jest natural like again every little while bringin in one thing or another if twas nothin more n a funny story to make us laugh An what I want to know is why she stopped right off short like this for Nonsense tossed Keith again with a lift of his chin Then with an attempt at lightness that was very near a failure he laughed I reckon we don t want her to come if she doesn t want to do we Susan Humph was Susan s only comment outwardly Inwardly she was vowing to see that young woman and have it out with her once for all But Susan did not see her nor have it out with her for as it happened something occurred that night so all absorbing and exciting that even the unexplained absence of Dorothy Parkman became as nothing beside it With the abrupt suddenness that sometimes makes the long waited for event a real shock came the news of the death of the poor old woman whose frail hand had held the wealth that Susan had coveted for Daniel Burton and his son The two men left the next morning on the four hundred mile journey that would take them to the town where Nancy Holworthy had lived Scarcely had they left the house before Susan began preparations for their home coming as befitted their new estate Her first move was to get out all the best silver and china She was busy cleaning it when missus McGuire came in at the kitchen door What s the matter she began breathlessly Where s Keith John s been askin for him all the mornin Is mister Burton sick They just telephoned from the store that mister Burton had sent word that he wouldn t be down for a few days He isn t sick is he or Keith I couldn t make out quite all they said but there was somethin about Keith They ain t either of em sick are they Oh no they re both well very well thank you There was an air half elation half superiority about Susan that was vaguely irritating to missus McGuire Well you needn t be so secret about it Susan she began a little haughtily But Susan tossed her head with a light laugh Secret I guess t won t be no secret long mister Daniel Burton an Master Keith have gone away Mis McGuire Away You mean a a vacation frowned missus McGuire doubtfully Susan laughed again still with that irritating air of superiority Well hardly This ain t no pleasure exertion Mis McGuire Still on the other hand Daniel Burton wouldn t be half humane if he didn t get some pleasure out of it though he wouldn t so demean himself as to show it of course Mis Nancy Holworthy is dead Mis McGuire We had the signification last night Not you don t mean THE Nancy Holworthy the one that s got the money The excited interest in missus McGuire s face and voice was as great as even Susan herself could have desired Susan obviously swelled with the glory of the occasion though she still spoke with cold loftiness The one and the same Mis McGuire My stars an stockin s you don t say An they ve gone to the funeral They have An they ll get the money now I s pose They will But are you sure You know sometimes when folks expect the money they don t get it It s been willed away to some one else Yes I know But t won t be here spoke Susan with decision Mis Holworthy couldn t if she d wanted to It s all foreordained an fixed beforehand Daniel Burton was to get jest the annual while she lived an then the whole in a plump sum when she died Well she s dead an now he gets it An a right tidy little sum it is too Was she awful rich Susan More n a hundred thousand A hundred an fifty I ve heard say My gracious me An to think of Daniel Burton havin a hundred and fifty thousand dollars What in the world will he do with it Susan s chin came up superbly Well I can tell you one thing he ll do Mis McGuire He ll stop peddlin peas an beans over that counter down there an retire to a life of ease an laxity with his paint brushes as he ought to An he ll have somethin fit to eat an wear an Keith will too An furthermore an likewise you ll see SOME difference in this place or my name ain t Susan Betts Them two men have got an awful lot to live up to an I mean they shall understand it right away Which explains this array of china an silver I take it observed missus McGuire dryly Eh What frowned Susan doubtfully then her face cleared Yes that s jest it They ve got to have things now fitted up to their new estation We shall get more too We need some new teaspoons an forks An I want em to get some of them bunion spoons BUNION spoons Yes when you eat soup out of them two handled cups you know Or maybe you don t know she corrected herself at the odd expression that had come to missus McGuire s face But I do missus Professor Hinkley used to have em They re awful pretty an stylish too And we ve got to have a lot of other things new china an some cut glass an Well it strikes me interrupted missus McGuire severely that Daniel Burton had better be puttin his money into Liberty Bonds an Red Cross work instead of silver spoons an cut glass in these war times An My lan Mis McGuire With the sudden exclamation Susan had dropped the spoon she was polishing Her eyes wild and incredulous were staring straight into the startled eyes of the woman opposite Do you know Since that yeller telegram came last night tellin us Nancy Holworthy was dead I hain t even once thought of the war Well I guess you would think of it if you had my John right before you all the time With a bitter sigh missus McGuire had relaxed in her chair You wouldn t need anything else Humph I don t need anything else with Daniel Burton round What do you mean Why I mean that that man don t do nothin but read war an talk war every minute he s in the house An what with them wheatless days an meatless days he fairly EATS war You heard my poem on them meatless wheatless days didn t you missus McGuire shook her head listlessly Her somber eyes were on the lonely figure of her son on the porch across the two back yards You didn t Well I ll say it to you then Tain t much still it s kind of good in a way I hain t written hardly anything lately but I did write this We ve a wheatless day An a meatless day An a tasteless wasteless sweetless day But with never a pause For the good of the cause We d even consent to an eatless day An we would too of course An as far as that s concerned there s a good many other kinds of less days that I m thinkin wouldn t hurt none of us How about a fretless day an a worryless day Wouldn t they be great An only think what a talkless day d mean in some households I could mention Oh of course present comp ny always accentuated she hastened to add with a sly chuckle as missus McGuire stirred into sudden resentment Humph subsided missus McGuire still a little resentfully An I m free to confess that there s some kinds of less days that we ve already got plenty of went on Susan after a moment s thoughtful pause There is folks that take quite enough workless days an laughless days an pityless days an thankless days My lan there ain t no end to them kind as any one can see An there was them heatless days last winter I guess no one was hankerin for more of THEM Oh course I understand that that was just preservation of coal an that twas necessary an all that An that s another thing too this preservation business I d like to add a few things to that an make em preserve in fault findin an crossness an backbitin an gossip as well as in coal an sugar an wheat an beef missus McGuire gave a short laugh My goodness Susan Betts if you ain t the limit an no mistake I s pose you mean CONservation Heh What s that Well CONservation then What s the difference anyway she scoffed a bit testily Then abruptly her face changed But there this ain t settlin what I m going to do with Daniel Burton she finished with a profound sigh Do with him puzzled missus McGuire Yes Susan picked up the silver spoon and began indifferently to polish it Tain t no use for me to be doin all this Daniel Burton won t know whether he s eatin with a silver spoon or one made of pewter No more will he retire to a life of ease an laxity with his paint brushes unless they declarate peace to morrow mornin You don t mean he ll stay in the store Susan made a despairing gesture Goodness only knows what he ll do I don t I know what he does now He s as uneasy as a fish out o water an he roams the house from one end to the other every night after he reads the paper He s got one of them war maps on his wall an he keeps changin the pins an flags an I hear him mutterin under his breath You see he has to keep it from Keith all he can for Keith hisself feels so bad cause he can t be up an doin an if he thought he was keepin his father back from helpin I don t know what the poor boy would do But I think if twa n t for Keith Daniel Burton would try to enlist an go over Oh of course he s beyond the malicious age so far as bein drafted is concerned an you wouldn t naturally think such a mild tempered lookin man would go in much for killin But this war s stirred him up somethin awful Well who wouldn t it Oh I know that an I ain t sayin as how it shouldn t But that don t make it no easier for Daniel Burton to keep his feelin s hid from his son particularly when it s that son that s made him have the feelin s partly There ain t no doubt but that one of the things that s made Daniel Burton so fidgety an uneasy an ready to jest fling hisself into that ravin conflict over there is his unhappiness an disappointment over Keith He had such big plans for that boy Yes I know We all have big plans for our boys missus McGuire choked and turned away An girls too for that matter hurried on Susan with a quick glance into the other s face An speakin of girls did you see Hattie Turner on the street last night Dumbly missus McGuire answered with a shake of her head Her eyes had gone back to her son s face across the yard Well I did Her Charlie s at Camp Devens you know They say he s invited to more places every Sunday than he can possibly accept an that he s petted an praised an made of everywhere he goes an tended right up to so s he won t get lonesome or attend unquestionable entertainments Well that s all right an good of course an as it should be But I wish somebody d take up Charlie Turner s wife an invite her to Sunday dinners an take her to ride an see that she didn t attend unquestionable entertainments Why Susan Betts what an idea protested missus McGuire suddenly sitting erect in her chair Hattie Turner isn t fightin for her country No but her husband is retorted Susan crisply An she s fightin for her honor an her future peace an happiness an she s doin it all alone She s pretty as a picture an nothin but a child when he married her four months ago an we ve took away her natural pervider an entertainer an left her nothin but her freedom for a ballast wheel An I say I wish some of the patriotic people who are jest showerin every Charlie Turner with attentions would please sprinkle jest a few on Charlie s wife to help keep her straight an sweet an honest for Charlie when he comes back Hm m maybe murmured missus McGuire rising wearily to her feet but there ain t many that thinks of that There ll be more think of it by an by when it s too late observed Susan succinctly as she too rose from her chair CHAPTER XXVII FOR THE SAKE OF JOHN In due course Daniel Burton and his son Keith returned from the funeral of their kinswoman missus Nancy Holworthy 
6288_63111_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The town aware now of the stupendous change that had come to the fortunes of the Burton family stared gossiped shook wise heads of prophecy then passed on to the next sensation which happened to be the return of four soldiers from across the seas three crippled one blinded 
none	none	At the Burton homestead the changes did not seem so stupendous after all True Daniel Burton had abandoned the peddling of peas and beans across the counter and had at the earnest solicitation of his son got out his easel and placed a fresh canvas upon it but he obviously worked half heartedly and he still roamed the house after reading the evening paper and spent even more time before the great war map on his studio wall True also disgruntled tradesmen no longer rang peremptory peals on the doorbell and the postman s load of bills on the first of the month was perceptibly decreased The dinner table too bore evidence that a scanty purse no longer controlled the larder but no new china or cut glass graced the board and Susan s longed for bouillon spoons had never materialized Locks and doors and sagging blinds had received prompt attention and already the house was being prepared for a new coat of paint but no startling alterations or improvements were promised by the evidence and Keith was still to be seen almost daily on the McGuire back porch as before or on his own with John McGuire It is no wonder surely that very soon the town ceased to stare and gossip or even to shake wise heads of prophecy Nancy Holworthy s death was two months in the past when one day Keith came home from John McGuire s back porch in very evident excitement and agitation Why Keith what s the matter 
6288_63111_000010_000001	train-clean-360	What IS the matter demanded Susan concernedly 
none	none	Nothing That is I I did not know I acted as if anything was the matter stammered the youth Well you do 
6288_63111_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Now tell me what is it 
none	none	Nothing nothing Susan Nothing you can help Keith was pacing back and forth and up and down the living room not even using his cane to define the familiar limits of his pathway Suddenly he turned and stopped short his whole body quivering with emotion
6288_63111_000013_000003	train-clean-360	 Susan I can t I can t stand it he moaned 
none	none	I know Keith 
6288_63111_000014_000001	train-clean-360	But what is it now 
none	none	John McGuire He s been telling me how it is over there 
6288_63111_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Why Susan I could see it SEE it I tell you and oh I did so want to be there to help 
none	none	He told me how they held it the little clump of trees that meant so much to US and how one by one they fell those brave fellows with him I could see it 
6288_63111_000015_000005	train-clean-360	I could hear it 
none	none	I could hear the horrid din of the guns and shells and the crash of falling trees about us and the shouts and groans of the men at our side And they needed men more men to take the place of those that had fallen 
6288_63111_000015_000008	train-clean-360	Even one man counted there counted for oh so much for at the last there was just one man left John McGuire 
6288_63111_000015_000009	train-clean-360	And to hear him tell it it was wonderful wonderful 
none	none	I know I know nodded Susan It was like his letters you could SEE things He MADE you see em An that s what he always did made you see things even when he was a little boy 
6288_63111_000016_000004	train-clean-360	His mother told me 
none	none	He wanted to write you know He was goin to be a writer before this happened An now The sentence trailed off into the silence unfinished And to think of all that to day being wasted on a blind baby tied to a picture puzzle moaned Keith resuming his nervous pacing of the room If only a man a real man could have heard him one that could go and do a man s work Why Susan that story as he told it would make a stone fight I never heard anything like it I never supposed there could be anything like that battle 
6288_63111_000017_000005	train-clean-360	He never talked like this until to day 
6288_63111_000017_000006	train-clean-360	Oh he s told me a little from time to time 
none	none	But to day to day he just poured out his heart to me ME and there are so many who need just that message to stir them from their smug complacency men who could fight and win men who WOULD fight and win if only they could see and hear and know as I saw and heard and knew this afternoon 
6288_63111_000017_000008	train-clean-360	And there it was wasted WASTED worse than wasted on me 
none	none	Chokingly Keith turned away but with a sudden cry Susan caught his arm No no Keith it wasn t wasted you mustn t let it be wasted she panted Listen 
6288_63111_000019_000002	train-clean-360	You want others to hear it what you heard don t you 
none	none	Why y yes Susan but Then make em hear it she interrupted You can you can How Make him write it down jest as he talks He can he wants to He s always wanted to Then publish it in a book so everybody can see it and hear it as you did
6288_63111_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Susan if we only could A dawning hope had come into Keith Burton s face but almost at once it faded into gray disappointment We couldn t do it though Susan 
none	none	He couldn t do it You know he can t write at all 
6288_63111_000024_000003	train-clean-360	He s only begun to practice a little bit 
none	none	He d never get it down with the fire and the vim in it learning to write as he d have to What do you suppose Lincoln s Gettysburg Speech would have been if he d had to stop to learn how to spell and to write each word before he could put it down I know I know nodded Susan It s that way with me in my poetry I jest HAVE to get right ahead while the fuse burns an spell em somehow anyhow so s to get em down while I m in the fit of it He couldn t do it 
6288_63111_000025_000004	train-clean-360	I can see that now 
6288_63111_000025_000005	train-clean-360	But Keith couldn t YOU do it take it down I mean as he talked like a stylographer 
none	none	Keith shook his head I wish I could 
6288_63111_000027_000001	train-clean-360	But I couldn t I know I couldn t 
none	none	I couldn t begin to do it fast enough to keep up with him and t would spoil it all to have to ask him to slow down When a man s got a couple of Huns coming straight for him and he knows he s got to get em both at once you can t very well sing out Here wait wait a minute till I get that last sentence down I know I know nodded Susan again She paused drew a long sigh and turned her eyes out the window Up the walk was coming Daniel Burton 
6288_63111_000028_000003	train-clean-360	His step was slow his head was bowed 
6288_63111_000028_000004	train-clean-360	He looked like anything but the happy possessor of new wealth 
none	none	Susan frowned as she watched him I wish your father she began Suddenly she stopped A new light had leaped to her eyes Keith Keith she cried eagerly I have it Your father he could do it I know he could Do what Take down John McGuire s story 
6288_63111_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Couldn t he do it 
none	none	Why y yes he could I think hesitated Keith doubtfully He doesn t know shorthand but he he s got eyes Keith s voice broke a little and he could SEE what he was doing and he could take down enough of it so he could patch it up afterwards I m sure 
6288_63111_000032_000002	train-clean-360	But Susan John McGuire wouldn t TELL it to HIM 
none	none	Don t you see He won t even see anybody but me and he didn t talk like this even to me until to day How s dad going to hear it to write it down 
6288_63111_000032_000005	train-clean-360	Tell me that 
none	none	But he could overhear it Keith 
6288_63111_000033_000001	train-clean-360	No no don t look like that she protested hurriedly as Keith began to frown 
none	none	Jest listen a minute It would be jest as easy He could be over on the grass right close where he could hear every word an you could get John to talkin an as soon as he got really started on a story your father could begin to write an John wouldn t know a thing about it an
6288_63111_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes you re quite right John wouldn t know a thing about it broke in Keith with a passion so sudden and bitter that Susan fell back in dismay 
none	none	Why Keith she exclaimed her startled eyes on his quivering face
6288_63111_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I wonder if you think I d do it he demanded 
none	none	I wonder if you really think I d cheat that poor fellow into talking to me just because he hadn t eyes to see that I wasn t the only one in his audience But Keith he wouldn t mind he wouldn t mind a bit urged Susan if he didn t know an Oh no he wouldn t mind being cheated and deceived and made a fool of just because he couldn t see No he wouldn t mind persisted Susan stoutly It wouldn t be a mean listenin nor sneak listenin It wouldn t be listenin to things he didn t want us to hear He d be glad after it was all done an Would he choked Keith still more bitterly Maybe you think I was glad after it was all done and I found I d been fooled and cheated into thinking the girl that was reading and talking to me and playing games with me was a girl I had never known before a girl who was what she pretended to be a new friend doing it all because she wanted to because she liked to
6288_63111_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 But Keith I m sure that Dorothy liked 
none	none	There there Susan interposed Keith with quickly uplifted hand We ll not discuss it please Yes I know I began the subject myself and it was my fault but when I heard you say John McGuire would be glad when he found out how we d lied to his poor blind eyes I I just couldn t hold it in I had to say something But never mind that now Susan only you ll you ll have to understand I mean what I say There s no letting dad copy that story on the sly But there s a way there must be a way argued Susan feverishly Only think what it would mean to that boy if we could get him started to writin books what he s wanted to do all his life Oh Keith why he d even forget his eyes then
6288_63111_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 It would help some Keith drew in his breath and held it a moment suspended 
none	none	And he d even be helping us to win out over there for if we could get that story of his on paper as he told it to me the fellow that reads it wouldn t need any recruiting station to send him over there If there was only a way that father could There is an we ll find it interposed Susan eagerly I know we will An Keith it s goin to be most as good for him as it is for John McGuire 
6288_63111_000045_000003	train-clean-360	He s nervous as a witch since he quit his job 
none	none	I know A swift cloud crossed the boy s face But twasn t giving up his job that s made him nervous Susan as you and I both know very well However we ll see And you may be sure if there is a way I ll find it Susan he finished a bit wearily as he turned to go upstairs CHAPTER XXVIII THE WAY Keith was still looking for the way when October came bringing crisp days and chilly winds When not too cold the boys still sat out of doors When it was too cold John McGuire did not appear at all on his back porch and Keith did not have the courage to make a bold advance to the McGuire door and ask admittance There came a day however when a cold east wind came up after they were well established in their porch chairs for the morning They were on the Burton porch this time and Keith suddenly determined to take the bull by the horns Brrr but it s cold this morning he shivered blithely What say you Let s go in Come on And without waiting for acquiescence he caught John McGuire s arm in his own and half pulled him to his feet Before John McGuire knew then quite what was happening he found himself in the house No no that is I I think I d better be going home he stammered But Keith Burton did not seem even to hear Say just try your hand at this puzzle he was saying gayly I gave it up and I ll bet you ll have to he finished thrusting a pasteboard box into his visitor s hands and nicely adjudging the distance a small table must be pushed in order to bring it conveniently in front of John McGuire s chair The quick tightening of John McGuire s lips and the proud lifting of his chin told that Keith s challenge had been accepted even before the laconic answer came Oh you do do you Well we ll see whether I ll have to give it up or not John McGuire loved picture puzzles as Keith Burton well knew It was easy after that Keith took it so unhesitatingly for granted that they were to go indoors when it was cold that John McGuire found it difficult to object and it was not long before the two boys were going back and forth between the two houses with almost as much ease as if their feet had been guided by the eye instead of by the tap of a slender stick John McGuire was learning a great deal from Keith these days though it is doubtful if he realized it It is doubtful also if he realized how constantly he was being made to talk of the war and of his experience in it But Keith realized it Keith was not looking for the way now He believed he had found it and there came a day when he deemed the time had come to try to carry it out They were in his own home living room It had been a wonderful story that John McGuire had told that day of a daring excursion into No Man s Land and what came of it Upstairs in the studio Daniel Burton was sitting alone as Keith knew Keith drew a long breath and made the plunge Springing to his feet he turned toward the door that led into the hall McGuire that was a bully story a corking good story I want dad to hear it Wait I ll get him And he was out of the room with the door fast closed behind him before John McGuire could so much as draw a breath Upstairs Daniel Burton already in the secret heard Keith s eager summons and came at once For some days he had been expecting just such an urgent call from Keith s lips He knew too much to delay He was down the stairs and at Keith s side in an incredibly short time Then together they pushed open the door and entered the living room John McGuire was on his feet Very plainly he was intending to go home and at once But Daniel Burton paid no attention to that He came straight toward him and took his hand I call this mighty good of you McGuire he said My boy here has been raving about your stories of the war until I m fairly green with envy Now I m to hear a bit of them myself he says I wish you would tell me some of your experiences my lad You know a chance like this is a real god send to us poor stay at homes Now fire away I m ready But John McGuire was not ready True he sat down but not until after a confused No no I must go home that is really they re not worth repeating those stories And he would not talk at all at first Daniel Burton talked however He talked of wars in general and of the Civil War in particular and he told the stories of Antietam and Gettysburg as they had been told to him by his father Then from Gettysburg he jumped to Flanders and talked of aeroplanes and gas masks and tanks and trenches and dugouts Little by little then John McGuire began to talk sometimes a whole sentence sometimes only a word or two But there was no fire no enthusiasm no impetuous rush of words that brought the very din of battle to their ears And not once did Daniel Burton thrust his fingers into his pocket for his pencil and notebook Yet when it was all over and John McGuire had gone home Keith dropped into his chair with a happy sigh It wasn t much dad I know he admitted but it was something It was a beginning and a beginning is something with John McGuire And it was something for the next time Daniel Burton entered the room John McGuire did not even start from his chair He gave a faint smile of welcome too and he talked sooner and talked more though there was little of war talk and for the second time Daniel Burton did not reach for his pencil But the third time he did A question a comment a chance word neither Keith nor his father could have told afterward what started it They knew only that a sudden light as of a flame leaped into John McGuire s face and he was back in the trenches of France and carrying them with him At the second sentence Daniel Burton s fingers were in his pocket and at the third his pencil was racing over the paper at breakneck speed There was no pause then no time for thought no time for careful forming of words and letters There was only the breakneck race between a bit of lead and an impassioned tongue and when it was all over there were only a well nigh hopeless looking mass of hieroglyphics in Daniel Burton s notebook and the sweat of spent excitement on the brows of two youths and a man Gee we got it that time breathed Keith after John McGuire had gone home Yes only I was wondering if I had really got it murmured Daniel Burton eyeing a bit ruefully the confused mass of words and letters in his notebook Still I reckon I can dig it out all right if I do it right away he finished confidently And he did dig it out before he slept that night If Daniel Burton and his son Keith thought the thing was done and it was going to be easy sailing thereafter they found themselves greatly mistaken John McGuire scarcely said five sentences about the war the next time they were together though Daniel Burton had his pencil poised expectantly from the start He said only a little more the next time and the next and Daniel Burton pocketed his pencil in despair Then came a day when a chance word about a new air raid reported in the morning paper acted like a match to gunpowder and sent John McGuire off into a rapid fire story that whipped Daniel Burton s pencil from his pocket and set it to racing again at breakneck speed to keep up with him It was easier after that Still every day it was like a game of hide and seek with Daniel Burton and his pencil ever in pursuit and with now and then a casual comment or a tactful question to lure the hiding story out into the open Little by little as the frank comradeship of Daniel Burton won its way John McGuire was led to talk more and more freely and by Christmas the eager scribe was in possession of a very complete record of John McGuire s war experiences dating even from the early days of his enlistment Day by day as he had taken down the rough notes Daniel Burton had followed it up with a careful untangling and copying before he had had a chance to forget or to lose the wonderful glow born of the impassioned telling Then from time to time he had sorted the notes and arranged them in proper sequence until now he had a complete story logical and well rounded It was on Christmas Day that he read the manuscript to Keith At its conclusion Keith drew a long tremulous breath Dad it s wonderful he exclaimed How did you do it You know You heard yourself Yes but to copy it like that Why I could hear him tell it as you read it dad I could HEAR him Could you really I m glad That makes me know I ve succeeded Now for a publisher You wouldn t publish it without his knowing Certainly not But I m going to let a publisher see it before he knows Y yes perhaps Why Keith I d have to do that Do you suppose I d run the risk of its being turned down and then have to tell that boy that he couldn t have the book after all No no I suppose not But it isn t going to be turned down dad Such a wonderful thing can t be turned down Hm m perhaps not Daniel Burton s lips came together a bit grimly But there ARE wonderful things that won t sell you know However he finished with brisk cheerfulness this isn t one of my pictures nor a bit of Susan s free verse so there s some hope I guess Anyhow we ll see but we won t tell John until we do see All right I suppose that would be best sighed Keith still a little doubtfully They had not long to wait after all In a remarkably short time came back word from the publishers Most emphatically they wanted the book and they wanted it right away Moreover the royalty they offered was so good that it sent Daniel Burton down the stairs two steps at a time like a boy in his eagerness to reach Keith with the good news And now for John he cried excitedly as soon as Keith s joyous exclamations over the news were uttered Come let s go across now But dad how how are you going to tell him Keith was holding back a little Tell him I m just going to tell him laughed the man That s easy I know but but Keith wet his lips and started again You see dad he didn t know we were taking notes of his stories He couldn t see us We we took advantage of But Daniel Burton would not even listen Shucks and nonsense Keith he cried Then a little grimly he added I only wish somebody d take advantage like that of me and sell a picture or two when I m not looking Come we re keeping John waiting And he took firm hold of his son s arm Yet in the McGuire living room in the presence of John McGuire himself he talked fully five minutes of nothing in particular before he said Well John I ve got some good news for you GOOD news That s what I d call it I er hear you re going to have a book out in the spring I m going to WHAT Have a book out war stories They were too good to keep to ourselves John so I jotted them down as you told them and last week I sent them off to a publisher A a real publisher The boy s voice shook Every trace of color had drained from his face You bet your life and one of the biggest in the country Daniel Burton s own voice was shaking He had turned his eyes away from John McGuire s face And they ll print it Just as soon as ever you ll sign the contract And by the way that contract happens to be a mighty good one for a first book my boy John McGuire drew a long breath The color was slowly coming back to his face But I can t seem to quite believe it he faltered Nonsense Simplest thing in the world insisted Daniel Burton brusquely They saw the stories liked them and are going to publish them That s all All ALL The blind boy was on his feet his face working with emotion When all my life I ve dreamed and dreamed and longed for He stopped short and sat down He had the embarrassed air the habitually reserved person usually displays when caught red handed making a scene He gave a confused laugh I was only thinking what a way You see I d always wanted to be a writer but I d given it up long ago I had my living to earn and I knew I couldn t earn it that way not at first I used to say I d give anything if I could write a book and I was just wondering if if I d been willing then to have given my eyes CHAPTER XXIX DOROTHY TRIES HER HAND It was on a mild day early in February that Susan met Dorothy Parkman on the street She stopped her at once Well if I ain t glad to see you she cried I didn t know you d got back I haven t been back long Susan You hain t been over to see us once Miss Dorothy Susan reproached her I I have been very busy Miss Dorothy seemed ill at ease and anxious to get away An you didn t come for a long long time when you was here last fall Susan had laid a detaining hand on the girl s arm now Didn t I Miss Dorothy smiled brightly Well perhaps I didn t But you didn t need me anyway I ve heard all about it the splendid work mister Burton and his son have done for John McGuire And I m so glad Oh yes that s all right Susan spoke without enthusiasm And the book is going to be published Yes oh yes Susan still spoke with a preoccupied frown Why Susan what s the matter I thought you d be glad Susan drew a long sigh I am glad Miss Dorothy I m awful glad for John McGuire They say it s wonderful the change in him already He s so proud an happy to think he s done it not sinfully proud you understand but just humbly proud an glad An his ma says he s writin other things now poems an stories an he s as happy as a lark all day An I m awful glad But it s Keith hisself that I m thinkin of You see only yesterday I found him cryin Crying Miss Dorothy seemed to have forgotten all about her haste to get away She had Susan s arm in HER grasp now She had pulled her to one side too where they could have a little sheltered place to talk in the angle of two store windows Yes cryin You see t was like this hurried on Susan Mis McGuire was over an I d been readin a new poem to her an him T was a real pretty one too if I do say it as shouldn t the best I ever done all about how fame an beauty an pleasure didn t count nothin beside workin I got the idea out of something I found in a magazine T was jest grand an it give me the perspiration right away to turn it into a poem An I did An t was that I was readin I d jest got it done that mornin Yes yes nodded Miss Dorothy I see Well I never thought of its meanin anything to Keith or of his takin it nohow wrong but after Mis McGuire had gone home she came out an set with me a spell first in the kitchen I heard a queer little noise in the settin room an I went an looked in Keith was at the table his arms flung straight out in front of him an his head bowed down An Miss Dorothy he was cryin like a baby Oh Susan what did you do What did you say Say Nothin Susan s eyes flashed her scorn Do you s pose I d let that poor lamb know I see him cryin Well I guess not I backed out as soft as a feather bed an I didn t go near that settin room for an hour nor let any one else I was a regular dragon fly guardin it Well by an by Keith comes out His face was white an strained lookin But he was smiling an he handed out my poem I d left it on the table when I come out with Mis McGuire I found this paper on the table Susan It s your poem isn t it he says real cheerful like Then he turns kind of quick an leaves the room without another word Well I didn t know then that t was the poem he d been cryin over I didn t know till this mornin Then somethin he said made me see right off Why Susan what was it It was somethin about work But first you wouldn t understand it unless you see the poem An I can show it to you cause I ve got it right here I m tryin to memorialize it so I keep it with me all the time an repeat one line over an over till I get it It s right here in my bag You ll find it s the best I ve wrote Miss Dorothy I m sure you will she went on a bit wistfully You see I used a lot of the words that was in the magazine not that I pleasurized it any of course Mine s different cause mine is poetry an theirs is prosy There I guess maybe you can read it even if t is my writin she finished taking a sheet of note paper from her bag and carefully spreading it out for Miss Dorothy to read And this is what Dorothy read CONTENTMENT Wealth I asked for the earth but when in my hands It shriveled and crumbled away And the green of its trees and the blue of its skies Changed to a somber gray Beauty I asked for the moon but the shimmering thing Was only reflected gold And vanished away at my glance and touch And was then but a tale that is told Pleasure I asked for the stars and lots of them came And twinkled and danced for me But the whirling lights soon wearied my gaze I squenched their flame in the sea Fame I asked for the sun but the fiery ball Brought down from its home on high Scorched and blistered my finger tips As I swirled it back to the sky Labor I asked for a hoe and I set me to work And my red blood danced as I went At night I rested and looking back I counted my day well spent But Susan I don t see began Miss Dorothy lifting puzzled eyes from the last line of the poem I don t see what there is about that to make mister Keith cry No I didn t till this mornin an then Well Keith came out into the kitchen an begun one of them tramps of his up an down the room It always drives me nearly crazy when he does that but I can t say anything of course I did begin this mornin to talk about John McGuire an how fine it was he d got somethin he could do I thought t would take the poor boy s mind off hisself if I could get him talkin about John McGuire he s been SO interested in John all winter An so glad he could help him You know he s always so wanted to HELP somebody hisself instead of always havin somebody helpin him But dear me instead of its bein a quieter now for him it was a regular stirrup That s just it that s just it Susan he moans You ve got to have work or you die There s nothin in the whole world like work YOUR WORK John McGuire s got his work an I m glad of it But where s mine Where s mine I tell you An I told him he d jest been havin his work helpin John McGuire You know it was wonderful perfectly wonderful Miss Dorothy the way them two men got hold of John McGuire You know John wouldn t speak to anybody not anybody till Keith an his father found some way to get on the inside of his shell An Keith s been so happy all winter doin it an his father too So I tried to remind him that he d been doin his work But it didn t do no good Keith said that was all very well an he was glad of course but that was only a little bit of a thing an t was all past an gone an John didn t need em any more an there wasn t anything left for him now at all Oh Miss Dorothy he talked awfully I never heard him run on so An I knew from a lot of it that he said that he was thinkin of that poem he wouldn t ask for wealth or beauty or fame or anything an that there didn t anything count but labor You see Yes I see Miss Dorothy s voice was very low Her face was turned quite away yet Susan was very sure that there were tears in her eyes An his father he s most as bad as Keith sighed Susan They re both as nervous as witches what with the war an all an they not bein able to do anything Oh they do give money lots of it Liberty Bonds an Red Cross an drives of course You knew they d got it now their money didn t you Miss Dorothy Yes I had heard so Not that it seems to do em any particular good complained Susan wistfully Oh of course things ain t so so ambiguous as they was an we have more to eat an wear an don t have to worry about bills But they ain t any happier as I can see If only Keith could find somethin Yes I know sighed Miss Dorothy again as she turned slowly away I wish he could Well come to see us won t you urged Susan anxiously That ll help some it ll help a lot But Miss Dorothy did not seem to have heard At least she did not answer Yet not twenty four hours later she was ringing the Burtons doorbell No no not there I want to see YOU she panted a little breathlessly when Susan would have led the way to the living room But Keith would be so glad begged Susan No no I particularly don t want him to know I am here insisted Dorothy And without further ado but with rebellious lips and eyes Susan led the way to the kitchen Susan I have a scheme I think that may help out mister Keith began the young girl abruptly I ll have to begin by telling you something of what I ve seen during these last two or three months while I ve been away A mister Wilson an old college friend of my father s has been taking a lot of interest in the blind especially since the war He got to thinking of the blinded soldiers and wishing he could help them He had seen some of them in Canada and talked with them What he thought of first for them was brooms and basket weaving and chair caning same as everybody does But he found they had a perfect horror of those things They said nobody bought such things except out of pity they d rather have the machine made kind And these men didn t want things bought of them out of pity You see they were big well strong young fellows like John McGuire here and they were groping around trying to find a way to live all those long years of darkness that they knew were ahead of them They didn t have any especial talent But they wanted to work do something that was necessary not be charity folks as they called it I know responded Susan sympathetically Well this mister Wilson is at the head of a big electrical machinery manufacturing company near Chicago like mister Sanborn s here you know And suddenly one day it came to him that he had the very thing right in his own shop a necessary kind of work that the blind could be taught to do My lan what was it Think of blind folks goin to work in a big shop like Tom Sanborn s I know it But there was something It was wrapping the coils of wire with tape mister Wilson said they used hundreds of thousands of these coils all the time and they had to be wrapped to insulate them It was this work that he believed the blind could learn to do Anyhow he determined to try it And try it he did He sent for those soldiers he had talked with in Canada and he took two or three of father s patients and opened a little winding room with a good electrical engineer in charge And do you know it was wonderful the way those poor fellows took hold of that work Why they got really skillful in no time and they learned to do it swiftly too My lan breathed Susan again They did He took me in to see them one day It was just a big room on the ground floor of an office building He didn t put them in his shop He said he wanted to keep them separate for the present anyway It had two or three long tables and the superintendent moved up and down the room overseeing their work and helping where it was necessary There was a new man that morning and it was perfectly wonderful how he took hold of it And they were all so happy laughing and talking and having the best time ever but they sobered up real earnest when mister Wilson introduced one or two of them to me One man in particular he was one of the soldiers a splendid great blond fellow six feet tall and only twenty one told me what this work meant to them how glad they were to feel of real use in the world Then his face flushed and his shoulders straightened a bit And we re even helping a little to win the war he said for these coils we are winding now are for some armatures to go in some big motors that are going to be used in making munitions So you see we are helping a little Bless his heart He didn t know how much he was helping every one just by his big brave courage Well Susan all this gave me an idea after what you said yesterday about mister Keith And I wondered why couldn t he wind coils too And maybe he d get others to do it also So I went to mister Sanborn and he s perfectly willing to let us give it a trial He s pleased and interested and says he will furnish everything for the experiment including a first class engineer to superintend only he can t spend any time over it himself and we ll have to get somebody else to take charge and make arrangements about the place and the starting of it and all that And Susan now comes my second idea Could we do you suppose we could get mister Daniel Burton to take charge of it Oh Miss Dorothy if we only could It would be so fine for mister Keith and for all the others I ve been hearing everywhere how wonderfully he got hold of John McGuire He did he did cried Susan an he was like a different man all the time he was doin it He hain t had no use for his paintin lately an he s been so uneasy I m sure he ll do it if you ask him Good Then I will Is is he at home to day Yes he s upstairs I ll call him Susan sprang to her feet with alacrity But Susan just a minute Miss Dorothy had put out a detaining hand Is is mister Keith here too Yes both of em Keith is in the settin room an I ll call his father down T won t take but jest a minute Susan was plainly chafing at the detaining hand No no Susan Miss Dorothy too had sprung to her feet If if mister Keith is here I ll wait I want to see mister Daniel Burton first er alone to to tell him about it you know she added hastily as Susan began to frown her disappointment But I don t see why argued Susan her disapproving eyes on the girl s flushed cheeks I should think you d want to talk it up with both of em Yes yes of course but not not at first stammered Miss Dorothy plainly growing more and more embarrassed as she tried to appear less so I would rather er that is I think it would be better to ask mister Daniel Burton first and then after we get it well started let him tell his son So I ll come to morrow in the morning at ten mister Keith is with mister John McGuire then isn t he And over at his house I heard he was Yes he is most generally Then I ll come then If if you ll tell mister Daniel Burton please hurried on Miss Dorothy and ask him to see me And please PLEASE keep it from mister Keith Susan Truly I don t want him to know a thing about it till his father and I have have got it all fixed up she finished But Miss Dorothy I know that Keith would want Susan With an imperiousness quite foreign to her usual manner Miss Dorothy cut in sharply If you don t promise to speak only to mister Daniel Burton about this matter I shall not come at all Oh lan sakes Well well have it your own way snapped Susan You promise Yes I promise Susan s lips obeyed but her eyes were still mutinous Good Thank you Susan Then I ll come to morrow at ten nodded Miss Dorothy once again her smiling gracious self as she turned to leave the room CHAPTER XXX DANIEL BURTON S JOB Dorothy came at ten or to be strictly accurate at five minutes past ten The additional five minutes had been consumed by her going out of her way around the block so that she might see if Keith were visible in one of the McGuires windows He was visible and when she went up the Burton walk at five minutes past ten her step was confident and her face eager and there was about her manner none of the furtive nervous questioning that had marked her coming the day before Good morning Susan she began cheerily as Susan answered her ring Did mister Burton say he would see me He did And mister Keith is over to the McGuires all safe so you don t have to worry about him Susan s eyes were still mutinous her voice still coldly disapproving Yes I know he is nodded Miss Dorothy with a bright smile Oh you do Yes Well that is er I Under Susan s uncompromising frigidity Miss Dorothy s stammering tongue came to a painful pause Humph vouchsafed Susan Well come in an I ll tell mister DANIEL Burton you re here That the emphasis on Daniel was not lost was shown by the sudden broad smile that chased away the confusion on Miss Dorothy s face as Susan led the way to the living room Two minutes later Daniel Burton thinner paler and more worn looking than Dorothy had ever seen him before entered the room and held out a cordial hand Good morning Miss Dorothy I m glad to see you he said What is it Red Cross Y M C A Smileage Books The whimsical smile on his lips only served to emphasize the somber pain in his eyes Not any of them Then Susan didn t tell you Not a word Sit down please Thank you Then I shall have to begin at the beginning sighed the girl a little constrainedly as she took the chair he offered her I I have a certain project that I want to carry out mister Burton and I I want your help Why of course certainly I shall be glad to I know Daniel Burton s hand had already reached for his check book Any project of yours Miss Dorothy How much do you want But Miss Dorothy lifted her hand palm outward Thank you mister Burton but not any in money just yet Oh it ll take money probably to get it started before it s on a self supporting basis I suppose But it isn t money I want to day mister Burton It it s yourself The man gave a short dry laugh not untinged with bitterness I m afraid I can t endorse either your taste or your judgment there Miss Dorothy You ve come for a poor stick I can t imagine myself as being much benefit to any sort of project However I shall be glad to hear about it of course What is it And Miss Dorothy told him With her eyes shining and her voice quivering with eagerness she told the story as she had told it to Susan the afternoon before but with even greater elaboration of detail And so now mister Burton you you will help won t you she begged in closing Help But my dear girl how Take charge Be the head and shoulders the backbone of the whole thing Oh yes I know it s a whole lot to ask she hurried on as she saw the dawning dismay and refusal in his face But I thought for the sake of the cause The cause The man s voice was bitter as he interrupted her I d crawl to France on my hands and knees if that would do any good But my dear young lady I m an ignoramus and worse than an ignoramus when it comes to machinery I ll venture to wager that I wouldn t know the tape from the coils or whatever they are Oh we d have an engineer for that part of course interposed the girl eagerly And we want your son too You want Keith Pray do you expect him to teach how to wind coils No no not exactly though I think he will be teaching before he realizes it I want him to learn to wind them himself and thus get others to learn You don t understand mister Burton I want you and mister Keith to to do just what you did for John McGuire arouse interest and enthusiasm and get them to do it Don t you see But that was Keith not I in the case of John McGuire It was you at the last corrected the girl gently mister Burton John McGuire wouldn t have any book out this spring if it weren t for you and your eyes Hm m perhaps not Still there d have been a way probably But even if I grant that all you say in the case of John McGuire that isn t winding armatures or whatever they are mister Burton you aren t going to refuse pleaded the girl What else can I do Miss Dorothy you don t want to stamp this project of yours a FAILURE from the start do you Words voice manner and gesture were unmistakable All the longing and heartache and bitterness of years of fruitless effort and final disappointment pulsated through that one word FAILURE For a moment nobody spoke Daniel Burton had got to his feet and crossed the room to the window The girl watching him with compassionate eyes as he stood looking out had caught her breath with a little choking sigh Suddenly she lifted her head resolutely mister Burton you ve got one gift that that I don t believe you realize at all that you possess Like John McGuire you can make folks SEE what you are talking about Perhaps it s because you can paint pictures with a brush Or or perhaps it s because you ve got such a wonderful command of words Miss Dorothy stumbled a little precipitately into this sentence she had not failed to see the disdainful movement of the man s head and shoulders at the mention of his pictures Whatever it is she hurried on you ve got it I saw it first years ago with with your son when I used to see him at father s He would sit and talk to me by the hour about the woods and fields and mountains the sunsets and the flowers back home and little by little I found out that they were the pictures you drew for him on the canvas of his soul You ve done it again now for John McGuire Do you suppose you could have caught those wonderful stories of his with your pencil if you hadn t been able to help him visualize them for himself you and Keith together with your wonderful enthusiasm and interest I know you couldn t And that s what I want you now for you and your son Because he is blind and knows and understands as no seeing person can know and understand they will trust him they will follow where he leads But behind him has got to be YOU You ve got to be the eyes for for them all not to teach the work we ll have others for that Any good mechanic will do for that part But it s the other part of it the soul of the thing These men lots of them are but little more than boys big strong strapping fellows with the whole of life before them And they are blind Whichever way they turn a big black curtain shuts them in And it s those four black curtains that I want you to paint I want you to give them something to look at something to think of something to live for And you can do it And when you have done it you ll find they re the best and and the biggest pictures you ever painted Her voice broke with the last word and choked into silence Over at the window the man stood motionless One minute two minutes passed Then a bit abruptly he turned crossed the room to the girl s side and held out his hand Miss Dorothy I I ll take the job he said He spoke lightly and he smiled as he said the words but neither the smile nor the lightness of his manner quite hid the shake in his voice nor the moisture in his eyes Thank you mister Burton I was sure you would cried the girl And now for Keith He s over to the McGuires I ll get him exclaimed the man boyishly But Miss Dorothy was instantly on her feet No no please she begged a little breathlessly I d rather you didn t now I I think we d better get it a little farther along before we tell him There s a whole lot to do you know getting the room and the materials and the superintendent and all that and there isn t a thing he can do yet All right Very good Perhaps that would be better nodded the man But let me tell you I already have some workers for your project You mean Jack Green here in town No Oh we d want him of course but it s some others a couple of boys from Hillsboro I had a letter yesterday from the father of one of the boys asking what to do with his son He thought because of of Keith that I could help him It was a pitiful letter The man was heart broken and utterly at sea His boy only nineteen had come home blind and well nigh crazed with the tragedy of it And the father didn t know which way to turn That s why he had appealed to me You see on account of Keith Yes I understand said the girl gently as the man left his sentence unfinished I ve had others too several of them in the last few weeks If you ll wait I ll get the letters He was already halfway to the door It may take a minute or two to look them up but they ll be worth it I think Of course they will she cried eagerly They ll be just exactly what we want and I m not in a bit of a hurry she finished dropping back in her chair as the door closed behind him Alone she looked about the room her eyes wistful brimming with unshed tears Over by the window was Keith s chair before it the table with a half completed picture puzzle spread upon it Near the table was a set of shelves containing other picture puzzles games and books all as the girl well knew especially designed and constructed for eyes that could not see She had risen to her feet and half started to cross the room toward the table when the door to the side hall opened and Keith Burton entered the room With a half stifled gasp the girl stepped back to her chair The blind boy stopped instantly his face turned toward her Is that you Susan The girl wet her lips but no words came Who s there please He spoke sharply this time As everybody knew who knew Keith the one thing that angered him more than anything else was the attempted deception as to one s presence in the room Miss Dorothy gave a confused little laugh and put her hand to her throat Why Keith it s only I Don t look so You For one brief moment his face lighted up as with a hidden flame then instantly it changed It became like the gray of ashes after the flame is spent Why didn t you speak then he questioned It did no good to keep quiet You mustn t forget that I have ears if I haven t eyes Nonsense Keith She laughed again confusedly though her own face had paled a little I did speak as soon as I caught my breath popping in on a body like that But I didn t know you were here stammered the young fellow uncertainly Nobody called me I beg your pardon if He came to a helpless pause Not a bit of it You needn t It wasn t necessary at all The girl tossed off the words with a lightness so forced that it was almost flippancy You see I didn t come to see you at all It was your father My father Certainly But but does he know The girl laughed merrily too merrily for sincerity Know Indeed he does We ve just been having a lovely talk He s gone upstairs for some letters He s coming right back right back Oh h Was it an indefinable something in her voice or was it the repetition of the last two words Whatever it was that caused it Keith turned away with a jerk walked with the swift sureness of long familiarity straight to the set of shelves and took down a book Then I ll not disturb you any further as long as you re not needing me he said tersely I only came for this And with barely a touch of his cane to the floor and door casing he strode from the room The pity of it that he could not have seen Dorothy Parkman s eyes looking after him CHAPTER XXXI WHAT SUSAN DID NOT SEE There was apparently no limit to Daniel Burton s enthusiastic cooperation with Dorothy Parkman on the matter of establishing a workroom for the blind He set to work with her at once The very next morning after her initial visit he went with her to Mazie Sanborn s father and together they formulated the first necessary plans Thomas Sanborn was generous and cordially enthusiastic though his words and manner carried the crisp terseness of the busy man whose time is money At the end of five minutes he summoned one David Patch to the office and introduced him to Miss Dorothy and Daniel Burton as one of his most expert engineers And now I ll turn the whole thing over to you he declared briskly with his finger already on the button that would summon his stenographer for dictation Just step into that room there and stay as long as you like Whatever Patch says I ll back up You ll find him thoroughly capable and trustworthy And now good luck to you he finished throwing wide the door of the adjoining room The next moment Miss Dorothy and Daniel Burton found themselves alone with the keen eyed alert little man who had been introduced as David Patch And David Patch did indeed appear to be very capable He evidently understood his business and he gave interested attention to Miss Dorothy s story of what she had seen and of what she wished now to try to do He took them then for a tour of the great shop especially to the department where the busy fingers were winding with tape the thousands of wire coils Miss Dorothy s eyes sparkled with excitement and she fairly clapped her hands in her delight while Daniel Burton said that even he could see the possibilities of that kind of work for their purpose At the end of a long hour of talking and planning Miss Dorothy and Daniel Burton started for home But even then Daniel Burton had yet more to say for at his gate which was on Miss Dorothy s way home he begged her to come in for a moment I had another letter to day about a blind soldier this time from Baltimore I want to show it to you You see so many write to me on account of my own boy You will come in just a minute Why yes of course I will The pause and the half stifled word that finished the sentence came as the tall figure of Keith Burton turned the corner of the piazza and walked toward the steps Hullo Dad Keith s voice was questioning Yes and And Dorothy Parkman broke in the girl with a haste so precipitate as to make her almost choke Miss Parkman Once again for a moment Keith s face lighted as with a flame Come up Come around on the south side he cried eagerly I ve been sunning myself there You d think it was May instead of March No she can t go and sun herself with you interposed Daniel Burton with mock severity She s coming with me into the house I want to show her something Well I I like that retorted the youth He spoke jauntily and gave a short little laugh But the light had died from his face and a slow red had crept to his forehead Well she can t She s coming with me reiterated the man Now run back to your sun bath If you re good maybe we ll be out pretty soon he laughed back at his son as he opened the house door for his guest That s right you didn t want him to know yet did you he added looking a bit anxiously into the girl s somewhat flushed face as he closed the hall door Quite right No I don t want him to know yet There s so much to be done to get started and he d want to help And he couldn t help about that part and t would only fret him and make him unhappy My idea exactly nodded the man When we get the room and the goods there we ll want to tell him then Of course you ll tell him then cried the girl Yes indeed of course we will exclaimed the man very evidently not noticing the change in the pronoun Now if you ll wait a minute I ll get that letter then we ll go out to Keith on the piazza It was a short letter and one quickly read and very soon they were out on the piazza again But Miss Dorothy said No no very hastily when he urged her to go around on the other side and she added I really must go home now as she hurried down the steps Daniel Burton went then around the corner of the piazza to explain her absence to his son Keith But he need not have hurried His son Keith was not there For all the good progress that was made on that first day things seemed to move a bit slowly after that To begin with the matter of selecting a suitable room gave no little difficulty The right room in the right location seemed not to be had and Daniel Burton even suggested that they use some room in his own house But after a little thought he gave up this idea as being neither practical nor desirable Meanwhile he was in daily communication with Dorothy Parkman and the two spent hours together thrashing out the different problems one by one as they arose sometimes at her home more frequently at his for home to Dorothy in Hinsdale meant the Sanborn house where Mazie was always in evidence and Daniel Burton did not care for Mazie Especially he did not care for her advice and assistance on the problems that were puzzling him now To be sure at his own home there was Keith but he contrived to avoid Keith on most occasions Besides Keith himself seemed quite inclined to keep out of the way particularly if he heard the voice of Dorothy Parkman which did not disturb Daniel Burton in the least under the circumstances Until they got ready to tell Keith he was rather glad that he did keep so conveniently out of the way And as Dorothy seemed always glad to avoid seeing Keith or talking to him there was really very little trouble on that score and they could have their consultations in peace and quietness And there were so many of them those consultations When at last the room was found there were the furnishings to select and the final plans to be made for the real work to be done David Patch proved himself to be invaluable then As if by magic a long table appeared and the coils and the tape and all the various paraphernalia of a properly equipped winding room marched smoothly into place Meanwhile three soldiers and one civilian stood ready and eager to be taught needing only the word of command to begin And now we ll tell Keith said Daniel Burton Yes now you must tell Keith said Miss Dorothy To morrow at nine To morrow at nine bowed Miss Dorothy I ll bring him down and we ll show him And I do so hope he ll like it Of course he ll like it cried Daniel Burton You wait and see But she did not see She was not there to see Promptly at nine o clock Daniel Burton appeared at the winding room with Keith But Dorothy Parkman was nowhere in sight He waited ten fifteen minutes then he told Keith the story of the room and of what they hoped to do there fuming meanwhile within himself because he had to tell it alone But it was not lack of interest that kept Miss Dorothy away It could not have been for that very afternoon she sought Daniel Burton out and asked eagerly what his son had said and how he had taken it And her eyes shone and her breath quickened at the story Daniel Burton told and so eager was she to know every little word that had fallen from Keith s lips that she kept Daniel Burton repeating over and over each minute detail Yet the next day when Keith and four other blind youths began work in earnest she never once went near Keith s chair though she went often to the others dropping here and there a word of encouragement or a touch of aiding fingers When night came however and she found an opportunity for a few words alone with Daniel Burton she told him that in her opinion Keith had done the best work of the five and that it was perfectly marvelous the way he was taking hold And again her eyes sparkled and her breath quickened and she spent the entire ten minutes talking about Keith to his father Yet the next day when the work began again she still went to the back of every chair but Keith s Things happened very rapidly after that It was not a week before the first long table in the big room was filled with eager workers and the second one had to be added to take care of the newcomers The project was already the talk of the town and not the least excited and interested of the observers was John McGuire s mother When the news came of the second table s being added to the equipment of the place she hurried over to Susan s kitchen without delay though with the latest poem of her son s as the ostensible excuse It s The Stumbling Block she announced He just got it done yesterday an I copied it for you I think it s the best yet she beamed handing over a folded paper It s kind of long so don t stop to read it now Say is it true Have they had to put in another table at that blind windin room They have Well if that ain t the greatest I think it s just grand They took my John down there to see the place yesterday Do you know That boy is a different bein since his book an his writin An he s learnin to do such a lot of things for himself an he s so happy in it An he doesn t mind seein anybody now An it s all owin to your wonderful Keith an his father I wouldn t ever have believed it of them Susan s chin came up a bit I would I KNEW An I always told you that Daniel Burton was a superlative man in every way an his son s jest like him Only you wouldn t believe me Nobody d believe you maintained missus McGuire spiritedly Nobody d believe such a thing could be as my John bein changed like that an all those others down to the windin room too They say it s perfectly marvelous what Keith an his father are doin with those men an boys Aren t they awful happy over it Keith an his father I mean Daniel Burton is Why he s like a different man Mis McGuire You d know that jest to see him walk an hear him speak An I don t hear nothin more about his longin to get over there I guess he thinks he s got work enough to do right here An he hardly ever touches his war maps these days But ain t Keith happy too Y yes an no hesitated Susan her face clouding a little Oh he s gone into it heart an soul an while he s workin on somethin he s all right But when it s all quiet an he s settin alone I don t like the look on his face But I know he s glad to be helpin down there an I know it s helpin him too It s helpin everybody not forgettin Miss Dorothy Parkman added missus McGuire with a smile and a shrug as she rose to go But then of course we all know what she s after After What do you mean Susan Betts With a jerk missus McGuire faced about It ain t possible with eyes in your head that you hain t seen Seen what Well my lan With that girl throwin herself at Daniel Burton s head for the last six weeks an you calmly set there an ask seen what Daniel Burton Dorothy Parkman There was no mistaking Susan s dumfounded amazement Yes Daniel Burton an Dorothy Parkman Oh I used to think it was Keith but when the money came to old Daniel I guess she thought he wasn t so old after all Besides Keith with his handicap you couldn t blame the girl after all I s pose Daniel Burton an Dorothy Parkman repeated Susan this time with the faintness of stupefaction Why Susan you must ve seen it her runnin in here every day walkin home with him an talk talk talkin to him every chance she gets But they they ve been makin plans for for the work murmured Susan Work Well I guess it no need to ve taken quite so many consultations for just the work Besides she never thought of such a scheme as this before the money came did she Not much she did Oh come Susan wake up She ll be walkin off with him right under your nose if you don t look out finished missus McGuire with a sly laugh as she took her departure Left alone Susan sat for some time absorbed in thought a deep frown on her face then with a sigh and a shrug as if throwing off an incomprehensible burden she opened the paper missus McGuire had left with her Once twice three times she read the verses then with a low chuckle she folded up the paper tucked it into her apron pocket and rose to her feet A minute later she had attacked the pile of dishes in the sink and was singing lustily I ve taken my worries an taken my woes I have I have An shut em up where nobody knows I have I have I chucked em down that s what I did An now I m sittin upon the lid An we ll all feel gay when Johnny comes marchin home I m sittin upon the lid I am Hurrah Hurrah I m tryin to be a little lamb Hurrah Hurrah But I m feelin more like a great big slam Than a nice little peaceful woolly lamb But we ll all feel gay when Johnny comes marchin home CHAPTER XXXII THE KEY There was no work at the winding room Saturday afternoons and it was on Saturday afternoon that Susan found Keith sitting idle handed in his chair by the window in the living room As was her custom she spoke the moment she entered the room but not before she had noted the listless attitude and wistful face of the youth over by the window Keith I ve been thinkin Bad practice Susan sometimes he laughed whimsically Not this time Poetry She shook her head No I ain t poetizin so much these days though I did write one yesterday about the ways of the world I m goin to read it to you too by an by But that s jest a common poem about common every day folks An this thing I was thinkin about was was diff rent And so you couldn t put this into a poem eh Susan shook her head again and sighed No An it s been that way lots o times lately specially since I seen John McGuire s poems so fine an bumtious Oh I have the perspiration to write lots o times an I yield up to it an write But somehow when it s done I hain t said a mite what I want to an I hain t said it the way I want to either I think maybe havin so many of em disinclined by them editors has made me kinder fearsome I m afraid it has Susan he smiled Now this afternoon what I was thinkin about once I d ve made a poem of that easy but to day I didn t even try I KNEW I couldn t do it An say Keith it was you I was thinkin about Heavens Susan A poem out of me No wonder your muse balked I m afraid you d find even er perspiration wouldn t make a poem out of me Keith do you remember Susan was still earnest and preoccupied I told you once that it didn t make no diff rence if God had closed the door of your eyes He d open up another room to you sometime an give you the key to unlock the door An he has An now you ve got it that key I ve got it the key Yes It s that work down there helpin them blind men an boys to get hold of their souls again Oh Keith don t you see An it s such a big wide room that God has given you an it s all yours There ain t no one that can help them poor blind soldiers like you can An you couldn t a done it if the door of your eyes hadn t been shut first That was what give you the key to this big beautiful room of helpin our boys what s come back to us blinded an half crazed with despair an discouragement Oh if I only could make you see it the way I do But I can t say it the right way There s such a big beautiful idea there if only I could make you see it That s why I wanted to write the poem I can see it Susan without the poem Keith was not smiling now His face was turned away and his voice had grown a bit unsteady And I m glad you showed it to me It s going to help me a whole lot if if I ll just keep remembering that key I think Susan threw a quick look into Keith s averted face then promptly she reached for the folded paper in her apron pocket There were times when Susan was wise beyond her station as to when the subject should be changed An now I m goin to read you the poem I did write she announced briskly about every day folks diff rent kinds of folks Six of em It shows that there ain t any one anywhere that s really satisfied with their lot when you come right down to it whether they ve got eyes or not And she began to read THE WAY OF THE WORLD A beggar girl on the curbstone sat All ragged an hungry eyed Across the street came Peggy McGee The beggar girl saw an sighed I wish d I was rich as rich as she For she has got things to eat An clo s an shoes an a place to live An she don t beg in the street When Peggy McGee the corner turned SHE climbed to her garret high From there she gazed through curtainless panes At hangin s of lace near by Ah me sighed Peggy If I had those An rugs like hers on the floor It seems to me that I d never ask For nothin at all no more From out those curtains that selfsame day Looked a face all sour an thin I hate to live on this horrid street In the children s yellin din An where s the good of my nice new things When nobody ll see or know I really think that I ought to be A livin in Rich Man s Row A carriage came from Rich Man s Row An rumbled by to the park A lady sat on the carriage seat Oh dear said she what an ark If only this coach could show some style My clothes so shabby would pass Now there s an auto quite my kind But tisn t my own alas The auto carried a millionaire Whose brow was knotted an stern A million is nowhere now thought he That s somethin we all must learn It s millions MANY one has to have To be in the swim at all This tryin to live when one is so poor Is really all folderol A man of millions was just behind The beggar was passin by Business at beggin was good that day An the girl was eatin pie The rich man looked an he groaned aloud An swore with his gouty pain I d give my millions an more beside Could I eat like that again Now ain t that jest like folks Susan demanded as she finished the last verse Keith laughed I suspect it is Susan And and by the way I shouldn t wonder if this were quite the right time to show that I m no different from other folks You see I too er am going to make a change in living A change in living What do you mean Oh not now not quite yet But you see I VE been doing some thinking too I ve been thinking that if father that is WHEN father and Miss Parkman are married that But Susan interrupted with a groan My sakes Keith have you seen it too Keith laughed embarrassedly To be sure I have You don t have to have eyes to see that do you Susan Oh good lan I don t know frowned Susan irritably I didn t s pose She did not finish her sentence and after a moment s silence Keith began again to speak I ve been talking a little to David Patch the superintendent you know We re going to take the whole house where we are for our work pretty quick and when we do Patch and his wife will come there to live upstairs and they ll take me to board I asked them Then I ll be right there handy all the time you see which will be a fine arrangement all around A fine arrangement indeed with you way off down there an livin with David Patch But Susan argued Keith a bit wearily I couldn t be living here you know I should like to know why not Because I couldn t He had grown very white now Besides I I think they would be happier without me here and I know I should be His voice was low and almost indistinct but Susan heard and understood The very fact that once I I thought that I was foolish enough to think But of course as soon as I remembered my blindness And to tie a beautiful young girl down to He stopped short and pulled himself up Susan are you still there I m right here Keith Susan spoke constrainedly He gave an embarrassed laugh A painful red had suffused his face I m afraid I got to talking and forgetting that I wasn t alone he stumbled on hurriedly I I meant to go on to say that I hoped they d be very happy Dad deserves it and and if they d only hurry up and get it over with it it would be easier for me Not that it matters of course Dad has had an awful lot to put up with me already as it is you know the trouble the care and the disappointment You see I I was going to make up to him for all he had lost I was going to be Jerry and Ned and myself all in a bunch And now to turn out to be nothing and worse than nothing Keith Burton you stop It was the old imperious Susan back again You stop right where you be An don t you never let me hear you say another word about your bein a disappointment Jerry an Ned indeed I wonder if you think a dozen Jerrys an Neds could do what you ve done An no matter what they done they couldn t have done a bigger splendider thing than you ve done in triumphating over your blindness the way you ve done nor one that would make your father prouder of you An let me tell you another thing Keith Burton No matter what you done no matter how many big pictures you painted or big books you wrote or how much money you made for your dad there ain t anything you could ve done that would do him so much solid good as what you have done Why Susan are you wild I haven t done a thing not a thing for dad Yes you have You ve done the biggest thing of all by NEEDIN him Needing him Yes Keith Burton look at your father now Look at the splendid work he s doin You know as well as I do that he used to be a thoroughly insufficient uncapacious man though I wouldn t let anybody else say it putterin over a mess of pictures that wouldn t sell for a nickel An that he used to run from anything an everything that was unpropitious an disagreeable like he was bein chased Well then you was took blind An what happened You know what happened He came right up an toed the mark like a man an a gentleman An he s toed it ever since An I can tell you that the pictures he s paintin now with his tongue for them poor blind boys to see is bigger an better than any pictures he could have painted with with his pigmy paints if he worked on em for a thousand years An it s YOU that s done it for him jest by needin him So there And before Keith could so much as open his lips Susan was gone slamming the door behind her CHAPTER XXXIII AND ALL ON ACCOUNT OF SUSAN Not one wink did Susan Betts sleep that night To Susan her world was tumbling about her ears in one dizzy whirl of destruction Daniel Burton and Dorothy Parkman married and living there and her beloved blind boy banished to a home with one David Patch Unthinkable And yet Well if it had got to be it had got to be she supposed the marriage But they might at least be decent about it As for keeping that poor blind boy harrowed up all the time and prolonging the agony well at least she could do something about THAT thank goodness And she would too When there was anything that Susan could do particularly in the line of righting a wrong she lost no time in doing it Within two days therefore she made her opportunity and grasped it A little peremptorily she informed Miss Dorothy Parkman that she would like to speak to her please in the kitchen Then tall and cold and very stern she faced her Of course I understand Miss Dorothy I m bustlin in where I hain t no business to An I hain t no excuse to offer except my boy Keith It s for him I m askin you to do it To do what Susan She had changed color slightly as she asked the question Not let it be seen so plain the love makin Seen Love making gasped the girl Well the talkin to him then an whisperin an consultin s an runnin here every day an I beg your pardon Susan interrupted the girl incisively She had grown very white I am tempted to make no sort of reply to such an absurd accusation but I m going to say however that you must be laboring under some mistake I do not come here to see mister Keith Burton and I ve scarcely exchanged a dozen words with him for months I m talkin about mister Daniel not Keith an mister DANIEL Burton Of course Who else Susan was nettled now and showed it I don t s pose you ll deny runnin here to see him an talkin to him an No no wait wait Don t say any more PLEASE The girl was half laughing half crying and her face was going from white to red and back to white again Am I to understand that I am actually being accused of of running after mister Daniel Burton of of love making toward HIM she choked incoherently Why y yes that is er Oh this is too much too much First Keith and now She broke off hysterically To think that Oh Susan how could you how could you And this time she dropped into a chair and covered her face with her hands But she was laughing Very plainly she was laughing Susan frowned stared and frowned again Then you ain t in love with Suddenly her face cleared and broke into a broad smile Well my lan if that ain t the best joke ever Of course you ain t in love with him I don t believe I ever more n half believed it anyway Now it ll be dead easy an all right too But but what does it all mean stammered the girl Why it s jest that that everybody thought you was after him an t would be a match you bein together so much But even then I wouldn t have said a thing if it hadn t been for Keith Keith Yes poor boy he an it WAS hard for him seein you two together like this an thinkin you cared for each other An he d got his plans all made how when you was married he d go an live with David Patch David Patch But why Why don t you see T wouldn t be very easy to see you married to another man would it an lovin you all the time hisself an LOVING ME That s what I said Susan s lips came sharply together and her keen eyes swept the girl s face But I I think you must be mistaken again faltered the girl growing rosy I ain t I ve always suspicioned it an now I know it But he he s acted as if he didn t care for me at all as if he hated me That s because he cared so much Nonsense Susan T ain t nonsense It s sense As I told you I ve always suspicioned it an last Saturday when I heard him talk I knew He as good as owned it up anyhow But why didn t he he tell me stammered the girl growing still more rosy Because he was blind As if I d minded She stopped abruptly and turned away her face Susan drew a resolute breath and squared her shoulders Then why don t you do somethin she demanded Do something Yes to to show him that you don t mind Oh Susan I I couldn t do that All right Settle back then an do nothin an he ll settle back an do nothin an there ll be a pretty pair of you eatin your hearts out with love for each other an passin each other by with converted faces an highbrow chins an all because you re afraid of offendin Mis Grundy who don t care no more about you than two sticks But I s pose you d both rather be miserable than brace up an defy the properties an live long an be happy ever after But if I could be sure he cared spoke the girl in a faint little voice You would have been if you d seen him Saturday as I did And if If if if interrupted Susan impatiently An there that poor blind boy sets an thinks an thinks an thinks an longs for some one that loves him to smooth his pillow an rumple his hair an Susan I m going to do it I M GOING TO DO IT vowed the girl springing to her feet her eyes like stars her cheeks like twin roses Do what demanded Susan I don t know But I m going to do SOMETHING Anyhow whatever I do I know I m going to to defy the properties she babbled deliriously as she hurried from the room looking very much as if she were trying to hide from herself Four days later Keith in his favorite chair sat on the south piazza It was an April day but it was like June and the window behind him was wide open into the living room He did not hear Dorothy Parkman s light step up the walk He did not know that she had paused at sight of him sitting there and had put her hand to her throat and then that she had almost run light footed into the house again very much as if she were trying to run away from herself But he did hear her voice two minutes later speaking just inside the window At the first sentence he tried to rise then with a despairing gesture as if realizing that flight would be worse than to remain where he was he sat back in his chair And this is what he heard Dorothy Parkman say No no mister Burton please I I can t marry you You ll have to understand No don t speak don t say anything please There s nothing you could say that that would make a bit of difference It s just that I I don t love you and I do love somebody else Keith your son yes you have guessed it Oh yes I know we don t seem to be much to each other now But but whether we ever are or not there can t ever be any one else And I think he cares It s just that that his pride won t let him speak As if his dear eyes didn t make me love him But I mustn t say all this to you It s just that that I wanted you to surely understand And and I must go now I must go And she went She went hurriedly a little noisily She shut one door and another then out on the piazza she came face to face with Keith Burton Dorothy oh Dorothy I heard And then it was well indeed that the Japanese screen on the front piazza was down for Keith stood with his arms outstretched and Dorothy with an ineffably contented little indrawn breath walked straight into them And with that light on his face she would have walked into them had he been standing in the middle of the sidewalk outside Illustration IT WAS WELL THAT THE JAPANESE SCREEN ON THE FRONT PIAZZA WAS DOWN To Dorothy at that moment nobody in all the world counted for a feather s weight except the man who was holding her close with his lips to hers Later a little later when they sat side by side on the piazza settee and when coherence and logic had become attributes to their conversation Keith sighed with a little catch in his voice The only thing I regret about this all this the only thing that makes me feel cheap and mean is that I ve won where dad lost out Poor old dad There was the briefest of pauses then a small subdued voice said I I suspect Keith confession is good for the soul Well he demanded in evident mystification Anyhow I I ll have to do it Your father wasn t there at all But I heard you speaking to him my dear She shook her head and stole a look into his face then caught her breath with a little choking sob of heartache because he could not see the love she knew was in her eyes But the heartache only nerved her to say the words that almost refused to come He he wasn t there she repeated fencing for time But who was there I heard you call him by name mister Burton clearly distinctly I know I did But but he wasn t there Nobody was there I I was just talking to myself You mean practicing what you were going to say questioned Keith doubtfully And that that he doesn t know yet that you are going to refuse him N no er well yes That is I mean it s true He he doesn t know I am going to refuse him There was a hint of smothered laughter in the girl s voice Dorothy The arm about her waist perceptibly loosened and almost fell away Why I don t feel now that that you half belong to me yet And and think of poor dad The girl caught her breath and stole another look into his face But Keith you you don t understand He he hasn t proposed to me yet That is I mean she amended hastily he he isn t going to propose to me ever But he was He cares And now he ll have to know about us But he wasn t he doesn t You don t understand Keith He he never thought of of proposing to me I know he didn t Then why what Dorothy what do you mean by all this Why it s just that that is I oh Keith Keith why will you make me tell you she cried between hysterical little laughs and sobs And yet I d have to tell you of course I I knew you were there on the porch and and I knew you d hear what I said And so to make you understand oh Keith it was awful but I I pretended that You darling breathed an impassioned voice in her ear Oh how I love you love you for that Oh but Keith it really was awful of me she cried blushing and laughing as she emerged from his embrace Susan told me to defy the properties and and I did it Susan She nodded That s how I knew for sure that you cared And so I owe it all even my er proposal of marriage to Susan he bantered mischievously Keith I did NOT er it was not a proposal of marriage No But you re going to marry me aren t you Her chin came up I I shall wait till I m asked she retorted with dignity Hm m well I reckon it s safe to say you ll be asked And so I owe it all to Susan Well it isn t the first good thing I ve owed to her bless her heart And she s equal to most anything But I ll wager in this case that even Susan had some stunt to perform How did she do it She told me that you you thought your father and I cared for each other and that that you cared for me but that you were very brave and were going to go away and leave us to our happiness Then when she found there was nothing to the other part of it and that I I cared for you she well I don t know how she did it but she said well I did it That s all Keith chuckled Exactly You couldn t have described it better We ve always done what Susan wanted us to and we never could tell why We we just did it That s all And oh I m so glad you did this little girl so glad Yes but She drew away from him a little and her voice became severely accusing Keith Burton you you should have done it yourself and you know it He shook his head I couldn t A swift shadow fell like a cloud over his countenance Darling even now Dorothy do you fully realize what you are doing All your life to be tied Hush Her finger was on his lips only to be kissed till she took it away I won t let you talk like that a minute not a single minute But Keith there is something I want you to say Her voice was half pleading half whimsical Her eyes through her tears were studying his face turned partly away from her Confession is good for the soul Well Anything more He smiled faintly Yes only this time it s you YOU VE got to do it I Yes Her voice rang with firm decision Keith I want to know why why all this time you ve acted so so that I had to find out through Susan that you cared And I want to know when you stopped hating me And Dorothy I never never hated you cut in the man passionately But you acted as if you did Why you you wouldn t let me come near you and you were so angry with me Yes I know The man fell back in his chair and was silent There was a long minute of waiting Keith Yes dear I confessed mine and yours can t be any harder than mine was Still he hesitated then with a long breath he began to speak Dorothy it it s just that I ve had so much to fight And it hasn t been easy But listen dear I think I ve loved you from away back in the days when you wore your hair in two thick pigtails down your back You know I was only fourteen when when the shadows began to come One day away back then I saw you shudder once at blindness We were talking about old Joe Harrington And I never forgot it But it was only because I pitied him Yes but I thought then that it was more aversion You said you couldn t bear to look at them And you see I feared even then that I was going to be like old Joe some time Oh Keith Well it came I was like old Joe blind And I knew that I was the object of curiosity and pity and I believed aversion wherever I went And oh I so hated it I didn t want to be stared at and pointed out and pitied I didn t want to be different And above all I didn t want to know that you were turning away from me in aversion and disgust Oh Keith Keith as if I ever could faltered the girl I thought you could and would I used to picture you all in the dark as I used to see you with your bright eyes and pretty hair and I could see the look on your face as you turned away shuddering That s when I determined at all costs to keep out of your sight until I should be well again I was going to be well of course then you know Well in time I went West and on the way I met Miss Stewart Yes Dorothy s voice was not quite steady I liked Miss Stewart She was wonderfully good to me At first at the very first she gave me quite a start Her voice sounded so much like Dorothy Parkman s But very soon I forgot that and just gave myself up to the enjoyment of her companionship I wasn t afraid with her that her eyes were turned away in aversion and disgust Some way I just knew that she wasn t like Dorothy Parkman You see I hadn t forgotten Dorothy Some day I was going back to her seeing Well you know what happened the operations the specialists the years of waiting the trip to London then home hopelessly blind It was not easy then Dorothy but I tried to be a man Most of all I felt for dad He d had so many hopes But never mind and anyhow what Susan said the other day helped But this has nothing to do with you dear To go on I gave you up then definitely I know that all the while I d been having you back in my mind young as I was that some day I was going to be big and strong and rich and have my eyes and that then I was going to ask you to marry me But when I got home hopelessly blind that ended it I didn t believe you would have me anyway but even if you would I wasn t going to give you the chance of always having to turn away in aversion and disgust from the sight of your husband Oh Keith how could you I couldn t But you see how I felt Then one day I heard Miss Stewart s voice in the hall and oh how good it sounded to me I think I must have caught her hand very much as the drowning man grasps at the straw SHE would never turn away from me With her I felt safe happy and at peace I don t think I exactly understood my state of mind myself I didn t think I was in love with her yet with her I was happy and I was never afraid But I didn t have a chance long to question Almost at once came the day when Mazie Sanborn ran up the steps and spoke to you And I knew My whole world seemed tumbling to destruction in one blinding crash You can never know dear how utterly dismayed and angry and helpless I felt All that I knew was that for months and months I had let Dorothy Parkman read to me play with me and talk to me that I had been eager to take all the time she would give me when all the while she had been doing it out of pity of course and I could see just how she must have been shuddering and turning away her eyes all the long long weeks she had been with me at different times But even more than that if possible was the chagrin and dismay with which I realized that all the while I had been cheated and deceived and made a fool of because I was blind and could not see I had been tricked into putting myself in such a position No no You didn t understand protested the girl Of course I didn t understand dear Nobody who is blinded with rage and hurt pride can understand anything rightly But you wouldn t let me explain afterwards No I didn t want you to explain I was too sore too deeply hurt too well I couldn t That s all Besides I didn t want you to know how much I was caring about it all So a little later when I did see you I tried to toss it all off lightly as of no consequence whatever Well you succeeded commented Dorothy dryly I had to you see I had found out then how much I really did care I knew then that somehow you and Miss Stewart were hopelessly mixed up in my heart and that I loved you and that the world without you was going to be one big desert of loneliness and longing You see it had not been so hard to give you up in imagination but when it came to the real thing But Keith why why did you insist that you must Do you think I d ask you or anybody to tie yourself to a helpless creature who would probably finally end up on a street corner with a tin cup for pennies Besides in your case I had not forgotten the shudders and the averted eyes I still was so sure Then John McGuire came home blind and after a while I found I could help him And Dorothy then is when I learned that that perhaps YOU were as happy in doing things for me as I had been in doing them for John McGuire I sort of forgot the shudders and the averted eyes then Besides along about that time we had got back to almost our old friendliness the friendliness and companionship of Miss Stewart and me Then the money came and I knew that at least I never should have to ask you to subsist on what the tin cup of pennies could bring And I had almost begun to to actually plan when all of a sudden you stopped coming right off short But I I went away defended the girl a little faintly Not at once You were here in town a long time after that I knew because I used to hear about you I was sure then that that you had seen I was caring for you and so you stayed away Besides it came back to me again my old fear of your pity and aversion of your eyes turned away You see always dear that s been a sort of obsession with me I guess I hate to feel that any one is looking at me watching me To me it seems like spying on me because I I can t look back Yes I know it s all very foolish and very silly but we are all foolish and silly over something It s because of that feeling that I I so hate to enter a room and know that some one is there who won t speak who tries to cheat me into thinking I am alone I I can t bear it Dorothy Just because I can t see them I know I know nodded the girl Well in December you went away Oh I knew when you went I knew a lot of things that YOU didn t know I knew But I was trying all those days to put you quite out of my mind and I busied myself with John McGuire and told myself that I was satisfied with my work that I had put you entirely out of my life Then you came back in February and I knew I hadn t I knew I loved you more than ever Just at first the very first I thought you had come back to me Then I saw that it was dad After that I tried oh you don t know how hard I tried to kill that wicked love in my heart Why darling nothing would have hired me to let you see it then Let dad know that his loving you hurt me Fail dad there as I had failed him everywhere else I guess not This was something I COULD do I could let him have you and never never let him know So I buried myself in work and tried to forget Then to day you came At the first sound of your voice in there when I realized what you were saying to dad I supposed I started up and would have gone Then I was afraid you would see me pass the window and that it would be worse if I went than if I stayed Besides right away I heard words that made me so weak with joy and amazement that my knees bent under me and I had to sit down And then but you know the rest dear Yes I know the rest and I ll tell you some time why I I stopped coming last fall All right but even that doesn t matter to me now for now in spite of my blind eyes the way looks all rosy ahead Why dear it s like the dawn the dawn of a new day And I used to so love the dawn You don t know but years ago with dad I d go camping in the woods and sometimes we d stay all night on the mountain I loved that for in the morning we d watch the sun come up and flood the world with light And it seemed so wonderful after the dark And it s like that with me to day dear It s my dawn the dawn of a new day And it s so wonderful after the dark Oh Keith I m so glad And listen dear It s not only dawn for you but for all those blind boys down there that you are helping You have opened their eyes to the dawn of THEIR new day Don t you see Keith drew in his breath with a little catch Have I Do you think I have Oh I should like to think that I don t know of course about them But I do know about myself And I know it s the most wonderful dawn ever was for me And I know that with your little hand in mine I ll walk fearlessly straight on with my chin up And now that I know dad doesn t care and that he isn t going to be unhappy about my loving you and your loving me I haven t even that to fear And oh Keith think think what it would have been if if I hadn t defied the properties she faltered mistily Dear old Susan bless her heart And that isn t all I owe her Something she said the other day made me hope that maybe I hadn t even quite failed dad And I so wanted to make good for dad And you ve done it Keith But maybe he he doesn t think so But he does He told me He TOLD you Yes last night He said that once he had great plans for you great ambitions but that he never dreamed he could be as proud of you as he is right now what you had done for yourself and what you were doing for those boys down there Did dad say that Yes And to think of my having that and you too breathed the man his arm tightening about her THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dawn by Eleanor H
