for two hundred seventy two An engaving by Guillaumot Introduction The deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us admits Professor Aronnax early in this novel What goes on in those distant depths What creatures inhabit or could inhabit those regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water It s almost beyond conjecture Jules Verne eighteen twenty eight nineteen oh five published the French equivalents of these words in eighteen sixty nine and little has changed since one hundred twenty six years later a Time cover story on deep sea exploration made much the same admission We know more about Mars than we know about the oceans This reality begins to explain the dark power and otherworldly fascination of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas Born in the French river town of Nantes Verne had a lifelong passion for the sea First as a Paris stockbroker later as a celebrated author and yachtsman he went on frequent voyages to Britain America the Mediterranean But the specific stimulus for this novel was an eighteen sixty five fan letter from a fellow writer Madame George Sand She praised Verne s two early novels Five Weeks in a Balloon eighteen sixty three and Journey to the Center of the Earth eighteen sixty four then added Soon I hope you ll take us into the ocean depths your characters traveling in diving equipment perfected by your science and your imagination Thus inspired Verne created one of literature s great rebels a freedom fighter who plunged beneath the waves to wage a unique form of guerilla warfare Initially Verne s narrative was influenced by the eighteen sixty three uprising of Poland against Tsarist Russia The Poles were quashed with a violence that appalled not only Verne but all Europe As originally conceived Verne s Captain Nemo was a Polish nobleman whose entire family had been slaughtered by Russian troops Nemo builds a fabulous futuristic submarine the Nautilus then conducts an underwater campaign of vengeance against his imperialist oppressor But in the eighteen sixtys France had to treat the Tsar as an ally and Verne s publisher Pierre Hetzel pronounced the book unprintable Verne reworked its political content devising new nationalities for Nemo and his great enemy information revealed only in a later novel The Mysterious Island eighteen seventy five in the present work Nemo s background remains a dark secret In all the novel had a difficult gestation Verne and Hetzel were in constant conflict and the book went through multiple drafts struggles reflected in its several working titles over the period eighteen sixty five sixty nine early on it was variously called Voyage Under the Waters Twenty five Thousand Leagues Under the Waters Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Waters and A Thousand Leagues Under the Oceans Verne is often dubbed in Isaac Asimov s phrase the world s first science fiction writer And it s true many of his sixty odd books do anticipate future events and technologies From the Earth to the Moon eighteen sixty five and Hector Servadac eighteen seventy seven deal in space travel while Journey to the Center of the Earth features travel to the earth s core But with Verne the operative word is travel and some of his best known titles don t really qualify as sci fi Around the World in Eighty Days eighteen seventy two and Michael Strogoff eighteen seventy six are closer to travelogs adventure yarns in far away places These observations partly apply here The subtitle of the present book is An Underwater Tour of the World so in good travelog style the Nautilus s exploits supply an episodic story line Shark attacks giant squid cannibals hurricanes whale hunts and other rip roaring adventures erupt almost at random Yet this loose structure gives the novel an air of documentary realism What s more Verne adds backbone to the action by developing three recurring motifs the deepening mystery of Nemo s past life and future intentions the mounting tension between Nemo and hot tempered harpooner Ned Land and Ned s ongoing schemes to escape from the Nautilus These unifying threads tighten the narrative and accelerate its momentum Other subtleties occur inside each episode the textures sparkling with wit information and insight Verne regards the sea from many angles in the domain of marine biology he gives us thumbnail sketches of fish seashells coral sometimes in great catalogs that swirl past like musical cascades in the realm of geology he studies volcanoes literally inside and out in the world of commerce he celebrates the high energy entrepreneurs who lay the Atlantic Cable or dig the Suez Canal And Verne s marine engineering proves especially authoritative His specifications for an open sea submarine and a self contained diving suit were decades before their time yet modern technology bears them out triumphantly True today s scientists know a few things he didn t the South Pole isn t at the water s edge but far inland sharks don t flip over before attacking giant squid sport ten tentacles not eight sperm whales don t prey on their whalebone cousins This notwithstanding Verne furnishes the most evocative portrayal of the ocean depths before the arrival of Jacques Cousteau and technicolor film Lastly the book has stature as a novel of character Even the supporting cast is shrewdly drawn Professor Aronnax the career scientist caught in an ethical conflict Conseil the compulsive classifier who supplies humorous tag lines for Verne s fast facts the harpooner Ned Land a creature of constant appetites man as heroic animal But much of the novel s brooding power comes from Captain Nemo Inventor musician Renaissance genius he s a trail blazing creation the prototype not only for countless renegade scientists in popular fiction but even for such varied figures as Sherlock Holmes or Wolf Larsen However Verne gives his hero s brilliance and benevolence a dark underside the man s obsessive hate for his old enemy This compulsion leads Nemo into ugly contradictions he s a fighter for freedom yet all who board his ship are imprisoned there for good he works to save lives both human and animal yet he himself creates a holocaust he detests imperialism yet he lays personal claim to the South Pole And in this last action he falls into the classic sin of Pride He s swiftly punished The Nautilus nearly perishes in the Antarctic and Nemo sinks into a growing depression Like Shakespeare s King Lear he courts death and madness in a great storm then commits mass murder collapses in catatonic paralysis and suicidally runs his ship into the ocean s most dangerous whirlpool Hate swallows him whole For many then this book has been a source of fascination surely one of the most influential novels ever written an inspiration for such scientists and discoverers as engineer Simon Lake oceanographer William Beebe polar traveler

was marked by a bizarre development an unexplained and downright inexplicable phenomenon that surely no one has forgotten Without getting into those rumors that upset civilians in the seaports and deranged the public mind even far inland it must be said that professional seamen were especially alarmed Traders shipowners captains of vessels skippers and master mariners from Europe and America naval officers from every country and at their heels the various national governments on these two continents were all extremely disturbed by the business In essence over a period of time several ships had encountered an enormous thing at sea a long spindle shaped object sometimes giving off a phosphorescent glow infinitely bigger and faster than any whale The relevant data on this apparition as recorded in various logbooks agreed pretty closely as to the structure of the object or creature in question its unprecedented speed of movement its startling locomotive power and the unique vitality with which it seemed to be gifted If it was a cetacean it exceeded in bulk any whale previously classified by science No naturalist neither Cuvier nor Lacepede neither Professor Dumeril nor Professor de Quatrefages would have accepted the existence of such a monster sight unseen specifically unseen by their own scientific eyes Striking an average of observations taken at different times rejecting those timid estimates that gave the object a length of two hundred feet and ignoring those exaggerated views that saw it as a mile wide and three long you could still assert that this phenomenal creature greatly exceeded the dimensions of anything then known to ichthyologists if it existed at all Now then it did exist this was an undeniable fact and since the human mind dotes on objects of wonder you can understand the worldwide excitement caused by this unearthly apparition As for relegating it to the realm of fiction that charge had to be dropped In essence on July twenty eighteen sixty six the steamer Governor Higginson from the Calcutta Burnach Steam Navigation company encountered this moving mass five miles off the eastern shores of Australia Captain Baker at first thought he was in the presence of an unknown reef he was even about to fix its exact position when two waterspouts shot out of this inexplicable object and sprang hissing into the air some one hundred fifty feet So unless this reef was subject to the intermittent eruptions of a geyser the Governor Higginson had fair and honest dealings with some aquatic mammal until then unknown that could spurt from its blowholes waterspouts mixed with air and steam Similar events were likewise observed in Pacific seas on July twenty three of the same year by the Christopher Columbus from the West India Pacific Steam Navigation company Consequently this extraordinary cetacean could transfer itself from one locality to another with startling swiftness since within an interval of just three days the Governor Higginson and the Christopher Columbus had observed it at two positions on the charts separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues Fifteen days later and two thousand leagues farther the Helvetia from the Compagnie Nationale and the Shannon from the Royal Mail line running on opposite tacks in that part of the Atlantic lying between the United States and Europe respectively signaled each other that the monster had been sighted in latitude forty two degrees fifteen north and longitude sixty degrees thirty five west of the meridian of Greenwich From their simultaneous observations they were able to estimate the mammal s minimum length at more than three hundred fifty English feet this was because both the Shannon and the Helvetia were of smaller dimensions although each measured one hundred meters stem to stern Now then the biggest whales those rorqual whales that frequent the waterways of the Aleutian Islands have never exceeded a length of fifty six meters if they reach even that Author s Note About one hundred six meters An English foot is only thirty point four centimeters One after another reports arrived that would profoundly affect public opinion new observations taken by the transatlantic liner Pereire the Inman line s Etna running afoul of the monster an official report drawn up by officers on the French frigate Normandy dead earnest reckonings obtained by the general staff of Commodore Fitz James aboard the Lord Clyde In lighthearted countries people joked about this phenomenon but such serious practical countries as England America and Germany were deeply concerned In every big city the monster was the latest rage they sang about it in the coffee houses they ridiculed it in the newspapers they dramatized it in the theaters The tabloids found it a

none	none	have been forgotten like so many others if three weeks later it hadn t been reenacted under identical conditions Only thanks to the nationality of the ship victimized by this new ramming and thanks to the reputation of the company to which this ship belonged the event caused an immense uproar No one is unaware of the name of that famous English shipowner Cunard In eighteen forty this shrewd industrialist founded a postal service between Liverpool and Halifax featuring three wooden ships with four hundred horsepower paddle wheels and a burden of eleven sixty two metric tons Eight years later the company s assets were increased by four six hundred fifty horsepower ships at eighteen twenty metric tons and in two more years by two other vessels of still greater power and tonnage In eighteen fifty three the Cunard company whose mail carrying charter had just been renewed successively added to its assets the Arabia the Persia the China the Scotia the Java and the Russia all ships of top speed and after the Great Eastern the biggest ever to plow the seas So in eighteen sixty seven this company owned twelve ships eight with paddle wheels and four with propellers If I give these highly condensed details it is so everyone can fully understand the importance of this maritime transportation company known the world over for its shrewd management No transoceanic navigational undertaking has been conducted with more ability no business dealings have been crowned with greater success In twenty six years Cunard ships have made two thousand Atlantic crossings without so much as a voyage canceled a delay recorded a man a craft or even a letter lost Accordingly despite strong competition from France passengers still choose the Cunard line in preference to all others as can be seen in a recent survey of official documents Given this no one will be astonished at the uproar provoked by this accident involving one of its finest steamers On April thirteen eighteen sixty seven with a smooth sea and a moderate breeze the Scotia lay in longitude fifteen degrees twelve and latitude forty five degrees thirty seven It was traveling at a speed of thirteen point forty three knots under the thrust of its one thousand horsepower engines Its paddle wheels were churning the sea with perfect steadiness It was then drawing six point seven meters of water and displacing six thousand six hundred twenty four cubic meters At four seventeen in the afternoon during a high tea for passengers gathered in the main lounge a collision occurred scarcely noticeable on the whole affecting the Scotia s hull in that quarter a little astern of its port paddle wheel The Scotia hadn t run afoul of something it had been fouled and by a cutting or perforating instrument rather than a blunt one This encounter seemed so minor that nobody on board would have been disturbed by it had it not been for the shouts of crewmen in the hold who climbed on deck yelling We re sinking We re sinking At first the passengers were quite frightened

none	none	Anderson hastened to reassure them In fact there could be no immediate danger Divided into seven compartments by watertight bulkheads the Scotia could brave any leak with impunity Captain Anderson immediately made his way into the hold He discovered that the fifth compartment had been invaded by the sea and the speed of this invasion proved that the leak was considerable Fortunately this compartment didn t contain the boilers because their furnaces would have been abruptly extinguished Captain Anderson called an immediate halt and one of his sailors dived down to assess the damage Within moments they had located a hole two meters in width on the steamer s underside Such a leak could not be patched and with its paddle wheels half swamped the Scotia had no choice but to continue its voyage By then it lay three hundred miles from Cape Clear and after three days of delay that filled Liverpool with acute anxiety it entered the company docks The engineers then proceeded to inspect the Scotia which had been put in dry dock They couldn t believe their eyes Two and a half meters below its waterline there gaped a symmetrical gash in the shape of an isosceles triangle This breach in the sheet iron was so perfectly formed no punch could have done a cleaner job of it Consequently it must have been produced by a perforating tool of uncommon toughness plus after being launched with prodigious power and then piercing four centimeters of sheet iron this tool had needed to withdraw itself by a backward motion truly inexplicable This was the last straw and it resulted in arousing public passions all over again Indeed from this moment on any maritime casualty without an established cause was charged to the monster s account This outrageous animal had to shoulder responsibility for all derelict vessels whose numbers are unfortunately considerable since out of those three thousand ships whose losses are recorded annually at the marine insurance bureau the figure for steam or sailing ships supposedly lost with all hands in the absence of any news amounts to at least two hundred Now then justly or unjustly it was the monster who stood accused of their disappearance and since thanks to it travel between the various continents had become more and more dangerous the public spoke up and demanded straight out that at all cost the seas be purged of this fearsome cetacean

none	none	 The Pros and Cons DURING THE PERIOD in which these developments were occurring I had returned from a scientific undertaking organized to explore the Nebraska badlands in the United States In my capacity as Assistant Professor at the Paris Museum of Natural History I had been attached to this expedition by the French government After spending six months in Nebraska I arrived in New York laden with valuable collections near the end of March My departure for France was set for early May In the meantime then I was busy classifying my mineralogical botanical and zoological treasures when that incident took place with the Scotia I was perfectly abreast of this question which was the big news of the day and how could I not have been I had read and reread every American and European newspaper without being any farther along This mystery puzzled me Finding it impossible to form any views I drifted from one extreme to the other Something was out there that much was certain and any doubting Thomas was invited to place his finger on the Scotia s wound When I arrived in New York the question was at the boiling point The hypothesis of a drifting islet or an elusive reef put forward by people not quite in their right minds was completely eliminated And indeed unless this reef had an engine in its belly how could it move about with such prodigious speed Also discredited was the idea of a floating hull or some other enormous wreckage and again because of this speed of movement So only two possible solutions to the question were left creating two very distinct groups of supporters on one side those favoring a monster of colossal strength on the other those favoring an underwater boat of tremendous motor power Now then although the latter hypothesis was completely admissible it couldn t stand up to inquiries conducted in both the New World and the Old That a private individual had such a mechanism at his disposal was less than probable

none	none	and when had he built it and how could he have built it in secret Only some government could own such an engine of destruction and in these disaster filled times when men tax their ingenuity to build increasingly powerful aggressive weapons it was possible that unknown to the rest of the world some nation could have been testing such a fearsome machine The Chassepot rifle led to the torpedo and the torpedo has led to this underwater battering ram which in turn will lead to the world putting its foot down At least I hope it will But this hypothesis of a war machine collapsed in the face of formal denials from the various governments Since the public interest was at stake and transoceanic travel was suffering the sincerity of these governments could not be doubted Besides how could the assembly of this underwater boat have escaped public notice Keeping a secret under such circumstances would be difficult 
836_130900_000049_000002	train-clean-360	enough 
none	none	for an individual and certainly impossible for a nation whose every move is under constant surveillance by rival powers So after inquiries conducted in England France Russia Prussia Spain Italy America and even Turkey the hypothesis of an underwater Monitor was ultimately rejected And so the monster surfaced again despite the endless witticisms heaped on it by the popular press and the human imagination soon got caught up in the most ridiculous ichthyological fantasies After I arrived in New York several people did me the honor of consulting me on the phenomenon in question In France I had published a two volume work in quarto entitled The Mysteries of the Great Ocean Depths Well received in scholarly circles this book had established me as a specialist in this pretty obscure field of natural history My views were in demand As long as I could deny the reality of the business I confined myself to a flat no comment But soon pinned to the wall I had to explain myself straight out And in this vein the honorable

none	none	 Professor at the Paris Museum was summoned by The New York Herald to formulate his views no matter what I complied Since I could no longer hold my tongue I let it wag I discussed the question in its every aspect both political and scientific and this is an excerpt from the well padded article I published in the issue of April thirty Therefore I wrote after examining these different hypotheses one by one we are forced every other supposition having been refuted to accept the existence of an extremely powerful marine animal The deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us No soundings have been able to reach them What goes on in those distant depths What creatures inhabit or could inhabit those regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water What is the constitution of these animals It s almost beyond conjecture However the solution to this problem submitted to me can take the form of a choice between two alternatives Either we know every variety of creature populating our planet or we do not If we do not know every one of them if nature still keeps ichthyological secrets from us nothing is more admissible than to accept the existence of fish or cetaceans of new species or even new genera animals with a basically cast iron constitution that inhabit strata beyond the reach of our soundings and which some development or other an urge or a whim if you prefer can bring to the upper level of the ocean for long intervals If on the other hand we do know every living species we must look for the animal in question among those marine creatures already cataloged and in this event I would be inclined to accept the existence of a giant narwhale The common narwhale or sea unicorn often reaches a length of sixty feet Increase its dimensions fivefold or even tenfold then give this cetacean a strength in proportion to its size while enlarging its offensive weapons and you have the animal we re looking for It would have the proportions determined by the officers of the Shannon the instrument needed to perforate the Scotia and the power to pierce a steamer s hull In essence the narwhale is armed with a sort of ivory sword or lance as certain naturalists have expressed it It s a king sized tooth as hard as steel Some of these teeth have been found buried in the bodies of baleen whales which the narwhale attacks with invariable success Others have been wrenched not without difficulty from the undersides of vessels that narwhales have pierced clean through as a gimlet pierces a wine barrel The museum at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris owns one of these tusks with a length of two point twenty five meters and a width at its base of forty eight centimeters All right then Imagine this weapon to be ten times stronger and the animal ten times more powerful launch it at a speed of twenty miles per hour multiply its mass times its velocity and you get just the collision we need to cause the specified catastrophe So until information becomes more abundant I plump for a sea unicorn of colossal dimensions no longer armed with a mere lance but with an actual spur like ironclad frigates or those warships called rams whose mass and motor power it would possess simultaneously This inexplicable phenomenon is thus explained away unless it s something else entirely which despite everything that has been sighted studied explored and experienced is still possible These last words were cowardly of me but as far as I could I wanted to protect my professorial dignity and not lay myself open to laughter from the Americans who when they do laugh laugh raucously I had left myself a loophole Yet deep down I had accepted the existence of the monster My article was hotly debated causing a fine old uproar It rallied a number of supporters Moreover the solution it proposed allowed for free play of the imagination The human mind enjoys impressive visions of unearthly creatures Now then the sea is precisely their best medium the only setting suitable for the breeding and growing of such giants next to which such land animals as elephants or rhinoceroses are mere dwarves The liquid masses support the largest known species of mammals and perhaps conceal mollusks of incomparable size or crustaceans too frightful to contemplate such as one hundred meter lobsters or crabs weighing two hundred metric tons Why not Formerly in prehistoric days land animals quadrupeds apes reptiles birds were built on a gigantic scale Our Creator cast them using a colossal mold that time has gradually made smaller With its untold depths couldn t the sea keep alive such huge specimens of life from another age this sea that never changes while the land masses undergo almost continuous alteration Couldn t the heart of the ocean hide the last remaining varieties of these titanic species for whom years are centuries and centuries millennia But I mustn t let these fantasies run away with me Enough of these fairy tales that time has changed for me into harsh realities I repeat opinion had crystallized as to the nature of this phenomenon and the public accepted without argument the existence of a prodigious creature that had nothing in common with the fabled sea serpent Yet if some saw it purely as a scientific problem to be solved more practical people especially in America and England were determined to purge the ocean of this daunting monster to insure the safety of transoceanic travel The industrial and commercial newspapers dealt with the question chiefly from this viewpoint The Shipping Mercantile Gazette the Lloyd s List France s Packetboat and Maritime Colonial Review all the rags devoted to insurance companies who threatened to raise their premium rates were unanimous on this point Public opinion being pronounced the States of the Union were the first in the field In New York preparations were under way for an expedition designed to chase this narwhale A high speed frigate the Abraham Lincoln was fitted out for putting to sea as soon as possible The naval arsenals were unlocked for Commander Farragut who pressed energetically forward with the arming of his frigate But as it always happens just when a decision had been made to chase the monster the monster put in no further appearances For two months nobody heard a word about it Not a single ship encountered it Apparently the unicorn had gotten wise to these plots being woven around it People were constantly babbling about the creature even via the Atlantic Cable Accordingly the wags claimed that this slippery rascal had waylaid some passing telegram and was making the most of it So the frigate was equipped for a far off voyage and armed with fearsome fishing gear but 
6233_36633_000058_000002	train-clean-360	nobody knew 
none	none	where to steer it And impatience grew until on June two word came that the Tampico a steamer on the San Francisco line sailing from California to Shanghai had sighted the animal again three weeks before in the northerly seas of the Pacific This news caused intense excitement Not even a twenty four hour breather was granted to Commander Farragut His provisions were loaded on board His coal bunkers were overflowing Not a crewman was missing from his post To cast off he needed only to fire and stoke his furnaces Half a day s delay would have been unforgivable But Commander Farragut wanted nothing more than to go forth I received a letter three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left its Brooklyn pier the letter read as follows Author s Note A pier is a type of wharf expressly set aside for an individual vessel Pierre Aronnax Professor at the Paris Museum Fifth Avenue Hotel New York Sir If you would like to join the expedition on the Abraham Lincoln the government of the Union will be pleased to regard you as France s representative in this undertaking Commander Farragut has a cabin at your disposal Very cordially yours J B HOBSON Secretary of the Navy CHAPTER three As Master Wishes THREE SECONDS before the arrival of J B Hobson s letter I no more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the Northwest Passage Three seconds after reading this letter from the honorable Secretary of the Navy I understood at last that my true vocation my sole purpose in life was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid the world of it Even so I had just returned from an arduous journey exhausted and badly needing a rest I wanted nothing more than to see my country again my friends my modest quarters by the Botanical Gardens my dearly beloved collections But now nothing could hold me back I forgot everything else and without another thought of exhaustion friends or collections I accepted the American government s offer Besides I mused all roads lead home to Europe and our unicorn may be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of France That fine animal may even let itself be captured in European seas as a personal favor to me and I ll bring back to the Museum of Natural History at least half a meter of its ivory lance But in the meantime I would have to look for this narwhale in the northern Pacific Ocean which meant returning to France by way of the Antipodes Conseil I called in an impatient voice Conseil was my manservant A devoted lad who went with me on all my journeys a gallant Flemish boy whom I genuinely liked and who returned the compliment a born stoic punctilious on principle habitually hardworking rarely startled by life s surprises very skillful with his hands efficient in his every duty and despite his having a name that means counsel never giving advice not even the unsolicited kind From rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the Botanical Gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two In Conseil I had a seasoned specialist in biological classification an enthusiast who could run with acrobatic agility up and down the whole ladder of branches groups classes subclasses orders families genera subgenera species and varieties But there his science came to a halt Classifying was everything to him so he knew nothing else Well versed in the theory of classification he was poorly versed in its practical application and I doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a baleen whale 
836_130900_000029_000004	train-clean-360	And yet 
none	none	what a fine gallant lad For the past ten years Conseil had gone with me wherever science beckoned Not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of a journey Never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever China or the Congo no matter how far off it was He went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment Moreover he enjoyed excellent health that defied all ailments owned solid muscles but hadn t a nerve in him not a sign of nerves the mental type I mean The lad was thirty years old and his age to that of his employer was as fifteen is to twenty Please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting I had turned forty But Conseil had one flaw He was a fanatic on formality and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where it got tiresome Conseil I repeated while feverishly beginning my preparations for departure To be sure I had confidence in this devoted lad Ordinarily I never asked whether or not it suited him to go with me on my journeys but this time an expedition was at issue that could drag on indefinitely a hazardous undertaking whose purpose was to hunt an animal that could sink a frigate as easily as a walnut shell There was good reason to stop and think even for the world s most emotionless man What would Conseil say Conseil I called a third time Conseil appeared Did master summon me he said entering

none	none	Get my things ready get yours ready We re departing in two hours As master wishes Conseil replied serenely We haven t a moment to lose Pack as much into my trunk as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks don t bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurry What about master s collections Conseil ventured to observe We ll deal with them later What The archaeotherium hyracotherium oreodonts cheiropotamus and master s other fossil skeletons The hotel will keep them for us What about master s live babirusa They ll feed it during our absence Anyhow we ll leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to France Then we aren t returning to Paris Conseil asked Yes we are certainly I replied evasively but after we make a detour Whatever detour master wishes Oh it s nothing really A route slightly less direct that s all We re leaving on the Abraham Lincoln As master thinks best Conseil replied placidly You see my friend it s an issue of the monster the notorious narwhale We re going to rid the seas of it The author of a two volume work in quarto on The Mysteries of the Great Ocean Depths has no excuse for not setting sail with Commander Farragut It s a glorious mission but also a dangerous one We don t know where it will take us These beasts can be quite unpredictable But we re going just the same We have a commander who s game for anything What master does I ll do Conseil replied But think it over because I don t want to hide anything from you This is one of those voyages from which people don t always come back As master wishes A quarter of an hour later our trunks were ready Conseil did them in a flash and I was sure the lad hadn t missed a thing because he classified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals The hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the mezzanine I went down a short stair leading to the ground floor I settled my bill at that huge counter that was always under siege by a considerable crowd I left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris France I opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the babirusa and Conseil at my heels I jumped into a carriage For a fare of twenty francs the vehicle went down Broadway to Union Square took Fourth Ave to its junction with Bowery saint turned into Katrin saint and halted at Pier thirty four There the Katrin ferry transferred men horses and carriage to Brooklyn that great New York annex located on the left bank of the East River and in a few minutes we arrived at the wharf next to which the Abraham Lincoln was vomiting torrents of black smoke from its two funnels Our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate I rushed aboard I asked for Commander Farragut One of the sailors led me to the afterdeck where I stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me Professor Pierre Aronnax he said to me The same I replied Commander Farragut In person Welcome aboard professor Your cabin is waiting for you I bowed and letting the commander attend to getting under way I was taken to the cabin that had been set aside for me The Abraham Lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out for its new assignment It was a high speed frigate furnished with superheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam to build to seven atmospheres Under this pressure the Abraham Lincoln reached an average speed of eighteen point three miles per hour a considerable speed but still not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean The frigate s interior accommodations complemented its nautical virtues I was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officers mess We ll be quite comfortable here I told Conseil With all due respect to master Conseil replied as comfortable as a hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk I left Conseil to the proper stowing of our luggage and climbed on deck to watch the preparations for getting under way Just then Commander Farragut was giving orders to cast off the last moorings holding the Abraham Lincoln to its Brooklyn pier And so if I d been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and I would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism But Commander Farragut didn t want to waste a single day or even a single hour in making for those seas where the animal had just been sighted He summoned his engineer Are we up to pressure he asked the man Aye sir the engineer replied Go ahead then Commander Farragut called At this order which was relayed to the engine by means of a compressed air device the mechanics activated the start up wheel Steam rushed whistling into the gaping valves Long horizontal pistons groaned and pushed the tie rods of the drive shaft The blades of the propeller churned the waves with increasing speed and the Abraham Lincoln moved out majestically amid a spectator laden escort of some one hundred ferries and tenders Author s Note Tenders are small steamboats that assist the big liners The wharves of Brooklyn and every part of New York bordering the East River were crowded with curiosity seekers Departing from

none	none	throats three cheers burst forth in succession Thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the Abraham Lincoln until it reached the waters of the Hudson River at the tip of the long peninsula that forms New York City The frigate then went along the New Jersey coast the wonderful right bank of this river all loaded down with country homes and passed by the forts to salutes from their biggest cannons The Abraham Lincoln replied by three times lowering and hoisting the American flag whose thirty nine stars gleamed from the gaff of the mizzen sail then changing speed to take the buoy marked channel that curved into the inner bay formed by the spit of Sandy Hook it hugged this sand covered strip of land where thousands of spectators acclaimed us one more time The escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only left us when we came abreast of the lightship whose two signal lights mark the entrance of the narrows to Upper New York Bay Three o clock then sounded The harbor pilot went down into his dinghy and rejoined a little schooner waiting for him to leeward The furnaces were stoked the propeller churned the waves more swiftly the frigate skirted the flat yellow coast of Long Island and at eight o clock in the evening after the lights of Fire Island had vanished into the northwest we ran at full steam onto the dark waters of the Atlantic CHAPTER four Ned Land COMMANDER FARRAGUT was a good seaman worthy of the frigate he commanded His ship and he were one He was its very soul On the cetacean question no doubts arose in his mind and he didn t allow the animal s existence to be disputed aboard his vessel He believed in it as certain pious women believe in the leviathan from the Book of Job out of faith not reason The monster existed and he had vowed to rid the seas of it The man was a sort of Knight of Rhodes a latter day Sir Dieudonne of Gozo on his way to fight an encounter with the dragon devastating the island Either Commander Farragut would slay the narwhale or the narwhale would slay Commander Farragut No middle of the road for these two The ship s officers shared the views of their leader They could be heard chatting discussing arguing calculating the different chances of an encounter and observing the vast expanse of the ocean Voluntary watches from the crosstrees of the topgallant sail were self imposed by more than one who would have cursed such toil under any other circumstances As often as the sun swept over its daily arc the masts were populated with sailors whose feet itched and couldn t hold still on the planking of the deck below And the Abraham Lincoln s stempost hadn t even cut the suspected waters of the Pacific As for the crew they only wanted to encounter the unicorn harpoon it haul it on board and carve it up They surveyed the sea with scrupulous care Besides Commander Farragut had mentioned that a certain sum of two thousand dollars was waiting for the man who first sighted the animal be he cabin boy or sailor mate or officer I ll let the reader decide whether eyes got proper exercise aboard the Abraham Lincoln As for me I didn t lag behind the others and I yielded to no one my share in these daily observations Our frigate would have had fivescore good reasons for renaming itself the Argus after that mythological beast with one hundred eyes The lone rebel among us was Conseil who seemed utterly uninterested in the question exciting us and was out of step with the general enthusiasm on board As I said Commander Farragut had carefully equipped his ship with all the gear needed to fish for a gigantic cetacean No whaling vessel could have been better armed We had every known mechanism from the hand hurled harpoon to the blunderbuss firing barbed arrows to the duck gun with exploding bullets On the forecastle was mounted the latest model breech loading cannon very heavy of barrel and narrow of bore a weapon that would figure in the Universal Exhibition of eighteen sixty seven Made in America this valuable instrument could fire a four kilogram conical projectile an average distance of sixteen kilometers without the least bother So the Abraham Lincoln wasn t lacking in means of destruction But it had better still It had Ned Land the King of Harpooners Gifted with uncommon manual ability Ned Land was a Canadian who had no equal in his dangerous trade Dexterity coolness bravery and cunning were virtues he possessed to a high degree and it took a truly crafty baleen whale or an exceptionally astute sperm whale to elude the thrusts of his harpoon Ned Land was about forty years old A man of great height over six English feet he was powerfully built serious in manner not very sociable sometimes headstrong and quite ill tempered when crossed His looks caught the attention and above all the strength of his gaze which gave a unique emphasis to his facial appearance Commander Farragut to my thinking had made a wise move in hiring on this man With his eye and his throwing arm he was worth the whole crew all by himself I can do no better than to compare him with a powerful telescope that could double as a cannon always ready to fire To say Canadian is to say French and as unsociable as Ned Land was I must admit he took a definite liking to me No doubt it was my nationality that attracted him It was an opportunity for him to speak and for me to hear that old Rabelaisian dialect still used in some Canadian provinces The harpooner s family originated in Quebec and they were already a line of bold fishermen back in the days when this town still belonged to France Little by little Ned developed a taste for chatting and I loved hearing the tales of his adventures in the polar seas He described his fishing trips and his battles with great natural lyricism His tales took on the form of an epic poem and I felt I was hearing some Canadian Homer reciting his Iliad of the High Arctic regions I m writing of this bold companion as I currently know him Because we ve become old friends united in that permanent comradeship born and cemented during only the most frightful crises Ah my gallant Ned I ask only to live one hundred years more the longer to remember you And now what were Ned Land s views on this question of a marine monster I must admit that he flatly didn t believe in the unicorn and alone on board he didn t share the general conviction He avoided even dealing with the subject for which one day I felt compelled to take him to task During the magnificent evening of June twenty five in other words three weeks after our departure the frigate lay abreast of Cabo Blanco thirty miles to leeward of the coast of Patagonia We had crossed the Tropic of Capricorn and the Strait of Magellan opened less than seven hundred miles to the south Before eight days were out the Abraham Lincoln would plow the waves of the Pacific Seated on the afterdeck Ned Land and I chatted about one thing and another staring at that mysterious sea whose depths to this day are beyond the reach of human eyes Quite naturally I led our conversation around to the giant unicorn and I weighed our expedition s various chances for success or failure Then seeing that Ned just let me talk without saying much himself I pressed him more closely Ned I asked him how can you still doubt the reality of this cetacean we re after Do you have any particular reasons for being so skeptical The harpooner stared at me awhile before replying slapped his broad forehead in one of his standard gestures closed his eyes as if to collect himself and finally said Just maybe Professor Aronnax But Ned you re a professional whaler a man familiar with all the great marine mammals your mind should easily accept this hypothesis of an enormous cetacean and you ought to be the last one to doubt it under these circumstances That s just where you re mistaken professor Ned replied The common man may still believe in fabulous comets crossing outer space or in prehistoric monsters living at the earth s core but astronomers and geologists don t swallow such fairy tales It s the same with whalers I ve chased plenty of cetaceans I ve harpooned a good number I ve killed several But no matter how powerful and well armed they were neither their tails or their tusks could puncture the sheet iron plates of a steamer Even so Ned people mention vessels that narwhale tusks have run clean through Wooden ships maybe the Canadian replied But I ve never seen the like So till I have proof to the contrary I ll deny that baleen whales sperm whales or unicorns can do any such thing Listen to me Ned No no professor I ll go along with anything you want except that Some gigantic devilfish maybe Even less likely Ned The devilfish is merely a mollusk and even this name hints at its semiliquid flesh because it s Latin meaning soft one The devilfish doesn t belong to the vertebrate branch and even if it were five hundred feet long it would still be utterly harmless to ships like the Scotia or the Abraham Lincoln Consequently the feats of krakens or other monsters of that ilk must be relegated to the realm of fiction So mister Naturalist Ned Land continued in a bantering tone you ll just keep on believing in the existence of some enormous cetacean Yes Ned I repeat it with a conviction backed by factual logic I believe in the existence of a mammal with a powerful constitution belonging to the vertebrate branch like baleen whales sperm whales or dolphins and armed with a tusk made of horn that has tremendous penetrating power Humph the harpooner put in shaking his head with the attitude of a man who doesn t want to be convinced Note well my fine Canadian I went on if such an animal exists if it lives deep in the ocean if it frequents the liquid strata located miles beneath the surface of the water it needs to have a constitution so solid it defies all comparison And why this powerful constitution Ned asked Because it takes incalculable strength just to live in those deep strata and withstand their pressure Oh really Ned said tipping me a wink Oh really and I can prove it to you with a few simple figures Bosh Ned replied You can make figures do anything you want In business Ned but not in mathematics Listen to me Let s accept that the pressure of one atmosphere is represented by the pressure of a column of water thirty two feet high In reality such a column of water wouldn t be quite so high because here we re dealing with salt water which is denser than fresh water Well then when you dive under the waves Ned for every thirty two feet of water above you your body is tolerating the pressure of one more atmosphere in other words one more kilogram per each square centimeter on your body s surface So it follows that at three hundred twenty feet down this pressure is equal to ten atmospheres to one hundred atmospheres at three thousand two hundred feet and to one thousand atmospheres at thirty two thousand feet that is at about two and a half vertical leagues down Which is tantamount to saying that if you could reach such a depth in the ocean each square centimeter on your body s surface would be experiencing one thousand kilograms of pressure Now my gallant Ned do you know how many square centimeters you have on your bodily surface I haven t the foggiest notion Professor Aronnax About seventeen thousand As many as that Yes and since the atmosphere s pressure actually weighs slightly more than one kilogram per square centimeter your seventeen thousand square centimeters are tolerating seventeen thousand five hundred sixty eight kilograms at this very moment Without my noticing it Without your noticing it And if you aren t crushed by so much pressure it s because the air penetrates the interior of your body with equal pressure When the inside and outside pressures are in perfect balance they neutralize each other and allow you to tolerate them without discomfort But
229_130880_000111_000000	train-clean-100	 in the water 
none	none	it s another story Yes I see Ned replied growing more interested Because the water surrounds me but doesn t penetrate me Precisely Ned So at thirty two feet beneath the surface of the sea you ll undergo a pressure of seventeen thousand five hundred sixty eight kilograms at three hundred twenty feet or ten times greater pressure it s one hundred seventy five thousand six hundred eighty kilograms at three thousand two hundred feet or one hundred times greater pressure it s one million seven hundred fifty six thousand eight hundred kilograms finally at thirty two thousand feet or one thousand times greater pressure it s seventeen million five hundred sixty eight thousand kilograms in other words you d be squashed as flat as if you d just been yanked from between the plates of a hydraulic press Fire and brimstone Ned put in All right then my fine harpooner if vertebrates several hundred meters long and proportionate in bulk live at such depths their surface areas make up millions of square centimeters and the pressure they undergo must be assessed in billions of kilograms Calculate then how much resistance of bone structure and strength of constitution they d need in order to withstand such pressures They d need to be manufactured Ned Land replied from sheet iron plates eight inches thick like ironclad frigates Right Ned and then picture the damage such a mass could inflict if it were launched with the speed of an express train against a ship s hull Yes indeed maybe the Canadian replied staggered by these figures but still not willing to give in Well have I convinced you You ve convinced me of one thing mister Naturalist That deep in the sea such animals would need to be just as strong as you say if they exist But if they don t exist my stubborn harpooner how do you explain the accident that happened to the Scotia It s maybe Ned said hesitating Go on Because it just couldn t be true the Canadian replied unconsciously echoing a famous catchphrase of the scientist Arago But this reply proved nothing other than how bullheaded the harpooner could be That day I pressed him no further The Scotia s accident was undeniable Its hole was real enough that it had to be plugged up and I don t think a hole s existence can be more emphatically proven Now then this hole didn t make itself and since it hadn t resulted from underwater rocks or underwater machines it must have been caused by the perforating tool of some animal Now for all the reasons put forward to this point I believed that this animal was a member of the branch Vertebrata class Mammalia group Pisciforma and finally order Cetacea As for the family in which it would be placed baleen whale sperm whale or dolphin the genus to which it belonged and the species in which it would find its proper home these questions had to be left for later To answer them called for dissecting this unknown monster to dissect it called for catching it to catch it called for harpooning it which was Ned Land s business to harpoon it called for sighting it which was the crew s business and to sight it called for encountering it which was a chancy business CHAPTER five At Random FOR SOME WHILE the voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was marked by no incident But one circumstance arose that displayed Ned Land s marvelous skills and showed just how much confidence we could place in him Off the Falkland Islands on June thirty the frigate came in contact with a fleet of American whalers and we learned that they hadn t seen the narwhale But one of them the captain of the Monroe knew that Ned Land had shipped aboard the Abraham Lincoln and asked his help in hunting a baleen whale that was in sight Anxious to see Ned Land at work Commander Farragut authorized him to make his way aboard the Monroe And the Canadian had such good luck that with a right and left shot he harpooned not one whale but two striking the first straight to the heart and catching the other after a few minutes chase Assuredly if the monster ever had to deal with Ned Land s harpoon I wouldn t bet on the monster The frigate sailed along the east coast of South America with prodigious speed By July three we were at the entrance to the Strait of Magellan abreast of Cabo de las Virgenes But Commander Farragut was unwilling to attempt this tortuous passageway and maneuvered instead to double Cape Horn The crew sided with him unanimously Indeed were we likely to encounter the narwhale in such a cramped strait Many of our sailors swore that the monster couldn t negotiate this passageway simply because he s too big for it Near three o clock in the afternoon on July six fifteen miles south of shore the Abraham Lincoln doubled that solitary islet at the tip of the South American continent that stray rock Dutch seamen had named Cape Horn after their hometown of Hoorn Our course was set for the northwest and the next day our frigate s propeller finally churned the waters of the Pacific Open your eyes Open your eyes repeated the sailors of the Abraham Lincoln And they opened amazingly wide Eyes and spyglasses a bit dazzled it is true by the vista of two thousand dollars didn t remain at rest for an instant Day and night we observed the surface of the ocean and those with nyctalopic eyes whose ability to see in the dark increased their chances by fifty percent had an excellent shot at winning the prize As for me I was hardly drawn by the lure of money and yet was far from the least attentive on board Snatching only a few minutes for meals and a few hours for sleep come rain or come shine I no longer left the ship s deck Sometimes bending over the forecastle railings sometimes leaning against the sternrail I eagerly scoured that cotton colored wake that whitened the ocean as far as the eye could see And how many times I shared the excitement of general staff and crew when some unpredictable whale lifted its blackish back above the waves In an instant the frigate s deck would become densely populated The cowls over the companionways would vomit a torrent of sailors and officers With panting chests and anxious eyes we each would observe the cetacean s movements I stared I stared until I nearly went blind from a worn out retina while Conseil as stoic as ever kept repeating to me in a calm tone If master s eyes would kindly stop bulging master will see farther But what a waste of energy The Abraham Lincoln would change course and race after the animal sighted only to find an ordinary baleen whale or a common sperm whale that soon disappeared amid a chorus of curses However the weather held good Our voyage was proceeding under the most favorable conditions By then it was the bad season in these southernmost regions because July in this zone corresponds to our January in Europe but the sea remained smooth and easily visible over a vast perimeter Ned Land still kept up the most tenacious skepticism beyond his spells on watch he pretended that he never even looked at the surface of the waves at least while no whales were in sight And yet the marvelous power of his vision could have performed yeoman service But this stubborn Canadian spent eight hours out of every twelve reading or sleeping in his cabin A hundred times I chided him for his unconcern

none	none	he replied Nothing s out there Professor Aronnax and if there is some animal what chance would we have of spotting it Can t you see we re just wandering around at random People say they ve sighted this slippery beast again in the Pacific high seas I m truly willing to believe it but two months have already gone by since then and judging by your narwhale s personality it hates growing moldy from hanging out too long in the same waterways It s blessed with a terrific gift for getting around Now professor you know even better than I that nature doesn t violate good sense and she wouldn t give some naturally slow animal the ability to move swiftly if it hadn t a need to use that talent So if the beast does exist it s already long gone I had no reply to this Obviously we were just groping blindly But how else could we go about it All the same our chances were automatically pretty limited Yet everyone still felt confident of success and not a sailor on board would have bet against the narwhale appearing and soon On July twenty we cut the Tropic of Capricorn at longitude one hundred five degrees and by the twenty seventh of the same month we had cleared the equator on the one hundred and tenth meridian These bearings determined the frigate took a more decisive westward heading and tackled the seas of the central Pacific Commander Farragut felt and with good reason that it was best to stay in deep waters and keep his distance from continents or islands whose neighborhoods the animal always seemed to avoid No doubt our bosun said because there isn t enough water for him So the frigate kept well out when passing the Tuamotu Marquesas and Hawaiian Islands then cut the Tropic of Cancer at longitude one hundred thirty two degrees and headed for the seas of China We were finally in the area of the monster s latest antics And in all honesty shipboard conditions became life threatening Hearts were pounding hideously gearing up for futures full of incurable aneurysms The entire crew suffered from a nervous excitement that it s beyond me to describe Nobody ate nobody slept Twenty times a day some error in perception or the optical illusions of some sailor perched in the crosstrees would cause intolerable anguish and this emotion repeated twenty times over kept us in a state of irritability so intense that a reaction was bound to follow And this reaction wasn t long in coming For three months during which each day seemed like a century the Abraham Lincoln plowed all the northerly seas of the Pacific racing after whales sighted abruptly veering off course swerving sharply from one tack to another stopping suddenly putting on steam and reversing engines in quick succession at the risk of stripping its gears and it didn t leave a single point unexplored from the beaches of Japan to the coasts of America And we found nothing Nothing except an immenseness of deserted waves Nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhale or an underwater islet or a derelict shipwreck or a runaway reef or anything the least bit unearthly So the reaction set in At first discouragement took hold of people s minds opening the door to disbelief A new feeling appeared on board made up of three tenths shame and seven tenths fury The crew called themselves out and out fools for being hoodwinked by a fairy tale then grew steadily more furious The mountains of arguments amassed over a year collapsed all at once and each man now wanted only to catch up on his eating and sleeping to make up for the time he had so stupidly sacrificed With typical human fickleness they jumped from one extreme to the other Inevitably the most enthusiastic supporters of the undertaking became its most energetic opponents This reaction mounted upward from the bowels of the ship from the quarters of the bunker hands to the messroom of the general staff and for certain if it hadn t been for Commander Farragut s characteristic stubbornness the frigate would ultimately have put back to that cape in the south But this futile search couldn t drag on much longer The Abraham Lincoln had done everything it could to succeed and had no reason to blame itself Never had the crew of an American naval craft shown more patience and zeal they weren t responsible for this failure there was nothing to do but go home A request to this effect was presented to the commander The commander stood his ground His sailors couldn t hide their discontent and their work suffered because of it I m unwilling to say that there was mutiny on board but after a reasonable period of intransigence Commander Farragut like Christopher Columbus before him asked for a grace period of just three days more After this three day delay if the monster hadn t appeared our helmsman would give three turns of the wheel and the Abraham Lincoln would chart a course toward European seas This promise was given on November two It had the immediate effect of reviving the crew s failing spirits The ocean was observed with renewed care Each man wanted one last look with which to sum up his experience Spyglasses functioned with feverish energy A supreme challenge had been issued to the giant narwhale and the latter had no acceptable excuse for ignoring this Summons to Appear Two days passed The Abraham Lincoln stayed at half steam On the offchance that the animal might be found in these waterways a thousand methods were used to spark its interest or rouse it from its apathy Enormous sides of bacon were trailed in our wake to the great satisfaction I must say of assorted sharks While the Abraham Lincoln heaved to its longboats radiated in every direction around it and didn t leave a single point of the sea unexplored But the evening of November four arrived with this underwater mystery still unsolved At noon the next day November five the agreed upon delay expired After a position fix true to his promise Commander Farragut would have to set his course for the southeast and leave the northerly regions of the Pacific decisively behind By then the frigate lay in latitude thirty one degrees fifteen north and longitude one hundred thirty six degrees forty two east The shores of Japan were less than two hundred miles to our leeward Night was coming on Eight o clock had just struck Huge clouds covered the moon s disk then in its first quarter The sea undulated placidly beneath the frigate s stempost Just then I was in the bow leaning over the starboard rail Conseil stationed beside me stared straight ahead Roosting in the shrouds the crew examined the horizon which shrank and darkened little by little Officers were probing the increasing gloom with their night glasses Sometimes the murky ocean sparkled beneath moonbeams that darted between the fringes of two clouds Then all traces of light vanished into the darkness Observing Conseil I discovered that just barely the gallant lad had fallen under the general influence At least so I thought Perhaps his nerves were twitching with curiosity for the first time in history Come on Conseil I told him Here s your last chance to pocket that two thousand dollars If master will permit my saying so Conseil replied I never expected to win that prize and the Union government could have promised one hundred thousand dollars and been none the poorer You re right Conseil it turned out to be a foolish business after all and we jumped into it too hastily What a waste of time what a futile expense of emotion Six months ago we could have been back in France In master s little apartment Conseil answered In master s museum And by now I would have classified master s fossils And master s babirusa would be ensconced in its cage at the zoo in the Botanical Gardens and it would have attracted every curiosity seeker in town Quite so Conseil and what s more I imagine that people will soon be poking fun at us To be sure Conseil replied serenely I do think they ll have fun at master s expense And must it be said It must be said Conseil Well then it will serve master right How true When one has the honor of being an expert as master is one mustn t lay himself open to Conseil didn t have time to complete the compliment In the midst of the general silence a voice became audible It was Ned Land s voice and it shouted Ahoy There s the thing in question abreast of us to leeward CHAPTER six At Full Steam AT THIS SHOUT the entire crew rushed toward the harpooner commander officers mates sailors cabin boys down to engineers leaving their machinery and stokers neglecting their furnaces The order was given to stop and the frigate merely coasted By then the darkness was profound and as good as the Canadian s eyes were I still wondered how he could see and what he had seen My heart was pounding fit to burst But Ned Land was not mistaken and we all spotted the object his hand was indicating Two cable lengths off the Abraham Lincoln s starboard quarter the sea seemed to be lit up from underneath This was no mere phosphorescent phenomenon that much was unmistakable Submerged some fathoms below the surface of the water the monster gave off that very intense but inexplicable glow that several captains had mentioned in their reports This magnificent radiance had to come from some force with a great illuminating capacity The edge of its light swept over the sea in an immense highly elongated oval condensing at the center into a blazing core whose unbearable glow diminished by degrees outward It s only a cluster of phosphorescent particles exclaimed one of the officers No sir I answered with conviction Not even angel wing clams or salps have ever given off such a powerful light That glow is basically electric in nature Besides look look It s shifting It s moving back and forth It s darting at us A universal shout went up from the frigate Quiet Commander Farragut said Helm hard to leeward Reverse engines Sailors rushed to the helm engineers to their machinery Under reverse steam immediately the Abraham Lincoln beat to port sweeping in a semicircle Right your helm Engines forward Commander Farragut called These orders were executed and the frigate swiftly retreated from this core of light My mistake It wanted to retreat but the unearthly animal came at us with a speed double our own We gasped More stunned than afraid we stood mute and motionless The animal caught up with us played with us It made a full circle around the frigate then doing fourteen knots and wrapped us in sheets of electricity that were like luminous dust Then it retreated two or three miles leaving a phosphorescent trail comparable to those swirls of steam that shoot behind the locomotive of an express train Suddenly all the way from the dark horizon where it had gone to gather momentum the monster abruptly dashed toward the Abraham Lincoln with frightening speed stopped sharply twenty feet from our side plates and died out not by diving under the water since its glow did not recede gradually but all at once as if the source of this brilliant emanation had suddenly dried up Then it reappeared on the other side of the ship either by circling around us or by gliding under our hull At any instant a collision could have occurred that would have been fatal to us Meanwhile I was astonished at the frigate s maneuvers It was fleeing not fighting Built to pursue it was being pursued and I commented on this to Commander Farragut His face ordinarily so emotionless was stamped with indescribable astonishment Professor Aronnax he answered me I don t know what kind of fearsome creature I m up against and I don t want my frigate running foolish risks in all this darkness Besides how should we attack this unknown creature how should we defend ourselves against it Let s wait for daylight and then we ll play a different role You ve no further doubts commander as to the nature of this animal No sir it s apparently a gigantic narwhale and an electric one to boot Maybe I added it s no more approachable than an electric eel or an electric ray Right the commander replied And if it has their power to electrocute it s surely the most dreadful animal ever conceived by our Creator That s why I ll keep on my guard sir The whole crew stayed on their feet all night long No one even thought of sleeping Unable to compete with the monster s speed the Abraham Lincoln slowed down and stayed at half steam For its part the narwhale mimicked the frigate simply rode with the waves and seemed determined not to forsake the field of battle However near midnight it disappeared or to use a more appropriate expression it went out like a huge glowworm Had it fled from us We were duty bound to fear so rather than hope so But at twelve fifty three in the morning a deafening hiss became audible resembling the sound made by a waterspout expelled with tremendous intensity By then Commander Farragut Ned Land and I were on the afterdeck peering eagerly into the profound gloom Ned Land the commander asked you ve often heard whales bellowing Often sir but never a whale like this whose sighting earned me two thousand dollars Correct the prize is rightfully yours But tell me isn t that the noise cetaceans make when they spurt water from their blowholes The very noise sir but this one s way louder So there can be no mistake There s definitely a whale lurking in our waters With your permission sir the harpooner added tomorrow at daybreak we ll have words with it If it s in a mood to listen to you mister Land I replied in a tone far from convinced Let me get within four harpoon lengths of it the Canadian shot back and it had better listen But to get near it the commander went on I d have to put a whaleboat at your disposal Certainly sir That would be gambling with the lives of my men And with my own the harpooner replied simply Near two o clock in the morning the core of light reappeared no less intense five miles to windward of the Abraham Lincoln Despite the distance despite the noise of wind and sea we could distinctly hear the fearsome thrashings of the animal s tail and even its panting breath Seemingly the moment this enormous narwhale came up to breathe at the surface of the ocean air was sucked into its lungs like steam into the huge cylinders of a two thousand horsepower engine Hmm I said to myself A cetacean as powerful as a whole cavalry regiment now that s a whale of a whale We stayed on the alert until daylight getting ready for action Whaling gear was set up along the railings Our chief officer loaded the blunderbusses which can launch harpoons as far as a mile and long duck guns with exploding bullets that can mortally wound even the most powerful animals Ned Land was content to sharpen his harpoon a dreadful weapon in his hands At six o clock day began to break and with the dawn s early light the narwhale s electric glow disappeared At seven o clock the day was well along but a very dense morning mist shrank the horizon and our best spyglasses were unable to pierce it The outcome disappointment and anger I hoisted myself up to the crosstrees of the mizzen sail Some officers were already perched on the mastheads At eight o clock the mist rolled ponderously over the waves and its huge curls were lifting little by little The horizon grew wider and clearer all at once Suddenly just as on the previous evening Ned Land s voice was audible There s the thing in question astern to port the harpooner shouted Every eye looked toward the point indicated There a mile and a half from the frigate a long blackish body emerged a meter above the waves Quivering violently its tail was creating a considerable eddy Never had caudal equipment thrashed the sea with such power An immense wake of glowing whiteness marked the animal s track sweeping in a long curve Our frigate drew nearer to the cetacean I examined it with a completely open mind Those reports from the Shannon and the Helvetia had slightly exaggerated its dimensions and I put its length at only two hundred fifty feet Its girth was more difficult to judge but all in all the animal seemed to be wonderfully proportioned in all three dimensions While I was observing this phenomenal creature two jets of steam and water sprang from its blowholes and rose to an altitude of forty meters which settled for me its mode of breathing From this I finally concluded that it belonged to the branch Vertebrata class Mammalia subclass Monodelphia group Pisciforma order Cetacea family but here I couldn t make up my mind The order Cetacea consists of three families baleen whales sperm whales dolphins and it s in this last group that narwhales are placed Each of these families is divided into several genera each genus into species each species into varieties So I was still missing variety species genus and family but no doubt I would complete my classifying with the aid of Heaven and Commander Farragut The crew were waiting impatiently for orders from their leader The latter after carefully observing the animal called for his engineer The engineer raced over Sir the commander said are you up to pressure Aye sir the engineer replied Fine Stoke your furnaces and clap on full steam Three cheers greeted this order The hour of battle had sounded A few moments later the frigate s two funnels vomited torrents of black smoke and its deck quaked from the trembling of its boilers Driven forward by its powerful propeller the Abraham Lincoln headed straight for the animal Unconcerned the latter let us come within half a cable length then not bothering to dive it got up a little speed retreated and was content to keep its distance This chase dragged on for about three quarters of an hour without the frigate gaining two fathoms on the cetacean At this rate it was obvious that we would never catch up with it Infuriated Commander Farragut kept twisting the thick tuft of hair that flourished below his chin Ned Land he called The Canadian reported at once Well mister Land the commander asked do you still advise putting my longboats to sea No sir Ned Land replied because that beast won t be caught against its will Then what should we do Stoke up more steam sir if you can As for me with your permission I ll go perch on the bobstays under the bowsprit and if we can get within a harpoon length I ll harpoon the brute Go to it Ned Commander Farragut replied Engineer he called keep the pressure mounting Ned Land made his way to his post The furnaces were urged into greater activity our propeller did forty three revolutions per minute and steam shot from the valves Heaving the log we verified that the Abraham Lincoln was going at the rate of eighteen point five miles per hour But that damned animal also did a speed of eighteen point five For the next hour our frigate kept up this pace without gaining a fathom This was humiliating for one of the fastest racers in the American navy The crew were working up into a blind rage Sailor after sailor heaved insults at the monster which couldn t be bothered with answering back Commander Farragut was no longer content simply to twist his goatee he chewed on it The engineer was summoned once again You re up to maximum pressure the commander asked him Aye sir the engineer replied And your valves are charged to To six and a half atmospheres Charge them to ten atmospheres A typical American order if I ever heard one It would have sounded just fine during some Mississippi paddle wheeler race to outstrip the competition Conseil I said to my gallant servant now at my side you realize that we ll probably blow ourselves skyhigh As master wishes Conseil replied All right I admit it I did wish to run this risk The valves were charged More coal was swallowed by the furnaces Ventilators shot torrents of air over the braziers The Abraham Lincoln s speed increased Its masts trembled down to their blocks and swirls of smoke could barely squeeze through the narrow funnels We heaved the log a second time Well helmsman Commander Farragut asked nineteen point three miles per hour sir Keep stoking the furnaces The engineer did so The pressure gauge marked ten atmospheres But no doubt the cetacean itself had warmed up because without the least trouble it also did nineteen point three What a chase No I can t describe the excitement that shook my very being Ned Land stayed at his post harpoon in hand Several times the animal let us approach We re overhauling it the Canadian would shout Then just as he was about to strike the cetacean would steal off with a swiftness I could estimate at no less than thirty miles per hour And even at our maximum speed it took the liberty of thumbing its nose at the frigate by running a full circle around us A howl of fury burst from every throat By noon we were no farther along than at eight o clock in the morning Commander Farragut then decided to use more direct methods Bah he said So that animal is faster than the Abraham Lincoln All right we ll see if it can outrun our conical shells Mate man the gun in the bow Our forecastle cannon was immediately loaded and leveled The cannoneer fired a shot but his shell passed some feet above the cetacean which stayed half a mile off Over to somebody with better aim the commander shouted And five hundred dollars to the man who can pierce that infernal beast Calm of eye cool of feature an old gray bearded gunner I can see him to this day approached the cannon put it in position and took aim for a good while There was a mighty explosion mingled with cheers from the crew The shell reached its target it hit the animal but not in the usual fashion it bounced off that rounded surface and vanished into the sea two miles out Oh drat said the old gunner in his anger That rascal must be covered with six inch armor plate Curse the beast Commander Farragut shouted The hunt was on again and Commander Farragut leaned over to me saying I ll chase that animal till my frigate explodes Yes I replied and nobody would blame you We could still hope that the animal would tire out and not be as insensitive to exhaustion as our steam engines But no such luck Hour after hour went by without it showing the least sign of weariness However to the Abraham Lincoln s credit it must be said that we struggled on with tireless persistence I estimate that we covered a distance of at least five hundred kilometers during this ill fated day of November six But 
6235_36641_000008_000000	train-clean-360	night fell 
none	none	and wrapped the surging ocean in its shadows By then I thought our expedition had come to an end that we would never see this fantastic animal again 
6235_36641_000052_000001	train-clean-360	I was mistaken 
none	none	At ten fifty in the evening that electric light reappeared three miles to windward of the frigate just as clear and intense as the night before The narwhale seemed motionless Was it asleep perhaps weary from its workday just riding with the waves This was our chance and Commander Farragut was determined to take full advantage of it He gave his orders The Abraham Lincoln stayed at half steam advancing cautiously so as not to awaken its adversary In midocean it s not unusual to encounter whales so sound asleep they can successfully be attacked and Ned Land had harpooned more than one in its slumber The Canadian went to resume his post on the bobstays under the bowsprit The frigate approached without making a sound stopped two cable lengths from the animal and coasted Not a soul breathed on board A profound silence reigned over the deck We were not one hundred feet from the blazing core of light whose glow grew stronger and dazzled the eyes Just then leaning over the forecastle railing I saw Ned Land below me one hand grasping the martingale the other brandishing his dreadful harpoon Barely twenty feet separated him from the motionless animal All at once his arm shot forward and the harpoon was launched I heard the weapon collide resonantly as if it had hit some hard substance The electric light suddenly went out and two enormous waterspouts crashed onto the deck of the frigate racing like a torrent from stem to stern toppling crewmen breaking spare masts and yardarms from their lashings A hideous collision occurred and thrown over the rail with no time to catch hold of it I was hurled into the sea CHAPTER seven A Whale of Unknown Species ALTHOUGH I WAS startled by this unexpected descent I at least have a very clear recollection of my sensations during it At first I was dragged about twenty feet under I m a good swimmer without claiming to equal such other authors as Byron and Edgar Allan Poe who were master divers and I didn t lose my head on the way down With two vigorous kicks of the heel I came back to the surface of the sea My first concern was to look for the frigate Had the crew seen me go overboard Was the Abraham Lincoln tacking about Would Commander Farragut put a longboat to sea Could I hope to be rescued The gloom was profound I glimpsed a black mass disappearing eastward where its running lights were fading out in the distance It was the frigate I felt I was done for Help Help I shouted swimming desperately toward the Abraham Lincoln My clothes were weighing me down The water glued them to my body they were paralyzing my movements I was sinking I was suffocating Help This was the last shout I gave My mouth was filling with water I struggled against being dragged into the depths Suddenly my clothes were seized by energetic hands I felt myself pulled abruptly back to the surface of the sea and yes I heard these words pronounced in my ear If master would oblige me by leaning on my shoulder master will swim with much greater ease With one hand I seized the arm of my loyal Conseil You I said You Myself Conseil replied and at master s command That collision threw you overboard along with me Not at all But being in master s employ I followed master The fine lad thought this only natural What about the frigate I asked The frigate Conseil replied rolling over on his back I think master had best not depend on it to any great extent What are you saying I m saying that just as I jumped overboard I heard the men at the helm shout Our propeller and rudder are smashed Smashed Yes smashed by the monster s tusk I believe it s the sole injury the Abraham Lincoln has sustained But most inconveniently for us the ship can no longer steer Then we re done for Perhaps Conseil replied serenely However we still have a few hours before us and in a few hours one can do a great many things Conseil s unflappable composure cheered me up I swam more vigorously but hampered by clothes that were as restricting as a cloak made of lead I was managing with only the greatest difficulty Conseil noticed as much Master will allow me to make an incision he said And he slipped an open clasp knife under my clothes slitting them from top to bottom with one swift stroke Then he briskly undressed me while I swam for us both I then did Conseil the same favor and we continued to navigate side by side But our circumstances were no less dreadful Perhaps they hadn t seen us go overboard and even if they had the frigate being undone by its rudder couldn t return to leeward after us So we could count only on its longboats Conseil had coolly reasoned out this hypothesis and laid his plans accordingly An amazing character this boy in midocean this stoic lad seemed right at home So having concluded that our sole chance for salvation lay in being picked up by the Abraham Lincoln s longboats we had to take steps to wait for them as long as possible Consequently I decided to divide our energies so we wouldn t both be worn out at the same time and this was the arrangement while one of us lay on his back staying motionless with arms crossed and legs outstretched the other would swim and propel his partner forward This towing role was to last no longer than ten minutes and by relieving each other in this way we could stay afloat for hours perhaps even until daybreak Slim chance but hope springs eternal in the human breast Besides there were two of us Lastly I can vouch as improbable as it seems that even if I had wanted to destroy all my illusions even if I had been willing to give in to despair I could not have done so The cetacean had rammed our frigate at about eleven o clock in the evening I therefore calculated on eight hours of swimming until sunrise A strenuous task but feasible thanks to our relieving each other The sea was pretty smooth and barely tired us Sometimes I tried to peer through the dense gloom which was broken only by the phosphorescent flickers coming from our movements I stared at the luminous ripples breaking over my hands shimmering sheets spattered with blotches of bluish gray It seemed as if we d plunged into a pool of quicksilver Near one o clock in the morning I was overcome with tremendous exhaustion My limbs stiffened in the grip of intense cramps Conseil had to keep me going and attending to our self preservation became his sole responsibility I soon heard the poor lad gasping his breathing became shallow and quick I didn t think he could stand such exertions for much longer Go on Go on I told him Leave master behind he replied Never I ll drown before he does Just then past the fringes of a large cloud that the wind was driving eastward the moon appeared The surface of the sea glistened under its rays That kindly light rekindled our strength I held up my head again My eyes darted to every point of the horizon I spotted the frigate It was five miles from us and formed no more than a dark barely perceptible mass But as for longboats not a one in sight I tried to call out What was the use at such a distance My swollen lips wouldn t let a single sound through Conseil could still articulate a few words and I heard him repeat at intervals Help Help Ceasing all movement for an instant we listened And it may have been a ringing in my ear from this organ filling with impeded blood but it seemed to me that Conseil s shout had received an answer back Did you hear that I muttered Yes yes And Conseil hurled another desperate plea into space This time there could be no mistake A human voice had answered us Was it the voice of some poor devil left behind in midocean some other victim of that collision suffered by our ship Or was it one of the frigate s longboats hailing us out of the gloom Conseil made one final effort and bracing his hands on my shoulders while I offered resistance with one supreme exertion he raised himself half out of the water then fell back exhausted What did you see I saw he muttered I saw but we mustn t talk save our strength What had he seen Then lord knows why the thought of the monster came into my head for the first time But even so that voice Gone are the days when Jonahs took refuge in the bellies of whales Nevertheless Conseil kept towing me Sometimes he looked up stared straight ahead and shouted a request for directions which was answered by a voice that was getting closer and closer I could barely hear it I was at the end of my strength my fingers gave out my hands were no help to me my mouth opened convulsively filling with brine its coldness ran through me I raised my head one last time then I collapsed Just then something hard banged against me I clung to it Then I felt myself being pulled upward back to the surface of the water my chest caved in and I fainted For certain I came to quickly because someone was massaging me so vigorously it left furrows in my flesh I half opened my eyes Conseil I muttered Did master ring for me Conseil replied Just then in the last light of a moon settling on the horizon I spotted a face that wasn t Conseil s but which I recognized at once Ned I exclaimed In person sir and still after his prize the Canadian replied You were thrown overboard after the frigate s collision Yes professor but I was luckier than you and right away I was able to set foot on this floating islet Islet Or in other words on our gigantic narwhale Explain yourself Ned It s just that I soon realized why my harpoon got blunted and couldn t puncture its hide Why Ned why Because professor this beast is made of boilerplate steel At this point in my story I need to get a grip on myself reconstruct
229_130880_000092_000000	train-clean-100	 exactly 
none	none	what I experienced and make doubly sure of everything I write The Canadian s last words caused a sudden upheaval in my brain I swiftly hoisted myself to the summit of this half submerged creature or object that was serving as our refuge I tested it with my foot Obviously it was some hard impenetrable substance not the soft matter that makes up the bodies of our big marine mammals But this hard substance could have been a bony carapace like those that covered some prehistoric animals and I might have left it at that and classified this monster among such amphibious reptiles as turtles or alligators Well no The blackish back supporting me was smooth and polished with no overlapping scales On impact it gave off a metallic sonority and as incredible as this sounds it seemed I swear to be made of riveted plates No doubts were possible This animal this monster this natural phenomenon that had puzzled the whole scientific world that had muddled and misled the minds of seamen in both hemispheres was there could be no escaping it an even more astonishing phenomenon a phenomenon made by the hand of man Even if I had discovered that some fabulous mythological creature really existed it wouldn t have given me such a terrific mental jolt It s easy enough to accept that prodigious things can come from our Creator But to find all at once right before your eyes that the impossible had been mysteriously achieved by man himself this staggers the mind But there was no question now We were stretched out on the back of some kind of underwater boat that as far as I could judge boasted the shape of an immense steel fish Ned Land had clear views on the issue Conseil and I could only line up behind him But then I said does this contraption contain some sort of locomotive mechanism and a crew to run it Apparently the harpooner replied And yet for the three hours I ve lived on this floating island it hasn t shown a sign of life This boat hasn t moved at all No Professor Aronnax It just rides with the waves but otherwise it hasn t stirred But we know that it s certainly gifted with great speed Now then since an engine is needed to generate that speed and a mechanic to run that engine I conclude we re saved Humph Ned Land put in his tone denoting reservations Just then as if to take my side in the argument a bubbling began astern of this strange submersible whose drive mechanism was obviously a propeller and the boat started to move We barely had time to hang on to its topside which emerged about eighty centimeters above water Fortunately its speed was not excessive So long as it navigates horizontally Ned Land muttered I ve no complaints But if it gets the urge to dive I wouldn t give two dollars for my hide The Canadian might have quoted a much lower price So it was imperative to make contact with whatever beings were confined inside the plating of this machine I searched its surface for an opening or a hatch a manhole to use the official term but the lines of rivets had been firmly driven into the sheet iron joins and were straight and uniform Moreover the moon then disappeared and left us in profound darkness We had to wait for daylight to find some way of getting inside this underwater boat So our salvation lay totally in the hands of the mysterious helmsmen steering this submersible and if it made a dive we were done for But aside from this occurring I didn t doubt the possibility of our making contact with them In fact if they didn t produce their own air they inevitably had to make periodic visits to the surface of the ocean to replenish their oxygen supply Hence the need for some opening that put the boat s interior in contact with the atmosphere As for any hope of being rescued by Commander Farragut that had to be renounced completely We were being swept westward and I estimate that our comparatively moderate speed reached twelve miles per hour The propeller churned the waves with mathematical regularity sometimes emerging above the surface and throwing phosphorescent spray to great heights Near four o clock in the morning the submersible picked up speed We could barely cope with this dizzying rush and the waves battered us at close range Fortunately Ned s hands came across a big mooring ring fastened to the topside of this sheet iron back and we all held on for dear life Finally this long night was over My imperfect memories won t let me recall my every impression of it A single detail comes back to me Several times during various lulls of wind and sea I thought I heard indistinct sounds a sort of elusive harmony produced by distant musical chords What was the secret behind this underwater navigating whose explanation the whole world had sought in vain What beings lived inside this strange boat What mechanical force allowed it to move about with such prodigious speed Daylight appeared The morning mists surrounded us but they soon broke up I was about to proceed with a careful examination of the hull whose topside formed a sort of horizontal platform when I felt it sinking little by little Oh damnation Ned Land shouted stamping his foot on the resonant sheet iron Open up there you antisocial navigators But it was difficult to make yourself heard above the deafening beats of the propeller Fortunately this submerging movement stopped From inside the boat there suddenly came noises of iron fastenings pushed roughly aside One of the steel plates flew up a man appeared gave a bizarre yell and instantly disappeared A few moments later eight strapping fellows appeared silently their faces like masks and dragged us down into their fearsome machine CHAPTER eight Mobilis in Mobili THIS BRUTALLY EXECUTED capture was carried out with lightning speed My companions and I had no time to collect ourselves I don t know how they felt about being shoved inside this aquatic prison but as for me I was shivering all over With whom were we dealing Surely with some new breed of pirates exploiting the sea after their own fashion The narrow hatch had barely closed over me when I was surrounded by profound darkness Saturated with the outside light my eyes couldn t make out a thing I felt my naked feet clinging to the steps of an iron ladder Forcibly seized Ned Land and Conseil were behind me At the foot of the ladder a door opened and instantly closed behind us with a loud clang We were alone Where I couldn t say could barely even imagine All was darkness but such utter darkness that after several minutes my eyes were still unable to catch a single one of those hazy gleams that drift through even the blackest nights Meanwhile furious at these goings on Ned Land gave free rein to his indignation

none	none	of New Caledonia All that s lacking is for them to be cannibals I wouldn t be surprised if they were but believe you me they won t eat me without my kicking up a protest Calm yourself Ned my friend Conseil replied serenely Don t flare up so quickly We aren t in a kettle yet In a kettle no the Canadian shot back but in an oven for sure It s dark enough for one Luckily my Bowie knife hasn t left me and I can still see well enough to put it to use The first one of these bandits who lays a hand on me Author s Note A Bowie knife is a wide bladed dagger that Americans are forever carrying around Don t be so irritable Ned I then told the harpooner and don t ruin things for us with pointless violence Who knows whether they might be listening to us Instead let s try to find out where we are I started moving groping my way After five steps I encountered an iron wall made of riveted boilerplate Then turning around I bumped into a wooden table next to which several stools had been set The floor of this prison lay hidden beneath thick hempen matting that deadened the sound of footsteps Its naked walls didn t reveal any trace of a door or window Going around the opposite way Conseil met up with me and we returned to the middle of this cabin which had to be twenty feet long by ten wide As for its height not even Ned Land with his great stature was able to determine it Half an hour had already gone by without our situation changing when our eyes were suddenly spirited from utter darkness into blinding light Our prison lit up all at once in other words it filled with luminescent matter so intense that at first I couldn t stand the brightness of it From its glare and whiteness I recognized the electric glow that had played around this underwater boat like some magnificent phosphorescent phenomenon After involuntarily closing my eyes I reopened them and saw that this luminous force came from a frosted half globe curving out of the cabin s ceiling Finally It s light enough to see Ned Land exclaimed knife in hand staying on the defensive Yes I replied then ventured the opposite view But as for our situation we re still in the dark Master must learn patience said the emotionless Conseil This sudden illumination of our cabin enabled me to examine its tiniest details It contained only a table and five stools Its invisible door must have been hermetically sealed Not a sound reached our ears Everything seemed dead inside this boat Was it in motion or stationary on the surface of the ocean or sinking into the depths I couldn t tell But this luminous globe hadn t been turned on without good reason Consequently I hoped that some crewmen would soon make an appearance If you want to consign people to oblivion you don t light up their dungeons I was not mistaken Unlocking noises became audible a door opened and two men appeared One was short and stocky powerfully muscled broad shouldered robust of limbs the head squat the hair black and luxuriant the mustache heavy the eyes bright and penetrating and his whole personality stamped with that southern blooded zest that in France typifies the people of Provence The philosopher Diderot has very aptly claimed that a man s bearing is the clue to his character and this stocky little man was certainly a living proof of this claim You could sense that his everyday conversation must have been packed with such vivid figures of speech as personification symbolism and misplaced modifiers But I was never in a position to verify this because around me he used only an odd and utterly incomprehensible dialect The second stranger deserves a more detailed description A disciple of such character judging anatomists as Gratiolet or Engel could have read this man s features like an open book Without hesitation I identified his dominant qualities self confidence since his head reared like a nobleman s above the arc formed by the lines of his shoulders and his black eyes gazed with icy assurance calmness since his skin pale rather than ruddy indicated tranquility of blood energy shown by the swiftly knitting muscles of his brow and finally courage since his deep breathing denoted tremendous reserves of vitality I might add that this was a man of great pride that his calm firm gaze seemed to reflect thinking on an elevated plane and that the harmony of his facial expressions and bodily movements resulted in an overall effect of unquestionable candor according to the findings of physiognomists those analysts of facial character I felt involuntarily reassured in his presence and this boded well for our interview Whether this individual was thirty five or fifty years of age I could not precisely state He was tall his forehead broad his nose straight his mouth clearly etched his teeth magnificent his hands refined tapered and to use a word from palmistry highly psychic in other words worthy of serving a lofty and passionate spirit This man was certainly the most wonderful physical specimen I had ever encountered One unusual detail his eyes were spaced a little far from each other and could instantly take in nearly a quarter of the horizon This ability as I later verified was strengthened by a range of vision even greater than Ned Land s When this stranger focused his gaze on an object his eyebrow lines gathered into a frown his heavy eyelids closed around his pupils to contract his huge field of vision and he looked What a look as if he could magnify objects shrinking into the distance as if he could probe your very soul as if he could pierce those sheets of water so opaque to our eyes and scan the deepest seas Wearing caps made of sea otter fur and shod in sealskin fishing boots these two strangers were dressed in clothing made from some unique fabric that flattered the figure and allowed great freedom of movement The taller of the two apparently the leader on board examined us with the greatest care but without pronouncing a word Then turning to his companion he conversed with him in a language I didn t recognize It was a sonorous harmonious flexible dialect whose vowels seemed to undergo a highly varied accentuation The other replied with a shake of the head and added two or three utterly incomprehensible words Then he seemed to question me directly with a long stare I replied in clear French that I wasn t familiar with his language but he didn t seem to understand me and the situation grew rather baffling Still master should tell our story Conseil said to me Perhaps these gentlemen will grasp a few words of it I tried again telling the tale of our adventures clearly articulating my every syllable and not leaving out a single detail I stated our names and titles then in order I introduced Professor Aronnax his manservant Conseil and mister Ned Land harpooner The man with calm gentle eyes listened to me serenely even courteously and paid remarkable attention But nothing in his facial expression indicated that he understood my story When I finished he didn t pronounce a single word One resource still left was to speak English Perhaps they would be familiar with this nearly universal language But I only knew it as I did the German language well enough to read it fluently not well enough to speak it correctly Here however our overriding need was to make ourselves understood Come on it s your turn I told the harpooner Over to you mister Land Pull out of your bag of tricks the best English ever spoken by an Anglo Saxon and try for a more favorable result than mine Ned needed no persuading and started our story all over again most of which I could follow Its content was the same but the form differed Carried away by his volatile temperament the Canadian put great animation into it He complained vehemently about being imprisoned in defiance of his civil rights asked by virtue of which law he was hereby detained invoked writs of habeas corpus threatened to press charges against anyone holding him in illegal custody ranted gesticulated shouted and finally conveyed by an expressive gesture that we were dying of hunger This was perfectly true but we had nearly forgotten the fact Much to his amazement the harpooner seemed no more intelligible than I had been Our visitors didn t bat an eye Apparently they were engineers who understood the languages of neither the French physicist Arago nor the English physicist Faraday Thoroughly baffled after vainly exhausting our philological resources I no longer knew what tactic to pursue when Conseil told me If master will authorize me I ll tell the whole business in German What You know German I exclaimed Like most Flemish people with all due respect to master On the contrary my respect is due you Go to it my boy And Conseil in his serene voice described for the third time the various vicissitudes of our story But despite our narrator s fine accent and stylish turns of phrase the German language met with no success Finally as a last resort I hauled out everything I could remember from my early schooldays and I tried to narrate our adventures in Latin Cicero would have plugged his ears and sent me to the scullery but somehow I managed to pull through With the same negative result This last attempt ultimately misfiring the two strangers exchanged a few words in their incomprehensible language and withdrew not even favoring us with one of those encouraging gestures that are used in every country in the world The door closed again This is outrageous Ned Land shouted exploding for the twentieth time I ask you We speak French English German and Latin to these rogues and neither of them has the decency to even answer back Calm down Ned I told the seething harpooner Anger won t get us anywhere But professor our irascible companion went on can t you see that we could die of hunger in this iron cage Bah Conseil put in philosophically We can hold out a good while yet My friends I said we mustn t despair We ve gotten out of tighter spots So please do me the favor of waiting a bit before you form your views on the commander and crew of this boat My views are fully formed Ned Land shot back They re rogues Oh good And from what country Roguedom My gallant Ned as yet that country isn t clearly marked on maps of the world but I admit that the nationality of these two strangers is hard to make out Neither English French nor German that s all we can say But I m tempted to think that the commander and his chief officer were born in the low latitudes There must be southern blood in them But as to whether they re Spaniards Turks Arabs or East Indians their physical characteristics don t give me enough to go on And as for their speech it s utterly incomprehensible That s the nuisance in not knowing every language Conseil replied or the drawback in not having one universal language Which would all go out the window Ned Land replied Don t you see these people have a language all to themselves a language they ve invented just to cause despair in decent people who ask for a little dinner Why in every country on earth when you open your mouth snap your jaws smack your lips and teeth isn t that the world s most understandable message From Quebec to the Tuamotu Islands from Paris to the Antipodes doesn t it mean I m hungry give me a bite to eat Oh Conseil put in there are some people so unintelligent by nature As he was saying these words the door opened A steward entered He brought us some clothes jackets and sailor s pants made out of a fabric whose nature I didn t recognize I hurried to change into them and my companions followed suit Author s Note A steward is a waiter on board a steamer Meanwhile our silent steward perhaps a deaf mute set the table and laid three place settings There s something serious afoot Conseil said and it bodes well Bah replied the rancorous harpooner What the devil do you suppose they eat around here Turtle livers loin of shark dogfish steaks We ll soon find out Conseil said Overlaid with silver dish covers various platters had been neatly positioned on the table cloth and we sat down to eat Assuredly we were dealing with civilized people and if it hadn t been for this electric light flooding over us I would have thought we were in the dining room of the Hotel Adelphi in Liverpool or the Grand Hotel in Paris However I feel compelled to mention that bread and wine were totally absent The water was fresh and clear but it was still water which wasn t what Ned Land had in mind Among the foods we were served I was able to identify various daintily dressed fish but I couldn t make up my mind about certain otherwise excellent dishes and I couldn t even tell whether their contents belonged to the vegetable or the animal kingdom As for the tableware it was elegant and in perfect taste Each utensil spoon fork knife and plate bore on its reverse a letter encircled by a Latin motto and here is its exact duplicate MOBILIS IN MOBILI N Moving within the moving element It was a highly appropriate motto for this underwater machine so long as the preposition in is translated as within and not upon The letter N was no doubt the initial of the name of that mystifying individual in command beneath the seas Ned and Conseil had no time for such musings They were wolfing down their food and without further ado I did the same By now I felt reassured about our fate and it seemed obvious that our hosts didn t intend to let us die of starvation But all earthly things come to an end all things must pass even the hunger of people who haven t eaten for fifteen hours Our appetites appeased we felt an urgent need for sleep A natural reaction after that interminable night of fighting for our lives Ye gods I ll sleep soundly Conseil said Me I m out like a light Ned Land replied My two companions lay down on the cabin s carpeting and were soon deep in slumber As for me I gave in less readily to this intense need for sleep Too many thoughts had piled up in my mind too many insoluble questions had arisen too many images were keeping my eyelids open Where were we What strange power was carrying us along I felt or at least I thought I did the submersible sinking toward the sea s lower strata Intense nightmares besieged me In these mysterious marine sanctuaries I envisioned hosts of unknown animals and this underwater boat seemed to be a blood relation of theirs living breathing just as fearsome Then my mind grew calmer my imagination melted into hazy drowsiness and I soon fell into an uneasy slumber CHAPTER nine The Tantrums of Ned Land I HAVE NO IDEA how long this slumber lasted but it must have been a good while since we were completely over our exhaustion I was the first one to wake up My companions weren t yet stirring and still lay in their corners like inanimate objects I had barely gotten up from my passably hard mattress when I felt my mind clear my brain go on the alert So I began a careful reexamination of our cell Nothing had changed in its interior arrangements The prison was still a prison and its prisoners still prisoners But taking advantage of our slumber the steward had cleared the table Consequently nothing indicated any forthcoming improvement in our situation and I seriously wondered if we were doomed to spend the rest of our lives in this cage This prospect seemed increasingly painful to me because even though my brain was clear of its obsessions from the night before I was feeling an odd short windedness in my chest It was becoming hard for me to breathe The heavy air was no longer sufficient for the full play of my lungs Although our cell was large we obviously had used up most of the oxygen it contained In essence over an hour s time a single human being consumes all the oxygen found in one hundred liters of air at which point that air has become charged with a nearly equal amount of carbon dioxide and is no longer fit for breathing So it was now urgent to renew the air in our prison and no doubt the air in this whole underwater boat as well Here a question popped into my head How did the commander of this aquatic residence go about it Did he obtain air using chemical methods releasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by heating it meanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium hydroxide If so he would have to keep up some kind of relationship with the shore to come by the materials needed for such an operation Did he simply limit himself to storing the air in high pressure tanks and then dispense it according to his crew s needs Perhaps Or proceeding in a more convenient more economical and consequently more probable fashion was he satisfied with merely returning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean renewing his oxygen supply every twenty four hours In any event whatever his method was it seemed prudent to me that he use this method without delay In fact I had already resorted to speeding up my inhalations in order to extract from the cell what little oxygen it contained when suddenly I was refreshed by a current of clean air scented with a salty aroma It had to be a sea breeze life giving and charged with iodine I opened my mouth wide and my lungs glutted themselves on the fresh particles At the same time I felt a swaying a rolling of moderate magnitude but definitely noticeable This boat this sheet iron monster had obviously just risen to the surface of the ocean there to breathe in good whale fashion So the ship s mode of ventilation was finally established When I had absorbed a chestful of this clean air I looked for the conduit the air carrier if you prefer that allowed this beneficial influx to reach us and I soon found it Above the door opened an air vent that let in a fresh current of oxygen renewing the thin air in our cell I had gotten to this point in my observations when Ned and Conseil woke up almost simultaneously under the influence of this reviving air purification They rubbed their eyes stretched their arms and sprang to their feet Did master sleep well Conseil asked me with his perennial good manners Extremely well my gallant lad I replied And how about you mister Ned Land Like a log professor But I must be imagining things because it seems like I m breathing a sea breeze A seaman couldn t be wrong on this topic and I told the Canadian what had gone on while he slept Good he said That explains perfectly all that bellowing we heard when our so called narwhale lay in sight of the Abraham Lincoln Perfectly mister Land It was catching its breath Only I ve no idea what time it is Professor Aronnax unless maybe it s dinnertime Dinnertime my fine harpooner I d say at least breakfast time because we ve certainly woken up to a new day Which indicates Conseil replied that we ve spent twenty four hours in slumber That s my assessment I replied I won t argue with you Ned Land answered But dinner or breakfast that steward will be plenty welcome whether he brings the one or the other The one and the other Conseil said Well put the Canadian replied We deserve two meals and speaking for myself I ll do justice to them both All right Ned let s wait and see I replied It s clear that these strangers don t intend to let us die of hunger otherwise last evening s dinner wouldn t make any sense Unless they re fattening us up Ned shot back I object I replied We have not fallen into the hands of cannibals Just because they don t make a habit of it the Canadian replied in all seriousness doesn t mean they don t indulge from time to time Who knows Maybe these people have gone without fresh meat for a long while and in that case three healthy well built specimens like the professor his manservant and me Get rid of those ideas mister Land I answered the harpooner And above all don t let them lead you to flare up against our hosts which would only make our situation worse Anyhow the harpooner said I m as hungry as all Hades and dinner or breakfast not one puny meal has arrived mister Land I answered we have to adapt to the schedule on board and I imagine our stomachs are running ahead of the chief cook s dinner bell Well then we ll adjust our stomachs to the chef s timetable Conseil replied serenely There you go again Conseil my friend the impatient Canadian shot back You never allow yourself any displays of bile or attacks of nerves You re everlastingly calm You d say your after meal grace even if you didn t get any food for your before meal blessing and you d starve to death rather than complain What good would it do Conseil asked Complaining doesn t have to do good it just feels good And if these pirates I say pirates out of consideration for the professor s feelings since he doesn t want us to call them cannibals if these pirates think they re going to smother me in this cage without hearing what cusswords spice up my outbursts they ve got another think coming Look here Professor Aronnax speak frankly How long do you figure they ll keep us in this iron box To tell the truth friend Land I know little more about it than you do But in a nutshell what do you suppose is going on My supposition is that sheer chance has made us privy to an important secret Now then if the crew of this underwater boat have a personal interest in keeping that secret and if their personal interest is more important than the lives of three men I believe that our very existence is in jeopardy If such is not the case then at the first available opportunity this monster that has swallowed us will return us to the world inhabited by our own kind Unless they recruit us to serve on the crew Conseil said and keep us here Till the moment Ned Land answered when some frigate that s faster or smarter than the Abraham Lincoln captures this den of buccaneers then hangs all of us by the neck from the tip of a mainmast yardarm Well thought out mister Land I replied But as yet I don t believe we ve been tendered any enlistment offers Consequently it s pointless to argue about what tactics we should pursue in such a case I repeat let s wait let s be guided by events and let s do nothing since right now there s nothing we can do On the contrary professor the harpooner replied not wanting to give in There is something we can do Oh And what mister Land Break out of here Breaking out of a prison on shore is difficult enough but with an underwater prison it strikes me as completely unworkable Come now Ned my friend Conseil asked how would you answer master s objection I refuse to believe that an American is at the end of his tether Visibly baffled the harpooner said nothing Under the conditions in which fate had left us it was absolutely impossible to escape But a Canadian s wit is half French and mister Ned Land made this clear in his reply So Professor Aronnax he went on after thinking for a few moments you haven t figured out what people do when they can t escape from their prison

none	none	Easy They fix things so they stay there Of course Conseil put in Since we re deep in the ocean being inside this boat is vastly preferable to being above it or below it But we fix things by kicking out all the jailers guards and wardens Ned Land added What s this Ned I asked You d seriously consider taking over this craft Very seriously the Canadian replied It s impossible And why is that sir Some promising opportunity might come up and I don t see what could stop us from taking advantage of it If there are only about twenty men on board this machine I don t think they can stave off two Frenchmen and a Canadian It seemed wiser to accept the harpooner s proposition than to debate it Accordingly I was content to reply Let such circumstances come mister Land and we ll see But until then I beg you to control your impatience We need to act shrewdly and your flare ups won t give rise to any promising opportunities So swear to me that you ll accept our situation without throwing a tantrum over it I give you my word professor Ned Land replied in an unenthusiastic tone No vehement phrases will leave my mouth no vicious gestures will give my feelings away not even when they don t feed us on time I have your word Ned I answered the Canadian Then our conversation petered out and each of us withdrew into his own thoughts For my part despite the harpooner s confident talk I admit that I entertained no illusions I had no faith in those promising opportunities that Ned Land mentioned To operate with such efficiency this underwater boat had to have a sizeable crew so if it came to a physical contest we would be facing an overwhelming opponent Besides before we could do anything we had to be free and that we definitely were not I didn t see any way out of this sheet iron hermetically sealed cell And if the strange commander of this boat did have a secret to keep which seemed rather likely he would never give us freedom of movement aboard his vessel Now then would he resort to violence in order to be rid of us or would he drop us off one day on some remote coast There lay the unknown All these hypotheses seemed extremely plausible to me and to hope for freedom through use of force you had to be a harpooner I realized moreover that Ned Land s brooding was getting him madder by the minute Little by little I heard those aforesaid cusswords welling up in the depths of his gullet and I saw his movements turn threatening again He stood up pacing in circles like a wild beast in a cage striking the walls with his foot and fist Meanwhile the hours passed our hunger nagged unmercifully and this time the steward did not appear Which amounted to forgetting our castaway status for much too long if they really had good intentions toward us Tortured by the growling of his well built stomach Ned Land was getting more and more riled and despite his word of honor I was in real dread of an explosion when he stood in the presence of one of the men on board For two more hours Ned Land s rage increased The Canadian shouted and pleaded but to no avail The sheet iron walls were deaf I didn t hear a single sound inside this dead seeming boat The vessel hadn t stirred because I obviously would have felt its hull vibrating under the influence of the propeller It had undoubtedly sunk into the watery deep and no longer belonged to the outside world All this dismal silence was terrifying As for our neglect our isolation in the depths of this cell I was afraid to guess at how long it might last Little by little hopes I had entertained after our interview with the ship s commander were fading away The gentleness of the man s gaze the generosity expressed in his facial features the nobility of his bearing all vanished from my memory I saw this mystifying individual anew for what he inevitably must be cruel and merciless I viewed him as outside humanity beyond all feelings of compassion the implacable foe of his fellow man toward whom he must have sworn an undying hate But even so was the man going to let us die of starvation locked up in this cramped prison exposed to those horrible temptations to which people are driven by extreme hunger This grim possibility took on a dreadful intensity in my mind and fired by my imagination I felt an unreasoning terror run through me Conseil stayed calm Ned Land bellowed Just then a noise was audible outside Footsteps rang on the metal tiling The locks were turned the door opened the steward appeared Before I could make a single movement to prevent him the Canadian rushed at the poor man threw him down held him by the throat The steward was choking in the grip of those powerful hands Conseil was already trying to loosen the harpooner s hands from his half suffocated victim and I had gone to join in the rescue when I was abruptly nailed to the spot by these words pronounced in French Calm down mister Land And you professor kindly listen to me CHAPTER ten The Man of the Waters IT WAS THE ship s commander who had just spoken At these words Ned Land stood up quickly Nearly strangled the steward staggered out at a signal from his superior but such was the commander s authority aboard his vessel not one gesture gave away the resentment that this man must have felt toward the Canadian In silence we waited for the outcome of this scene Conseil in spite of himself seemed almost fascinated I was stunned Arms crossed leaning against a corner of the table the commander studied us with great care Was he reluctant to speak further Did he regret those words he had just pronounced in French You would have thought so After a few moments of silence which none of us would have dreamed of interrupting Gentlemen he said in a calm penetrating voice I speak French English German and Latin with equal fluency Hence I could have answered you as early as our initial interview but first I wanted to make your acquaintance and then think things over Your four versions of the same narrative perfectly consistent by and large established your personal identities for me I now know that sheer chance has placed in my presence Professor Pierre Aronnax specialist in natural history at the Paris Museum and entrusted with a scientific mission abroad his manservant Conseil and Ned Land a harpooner of Canadian origin aboard the Abraham Lincoln a frigate in the national navy of the United States of America I bowed in agreement The commander hadn t put a question to me So no answer was called for This man expressed himself with perfect ease and without a trace of an accent His phrasing was clear his words well chosen his facility in elocution remarkable And yet to me he didn t have the feel of a fellow countryman He went on with the conversation as follows No doubt sir you ve felt that I waited rather too long before paying you this second visit After discovering your identities I wanted to weigh carefully what policy to pursue toward you I had great difficulty deciding Some extremely inconvenient circumstances have brought you into the presence of a man who has cut himself off from humanity Your coming has disrupted my whole existence Unintentionally I said Unintentionally the stranger replied raising his voice a little Was it unintentionally that the Abraham Lincoln hunted me on every sea Was it unintentionally that you traveled aboard that frigate Was it unintentionally that your shells bounced off my ship s hull Was it unintentionally that mister Ned Land hit me with his harpoon I detected a controlled irritation in these words But there was a perfectly natural reply to these charges and I made it Sir I said you re surely unaware of the discussions that have taken place in Europe and America with yourself as the subject You don t realize that various accidents caused by collisions with your underwater machine have aroused public passions on those two continents I ll spare you the innumerable hypotheses with which we ve tried to explain this inexplicable phenomenon whose secret is yours alone But please understand that the Abraham Lincoln chased you over the Pacific high seas in the belief it was hunting some powerful marine monster which had to be purged from the ocean at all cost A half smile curled the commander s lips then in a calmer tone Professor Aronnax he replied do you dare claim that your frigate wouldn t have chased and cannonaded an underwater boat as readily as a monster This question baffled me since Commander Farragut would certainly have shown no such hesitation He would have seen it as his sworn duty to destroy a contrivance of this kind just as promptly as a gigantic narwhale So you understand sir the stranger went on that I have a right to treat you as my enemy I kept quiet with good reason What was the use of debating such a proposition when superior force can wipe out the best arguments It took me a good while to decide the commander went on Nothing obliged me to grant you hospitality If I were to part company with you I d have no personal interest in ever seeing you again I could put you back on the platform of this ship that has served as your refuge I could sink under the sea and I could forget you ever existed Wouldn t that be my right Perhaps it would be the right of a savage I replied But not that of a civilized man Professor the commander replied swiftly I m not what you term a civilized man I ve severed all ties with society for reasons that I alone have the right to appreciate Therefore I obey none of its regulations and I insist that you never invoke them in front of me This was plain speaking A flash of anger and scorn lit up the stranger s eyes and I glimpsed a fearsome past in this man s life Not only had he placed himself beyond human laws he had rendered himself independent out of all reach free in the strictest sense of the word For who would dare chase him to the depths of the sea when he thwarted all attacks on the surface What ship could withstand a collision with his underwater Monitor What armor plate no matter how heavy could bear the thrusts of his spur No man among men could call him to account for his actions God if he believed in Him his conscience if he had one these were the only judges to whom he was answerable These thoughts swiftly crossed my mind while this strange individual fell silent like someone completely self absorbed I regarded him with a mixture of fear and fascination in the same way no doubt that Oedipus regarded the Sphinx After a fairly long silence the commander went on with our conversation So I had difficulty deciding he said But I concluded that my personal interests could be reconciled with that natural compassion to which every human being has a right Since fate has brought you here you ll stay aboard my vessel You ll be free here and in exchange for that freedom moreover totally related to it I ll lay on you just one condition Your word that you ll submit to it will be sufficient Go on sir I replied I assume this condition is one an honest man can accept Yes sir Just this It s possible that certain unforeseen events may force me to confine you to your cabins for some hours or even for some days as the case may be Since I prefer never to use violence I expect from you in such a case even more than in any other your unquestioning obedience By acting in this way I shield you from complicity I absolve you of all responsibility since I myself make it impossible for you to see what you aren t meant to see Do you accept this condition So things happened on board that were quite odd to say the least things never to be seen by people not placing themselves beyond society s laws Among all the surprises the future had in store for me this would not be the mildest We accept I replied Only I ll ask your permission sir to address a question to you just one Go ahead sir You said we d be free aboard your vessel Completely Then I would ask what you mean by this freedom Why the freedom to come go see and even closely observe everything happening here except under certain rare circumstances in short the freedom we ourselves enjoy my companions and I It was obvious that we did not understand each other Pardon me sir I went on but that s merely the freedom that every prisoner has the freedom to pace his cell That s not enough for us Nevertheless it will have to do What We must give up seeing our homeland friends and relatives ever again Yes sir But giving up that intolerable earthly yoke that some men call freedom is perhaps less painful than you think By thunder Ned Land shouted I ll never promise I won t try getting out of here I didn t ask for such a promise mister Land the commander replied coldly Sir I replied flaring up in spite of myself you re taking unfair advantage of us This is sheer cruelty No sir it s an act of mercy You re my prisoners of war I ve cared for you when with a single word I could plunge you back into the ocean depths You attacked me You ve just stumbled on a secret no living man must probe the secret of my entire existence Do you think I ll send you back to a world that must know nothing more of me Never By keeping you on board it isn t you whom I care for it s me These words indicated that the commander pursued a policy impervious to arguments Then sir I went on you give us quite simply a choice between life and death Quite simply My friends I said to a question couched in these terms our answer can be taken for granted But no solemn promises bind us to the commander of this vessel None sir the stranger replied Then in a gentler voice he went on Now allow me to finish what I have to tell you I ve heard of you Professor Aronnax You if not your companions won t perhaps complain too much about the stroke of fate that has brought us together Among the books that make up my favorite reading you ll find the work you ve published on the great ocean depths I ve pored over it You ve taken your studies as far as terrestrial science can go But you don t know everything because you haven t seen everything Let me tell you professor you won t regret the time you spend aboard my vessel You re going to voyage through a land of wonders Stunned amazement will probably be your habitual state of mind It will be a long while before you tire of the sights constantly before your eyes I m going to make another underwater tour of the world perhaps my last who knows and I ll review everything I ve studied in the depths of these seas that I ve crossed so often and you can be my fellow student Starting this very day you ll enter a new element you ll see what no human being has ever seen before since my men and I no longer count and thanks to me you re going to learn the ultimate secrets of our planet I can t deny it the commander s words had a tremendous effect on me He had caught me on my weak side and I momentarily forgot that not even this sublime experience was worth the loss of my freedom Besides I counted on the future to resolve this important question So I was content to reply Sir even though you ve cut yourself off from humanity I can see that you haven t disowned all human feeling We re castaways whom you ve charitably taken aboard we ll never forget that Speaking for myself I don t rule out that the interests of science could override even the need for freedom which promises me that in exchange our encounter will provide great rewards I thought the commander would offer me his hand to seal our agreement He did nothing of the sort I regretted that One last question I said just as this inexplicable being seemed ready to withdraw Ask it professor By what name am I to call you Sir the commander replied to you I m simply Captain Nemo to me you and your companions are simply passengers on the Nautilus Latin nemo means no one Ed Captain Nemo called out A steward appeared The captain gave him his orders in that strange language I couldn t even identify Then turning to the Canadian and Conseil A meal is waiting for you in your cabin he told them Kindly follow this man That s an offer I can t refuse the harpooner replied After being confined for over thirty hours he and Conseil were finally out of this cell And now Professor Aronnax our own breakfast is ready Allow me to lead the way Yours to command captain I followed Captain Nemo and as soon as I passed through the doorway I went down a kind of electrically lit passageway that resembled a gangway on a ship After a stretch of some ten meters a second door opened before me I then entered a dining room decorated and furnished in austere good taste Inlaid with ebony trim tall oaken sideboards stood at both ends of this room and sparkling on their shelves were staggered rows of earthenware porcelain and glass of incalculable value There silver plated dinnerware gleamed under rays pouring from light fixtures in the ceiling whose glare was softened and tempered by delicately painted designs In the center of this room stood a table richly spread Captain Nemo indicated the place I was to occupy Be seated 
836_130900_000032_000001	train-clean-360	he told me 
none	none	and eat like the famished man you must be Our breakfast consisted of several dishes whose contents were all supplied by the sea and some foods whose nature and derivation were unknown to me They were good I admit but with a peculiar flavor to which I would soon grow accustomed These various food items seemed to be rich in phosphorous and I thought that they too must have been of marine origin Captain Nemo stared at me I had asked him nothing but he read my thoughts and on his own he answered the questions I was itching to address him Most of these dishes are new to you he told me But you can consume them without fear They re healthy and nourishing I renounced terrestrial foods long ago and I m none the worse for it My crew are strong and full of energy and they eat what I eat So I said all these foods are products of the sea Yes professor the sea supplies all my needs Sometimes I cast my nets in our wake and I pull them up ready to burst Sometimes I go hunting right in the midst of this element that has long seemed so far out of man s reach and I corner the game that dwells in my underwater forests Like the flocks of old Proteus King Neptune s shepherd my herds graze without fear on the ocean s immense prairies There I own vast properties that I harvest myself and which are forever sown by the hand of the Creator of All Things I stared at Captain Nemo in definite astonishment and I answered him Sir I understand perfectly how your nets can furnish excellent fish for your table I understand less how you can chase aquatic game in your underwater forests but how a piece of red meat no matter how small can figure in your menu that I don t understand at all Nor I sir Captain Nemo answered me I never touch the flesh of land animals Nevertheless this I went on pointing to a dish where some slices of loin were still left What you believe to be red meat professor is nothing other than loin of sea turtle Similarly here are some dolphin livers you might mistake for stewed pork My chef is a skillful food processor who excels at pickling and preserving these various exhibits from the ocean Feel free to sample all of these foods Here are some preserves of sea cucumber that a Malaysian would declare to be unrivaled in the entire world here s cream from milk furnished by the udders of cetaceans and sugar from the huge fucus plants in the North Sea and finally allow me to offer you some marmalade of sea anemone equal to that from the tastiest fruits So I sampled away more as a curiosity seeker than an epicure while Captain Nemo delighted me with his incredible anecdotes But this sea Professor Aronnax he told me this prodigious inexhaustible wet nurse of a sea not only feeds me she dresses me as well That fabric covering you was woven from the masses of filaments that anchor certain seashells as the ancients were wont to do it was dyed with purple ink from the murex snail and shaded with violet tints that I extract from a marine slug the Mediterranean sea hare The perfumes you ll find on the washstand in your cabin were produced from the oozings of marine plants Your mattress was made from the ocean s softest eelgrass Your quill pen will be whalebone your ink a juice secreted by cuttlefish or squid Everything comes to me from the sea just as someday everything will return to it You love the sea captain Yes I love it The sea is the be all and end all It covers seven tenths of the planet earth Its breath is clean and healthy It s an immense wilderness where a man is never lonely because he feels life astir on every side The sea is simply the vehicle for a prodigious unearthly mode of existence it s simply movement and love it s living infinity as one of your poets put it And in essence professor nature is here made manifest by all three of her kingdoms mineral vegetable and animal The last of these is amply represented by the four zoophyte groups three classes of articulates five classes of mollusks and three vertebrate classes mammals reptiles and those countless legions of fish an infinite order of animals totaling more than thirteen thousand species of which only one tenth belong to fresh water The sea is a vast pool of nature Our globe began with the sea so to speak and who can say we won t end with it Here lies supreme tranquility The sea doesn t belong to tyrants On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims battle each other devour each other haul every earthly horror But thirty feet below sea level their dominion ceases their influence fades their power vanishes Ah sir live Live in the heart of the seas Here alone lies independence Here I recognize no superiors Here I m free Captain Nemo suddenly fell silent in the midst of this enthusiastic outpouring Had he let himself get carried away past the bounds of his habitual reserve Had he said too much For a few moments he strolled up and down all aquiver Then his nerves grew calmer his facial features recovered their usual icy composure and turning to me Now professor he said if you d like to inspect the Nautilus I m yours to command CHAPTER eleven The Nautilus CAPTAIN NEMO stood up I followed him Contrived at the rear of the dining room a double door opened and I entered a room whose dimensions equaled the one I had just left It was a library Tall black rosewood bookcases inlaid with copperwork held on their wide shelves a large number of uniformly bound books These furnishings followed the contours of the room their lower parts leading to huge couches upholstered in maroon leather and curved for maximum comfort Light movable reading stands which could be pushed away or pulled near as desired allowed books to be positioned on them for easy study In the center stood a huge table covered with pamphlets among which some newspapers long out of date were visible Electric light flooded this whole harmonious totality falling from four frosted half globes set in the scrollwork of the ceiling I stared in genuine wonderment at this room so ingeniously laid out and I couldn t believe my eyes Captain Nemo I told my host who had just stretched out on a couch this is a library that would do credit to more than one continental palace and I truly marvel to think it can go with you into the deepest seas Where could one find greater silence or solitude professor Captain Nemo replied Did your study at the museum afford you such a perfect retreat No sir and I might add that it s quite a humble one next to yours You own six thousand or seven thousand volumes here twelve thousand Professor Aronnax They re my sole remaining ties with dry land But I was done with the shore the day my Nautilus submerged for the first time under the waters That day I purchased my last volumes my last pamphlets my last newspapers and ever since I ve chosen to believe that humanity no longer thinks or writes In any event professor these books are at your disposal and you may use them freely I thanked Captain Nemo and approached the shelves of this library Written in every language books on science ethics and literature were there in abundance but I didn t see a single work on economics they seemed to be strictly banned on board One odd detail all these books were shelved indiscriminately without regard to the language in which they were written and this jumble proved that the Nautilus s captain could read fluently whatever volumes he chanced to pick up Among these books I noted masterpieces by the greats of ancient and modern times in other words all of humanity s finest achievements in history poetry fiction and science from Homer to Victor Hugo from Xenophon to Michelet from Rabelais to Madame George Sand But science in particular represented the major investment of this library books on mechanics ballistics hydrography meteorology geography geology et cetera held a place there no less important than works on natural history and I realized that they made up the captain s chief reading There I saw the complete works of Humboldt the complete Arago as well as works by Foucault Henri Sainte Claire Deville Chasles Milne Edwards Quatrefages John Tyndall Faraday Berthelot Father Secchi Petermann Commander Maury Louis Agassiz et cetera plus the transactions of France s Academy of Sciences bulletins from the various geographical societies et cetera and in a prime location those two volumes on the great ocean depths that had perhaps earned me this comparatively charitable welcome from Captain Nemo Among the works of Joseph Bertrand his book entitled The Founders of Astronomy even gave me a definite date and since I knew it had appeared in the course of eighteen sixty five I concluded that the fitting out of the Nautilus hadn t taken place before then Accordingly three years ago at the most Captain Nemo had begun his underwater existence Moreover I hoped some books even more recent would permit me to pinpoint the date precisely but I had plenty of time to look for them and I didn t want to put off any longer our stroll through the wonders of the Nautilus Sir I told the captain thank you for placing this library at my disposal There are scientific treasures here and I ll take advantage of them This room isn t only a library Captain Nemo said it s also a smoking room A smoking room I exclaimed Then one may smoke on board Surely In that case sir I m forced to believe that you ve kept up relations with Havana None whatever the captain replied Try this cigar Professor Aronnax and even though it doesn t come from Havana it will satisfy you if you re a connoisseur I took the cigar offered me whose shape recalled those from Cuba but it seemed to be made of gold leaf I lit it at a small brazier supported by an elegant bronze stand and I inhaled my first whiffs with the relish of a smoker who hasn t had a puff in days It s excellent I said but it s not from the tobacco plant Right the captain replied this tobacco comes from neither Havana nor the Orient It s a kind of nicotine rich seaweed that the ocean supplies me albeit sparingly Do you still miss your Cubans sir Captain I scorn them from this day forward Then smoke these cigars whenever you like without debating their origin They bear no government seal of approval but I imagine they re none the worse for it On the contrary Just then Captain Nemo opened a door facing the one by which I had entered the library and I passed into an immense splendidly lit lounge It was a huge quadrilateral with canted corners ten meters long six wide five high A luminous ceiling decorated with delicate arabesques distributed a soft clear daylight over all the wonders gathered in this museum For a museum it truly was in which clever hands had spared no expense to amass every natural and artistic treasure displaying them with the helter skelter picturesqueness that distinguishes a painter s studio Some thirty pictures by the masters uniformly framed and separated by gleaming panoplies of arms adorned walls on which were stretched tapestries of austere design There I saw canvases of the highest value the likes of which I had marveled at in private European collections and art exhibitions The various schools of the old masters were represented by a Raphael Madonna a Virgin by Leonardo da Vinci a nymph by Correggio a woman by Titian an adoration of the Magi by Veronese an assumption of the Virgin by Murillo a Holbein portrait a monk by Velazquez a martyr by Ribera a village fair by Rubens two Flemish landscapes by Teniers three little genre paintings by Gerard Dow Metsu and Paul Potter two canvases by Gericault and Prud honorable plus seascapes by Backhuysen and Vernet Among the works of modern art were pictures signed by Delacroix Ingres Decamps Troyon Meissonier Daubigny et cetera and some wonderful miniature statues in marble or bronze modeled after antiquity s finest originals stood on their pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum As the Nautilus s commander had predicted my mind was already starting to fall into that promised state of stunned amazement Professor this strange man then said you must excuse the informality with which I receive you and the disorder reigning in this lounge Sir I replied without prying into who you are might I venture to identify you as an artist A collector sir nothing more Formerly I loved acquiring these beautiful works created by the hand of man I sought them greedily ferreted them out tirelessly and I ve been able to gather some objects of great value They re my last mementos of those shores that are now dead for me In my eyes your modern artists are already as old as the ancients They ve existed for two thousand or three thousand years and I mix them up in my mind The masters are ageless What about these composers I said pointing to sheet music by Weber Rossini Mozart Beethoven Haydn Meyerbeer Herold Wagner Auber Gounod Victor Masse and a number of others scattered over a full size piano organ which occupied one of the wall panels in this lounge These composers Captain Nemo answered me are the contemporaries of Orpheus because in the annals of the dead all chronological differences fade and I m dead professor quite as dead as those friends of yours sleeping six feet under Captain Nemo fell silent and seemed lost in reverie I regarded him with intense excitement silently analyzing his strange facial expression Leaning his elbow on the corner of a valuable mosaic table he no longer saw me he had forgotten my very presence I didn t disturb his meditations but continued to pass in review the curiosities that enriched this lounge After the works of art natural rarities predominated They consisted chiefly of plants shells and other exhibits from the ocean that must have been Captain Nemo s own personal finds In the middle of the lounge a jet of water electrically lit fell back into a basin made from a single giant clam The delicately festooned rim of this shell supplied by the biggest mollusk in the class Acephala measured about six meters in circumference so it was even bigger than those fine giant clams given to King Francois I by the Republic of Venice and which the Church of Saint Sulpice in Paris has made into two gigantic holy water fonts Around this basin inside elegant glass cases fastened with copper bands there were classified and labeled the most valuable marine exhibits ever put before the eyes of a naturalist My professorial glee may easily be imagined The zoophyte branch offered some very unusual specimens from its two groups the polyps and the echinoderms In the first group organ pipe coral gorgonian coral arranged into fan shapes soft sponges from Syria isis coral from the Molucca Islands sea pen coral wonderful coral of the genus Virgularia from the waters of Norway various coral of the genus Umbellularia alcyonarian coral then a whole series of those madrepores that my mentor Professor Milne Edwards has so shrewdly classified into divisions and among which I noted the wonderful genus Flabellina as well as the genus Oculina from Reunion Island plus a Neptune s chariot from the Caribbean Sea every superb variety of coral and in short every species of these unusual polyparies that congregate to form entire islands that will one day turn into continents Among the echinoderms notable for being covered with spines starfish feather stars sea lilies free swimming crinoids brittle stars sea urchins sea cucumbers et cetera represented a complete collection of the individuals in this group An excitable conchologist would surely have fainted dead away before other more numerous glass cases in which were classified specimens from the mollusk branch There I saw a collection of incalculable value that I haven t time to describe completely Among these exhibits I ll mention just for the record an elegant royal hammer shell from the Indian Ocean whose evenly spaced white spots stood out sharply against a base of red and brown an imperial spiny oyster brightly colored bristling with thorns a specimen rare to European museums whose value I estimated at twenty thousand francs a common hammer shell from the seas near Queensland very hard to come by exotic cockles from Senegal fragile white bivalve shells that a single breath could pop like a soap bubble several varieties of watering pot shell from Java a sort of limestone tube fringed with leafy folds and much fought over by collectors a whole series of top shell snails greenish yellow ones fished up from American seas others colored reddish brown that patronize the waters off Queensland the former coming from the Gulf of Mexico and notable for their overlapping shells the latter some sun carrier shells found in the southernmost seas finally and rarest of all the magnificent spurred star shell from New Zealand then some wonderful peppery furrow shells several valuable species of cythera clams and venus clams the trellis wentletrap snail from Tranquebar on India s eastern shore a marbled turban snail gleaming with mother of pearl green parrot shells from the seas of China the virtually unknown cone snail from the genus Coenodullus every variety of cowry used as money in India and Africa a glory of the seas the most valuable shell in the East Indies finally common periwinkles delphinula snails turret snails violet snails European cowries volute snails olive shells miter shells helmet shells murex snails whelks harp shells spiky periwinkles triton snails horn shells spindle shells conch shells spider conchs limpets glass snails sea butterflies every kind of delicate fragile seashell that science has baptized with its most delightful names Aside and in special compartments strings of supremely beautiful pearls were spread out the electric light flecking them with little fiery sparks pink pearls pulled from saltwater fan shells in the Red Sea green pearls from the rainbow abalone yellow blue and black pearls the unusual handiwork of various mollusks from every ocean and of certain mussels from rivers up north in short several specimens of incalculable worth that had been oozed by the rarest of shellfish Some of these pearls were bigger than a pigeon egg they more than equaled the one that the explorer Tavernier sold the Shah of Persia for three million francs and they surpassed that other pearl owned by the Imam of Muscat which I had believed to be unrivaled in the entire world Consequently to calculate the value of this collection was I should say impossible Captain Nemo must have spent millions in acquiring these different specimens and I was wondering what financial resources he tapped to satisfy his collector s fancies when these words interrupted me You re examining my shells professor They re indeed able to fascinate a naturalist but for me they have an added charm since I ve collected every one of them with my own two hands and not a sea on the globe has escaped my investigations I understand captain I understand your delight at strolling in the midst of this wealth You re a man who gathers his treasure in person No museum in Europe owns such a collection of exhibits from the ocean But if I exhaust all my wonderment on them I ll have nothing left for the ship that carries them I have absolutely no wish to probe those secrets of yours But I confess that my curiosity is aroused to the limit by this Nautilus the motor power it contains the equipment enabling it to operate the ultra powerful force that brings it to life I see some instruments hanging on the walls of this lounge whose purposes are unknown to me May I learn Professor Aronnax Captain Nemo answered me I ve said you d be free aboard my vessel so no part of the Nautilus is off limits to you You may inspect it in detail and I ll be delighted to act as your guide I don t know how to thank you sir but I won t abuse your good nature I would only ask you about the uses intended for these instruments of physical measure Professor these same instruments are found in my stateroom where I ll have the pleasure of explaining their functions to you But beforehand come inspect the cabin set aside for you You need to learn how you ll be lodged aboard the Nautilus I followed Captain Nemo who via one of the doors cut into the lounge s canted corners led me back down the ship s gangways He took me to the bow and there I found not just a cabin but an elegant stateroom with a bed a washstand and various other furnishings I could only thank my host Your stateroom adjoins mine he told me opening a door and mine leads into that lounge we ve just left I entered the captain s stateroom It had an austere almost monastic appearance An iron bedstead a worktable some washstand fixtures Subdued lighting No luxuries Just the bare necessities Captain Nemo showed me to a bench Kindly be seated he told me I sat and he began speaking as follows CHAPTER twelve Everything through Electricity SIR CAPTAIN NEMO SAID showing me the instruments hanging on the walls of his stateroom these are the devices needed to navigate the Nautilus Here as in the lounge I always have them before my eyes and they indicate my position and exact heading in the midst of the ocean You re familiar with some of them such as the thermometer which gives the temperature inside the Nautilus the barometer which measures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes in the weather the humidistat which indicates the degree of dryness in the atmosphere the storm glass whose mixture decomposes to foretell the arrival of tempests the compass which steers my course the sextant which takes the sun s altitude and tells me my latitude chronometers which allow me to calculate my longitude and finally spyglasses for both day and night enabling me to scrutinize every point of the horizon once the Nautilus has risen to the surface of the waves These are the normal navigational instruments I replied and I m familiar with their uses But no doubt these others answer pressing needs unique to the Nautilus That dial I see there with the needle moving across it isn t it a pressure gauge It is indeed a pressure gauge It s placed in contact with the water and it indicates the outside pressure on our hull which in turn gives me the depth at which my submersible is sitting And these are some new breed of sounding line They re thermometric sounding lines that report water temperatures in the different strata And these other instruments whose functions I can t even guess Here professor I need to give you some background information Captain Nemo said So kindly hear me out He fell silent for some moments then he said There s a powerful obedient swift and effortless force that can be bent to any use and which reigns supreme aboard my vessel It does everything It lights me it warms me it s the soul of my mechanical equipment This force is electricity Electricity I exclaimed in some surprise Yes sir But captain you have a tremendous speed of movement that doesn t square with the strength of electricity Until now its dynamic potential has remained quite limited capable of producing only small amounts of power Professor Captain Nemo replied my electricity isn t the run of the mill variety and with your permission I ll leave it at that I won t insist sir and I ll rest content with simply being flabbergasted at your results I would ask one question however which you needn t answer if it s indiscreet The electric cells you use to generate this marvelous force must be depleted very quickly Their zinc component for example how do you replace it since you no longer stay in contact with the shore That question deserves an answer Captain Nemo replied First off I ll mention that at the bottom of the sea there exist veins of zinc iron silver and gold whose mining would quite certainly be feasible But I ve tapped none of these land based metals and I wanted to make demands only on the sea itself for the sources of my electricity The sea itself Yes professor and there was no shortage of such sources In fact by establishing a circuit between two wires immersed to different depths I d be able to obtain electricity through the diverging temperatures they experience but I preferred to use a more practical procedure And that is You re familiar with the composition of salt water In one thousand grams one finds ninety six point five water and about two point sixty six sodium chloride then small quantities of magnesium chloride potassium chloride magnesium bromide sulfate of magnesia calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate Hence you observe that sodium chloride is encountered there in significant proportions Now then it s this sodium that I extract from salt water and with which I compose my electric cells Sodium Yes sir Mixed with mercury it forms an amalgam that takes the place of zinc in Bunsen cells The mercury is never depleted Only the sodium is consumed and the sea itself gives me that Beyond this I ll mention that sodium batteries have been found to generate the greater energy and their electro motor strength is twice that of zinc batteries Captain I fully understand the excellence of sodium under the conditions in which you re placed The sea contains it Fine But it still has to be produced in short extracted And how do you accomplish this Obviously your batteries could do the extracting but if I m not mistaken the consumption of sodium needed by your electric equipment would be greater than the quantity you d extract It would come about then that in the process of producing your sodium you d use up more than you d make Accordingly professor I don t extract it with batteries quite simply I utilize the heat of coal from the earth From the earth I said my voice going up on the word We ll say coal from the seafloor if you prefer Captain Nemo replied And you can mine these veins of underwater coal You ll watch me work them Professor Aronnax I ask only a little patience of you since you ll have ample time to be patient Just remember one thing I owe everything to the ocean it generates electricity and electricity gives the Nautilus heat light motion and in a word life itself But not the air you breathe Oh I could produce the air needed on board but it would be pointless since I can rise to the surface of the sea whenever I like However even though electricity doesn t supply me with breathable air it at least operates the powerful pumps that store it under pressure in special tanks which if need be allows me to extend my stay in the lower strata for as long as I want Captain I replied I ll rest content with marveling You ve obviously found what all mankind will surely find one day the true dynamic power of electricity I m not so certain they ll find it Captain Nemo replied icily But be that as it may you re already familiar with the first use I ve found for this valuable force It lights us and with a uniformity and continuity not even possessed by sunlight Now look at that clock it s electric it runs with an accuracy rivaling the finest chronometers I ve had it divided into twenty four hours like Italian clocks since neither day nor night sun nor moon exist for me but only this artificial light that I import into the depths of the seas See right now it s ten o clock in the morning That s perfect Another use for electricity that dial hanging before our eyes indicates how fast the Nautilus is going An electric wire puts it in contact with the patent log this needle shows me the actual speed of my submersible And hold on just now we re proceeding at the moderate pace of fifteen miles per hour It s marvelous I replied and I truly see captain how right you are to use this force it s sure to take the place of wind water and steam But that s not all Professor Aronnax Captain Nemo said standing up And if you d care to follow me we ll inspect the Nautilus s stern In essence I was already familiar with the whole forward part of this underwater boat and here are its exact subdivisions going from amidships to its spur the dining room five meters long and separated from the library by a watertight bulkhead in other words it couldn t be penetrated by the sea the library five meters long the main lounge ten meters long separated from the captain s stateroom by a second watertight bulkhead the aforesaid stateroom five meters long mine two point five meters long and finally air tanks seven point five meters long and extending to the stempost Total a length of thirty five meters Doors were cut into the watertight bulkheads and were shut hermetically by means of india rubber seals which insured complete safety aboard the Nautilus in the event of a leak in any one section I followed Captain Nemo down gangways located for easy transit and I arrived amidships There I found a sort of shaft heading upward between two watertight bulkheads An iron ladder clamped to the wall led to the shaft s upper end I asked the captain what this ladder was for It goes to the skiff he replied What You have a skiff I replied in some astonishment Surely An excellent longboat light and unsinkable which is used for excursions and fishing trips But when you want to set out don t you have to return to the surface of the sea By no means The skiff is attached to the topside of the Nautilus s hull and is set in a cavity expressly designed to receive it It s completely decked over absolutely watertight and held solidly in place by bolts This ladder leads to a manhole cut into the Nautilus s hull and corresponding to a comparable hole cut into the side of the skiff I insert myself through this double opening into the longboat My crew close up the hole belonging to the Nautilus I close up the one belonging to the skiff simply by screwing it into place I undo the bolts holding the skiff to the submersible and the longboat rises with prodigious speed to the surface of the sea I then open the deck paneling carefully closed until that point I up mast and hoist sail or I take out my oars and I go for a spin But how do you return to the ship I don t Professor Aronnax the Nautilus returns to me At your command At my command An electric wire connects me to the ship I fire off a telegram and that s that Right I said tipsy from all these wonders nothing to it After passing the well of the companionway that led to the platform I saw a cabin two meters long in which Conseil and Ned Land enraptured with their meal were busy devouring it to the last crumb Then a door opened into the galley three meters long and located between the vessel s huge storage lockers There even more powerful and obedient than gas electricity did most of the cooking Arriving under the stoves wires transmitted to platinum griddles a heat that was distributed and sustained with perfect consistency It also heated a distilling mechanism that via evaporation supplied excellent drinking water Next to this galley was a bathroom conveniently laid out with faucets supplying hot or cold water at will After the galley came the crew s quarters five meters long But the door was closed and I couldn t see its accommodations which might have told me the number of men it took to operate the Nautilus At the far end stood a fourth watertight bulkhead separating the crew s quarters from the engine room A door opened and I stood in the compartment where Captain Nemo indisputably a world class engineer had set up his locomotive equipment Brightly lit the engine room measured at least twenty meters in length It was divided by function into two parts the first contained the cells for generating electricity the second that mechanism transmitting movement to the propeller Right off I detected an odor permeating the compartment that was sui generis Captain Nemo noticed the negative impression it made on me Latin in a class by itself Ed That he told me is a gaseous discharge caused by our use of sodium but it s only a mild inconvenience In any event every morning we sanitize the ship by ventilating it in the open air Meanwhile I examined the Nautilus s engine with a fascination easy to imagine You observe Captain Nemo told me that I use Bunsen cells not Ruhmkorff cells The latter would be ineffectual One uses fewer Bunsen cells but they re big and strong and experience has proven their superiority The electricity generated here makes its way to the stern where electromagnets of huge size activate a special system of levers and gears that transmit movement to the propeller s shaft The latter has a diameter of six meters a pitch of seven point five meters and can do up to one hundred twenty revolutions per minute And that gives you A speed of fifty miles per hour There lay a mystery but I didn t insist on exploring it How could electricity work with such power Where did this nearly unlimited energy originate Was it in the extraordinary voltage obtained from some new kind of induction coil Could its transmission have been immeasurably increased by some unknown system of levers This was the point I couldn t grasp Author s Note And sure enough there s now talk of such a discovery in which a new set of levers generates considerable power Did its inventor meet up with Captain Nemo Captain Nemo I said I ll vouch for the results and not try to explain them I ve seen the Nautilus at work out in front of the Abraham Lincoln and I know where I stand on its speed But it isn t enough just to move we have to see where we re going We must be able to steer right or left up or down How do you reach the lower depths where you meet an increasing resistance that s assessed in hundreds of atmospheres How do you rise back to the surface of the ocean Finally how do you keep your ship at whatever level suits you Am I indiscreet in asking you all these things Not at all professor the captain answered me after a slight hesitation since you ll never leave this underwater boat Come into the lounge It s actually our work room and there you ll learn the full story about the Nautilus CHAPTER thirteen Some Figures A MOMENT LATER we were seated on a couch in the lounge cigars between our lips The captain placed before my eyes a working drawing that gave the ground plan 
5784-36627-0000	train-other-500	cross section and side view of the Nautilus Then he began his description as follows Here Professor Aronnax are the different dimensions of this boat now transporting you
5784-36627-0001	train-other-500	It s a very long cylinder with conical ends It noticeably takes the shape of a cigar a shape already adopted in London for several projects of the same kind
5784-36627-0002	train-other-500	The length of this cylinder from end to end is exactly seventy meters and its maximum breadth of beam is eight meters So it isn t quite built on the ten to one ratio of your high speed steamers
5784-36627-0003	train-other-500	but its lines are sufficiently long and their tapering gradual enough so that the displaced water easily slips past and poses no obstacle to the ship s movements These two dimensions allow you to obtain
5784-36627-0004	train-other-500	via a simple calculation the surface area and volume of the Nautilus Its surface area totals
none	none	 ten eleven point forty five square meters its volume fifteen oh seven point two cubic meters 
5784-36627-0006	train-other-500	which is tantamount to saying that when it s completely submerged
none	none	 it displaces fifteen hundred cubic meters of water or weighs fifteen hundred metric tons 
5784-36627-0007	train-other-500	In drawing up plans for a ship meant to navigate underwater I wanted it when floating on the waves to lie nine tenths below the surface and to emerge only one tenth Consequently
none	none	 under these conditions it needed to displace only nine tenths of its volume hence thirteen fifty six point forty eight cubic meters in other words it was to weigh only that same number of metric tons 
5784-36627-0009	train-other-500	So I was obliged not to exceed this weight while building it to the aforesaid dimensions The Nautilus is made up of two hulls one inside the other between them
5784-36627-0010	train-other-500	joining them together are iron T bars that give this ship the utmost rigidity In fact thanks to this cellular arrangement it has the resistance of a stone block as if it were completely solid
none	none	 Its plating can t give way it s self adhering and not dependent on the tightness of its rivets and due to the perfect union of its materials the solidarity of its construction allows it to defy the most violent seas 
5784-36627-0011	train-other-500	The two hulls are manufactured from boilerplate steel
none	none	 whose relative density is seven point eight times that of water 
5784-36627-0012	train-other-500	The first hull has a thickness of no less than five centimeters
none	none	 and weighs three hundred ninety four point ninety six metric tons 
5784-36627-0013	train-other-500	My second hull the outer cover includes a keel fifty centimeters high by twenty five wide which by itself weighs sixty two metric tons this hull the engine the ballast
5784-36627-0014	train-other-500	the various accessories and accommodations plus the bulkheads and interior braces
none	none	 have a combined weight of nine hundred sixty one point fifty two metric tons which when added to three hundred ninety four point ninety six metric tons gives us the desired total of thirteen fifty six point forty eight metric tons 
5784-36627-0016	train-other-500	Clear Clear I replied So the captain went on when the Nautilus lies on the waves under these conditions one tenth of it does emerge above water
none	none	 Now then if I provide some ballast tanks equal in capacity to that one tenth hence able to hold one hundred fifty point seventy two metric tons and if I fill them with water the boat then displaces fifteen oh seven point two metric tons or it weighs that much and it would be completely submerged That s what comes about professor 
5784-36627-0018	train-other-500	These ballast tanks exist within easy access in the lower reaches of the Nautilus
none	none	 I open some stopcocks the tanks fill 
5784-36627-0019	train-other-500	the boat sinks and it s exactly flush with the surface of the water Fine captain but now we come to a genuine difficulty You re able to lie flush with the surface of the ocean that I understand
5784-36627-0020	train-other-500	But lower down while diving beneath that surface isn t your submersible going to encounter a pressure and consequently undergo an upward thrust that must be assessed at one atmosphere per every thirty feet of water hence at about one
5784-36627-0021	train-other-500	kilogram per each square centimeter Precisely sir Then unless you fill up the whole Nautilus I don t see how you can force it down into the heart of these liquid masses Professor Captain Nemo replied
5784-36627-0022	train-other-500	static objects mustn t be confused with dynamic ones or we ll be open to serious error Comparatively little effort is spent in reaching the ocean s lower regions because all objects have a tendency to become sinkers
5784-36627-0023	train-other-500	Follow my logic here I m all ears captain When I wanted to determine what increase in weight the Nautilus needed to be given in order to submerge I had only to take note of the
5784-36627-0024	train-other-500	proportionate reduction in volume that salt water experiences in deeper and deeper strata That s obvious I replied Now then if water isn t absolutely incompressible at least it compresses very little
none	none	 In fact according to the most recent calculations this reduction is only four hundred thirty six per atmosphere 
5784-36627-0025	train-other-500	or per every thirty feet of depth
none	none	 For instance to go one thousand meters down I must take into account the reduction in volume that occurs under a pressure equivalent to that from a one thousand meter column of water in other words under a pressure of one hundred atmospheres In this instance the reduction would be four hundred thirty six Consequently I d have to increase my weight from fifteen oh seven point two metric tons to fifteen thirteen point seventy seven So the added weight would only be six point fifty seven metric tons 
5784-36627-0027	train-other-500	That s all That s all Professor Aronnax and the calculation is easy to check Now then I have supplementary ballast tanks
none	none	 capable of shipping one hundred metric tons of water 
5784-36627-0028	train-other-500	So I can descend to considerable depths When I want to rise again and lie flush with the surface all I have to do is expel that water and if I desire that the Nautilus emerge above the waves to one tenth of its total capacity
5784-36627-0029	train-other-500	I empty all the ballast tanks completely This logic backed up by figures left me without a single objection
none	none	 I accept your calculations captain I replied and I d be ill mannered to dispute them 
5784-36627-0030	train-other-500	since your daily experience bears them out But at this juncture I have a hunch that we re still left with one real difficulty What s that sir When you re at a depth of one thousand meters the Nautilus s
839_130898_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 What s that 
835_130876_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 What s that sir 
835_130876_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 What s that sir 
none	none	When you re at a depth of one thousand meters the Nautilus s 
5784-36627-0031	train-other-500	plating bears a pressure of one hundred atmospheres If at this point you want to empty the supplementary ballast tanks in order to lighten your boat and rise to the surface your pumps must overcome that pressure of one hundred atmospheres
none	none	 which is one hundred kilograms per each square centimeter 
5784-36627-0032	train-other-500	This demands a strength That electricity alone can give me Captain Nemo said swiftly Sir I repeat the dynamic power of my engines is nearly infinite
none	none	 The Nautilus s pumps have prodigious strength as you must have noticed when their waterspouts swept like a torrent over the Abraham Lincoln 
5784-36627-0033	train-other-500	Besides I use my supplementary ballast tanks only to reach an average depth of
none	none	 fifteen hundred to two thousand meters 
5784-36627-0034	train-other-500	and that with a view to conserving my machinery Accordingly when I have a mind to visit the ocean depths two or three vertical leagues beneath the surface I use maneuvers that are more time consuming but no less infallible
5784-36627-0035	train-other-500	What are they captain I asked Here I m naturally led into telling you how the Nautilus is maneuvered I can t wait to find out In order to steer this boat to port or starboard in short
5784-36627-0036	train-other-500	to make turns on a horizontal plane I use an ordinary wide bladed rudder that s fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle
5784-36627-0037	train-other-500	But I can also move the Nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation these fins are flexible able to assume any position
none	none	 and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers 
5784-36627-0038	train-other-500	If these fins stay parallel with the boat the latter moves horizontally If they slant the Nautilus follows the angle of that slant and under its propeller s thrust either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me
none	none	 or rises on that diagonal And similarly if I want to return more swiftly to the surface 
5784-36627-0039	train-other-500	I throw the propeller in gear and the water s pressure makes the Nautilus rise vertically as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies Bravo captain I exclaimed
5784-36627-0040	train-other-500	But in the midst of the waters how can your helmsman follow the course you ve given him My helmsman is stationed behind the windows of a pilothouse which protrudes from the topside of the Nautilus s hull and is fitted with
5784-36627-0041	train-other-500	biconvex glass Is glass capable of resisting such pressures Perfectly capable Though fragile on impact crystal can still offer considerable resistance
5784-36627-0042	train-other-500	In eighteen sixty four during experiments on fishing by electric light in the middle of the North Sea glass panes less than seven millimeters thick
none	none	 were seen to resist a pressure of sixteen atmospheres 
5784-36627-0043	train-other-500	all the while letting through strong heat generating rays whose warmth
none	none	 was unevenly distributed 
5784-36627-0044	train-other-500	Now then I use glass windows measuring no less than twenty one centimeters at their centers in other words they ve thirty times the thickness Fair enough captain
none	none	 but if we re going to see we need light to drive away the dark and in the midst of the murky waters I wonder how your helmsman can Set astern of the pilothouse is a powerful electric reflector whose rays light up the sea for a distance of half a mile 
5784-36627-0045	train-other-500	Oh bravo Bravo three times over captain That explains the phosphorescent glow from this so called narwhale that so puzzled us scientists Pertinent to this
5784-36627-0046	train-other-500	I ll ask you if the Nautilus s running afoul of the Scotia which caused such a great uproar was the result of an accidental encounter Entirely accidental sir
none	none	 I was navigating two meters beneath the surface of the water 
5784-36627-0047	train-other-500	when the collision occurred However I could see that it had no dire consequences None sir But as for your encounter with the Abraham Lincoln Professor that troubled me
5784-36627-0048	train-other-500	because it s one of the best ships in the gallant American navy but they attacked me and I had to defend myself All the same I was content simply to put the frigate in a condition where it could do me no harm
none	none	 it won t have any difficulty getting repairs at the nearest port Ah commander I exclaimed with conviction your Nautilus is truly a marvelous boat 
5784-36627-0049	train-other-500	Yes professor Captain Nemo replied with genuine excitement and I love it as if it were my own flesh and blood Aboard a conventional ship facing the ocean s perils danger lurks everywhere on the surface of the sea
5784-36627-0050	train-other-500	your chief sensation is the constant feeling of an underlying chasm as the Dutchman Jansen so aptly put it but below the waves aboard the Nautilus your heart never fails you
none	none	 There are no structural deformities to worry about because the double hull of this boat has the rigidity of iron 
5784-36627-0051	train-other-500	no rigging to be worn out by rolling and pitching on the waves no sails for the wind to carry off no boilers for steam to burst open no fires to fear because this submersible is made of sheet iron not wood
5784-36627-0052	train-other-500	no coal to run out of since electricity is its mechanical force no collisions to fear because it navigates the watery deep all by itself no storms to brave because just a few meters beneath the waves it finds absolute tranquility
5784-36627-0053	train-other-500	There sir There s the ideal ship And if it s true that the engineer has more confidence in a craft than the builder and the builder more than the captain himself
5784-36627-0054	train-other-500	you can understand the utter abandon with which I place my trust in this Nautilus since I m its captain builder and engineer all in one Captain Nemo spoke with winning eloquence
5784-36627-0055	train-other-500	The fire in his eyes and the passion in his gestures transfigured him Yes he loved his ship the same way a father loves his child But one question perhaps indiscreet naturally popped up
5784-36627-0056	train-other-500	and I couldn t resist asking it You re an engineer then Captain Nemo Yes professor he answered me I studied in London Paris and New York back in the days when I was a resident of the earth s continents
5784-36627-0057	train-other-500	But how were you able to build this wonderful Nautilus in secret Each part of it Professor Aronnax came from a different spot on the globe and reached me at a cover address Its keel was forged by Creusot
none	none	 in France its propeller shaft by Pen company in London the sheet iron plates for its hull by Laird s in Liverpool its propeller by Scott s in Glasgow Its tanks were manufactured by Cail company in Paris its engine by Krupp in Prussia its spur by the Motala workshops in Sweden its precision instruments by Hart Bros in New York et cetera and each of these suppliers received my specifications under a different name 
5784-36627-0060	train-other-500	But I went on once these parts were manufactured didn t they have to be mounted and adjusted Professor I set up my workshops on a deserted islet in midocean
5784-36627-0061	train-other-500	There our Nautilus was completed by me and my workmen in other words by my gallant companions whom I ve molded and educated Then when the operation was over we burned every trace of our stay on that islet which if I could have
none	none	 I d have blown up From all this may I assume that such a boat costs a fortune An iron ship Professor Aronnax runs eleven twenty five francs per metric ton Now then the Nautilus has a burden of fifteen hundred metric tons 
5784-36627-0063	train-other-500	Consequently it cost one million six hundred eighty seven thousand francs hence two million francs including its accommodations
none	none	 and four million or five million with all the collections and works of art it contains 
5784-36627-0064	train-other-500	One last question Captain Nemo Ask professor You re rich then Infinitely rich sir and without any trouble I could pay off the ten billion franc French national debt
none	none	 I gaped at the bizarre individual who had just spoken these words Was he playing on my credulity Time would tell CHAPTER fourteen The Black Current THE PART OF THE planet earth that the seas occupy has been assessed at three million eight hundred thirty two thousand five hundred fifty eight square myriameters hence more than thirty eight billion hectares This liquid mass totals two billion two hundred fifty million cubic miles and could form a sphere with a diameter of sixty leagues whose weight would be three quintillion metric tons To appreciate such a number we should remember that a quintillion is to a billion what a billion is to one in other words there are as many billions in a quintillion as ones in a billion Now then this liquid mass nearly equals the total amount of water that has poured through all the earth s rivers for the past forty thousand years During prehistoric times an era of fire was followed by an era of water At first there was ocean everywhere Then during the Silurian period the tops of mountains gradually appeared above the waves islands emerged disappeared beneath temporary floods rose again were fused to form continents and finally the earth s geography settled into what we have today Solid matter had wrested from liquid matter some thirty seven million six hundred fifty seven thousand square miles hence twelve billion nine hundred sixteen million hectares The outlines of the continents allow the seas to be divided into five major parts the frozen Arctic and Antarctic oceans the Indian Ocean the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean The Pacific Ocean extends north to south between the two polar circles and east to west between America and Asia over an expanse of one hundred forty five degrees of longitude It s the most tranquil of the seas its currents are wide and slow moving its tides moderate its rainfall abundant And this was the ocean that I was first destined to cross under these strangest of auspices If you don t mind professor Captain Nemo told me we ll determine our exact position and fix the starting point of our voyage It s fifteen minutes before noon I m going to rise to the surface of the water The captain pressed an electric bell three times The pumps began to expel water from the ballast tanks on the pressure gauge a needle marked the decreasing pressures that indicated the Nautilus s upward progress then the needle stopped Here we are the captain said I made my way to the central companionway which led to the platform I climbed its metal steps passed through the open hatches and arrived topside on the Nautilus The platform emerged only eighty centimeters above the waves The Nautilus s bow and stern boasted that spindle shaped outline that had caused the ship to be compared appropriately to a long cigar I noted the slight overlap of its sheet iron plates which resembled the scales covering the bodies of our big land reptiles So I had a perfectly natural explanation for why 
6232-36628-0000	train-other-500	despite the best spyglasses this boat had always been mistaken for a marine animal Near the middle of the platform the skiff was half set in the ship s hull making a slight bulge
6232-36628-0001	train-other-500	Fore and aft stood two cupolas of moderate height their sides slanting and partly inset with heavy biconvex glass one reserved for the helmsman steering the Nautilus the other for the brilliance of the powerful electric beacon lighting his way
6232-36628-0002	train-other-500	The sea was magnificent the skies clear This long aquatic vehicle could barely feel the broad undulations of the ocean A mild breeze out of the east rippled the surface of the water
6232-36628-0003	train-other-500	Free of all mist the horizon was ideal for taking sights There was nothing to be seen Not a reef not an islet No more Abraham Lincoln A deserted immenseness Raising his sextant
6232-36628-0004	train-other-500	Captain Nemo took the altitude of the sun which would give him his latitude He waited for a few minutes until the orb touched the rim of the horizon While he was taking his sights he didn t move a muscle
6232-36628-0005	train-other-500	and the instrument couldn t have been steadier in hands made out of marble Noon he said Professor whenever you re ready I took one last look at the sea a little yellowish near the landing places of Japan and I went below again to the main lounge
6232-36628-0006	train-other-500	There the captain fixed his position and used a chronometer to calculate his longitude which he double checked against his previous observations of hour angles Then he told me
none	none	 Professor Aronnax we re in longitude one hundred thirty seven degrees fifteen west 
6232-36628-0007	train-other-500	West of which meridian I asked quickly hoping the captain s reply might give me a clue to his nationality
none	none	 Sir he answered me I have chronometers variously set to the meridians of 
6232-36628-0008	train-other-500	Paris Greenwich and Washington D C But in your honor I ll use the one for Paris This reply told me nothing I bowed and the commander went on
none	none	 We re in longitude one hundred thirty seven degrees fifteen west of the meridian of Paris and latitude thirty degrees seven north in other words about three hundred miles from the shores of Japan At noon on this day of November eight we hereby begin our voyage of exploration under the waters May God be with us I replied And now professor the captain added 
6232-36628-0010	train-other-500	I ll leave you to your intellectual pursuits I ve set our course east northeast at a depth of fifty meters Here are some large scale charts on which you ll be able to follow that course The lounge is at your disposal and with your permission I ll take my leave
none	none	 Captain Nemo bowed 
6232-36628-0011	train-other-500	I was left to myself lost in my thoughts They all centered on the Nautilus s commander
none	none	 Would I ever learn the nationality of this eccentric man who had boasted of having none 
6232-36628-0012	train-other-500	His sworn hate for humanity a hate that perhaps was bent on some dreadful revenge what had provoked it Was he one of those unappreciated scholars one of those geniuses embittered by the world as Conseil expressed it a latter day Galileo
6232-36628-0013	train-other-500	or maybe one of those men of science like America s Commander Maury whose careers were ruined by political revolutions I couldn t say yet As for me whom fate had just brought aboard his vessel whose life he had held in the balance
6232-36628-0014	train-other-500	he had received me coolly but hospitably Only he never took the hand I extended to him He never extended his own For an entire hour I was deep in these musings trying to probe this mystery that fascinated me so
6232-36628-0015	train-other-500	Then my eyes focused on a huge world map displayed on the table and I put my finger on the very spot where our just determined longitude and latitude intersected Like the continents the sea has its rivers
6232-36628-0016	train-other-500	These are exclusive currents that can be identified by their temperature and color the most remarkable being the one called the Gulf Stream Science has defined the global paths of five chief currents one in the north Atlantic
6232-36628-0017	train-other-500	a second in the south Atlantic a third in the north Pacific a fourth in the south Pacific and a fifth in the southern Indian Ocean Also it s likely that a sixth current used to exist in the northern Indian Ocean when the Caspian and Aral Seas
none	none	 joined up with certain large Asian lakes to form a single uniform expanse of water 
6232-36628-0018	train-other-500	Now then at the spot indicated on the world map one of these seagoing rivers was rolling by the Kuroshio of the Japanese the Black Current heated by
6232-36628-0019	train-other-500	perpendicular rays from the tropical sun it leaves the Bay of Bengal crosses the Strait of Malacca
6232-36628-0020	train-other-500	goes up the shores of Asia and curves into the north Pacific as far as the Aleutian Islands carrying along trunks of camphor trees and other local items the pure indigo of its warm waters sharply contrasting with the ocean s waves
6232-36628-0021	train-other-500	It was this current the Nautilus was about to cross I watched it on the map with my eyes I saw it lose itself in the immenseness of the Pacific and I felt myself swept along with it when Ned Land and Conseil appeared in the lounge doorway
6232-36628-0022	train-other-500	My two gallant companions stood petrified at the sight of the wonders on display Where are we the Canadian exclaimed In the Quebec Museum Begging master s pardon Conseil answered but this seems more like the Sommerard artifacts exhibition
836_130900_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Where are we 
none	none	the Canadian exclaimed In the Quebec Museum Begging master s pardon Conseil answered but this seems more like the Sommerard artifacts exhibition 
6232-36628-0023	train-other-500	My friends I replied signaling them to enter you re in neither Canada nor France but securely aboard the Nautilus fifty meters below sea level
6232-36628-0024	train-other-500	If master says so then so be it Conseil answered But in all honesty this lounge is enough to astonish even someone Flemish like myself Indulge your astonishment my friend and have a look
6232-36628-0025	train-other-500	because there s plenty of work here for a classifier of your talents Conseil needed no encouraging Bending over the glass cases the gallant lad was already muttering choice words from the naturalist s vocabulary
6232-36628-0026	train-other-500	class Gastropoda family Buccinoidea genus cowry
none	none	 species Cypraea madagascariensis et cetera 
6232-36628-0027	train-other-500	Meanwhile Ned Land
none	none	 less dedicated to conchology questioned me about my interview with Captain Nemo 
6232-36628-0028	train-other-500	Had I discovered who he was where he came from where he was heading how deep he was taking us In short a thousand questions I had no time to answer I told him everything I knew or rather everything I didn t know and I asked him what he had seen or heard on his part
6232-36628-0029	train-other-500	Haven t seen or heard a thing the Canadian replied I haven t even spotted the crew of this boat By any chance could they be electric too Electric Oh ye gods I m half
6232-36628-0030	train-other-500	tempted to believe it But back to you Professor Aronnax Ned Land said still hanging on to his ideas Can t you tell me how many men are on board Ten twenty fifty a hundred I m unable to answer you mister Land And trust me on this
6232-36628-0031	train-other-500	for the time being get rid of these notions of taking over the Nautilus or escaping from it This boat is a masterpiece of modern technology
6232-36628-0032	train-other-500	and I d be sorry to have missed it Many people would welcome the circumstances that have been handed us just to walk in the midst of these wonders So keep calm and let s see what s happening around us
none	none	 See the harpooner exclaimed 
6232-36628-0033	train-other-500	There s nothing to see nothing we ll ever see from this sheet iron prison We re simply running around blindfolded Ned Land was just pronouncing these last words when we were suddenly plunged into darkness utter darkness The ceiling lights went out so quickly my eyes literally ached
6232-36628-0034	train-other-500	just as if we had experienced the opposite sensation of going from the deepest gloom to the brightest sunlight We stood stock still not knowing what surprise was waiting for us whether pleasant or unpleasant But a sliding sound became audible
6232-36628-0035	train-other-500	You could tell that some panels were shifting over the Nautilus s sides It s the beginning of the end
none	none	 Ned Land said order Hydromedusa Conseil muttered 
6232-36628-0036	train-other-500	Suddenly through two oblong openings daylight appeared on both sides of the lounge The liquid masses came into view brightly lit by the ship s electric outpourings We were separated from the sea by two panes of glass
6232-36628-0037	train-other-500	Initially I shuddered at the thought that these fragile partitions could break but strong copper bands secured them giving them nearly infinite resistance The sea was clearly visible for a one mile radius around the Nautilus What a sight
none	none	 What pen could describe it Who could portray the effects of this light through these translucent sheets of water the subtlety of its progressive shadings into the ocean s upper and lower strata 
6232-36628-0038	train-other-500	The transparency of salt water has long been recognized Its clarity is believed to exceed that of spring water
none	none	 The mineral and organic substances it holds in suspension actually increase its translucency In certain parts of the Caribbean Sea you can see the sandy bottom with startling distinctness as deep as one hundred forty five meters down 
6232-36628-0039	train-other-500	and the penetrating power of the sun s rays seems to give out only at a depth of three hundred meters But in this fluid setting traveled by the Nautilus our electric glow was being generated in the very heart of the waves
6232-36628-0040	train-other-500	It was no longer illuminated water it was liquid light If we accept the hypotheses of the microbiologist Ehrenberg
6232-36628-0041	train-other-500	who believes that these underwater depths are lit up by phosphorescent organisms nature has certainly saved one of her most prodigious sights for residents of the sea and I could judge for myself from the thousandfold play of the light
6232-36628-0042	train-other-500	On both sides I had windows opening over these unexplored depths The darkness in the lounge enhanced the brightness outside and we stared as if this clear glass were the window of an immense aquarium The Nautilus seemed to be standing still
6232-36628-0043	train-other-500	This was due to the lack of landmarks But streaks of water parted by the ship s spur sometimes threaded before our eyes with extraordinary speed In wonderment
6232-36628-0044	train-other-500	we leaned on our elbows before these show windows and our stunned silence remained unbroken until Conseil said You wanted to see something Ned my friend well now you have something to see
6232-36628-0045	train-other-500	How unusual the Canadian put in setting aside his tantrums and getaway schemes while submitting to this irresistible allure A man would go an even greater distance just to stare at such a sight
none	none	 Ah I exclaimed 
6232-36628-0046	train-other-500	I see our captain s way of life He s found himself a separate world that saves its most astonishing wonders just for him But where are the fish the Canadian ventured to observe I don t see any fish
6232-36628-0047	train-other-500	Why would you care Ned my friend Conseil replied Since you have no knowledge of them Me A fisherman Ned Land exclaimed And on this subject a dispute arose between the two friends since both were knowledgeable about fish but from totally different standpoints
none	none	 Everyone knows that fish make up the fourth and last class in the vertebrate branch They have been quite aptly defined as cold blooded vertebrates with a double circulatory system breathing through gills and designed to live in water They consist of two distinct series the series of bony fish in other words those whose spines have vertebrae made of bone and cartilaginous fish in other words those whose spines have vertebrae made of cartilage 
6232-36628-0048	train-other-500	Possibly the Canadian was familiar with this distinction but Conseil knew far more about it
none	none	 and since he and Ned were now fast friends he just had to show off 
6232-36628-0049	train-other-500	So he told the harpooner Ned my friend you re a slayer of fish a highly skilled fisherman You ve caught a large number of these fascinating animals But I ll bet you don t know how they re classified
6232-36628-0050	train-other-500	Sure I do the harpooner replied in all seriousness They re classified into fish we eat and fish we don t eat Spoken like a true glutton Conseil replied But tell me are you familiar with the differences between bony fish and cartilaginous fish
6232-36628-0051	train-other-500	Just maybe Conseil And how about the subdivisions of these two large classes I haven t the foggiest notion the Canadian replied All right listen and learn Ned my friend Bony fish are subdivided into six orders
6232-36628-0052	train-other-500	Primo the acanthopterygians whose upper jaw is fully formed and free moving and whose gills take the shape of a comb This order consists of fifteen families in other words three quarters of all known fish Example the common perch
6232-36628-0053	train-other-500	Pretty fair eating Ned Land replied Secundo Conseil went on the abdominals whose pelvic fins hang under the abdomen to the rear of the pectorals
none	none	 but aren t attached to the shoulder bone an order that s divided into five families and makes up the great majority of freshwater fish Examples carp 
6232-36628-0054	train-other-500	pike Ugh the Canadian put in with distinct scorn
none	none	 You can keep the freshwater fish Tertio 
6232-36628-0055	train-other-500	Conseil said the subbrachians whose pelvic fins are attached under the pectorals and hang directly from the shoulder bone This order contains four families Examples
6232-36628-0056	train-other-500	flatfish such as sole turbot dab plaice brill et cetera Excellent really excellent the harpooner exclaimed interested in fish only from an edible viewpoint Quarto Conseil went on unabashed the apods
6232-36628-0057	train-other-500	with long bodies that lack pelvic fins and are covered by a heavy often glutinous skin an order consisting of only one family Examples common eels and electric eels So so just so so Ned Land replied
6232-36628-0058	train-other-500	Quinto Conseil said the lophobranchians which have fully formed free moving jaws but whose gills consist of little tufts arranged in pairs along their gill arches
6232-36628-0059	train-other-500	This order includes only one family Examples seahorses and dragonfish Bad very bad the harpooner replied Sexto and last Conseil said
6232-36628-0060	train-other-500	the plectognaths whose maxillary bone is firmly attached to the side of the intermaxillary that forms the jaw
none	none	 and whose palate arch is locked to the skull by sutures that render the jaw immovable an order lacking true pelvic fins and which consists of two families Examples puffers and moonfish They re an insult to a frying pan the Canadian exclaimed 
6232-36628-0061	train-other-500	Are you grasping all this Ned my friend asked the scholarly Conseil Not a lick of it Conseil my friend the harpooner replied But keep going because you fill me with fascination As for cartilaginous fish Conseil went on unflappably
6232-36628-0062	train-other-500	they consist of only three orders Good news Ned put in Primo the cyclostomes whose jaws are fused into a flexible ring and whose gill openings are simply a large number of holes an order consisting of only one family
6232-36628-0063	train-other-500	Example the lamprey An acquired taste Ned Land replied Secundo the selacians with gills resembling those of the cyclostomes but whose lower jaw is free moving
6232-36628-0064	train-other-500	This order which is the most important in the class consists of two families Examples the ray and the shark What Ned Land exclaimed Rays and man eaters in the same order Well Conseil my friend on behalf of the rays
none	none	 I wouldn t advise you to put them in the same fish tank Tertio Conseil replied The sturionians 
6232-36628-0065	train-other-500	whose gill opening is the usual single slit adorned with a gill cover an order consisting of four genera Example the sturgeon
none	none	 Ah Conseil my friend you saved the best for last in my opinion anyhow 
6232-36628-0066	train-other-500	And that s all of em Yes my gallant Ned Conseil replied And note well even when one has grasped all this one still knows next to nothing because these families are subdivided into genera subgenera species varieties
6232-36628-0067	train-other-500	All right Conseil my friend the harpooner said leaning toward the glass panel
none	none	 here come a couple of your varieties now 
6232-36628-0068	train-other-500	Yes Fish Conseil exclaimed One would think he was in front of an aquarium No I replied because an aquarium is nothing more than a cage and these fish are as free as birds in the air
6232-36628-0069	train-other-500	Well Conseil my friend identify them Start naming them Ned Land exclaimed Me Conseil replied I m unable to That s my employer s bailiwick And in truth although the fine lad was a classifying maniac
6232-36628-0070	train-other-500	he was no naturalist and I doubt that he could tell a bonito from a tuna In short he was the exact opposite of the Canadian who knew nothing about classification but could instantly put a name to any fish A triggerfish I said
6232-36628-0071	train-other-500	It s a Chinese triggerfish Ned Land replied Genus Balistes family Scleroderma order Plectognatha Conseil muttered
6232-36628-0072	train-other-500	Assuredly Ned and Conseil in combination added up to one outstanding naturalist The Canadian was not mistaken Cavorting around the Nautilus was a school of triggerfish
6232-36628-0073	train-other-500	with flat bodies grainy skins armed with stings on their dorsal fins and with four prickly rows of quills quivering on both sides of their tails Nothing could have been more wonderful than the skin covering them white underneath gray above
6232-36628-0074	train-other-500	with spots of gold sparkling in the dark eddies of the waves Around them rays were undulating like sheets flapping in the wind and among these I spotted much to my glee
6232-36628-0075	train-other-500	a Chinese ray yellowish on its topside a dainty pink on its belly and armed with three stings behind its eyes
6232-36628-0076	train-other-500	a rare species whose very existence was still doubted in Lacepede s day since that pioneering classifier of fish had seen one only in a portfolio of Japanese drawings
6232-36628-0077	train-other-500	For two hours a whole aquatic army escorted the Nautilus In the midst of their leaping and cavorting while they competed with each other in beauty radiance and speed I could distinguish some green wrasse bewhiskered mullet marked with pairs of black lines
6232-36628-0078	train-other-500	white gobies from the genus Eleotris with curved caudal fins and violet spots on the back wonderful Japanese mackerel from the genus Scomber with blue bodies and silver heads glittering azure goldfish
6232-36628-0079	train-other-500	whose name by itself gives their full description several varieties of porgy or gilthead some banded gilthead with fins variously blue and yellow some with horizontal heraldic bars and enhanced by a black strip around their caudal area
6232-36628-0080	train-other-500	some with color zones and elegantly corseted in their six waistbands trumpetfish with flutelike beaks that looked like genuine seafaring woodcocks and were sometimes a meter long
6232-36628-0081	train-other-500	Japanese salamanders serpentine moray eels from the genus Echidna that were six feet long with sharp little eyes and a huge mouth bristling with teeth et cetera
6232-36628-0082	train-other-500	Our wonderment stayed at an all time fever pitch Our exclamations were endless Ned identified the fish Conseil classified them and as for me I was in ecstasy over the verve of their movements and the beauty of their forms
6232-36628-0083	train-other-500	Never before had I been given the chance to glimpse these animals alive and at large in their native element Given such a complete collection from the seas of Japan and China I won t mention every variety that passed before our dazzled eyes
6232-36628-0084	train-other-500	More numerous than birds in the air these fish raced right up to us no doubt attracted by the brilliant glow of our electric beacon Suddenly daylight appeared in the lounge The sheet iron panels slid shut
6232-36628-0085	train-other-500	The magical vision disappeared But for a good while I kept dreaming away until the moment my eyes focused on the instruments hanging on the wall
none	none	 The compass still showed our heading as east northeast the pressure gauge indicated a pressure of five atmospheres 
6232-36628-0086	train-other-500	corresponding to a depth of fifty meters
none	none	 and the electric log gave our speed as fifteen miles per hour 
6232-36628-0087	train-other-500	I waited for Captain Nemo But he didn t appear The clock marked the hour of five Ned Land and Conseil returned to their cabin As for me I repaired to my stateroom There I found dinner ready for me
836_130900_000009_000000	train-clean-360	I repaired to my stateroom 
none	none	There I found dinner ready for me 
6232-36628-0088	train-other-500	It consisted of turtle soup made from the daintiest hawksbill a red mullet with white slightly flaky flesh whose liver when separately prepared makes delicious eating plus loin of imperial angelfish whose flavor struck me as even better than salmon
none	none	 I spent the evening in reading writing and thinking Then drowsiness overtook me I stretched out on my eelgrass mattress and I fell into a deep slumber while the Nautilus glided through the swiftly flowing Black Current CHAPTER fifteen An Invitation in Writing THE NEXT DAY November nine I woke up only after a long twelve hour slumber Conseil a creature of habit came to ask how master s night went and to offer his services He had left his Canadian friend sleeping like a man who had never done anything else I let the gallant lad babble as he pleased without giving him much in the way of a reply I was concerned about Captain Nemo s absence during our session the previous afternoon and I hoped to see him again today Soon I had put on my clothes which were woven from strands of seashell tissue More than once their composition provoked comments from Conseil I informed him that they were made from the smooth silken filaments with which the fan mussel a type of seashell quite abundant along Mediterranean beaches attaches itself to rocks In olden times fine fabrics stockings and gloves were made from such filaments because they were both very soft and very warm So the Nautilus s crew could dress themselves at little cost without needing a thing from cotton growers sheep or silkworms on shore As soon as I was dressed I made my way to the main lounge 
836_130900_000005_000002	train-clean-360	It was deserted 
none	none	I dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside the glass cases I also investigated the huge plant albums that were filled with the rarest marine herbs which although they were pressed and dried still kept their wonderful colors Among these valuable water plants I noted various seaweed some Cladostephus verticillatus peacock s tails fig leafed caulerpa grain bearing beauty bushes delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet sea colander arranged into fan shapes mermaid s cups that looked like the caps of squat mushrooms and for years had been classified among the zoophytes in short a complete series of algae The entire day passed without my being honored by a visit from Captain Nemo The panels in the lounge didn t open Perhaps they didn t want us to get tired of these beautiful things The Nautilus kept to an east northeasterly heading a speed of twelve miles per hour and a depth between fifty and sixty meters Next day November ten the same neglect the same solitude I didn t see a soul from the crew Ned and Conseil spent the better part of the day with me They were astonished at the captain s inexplicable absence Was this eccentric man ill Did he want to change his plans concerning us But after all as Conseil noted we enjoyed complete freedom we were daintily and abundantly fed Our host had kept to the terms of his agreement We couldn t complain and moreover the very uniqueness of our situation had such generous rewards in store for us we had no grounds for criticism That day I started my diary of these adventures which has enabled me to narrate them with the most scrupulous accuracy and one odd detail I wrote it on paper manufactured from marine eelgrass Early in the morning on November eleven fresh air poured through the Nautilus s interior informing me that we had returned to the surface of the ocean to renew our oxygen supply I headed for the central companionway and climbed onto the platform It was six o clock I found the weather overcast the sea gray but calm Hardly a billow I hoped to encounter Captain Nemo there would he come I saw only the helmsman imprisoned in his glass windowed pilothouse Seated on the ledge furnished by the hull of the skiff I inhaled the sea s salty aroma with great pleasure Little by little the mists were dispersed under the action of the sun s rays The radiant orb cleared the eastern horizon Under its gaze the sea caught on fire like a trail of gunpowder Scattered on high the clouds were colored in bright wonderfully shaded hues and numerous ladyfingers warned of daylong winds Author s Note Ladyfingers are small thin white clouds with ragged edges But what were mere winds to this Nautilus which no storms could intimidate So I was marveling at this delightful sunrise so life giving and cheerful when I heard someone climbing onto the platform I was prepared to greet Captain Nemo but it was his chief officer who appeared whom I had already met during our first visit with the captain He advanced over the platform not seeming to notice my presence A powerful spyglass to his eye he scrutinized every point of the horizon with the utmost care Then his examination over he approached the hatch and pronounced a phrase whose exact wording follows below I remember it because every morning it was repeated under the same circumstances It ran like this Nautron respoc lorni virch What it meant I was unable to say These words pronounced the chief officer went below again I thought the Nautilus was about to resume its underwater navigating So I went down the hatch and back through the gangways to my stateroom Five days passed in this way with no change in our situation Every morning 
835_130876_000038_000000	train-clean-360	I climbed onto the platform 
none	none	The same phrase was pronounced by the same individual Captain Nemo did not appear I was pursuing the policy that we had seen the last of him when on November sixteen while reentering my stateroom with Ned and Conseil I found a note addressed to me on the table I opened it impatiently It was written in a script that was clear and neat but a bit Old English in style its characters reminding me of German calligraphy The note was worded as follows Professor Aronnax Aboard the Nautilus November sixteen eighteen sixty seven Captain Nemo invites Professor Aronnax on a hunting trip that will take place tomorrow morning in his Crespo Island forests He hopes nothing will prevent the professor from attending and he looks forward with pleasure to the professor s companions joining him CAPTAIN NEMO Commander of the Nautilus A hunting trip Ned exclaimed And in his forests on Crespo Island Conseil added But does this mean the old boy goes ashore Ned Land went on That seems to be the gist of it I said rereading the letter Well we ve got to accept the Canadian answered Once we re on solid ground we ll figure out a course of action Besides it wouldn t pain me to eat a couple slices of fresh venison Without trying to reconcile the contradictions between Captain Nemo s professed horror of continents or islands and his invitation to go hunting in a forest I was content to reply First let s look into this Crespo Island I consulted the world map and in latitude thirty two degrees forty north and longitude one hundred sixty seven degrees fifty west I found an islet that had been discovered in eighteen oh one by Captain Crespo which old Spanish charts called Rocca de la Plata in other words Silver Rock So we were about eighteen hundred miles from our starting point and by a slight change of heading the Nautilus was bringing us back toward the southeast I showed my companions this small stray rock in the middle of the north Pacific If Captain Nemo does sometimes go ashore I told them at least he only picks desert islands Ned Land shook his head without replying then he and Conseil left me After supper was served me by the mute and emotionless steward I fell asleep but not without some anxieties When I woke up the next day November seventeen I sensed that the Nautilus was completely motionless I dressed hurriedly and entered the main lounge Captain Nemo was there waiting for me He stood up bowed and asked if it suited me to come along Since he made no allusion to his absence the past eight days I also refrained from mentioning it and I simply answered that my companions and I were ready to go with him Only sir I added I ll take the liberty of addressing a question to you Address away Professor Aronnax and if I m able to answer I will Well then captain how is it that you ve severed all ties with the shore yet you own forests on Crespo Island Professor the captain answered me these forests of mine don t bask in the heat and light of the sun They aren t frequented by lions tigers panthers or other quadrupeds They re known only to me They grow only for me These forests aren t on land they re actual underwater forests Underwater forests I exclaimed Yes professor And you re offering to take me to them Precisely On foot Without getting your feet wet While hunting While hunting
6235_36641_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Rifles 
none	none	in hand Rifles in hand I stared at the Nautilus s commander with an air anything but flattering to the man Assuredly I said to myself he s contracted some mental illness He s had a fit that s lasted eight days and isn t over even yet What a shame I liked him better eccentric than insane These thoughts were clearly readable on my face but Captain Nemo remained content with inviting me to follow him and I did so like a man resigned to the worst We arrived at the dining room where we found breakfast served Professor Aronnax the captain told me I beg you to share my breakfast without formality We can chat while we eat Because although I promised you a stroll in my forests I made no pledge to arrange for your encountering a restaurant there Accordingly eat your breakfast like a man who ll probably eat dinner only when it s extremely late I did justice to this meal It was made up of various fish and some slices of sea cucumber that praiseworthy zoophyte all garnished with such highly appetizing seaweed as the Porphyra laciniata and the Laurencia primafetida Our beverage consisted of clear water to which following the captain s example I added some drops of a fermented liquor extracted by the Kamchatka process from the seaweed known by name as Rhodymenia palmata At first Captain Nemo ate without pronouncing a single word Then he told me Professor when I proposed that you go hunting in my Crespo forests you thought I was contradicting myself When I informed you that it was an issue of underwater forests you thought I d gone insane Professor you must never make snap judgments about your fellow man But captain believe me Kindly listen to me and you ll see if you have grounds for accusing me of insanity or self contradiction I m all attention Professor you know as well as I do that a man can live underwater so long as he carries with him his own supply of breathable air For underwater work projects the workman wears a waterproof suit with his head imprisoned in a metal capsule while he receives air from above by means of force pumps and flow regulators That s the standard equipment for a diving suit I said Correct but under such conditions the man has no freedom He s attached to a pump that sends him air through an india rubber hose it s an actual chain that fetters him to the shore and if we were to be bound in this way to the Nautilus we couldn t go far either Then how do you break free I asked We use the Rouquayrol Denayrouze device invented by two of your fellow countrymen but refined by me for my own special uses thereby enabling you to risk these new physiological conditions without suffering any organic disorders It consists of a tank built from heavy sheet iron in which I store air under a pressure of fifty atmospheres This tank is fastened to the back by means of straps like a soldier s knapsack Its top part forms a box where the air is regulated by a bellows mechanism and can be released only at its proper tension In the Rouquayrol device that has been in general use two india rubber hoses leave this box and feed to a kind of tent that imprisons the operator s nose and mouth one hose is for the entrance of air to be inhaled the other for the exit of air to be exhaled and the tongue closes off the former or the latter depending on the breather s needs But in my case since I face considerable pressures at the bottom of the sea I needed to enclose my head in a copper sphere like those found on standard diving suits and the two hoses for inhalation and exhalation now feed to that sphere That s perfect Captain Nemo but the air you carry must be quickly depleted and once it contains no more than fifteen oxygen it becomes unfit for breathing Surely but as I told you Professor Aronnax the Nautilus s pumps enable me to store air under considerable pressure and given this circumstance the tank on my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours I ve no more objections to raise I replied I ll only ask you captain how can you light your way at the bottom of the ocean With the Ruhmkorff device Professor Aronnax If the first is carried on the back the second is fastened to the belt It consists of a Bunsen battery that I activate not with potassium dichromate but with sodium An induction coil gathers the electricity generated and directs it to a specially designed lantern In this lantern one finds a glass spiral that contains only a residue of carbon dioxide gas When the device is operating this gas becomes luminous and gives off a continuous whitish light Thus provided for I breathe and I see Captain Nemo to my every objection you give such crushing answers I m afraid to entertain a single doubt However though I have no choice but to accept both the Rouquayrol and Ruhmkorff devices I d like to register some reservations about the rifle with which you ll equip me But it isn t a rifle that uses gunpowder the captain replied Then it s an air gun Surely How can I make gunpowder on my ship when I have no saltpeter sulfur or charcoal Even so I replied to fire underwater in a medium that s eight hundred fifty five times denser than air you d have to overcome considerable resistance That doesn t necessarily follow There are certain Fulton style guns perfected by the Englishmen Philippe Coles and Burley the Frenchman Furcy and the Italian Landi they re equipped with a special system of airtight fastenings and can fire in underwater conditions But I repeat having no gunpowder I ve replaced it with air at high pressure which is abundantly supplied me by the Nautilus s pumps But this air must be swiftly depleted Well in a pinch can t my Rouquayrol tank supply me with more All I have to do is draw it from an ad hoc spigot Besides Professor Aronnax you ll see for yourself that during these underwater hunting trips we make no great expenditure of either air or bullets Latin a spigot just for that purpose Ed But it seems to me that in this semidarkness amid this liquid that s so dense in comparison to the atmosphere a gunshot couldn t carry far and would prove fatal only with difficulty On the contrary sir with this rifle every shot is fatal and as soon as the animal is hit no matter how lightly it falls as if struck by lightning Why Because this rifle doesn t shoot ordinary bullets but little glass capsules invented by the Austrian chemist Leniebroek and I have a considerable supply of them These glass capsules are covered with a strip of steel and weighted with a lead base they re genuine little Leyden jars charged with high voltage electricity They go off at the slightest impact and the animal no matter how strong drops dead I might add that these capsules are no bigger than number four shot and the chamber of any ordinary rifle could hold ten of them I ll quit debating I replied getting up from the table And all that s left is for me to shoulder my rifle So where you go I ll go Captain Nemo led me to the Nautilus s stern and passing by Ned and Conseil s cabin I summoned my two companions who instantly followed us Then we arrived at a cell located within easy access of the engine room in this cell we were to get dressed for our stroll 
405_130894_000004_000000	train-clean-100	CHAPTER sixteen
none	none	 Strolling the Plains THIS CELL properly speaking was the Nautilus s arsenal and wardrobe Hanging from its walls a dozen diving outfits were waiting for anybody who wanted to take a stroll After seeing these Ned Land exhibited an obvious distaste for the idea of putting one on But my gallant Ned I told him the forests of Crespo Island are simply underwater forests Oh great put in the disappointed harpooner watching his dreams of fresh meat fade away And you Professor Aronnax are you going to stick yourself inside these clothes It has to be mister Ned Have it your way sir the harpooner replied shrugging his shoulders But speaking for myself I ll never get into those things unless they force me No one will force you mister Land Captain Nemo said And is Conseil going to risk it Ned asked Where master goes I go Conseil replied At the captain s summons two crewmen came to help us put on these heavy waterproof clothes made from seamless india rubber and expressly designed to bear considerable pressures They were like suits of armor that were both yielding and resistant you might say These clothes consisted of jacket and pants The pants ended in bulky footwear adorned with heavy lead soles The fabric of the jacket was reinforced with copper mail that shielded the chest protected it from the water s pressure and allowed the lungs to function freely the sleeves ended in supple gloves that didn t impede hand movements These perfected diving suits it was easy to see were a far cry from such misshapen costumes as the cork breastplates leather jumpers seagoing tunics barrel helmets et cetera invented and acclaimed in the eighteenth century Conseil and I were soon dressed in these diving suits as were Captain Nemo and one of his companions a herculean type who must have been prodigiously strong All that remained was to encase one s head in its metal sphere But before proceeding with this operation I asked the captain for permission to examine the rifles set aside for us One of the Nautilus s men presented me with a streamlined rifle whose butt was boilerplate steel hollow inside and of fairly large dimensions This served as a tank for the compressed air which a trigger operated valve could release into the metal chamber In a groove where the butt was heaviest a cartridge clip held some twenty electric bullets that by means of a spring automatically took their places in the barrel of the rifle As soon as one shot had been fired another was ready to go off Captain Nemo I said this is an ideal easy to use weapon I ask only to put it to the test But how will we reach the bottom of the sea Right now professor the Nautilus is aground in ten meters of water and we ve only to depart But how will we set out You ll see Captain Nemo inserted his cranium into its spherical headgear Conseil and I did the same but not without hearing the Canadian toss us a sarcastic happy hunting On top the suit ended in a collar of threaded copper onto which the metal helmet was screwed Three holes protected by heavy glass allowed us to see in any direction with simply a turn of the head inside the sphere Placed on our backs the Rouquayrol device went into operation as soon as it was in position and for my part I could breathe with ease The Ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt my rifle in hand I was ready to go forth But in all honesty while imprisoned in these heavy clothes and nailed to the deck by my lead soles it was impossible for me to take a single step But this circumstance had been foreseen because I felt myself propelled into a little room adjoining the wardrobe Towed in the same way my companions went with me I heard a door with watertight seals close after us and we were surrounded by profound darkness After some minutes a sharp hissing reached my ears I felt a distinct sensation of cold rising from my feet to my chest Apparently a stopcock inside the boat was letting in water from outside which overran us and soon filled up the room Contrived in the Nautilus s side a second door then opened We were lit by a subdued light An instant later our feet were treading the bottom of the sea And now how can I convey the impressions left on me by this stroll under the waters Words are powerless to describe such wonders When even the painter s brush can t depict the effects unique to the liquid element how can the writer s pen hope to reproduce them Captain Nemo walked in front and his companion followed us a few steps to the rear Conseil and I stayed next to each other as if daydreaming that through our metal carapaces a little polite conversation might still be possible Already I no longer felt the bulkiness of my clothes footwear and air tank nor the weight of the heavy sphere inside which my head was rattling like an almond in its shell Once immersed in water all these objects lost a part of their weight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced and thanks to this law of physics discovered by Archimedes I did just fine I was no longer an inert mass and I had comparatively speaking great freedom of movement Lighting up the seafloor even thirty feet beneath the surface of the ocean the sun astonished me with its power The solar rays easily crossed this aqueous mass and dispersed its dark colors I could easily distinguish objects one hundred meters away Farther on the bottom was tinted with fine shades of ultramarine then off in the distance it turned blue and faded in the midst of a hazy darkness Truly this water surrounding me was just a kind of air denser than the atmosphere on land but almost as transparent Above me I could see the calm surface of the ocean We were walking on sand that was fine grained and smooth not wrinkled like beach sand which preserves the impressions left by the waves This dazzling carpet was a real mirror throwing back the sun s rays with startling intensity The outcome an immense vista of reflections that penetrated every liquid molecule Will anyone believe me if I assert that at this thirty foot depth I could see as if it was broad daylight For a quarter of an hour I trod this blazing sand which was strewn with tiny crumbs of seashell Looming like a long reef the Nautilus s hull disappeared little by little but when night fell in the midst of the waters the ship s beacon would surely facilitate our return on board since its rays carried with perfect distinctness This effect is difficult to understand for anyone who has never seen light beams so sharply defined on shore There the dust that saturates the air gives such rays the appearance of a luminous fog but above water as well as underwater shafts of electric light are transmitted with incomparable clarity Meanwhile we went ever onward and these vast plains of sand seemed endless My hands parted liquid curtains that closed again behind me and my footprints faded swiftly under the water s pressure Soon scarcely blurred by their distance from us the forms of some objects took shape before my eyes I recognized the lower slopes of some magnificent rocks carpeted by the finest zoophyte specimens and right off I was struck by an effect unique to this medium By then it was ten o clock in the morning The sun s rays hit the surface of the waves at a fairly oblique angle decomposing by refraction as though passing through a prism and when this light came in contact with flowers rocks buds seashells and polyps the edges of these objects were shaded with all seven hues of the solar spectrum This riot of rainbow tints was a wonder a feast for the eyes a genuine kaleidoscope of red green yellow orange violet indigo and blue in short the whole palette of a color happy painter If only I had been able to share with Conseil the intense sensations rising in my brain competing with him in exclamations of wonderment If only I had known like Captain Nemo and his companion how to exchange thoughts by means of prearranged signals So for lack of anything better I talked to myself I declaimed inside this copper box that topped my head spending more air on empty words than was perhaps advisable Conseil like me had stopped before this splendid sight Obviously in the presence of these zoophyte and mollusk specimens the fine lad was classifying his head off Polyps and echinoderms abounded on the seafloor various isis coral cornularian coral living in isolation tufts of virginal genus Oculina formerly known by the name white coral prickly fungus coral in the shape of mushrooms sea anemone holding on by their muscular disks providing a literal flowerbed adorned by jellyfish from the genus Porpita wearing collars of azure tentacles and starfish that spangled the sand including veinlike feather stars from the genus Asterophyton that were like fine lace embroidered by the hands of water nymphs their festoons swaying to the faint undulations caused by our walking It filled me with real chagrin to crush underfoot the gleaming mollusk samples that littered the seafloor by the thousands concentric comb shells hammer shells coquina seashells that actually hop around top shell snails red helmet shells angel wing conchs sea hares and so many other exhibits from this inexhaustible ocean But we had to keep walking and we went forward while overhead there scudded schools of Portuguese men of war that let their ultramarine tentacles drift in their wakes medusas whose milky white or dainty pink parasols were festooned with azure tassels and shaded us from the sun s rays plus jellyfish of the species Pelagia panopyra that in the dark would have strewn our path with phosphorescent glimmers All these wonders I glimpsed in the space of a quarter of a mile barely pausing following Captain Nemo whose gestures kept beckoning me onward Soon the nature of the seafloor changed The plains of sand were followed by a bed of that viscous slime Americans call ooze which is composed exclusively of seashells rich in limestone or silica Then we crossed a prairie of algae open sea plants that the waters hadn t yet torn loose whose vegetation grew in wild profusion Soft to the foot these densely textured lawns would have rivaled the most luxuriant carpets woven by the hand of man But while this greenery was sprawling under our steps it didn t neglect us overhead The surface of the water was crisscrossed by a floating arbor of marine plants belonging to that superabundant algae family that numbers more than two thousand known species I saw long ribbons of fucus drifting above me some globular others tubular Laurencia Cladostephus with the slenderest foliage Rhodymenia palmata resembling the fan shapes of cactus I observed that green colored plants kept closer to the surface of the sea while reds occupied a medium depth which left blacks and browns in charge of designing gardens and flowerbeds in the ocean s lower strata These algae are a genuine prodigy of creation one of the wonders of world flora This family produces both the biggest and smallest vegetables in the world Because just as forty thousand near invisible buds have been counted in one five square millimeter space so also have fucus plants been gathered that were over five hundred meters long We had been gone from the Nautilus for about an hour and a half It was almost noon I spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the sun s rays which were no longer refracted The magic of these solar colors disappeared little by little with emerald and sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether We walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity The tiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore In fact water is a better conductor of sound than air and under the waves noises carry four times as fast Just then the seafloor began to slope sharply downward The light took on a uniform hue We reached a depth of one hundred meters by which point we were undergoing a pressure of ten atmospheres But my diving clothes were built along such lines that I never suffered from this pressure I felt only a certain tightness in the joints of my fingers and even this discomfort soon disappeared As for the exhaustion bound to accompany a two hour stroll in such unfamiliar trappings it was nil Helped by the water my movements were executed with startling ease Arriving at this three hundred foot depth I still detected the sun s rays but just barely Their intense brilliance had been followed by a reddish twilight a midpoint between day and night But we could see well enough to find our way and it still wasn t necessary to activate the Ruhmkorff device Just then Captain Nemo stopped He waited until I joined him then he pointed a finger at some dark masses outlined in the shadows a short distance away It s the forest of Crespo Island I thought and I was not mistaken

none	none	 An Underwater Forest WE HAD FINALLY arrived on the outskirts of this forest surely one of the finest in Captain Nemo s immense domains He regarded it as his own and had laid the same claim to it that in the first days of the world the first men had to their forests on land Besides who else could dispute his ownership of this underwater property What other bolder pioneer would come ax in hand to clear away its dark underbrush This forest was made up of big treelike plants and when we entered beneath their huge arches my eyes were instantly struck by the unique arrangement of their branches an arrangement that I had never before encountered None of the weeds carpeting the seafloor none of the branches bristling from the shrubbery crept or leaned or stretched on a horizontal plane They all rose right up toward the surface of the ocean Every filament or ribbon no matter how thin stood ramrod straight Fucus plants and creepers were growing in stiff perpendicular lines governed by the density of the element that generated them After I parted them with my hands these otherwise motionless plants would shoot right back to their original positions It was the regime of verticality I soon grew accustomed to this bizarre arrangement likewise to the comparative darkness surrounding us The seafloor in this forest was strewn with sharp chunks of stone that were hard to avoid Here the range of underwater flora seemed pretty comprehensive to me as well as more abundant than it might have been in the arctic or tropical zones where such exhibits are less common But for a few minutes I kept accidentally confusing the two kingdoms mistaking zoophytes for water plants animals for vegetables And who hasn t made the same blunder Flora and fauna are so closely associated in the underwater world I observed that all these exhibits from the vegetable kingdom were attached to the seafloor by only the most makeshift methods They had no roots and didn t care which solid objects secured them sand shells husks or pebbles they didn t ask their hosts for sustenance just a point of purchase These plants are entirely self propagating and the principle of their existence lies in the water that sustains and nourishes them In place of leaves most of them sprouted blades of unpredictable shape which were confined to a narrow gamut of colors consisting only of pink crimson green olive tan and brown There I saw again but

shoots twisting strings of kelp from the genus Nereocystis that bloomed to a height of fifteen meters bouquets of mermaid s cups whose stems grew wider at the top and a number of other open sea plants all without flowers It s an odd anomaly in this bizarre element as one witty naturalist puts it The animal kingdom blossoms and the vegetable kingdom doesn t These various types of shrubbery were as big as trees in the temperate zones in the damp shade between them there were clustered actual bushes of moving flowers hedges of zoophytes in which there grew stony coral striped with twisting furrows yellowish sea anemone from the genus Caryophylia with translucent tentacles plus anemone with grassy tufts from the genus Zoantharia and to complete the illusion minnows flitted from branch to branch like a swarm of hummingbirds while there rose underfoot like a covey of snipe yellow fish from the genus Lepisocanthus with bristling jaws and sharp scales flying gurnards and pinecone fish Near one o clock Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt Speaking for myself I was glad to oblige and we stretched out beneath an arbor of winged kelp whose long thin tendrils stood up like arrows This short break was a delight It lacked only the charm of conversation But it was impossible to speak impossible to reply I simply nudged my big copper headpiece against Conseil s headpiece I saw a happy gleam in the gallant lad s eyes and to communicate his pleasure he jiggled around inside his carapace in the world s silliest way After four hours of strolling I was quite astonished not to feel any intense hunger What kept my stomach in such a good mood I m unable to say But in exchange I experienced that irresistible desire for sleep that comes over every diver Accordingly my eyes soon closed behind their heavy glass windows and I fell into an uncontrollable doze which until then I had been able to fight off only through the movements of our walking Captain Nemo and his muscular companion were already stretched out in this clear crystal setting us a fine naptime example How long I was sunk in this torpor I cannot estimate but when I awoke it seemed as if the sun were settling toward the horizon Captain Nemo was already up and I had started to stretch my limbs when an unexpected apparition brought me sharply to my feet A few paces away a monstrous meter high sea spider was staring at me with beady eyes poised to spring at me Although my diving suit was heavy enough to protect me from this animal s bites I couldn t keep back a shudder of horror Just then Conseil woke up together with the Nautilus s sailor Captain Nemo alerted his companion to this hideous crustacean which a swing of the rifle butt quickly brought down and I watched the monster s horrible legs writhing in dreadful convulsions This encounter reminded me that other more daunting animals must be lurking in these dark reaches and my diving suit might not be adequate protection against their attacks Such thoughts hadn t previously crossed my mind and I was determined to keep on my guard Meanwhile I had assumed this rest period would be the turning point in our stroll but I was mistaken and instead of heading back to the Nautilus Captain Nemo continued his daring excursion The seafloor kept sinking and its significantly steeper slope took us to greater depths It must have been nearly three o clock when we reached a narrow valley gouged between high vertical walls and located one hundred fifty meters down Thanks to the perfection of our equipment we had thus gone ninety meters below the limit that nature had until then set on man s underwater excursions I say one hundred fifty meters although I had no instruments for estimating this distance But I knew that the sun s rays even in the clearest seas could reach no deeper So at precisely this point the darkness became profound Not a single object was visible past ten paces Consequently I had begun to grope my way when suddenly I saw the glow of an intense white light Captain Nemo had just activated his electric device His companion did likewise Conseil and I followed suit By turning a switch I established contact between the induction coil and the glass spiral and the sea lit up by our four lanterns was illuminated for a radius of twenty five meters Captain Nemo continued to plummet into the dark depths of this forest whose shrubbery grew ever more sparse I observed that vegetable life was disappearing more quickly than animal life The open sea plants had already left behind the increasingly arid seafloor where a prodigious number of animals were still swarming zoophytes articulates mollusks and fish While we were walking I thought the lights of our Ruhmkorff devices would automatically attract some inhabitants of these dark strata But if they did approach us at least they kept at a distance regrettable from the hunter s standpoint Several times I saw Captain Nemo stop and take aim with his rifle then after sighting down its barrel for a few seconds he would straighten up and resume his walk Finally at around four o clock this marvelous excursion came to an end A wall of superb rocks stood before us imposing in its sheer mass a pile of gigantic stone blocks an enormous granite cliffside pitted with dark caves but not offering a single gradient we could climb up This was the underpinning of Crespo Island This was land The captain stopped suddenly A gesture from him brought us to a halt and however much I wanted to clear this wall I had to stop Here ended the domains of Captain Nemo He had no desire to pass beyond them Farther on lay a part of the globe he would no longer tread underfoot Our return journey began Captain Nemo resumed the lead in our little band always heading forward without hesitation I noted that we didn t follow the same path in returning to the Nautilus This new route very steep and hence very arduous quickly took us close to the surface of the sea But this return to the upper strata wasn t so sudden that decompression took place too quickly which could have led to serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers With great promptness the light reappeared and grew stronger and the refraction of the sun already low on the horizon again ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum At a depth of ten meters we walked amid a swarm of small fish from every species more numerous than birds in the air more agile too but no aquatic game worthy of a gunshot had yet been offered to our eyes Just then I saw the captain s weapon spring to his shoulder and track a moving object through the bushes A shot went off I heard a faint hissing and an animal dropped a few paces away literally struck by lightning It was a magnificent sea otter from the genus Enhydra the only exclusively marine quadruped One and a half meters long this otter had to be worth a good high price Its coat chestnut brown above and silver below would have made one of those wonderful fur pieces so much in demand in the Russian and Chinese markets the fineness and luster of its pelt guaranteed that it would go for at least two thousand francs I was full of wonderment at this unusual mammal with its circular head adorned by short ears its round eyes its white whiskers like those on a cat its webbed and clawed feet its bushy tail Hunted and trapped by fishermen this valuable carnivore has become extremely rare and it takes refuge chiefly in the northernmost parts of the Pacific where in all likelihood its species will soon be facing extinction Captain Nemo s companion picked up the animal loaded it on his shoulder and we took to the trail again For an hour plains of sand unrolled before our steps Often the seafloor rose to within two meters of the surface of the water I could then see our images clearly mirrored on the underside of the waves but reflected upside down above us there appeared an identical band that duplicated our every movement and gesture in short a perfect likeness of the quartet near which it walked but with heads down and feet in the air Another unusual effect Heavy clouds passed above us forming and fading swiftly But after thinking it over I realized that these so called clouds were caused simply by the changing densities of the long ground swells and I even spotted the foaming white caps that their breaking crests were proliferating over the surface of the water Lastly I couldn t help seeing the actual shadows of large birds passing over our heads swiftly skimming the surface of the sea On this occasion I witnessed one of the finest gunshots ever to thrill the marrow of a hunter A large bird with a wide wingspan quite clearly visible approached and hovered over us When it was just a few meters above the waves Captain Nemo s companion took aim and fired The animal dropped electrocuted and its descent brought it within reach of our adroit hunter who promptly took possession of it It was an albatross of the finest species a wonderful specimen of these open sea fowl This incident did not interrupt our walk For two hours we were sometimes led over plains of sand sometimes over prairies of seaweed that were quite arduous to cross In all honesty I was dead tired by the time I spotted a hazy glow half a mile away cutting through the darkness of the waters It was the Nautilus s beacon Within twenty minutes we would be on board and there I could breathe easy again because my tank s current air supply seemed to be quite low in oxygen But I was reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed our arrival I was lagging behind some twenty paces when I saw Captain Nemo suddenly come back toward me With his powerful hands he sent me buckling to the ground while his companion did the same to Conseil At first I didn t know what to make of this sudden assault but I was reassured to observe the captain lying motionless beside me I was stretched out on the seafloor directly beneath some bushes of algae when I raised my head and spied two enormous masses hurtling by throwing off phosphorescent glimmers My blood turned cold in my veins I saw that we were under threat from a fearsome pair of sharks They were blue sharks dreadful man eaters with enormous tails dull glassy stares and phosphorescent matter oozing from holes around their snouts They were like monstrous fireflies that could thoroughly pulverize a man in their iron jaws I don t know if Conseil was busy with their classification but as for me I looked at their silver bellies their fearsome mouths bristling with teeth from a viewpoint less than scientific more as a victim than as a professor of natural history Luckily these voracious animals have poor eyesight They went by without noticing us grazing us with their brownish fins and miraculously we escaped a danger greater than encountering a tiger deep in the jungle Half an hour later guided by its electric trail we reached the Nautilus The outside door had been left open and Captain Nemo closed it after we reentered the first cell Then he pressed a button I heard pumps operating within the ship I felt the water lowering around me and in a few moments the cell was completely empty The inside door opened and we passed into the wardrobe There our diving suits were removed not without difficulty and utterly exhausted faint from lack of food and rest I repaired to my stateroom full of wonder at this startling excursion on the bottom of the sea CHAPTER eighteen Four Thousand Leagues Under the Pacific BY THE NEXT MORNING November eighteen I was fully recovered from my exhaustion of the day before

none	none	 just as the Nautilus s chief officer was pronouncing his daily phrase It then occurred to me that these words either referred to the state of the sea

294-130872-0059	train-other-500	among which I recognized all nine species that Professor Orbigny has classified as native to the Pacific Ocean During this crossing the sea continually lavished us with the most marvelous sights Its variety was infinite
6227-36632-0066	train-other-500	It changed its setting and decor for the mere pleasure of our eyes
6227-36632-0067	train-other-500	and we were called upon not simply to contemplate the works of our Creator in the midst of the liquid element but also to probe the ocean s most daunting mysteries

294-130872-0061	train-other-500	The Nautilus was motionless Its ballast tanks full it was sitting at a depth of one thousand meters in a comparatively unpopulated region of the ocean where only larger fish put in occasional appearances Just then I was studying a delightful book

6233_36633_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER nineteen
none	none	 Vanikoro 
6233_36633_000004_000000	train-clean-360	THIS DREADFUL SIGHT was the first of a whole series of maritime catastrophes that the Nautilus would encounter on its run When it plied more heavily traveled seas we often saw wrecked hulls rotting in midwater and farther down cannons shells anchors chains and a thousand other iron objects rusting away 
none	none	Meanwhile continuously swept along by the Nautilus where we lived in near isolation we raised the Tuamotu Islands on December eleven that old dangerous group associated with the French global navigator Commander Bougainville it stretches from Ducie Island to Lazareff Island over an area of five hundred leagues from the east southeast to the west northwest between latitude thirteen degrees thirty and twenty three degrees fifty south and between longitude one hundred twenty five degrees thirty and one hundred fifty one degrees thirty west This island group covers a surface area of three hundred seventy square leagues and it s made up of some sixty subgroups among which we noted the Gambier group which is a French protectorate These islands are coral formations 
6233_36633_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Thanks to the work of polyps a slow but steady upheaval will someday connect these islands to each other Later on this new island will be fused to its neighboring island groups and a fifth continent will stretch from New Zealand and New Caledonia as far as the Marquesas Islands 
6233_36633_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The day I expounded this theory to Captain Nemo he answered me coldly 
6233_36633_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 The earth doesn t need new continents but new men 
none	none	Sailors luck led the Nautilus straight to Reao Island one of the most unusual in this group which was discovered in eighteen twenty two by Captain Bell aboard the Minerva So I was able to study the madreporic process that has created the islands in this ocean Madrepores which one must guard against confusing with precious coral clothe their tissue in a limestone crust and their variations in structure have led my famous mentor Professor Milne Edwards to classify them into five divisions 
6233_36633_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The tiny microscopic animals that secrete this polypary live by the billions in the depths of their cells Their limestone deposits build up into rocks reefs islets islands In some places they form atolls a circular ring surrounding a lagoon or small inner lake that gaps place in contact with the sea 
none	none	Elsewhere they take the shape of barrier reefs such as those that exist along the coasts of New Caledonia and several of the Tuamotu Islands In still other localities such as Reunion Island and the island of Mauritius they build fringing reefs high straight walls next to which the ocean s depth is considerable While cruising along only a few cable lengths from the underpinning of Reao Island I marveled at the gigantic piece of work accomplished by these microscopic laborers These walls were the express achievements of madrepores known by the names fire coral finger coral star coral and stony coral 
6233_36633_000010_000002	train-clean-360	These polyps grow exclusively in the agitated strata at the surface of the sea and so it s in the upper reaches that they begin these substructures which sink little by little together with the secreted rubble binding them 
none	none	This at least is the theory of mister Charles Darwin who thus explains the formation of atolls a theory superior in my view to the one that says these madreporic edifices sit on the summits of mountains or volcanoes submerged a few feet below sea level 
6233_36633_000011_000000	train-clean-360	I could observe these strange walls quite closely our sounding lines indicated that they dropped perpendicularly for more than three hundred meters and our electric beams made the bright limestone positively sparkle 
none	none	In reply to a question Conseil asked me about the growth rate of these colossal barriers I thoroughly amazed him by saying that scientists put it at an eighth of an inch per biennium
6233_36633_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Therefore he said to me to build these walls it took 
none	none	one hundred ninety two thousand years my gallant Conseil which significantly extends the biblical Days of Creation 
6233_36633_000014_000001	train-clean-360	What s more the formation of coal in other words the petrification of forests swallowed by floods and the cooling of basaltic rocks likewise call for a much longer period of time 
none	none	I might add that those days in the Bible must represent whole epochs and not literally the lapse of time between two sunrises because according to the Bible itself the sun doesn t date from the first day of Creation When the Nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean I could take in Reao Island over its whole flat wooded expanse Obviously its madreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms One day carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores some seed fell onto these limestone beds mixing with decomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus Propelled by the waves a coconut arrived on this new coast Its germ took root 
6233_36633_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Its tree grew tall catching steam off the water A brook was born 
6233_36633_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Little by little vegetation spread Tiny animals worms insects rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from islands to windward 
none	none	Turtles came to lay their eggs Birds nested in the young trees 
6233_36633_000015_000005	train-clean-360	In this way animal life developed and drawn by the greenery and fertile soil man appeared And that s how these islands were formed the immense achievement of microscopic animals 
none	none	Near evening Reao Island melted into the distance and the Nautilus noticeably changed course 
6233_36633_000016_000001	train-clean-360	After touching the Tropic of Capricorn at longitude one hundred thirty five degrees it headed west northwest going back up the whole intertropical zone 
6233_36633_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Although the summer sun lavished its rays on us we never suffered from the heat because thirty or forty meters underwater the temperature didn t go over ten degrees to twelve degrees centigrade 
none	none	By December fifteen we had left the alluring Society Islands in the west likewise elegant Tahiti queen of the Pacific In the morning I spotted this island s lofty summits a few miles to leeward Its waters supplied excellent fish for the tables on board mackerel bonito albacore and a few varieties of that sea serpent named the moray eel 
6233_36633_000018_000000	train-clean-360	The Nautilus had cleared eight thousand one hundred miles 
none	none	We logged nine thousand seven hundred twenty miles when we passed between the Tonga Islands where crews from the Argo Port au Prince and Duke of Portland had perished and the island group of Samoa scene of the slaying of Captain de Langle friend of that long lost navigator the Count de La Perouse Then we raised the Fiji Islands where savages slaughtered sailors from the Union as well as Captain Bureau commander of the Darling Josephine out of Nantes France Extending over an expanse of one hundred leagues north to south and over ninety leagues east to west this island group lies between latitude two degrees and six degrees south and between longitude one hundred seventy four degrees and one hundred seventy nine degrees west It consists of a number of islands islets and reefs among which we noted the islands of Viti Levu Vanua Levu and Kadavu 
6233_36633_000020_000000	train-clean-360	It was the Dutch navigator Tasman who discovered this group in sixteen forty three the same year the Italian physicist Torricelli invented the barometer and King Louis XIV ascended the French throne 
none	none	I ll let the reader decide which of these deeds was more beneficial to humanity Coming later Captain Cook in seventeen seventy four Rear Admiral d Entrecasteaux in seventeen ninety three and finally Captain Dumont d Urville in eighteen twenty seven untangled the whole chaotic geography of this island group The Nautilus drew near Wailea Bay an unlucky place for England s Captain Dillon who was the first to shed light on the longstanding mystery surrounding the disappearance of ships under the Count de La Perouse 
6233_36633_000021_000000	train-clean-360	This bay repeatedly dredged furnished a huge supply of excellent oysters 
6233_36633_000021_000001	train-clean-360	As the Roman playwright Seneca recommended we opened them right at our table then stuffed ourselves These mollusks belonged to the species known by name as Ostrea lamellosa whose members are quite common off Corsica 
none	none	This Wailea oysterbank must have been extensive and for certain if they hadn t been controlled by numerous natural checks these clusters of shellfish would have ended up jam packing the bay since as many as two million eggs have been counted in a single individual And if mister Ned Land did not repent of his gluttony at our oyster fest it s because oysters are the only dish that never causes indigestion In fact it takes no less than sixteen dozen of these headless mollusks to supply the three hundred fifteen grams that satisfy one man s minimum daily requirement for nitrogen On December twenty five the Nautilus navigated amid the island group of the New Hebrides which the Portuguese seafarer Queiros discovered in sixteen oh six which Commander Bougainville explored in seventeen sixty eight and to which Captain Cook gave its current name in seventeen seventy three This group is chiefly made up of nine large islands and forms a one hundred twenty league strip from the north northwest to the south southeast lying between latitude two degrees and fifteen degrees south and between longitude one hundred sixty four degrees and one hundred sixty eight degrees At the moment of our noon sights we passed fairly close to the island of Aurou which looked to me like a mass of green woods crowned by a peak of great height 
6233_36633_000024_000000	train-clean-360	That day it was yuletide and it struck me that Ned Land badly missed celebrating Christmas that genuine family holiday where Protestants are such zealots 
6233_36633_000025_000000	train-clean-360	I hadn t seen Captain Nemo for over a week when on the morning of the twenty seventh he entered the main lounge as usual acting as if he d been gone for just five minutes 
none	none	I was busy tracing the Nautilus s course on the world map 
6233_36633_000025_000002	train-clean-360	The captain approached placed a finger over a position on the chart and pronounced just one word 
none	none	Vanikoro This name was magic 
6233_36633_000027_000001	train-clean-360	It was the name of those islets where vessels under the Count de La Perouse had miscarried I straightened suddenly 
6233_36633_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 The Nautilus is bringing us to Vanikoro I asked 
6233_36633_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes professor the captain replied 
none	none	And I ll be able to visit those famous islands where the Compass and the Astrolabe came to grief
6233_36633_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 If you like professor 
none	none	When will we reach Vanikoro
6233_36633_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 We already have professor 
6233_36633_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Followed by Captain Nemo I climbed onto the platform and from there my eyes eagerly scanned the horizon 
none	none	In the northeast there emerged two volcanic islands of unequal size surrounded by a coral reef whose circuit measured forty miles We were facing the island of Vanikoro proper to which Captain Dumont d Urville had given the name Island of the Search we lay right in front of the little harbor of Vana located in latitude sixteen degrees four south and longitude one hundred sixty four degrees thirty two east 
6233_36633_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Its shores seemed covered with greenery from its beaches to its summits inland crowned by Mt Kapogo which is four hundred seventy six fathoms high 
none	none	After clearing the outer belt of rocks via a narrow passageway the Nautilus lay inside the breakers where the sea had a depth of thirty to forty fathoms Under the green shade of some tropical evergreens I spotted a few savages who looked extremely startled at our approach In this long blackish object advancing flush with the water didn t they see some fearsome cetacean that they were obliged to view with distrust 
6233_36633_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Just then Captain Nemo asked me what I knew about the shipwreck of the Count de La Perouse 
6233_36633_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 What everybody knows captain I answered him 
6233_36633_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 And could you kindly tell me what everybody knows he asked me in a gently ironic tone 
6233_36633_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Very easily 
6233_36633_000041_000000	train-clean-360	I related to him what the final deeds of Captain Dumont d Urville had brought to light deeds described here in this heavily condensed summary of the whole matter 
none	none	In seventeen eighty five the Count de La Perouse and his subordinate Captain de Langle were sent by King Louis XVI of France on a voyage to circumnavigate the globe 
6233_36633_000042_000001	train-clean-360	They boarded two sloops of war the Compass and the Astrolabe which were never seen again 
6233_36633_000043_000000	train-clean-360	In seventeen ninety one justly concerned about the fate of these two sloops of war the French government fitted out two large cargo boats the Search and the Hope which left Brest on September twenty eight under orders from Rear Admiral Bruni d Entrecasteaux 
none	none	Two months later testimony from a certain Commander Bowen aboard the Albemarle alleged that rubble from shipwrecked vessels had been seen on the coast of New Georgia But d Entrecasteaux was unaware of this news which seemed a bit dubious anyhow and headed toward the Admiralty Islands which had been named in a report by one Captain Hunter as the site of the Count de La Perouse s shipwreck They looked in vain The Hope and the Search passed right by Vanikoro without stopping there and overall this voyage was plagued by misfortune ultimately costing the lives of Rear Admiral d Entrecasteaux two of his subordinate officers and several seamen from his crew 
6233_36633_000045_000000	train-clean-360	It was an old hand at the Pacific the English adventurer Captain Peter Dillon who was the first to pick up the trail left by castaways from the wrecked vessels 
none	none	On May fifteen eighteen twenty four his ship the saint Patrick passed by Tikopia Island one of the New Hebrides There a native boatman pulled alongside in a dugout canoe and sold Dillon a silver sword hilt bearing the imprint of characters engraved with a cutting tool known as a burin Furthermore this native boatman claimed that during a stay in Vanikoro six years earlier he had seen two Europeans belonging to ships that had run aground on the island s reefs many years before Dillon guessed that the ships at issue were those under the Count de La Perouse ships whose disappearance had shaken the entire world He tried to reach Vanikoro where according to the native boatman a good deal of rubble from the shipwreck could still be found but winds and currents prevented his doing so 
6233_36633_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Dillon returned to Calcutta 
none	none	There he was able to interest the Asiatic Society and the East India Company in his discovery A ship named after the Search was placed at his disposal and he departed on January twenty three eighteen twenty seven accompanied by a French deputy This new Search after putting in at several stops over the Pacific dropped anchor before Vanikoro on July seven eighteen twenty seven in the same harbor of Vana where the Nautilus was currently floating 
6233_36633_000049_000000	train-clean-360	There Dillon collected many relics of the shipwreck iron utensils anchors eyelets from pulleys swivel guns an eighteen pound shell the remains of some astronomical instruments a piece of sternrail and a bronze bell bearing the inscription Made by Bazin the foundry mark at Brest Arsenal around seventeen eighty five There could no longer be any doubt 
none	none	Finishing his investigations Dillon stayed at the site of the casualty until the month of October Then he left Vanikoro headed toward New Zealand dropped anchor at Calcutta on April seven eighteen twenty eight and returned to France where he received a very cordial welcome from King Charles X 
6233_36633_000051_000000	train-clean-360	But just then the renowned French explorer Captain Dumont d Urville unaware of Dillon s activities had already set sail to search elsewhere for the site of the shipwreck 
none	none	In essence a whaling vessel had reported that some medals and a Cross of saint Louis had been found in the hands of savages in the Louisiade Islands and New Caledonia So Captain Dumont d Urville had put to sea in command of a vessel named after the Astrolabe and just two months after Dillon had left Vanikoro Dumont d Urville dropped anchor before Hobart There he heard about Dillon s findings and he further learned that a certain James Hobbs chief officer on the Union out of Calcutta had put to shore on an island located in latitude eight degrees eighteen south and longitude one hundred fifty six degrees thirty east and had noted the natives of those waterways making use of iron bars and red fabrics 
6233_36633_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Pretty perplexed Dumont d Urville didn t know if he should give credence to these reports which had been carried in some of the less reliable newspapers nevertheless he decided to start on Dillon s trail 
none	none	On February ten eighteen twenty eight the new Astrolabe hove before Tikopia Island took on a guide and interpreter in the person of a deserter who had settled there plied a course toward Vanikoro raised it on February twelve sailed along its reefs until the fourteenth and only on the twentieth dropped anchor inside its barrier in the harbor of Vana On the twenty third several officers circled the island and brought back some rubble of little importance The natives adopting a system of denial and evasion refused to guide them to the site of the casualty This rather shady conduct aroused the suspicion that the natives had mistreated the castaways and in truth the natives seemed afraid that Dumont d Urville had come to avenge the Count de La Perouse and his unfortunate companions But on the twenty sixth appeased with gifts and seeing that they didn t need to fear any reprisals the natives led the chief officer mister Jacquinot to the site of the shipwreck At this location in three or four fathoms of water between the Paeu and Vana reefs there lay some anchors cannons and ingots of iron and lead all caked with limestone concretions A launch and whaleboat from the new Astrolabe were steered to this locality and after going to exhausting lengths their crews managed to dredge up an anchor weighing eighteen hundred pounds a cast iron eight pounder cannon a lead ingot and two copper swivel guns Questioning the natives Captain Dumont d Urville also learned that after La Perouse s two ships had miscarried on the island s reefs the count had built a smaller craft only to go off and miscarry a second time Where Nobody knew The commander of the new Astrolabe then had a monument erected under a tuft of mangrove in memory of the famous navigator and his companions It was a simple quadrangular pyramid set on a coral base with no ironwork to tempt the natives avarice Then Dumont d Urville tried to depart but his crews were run down from the fevers raging on these unsanitary shores and quite ill himself he was unable to weigh anchor until March seventeen Meanwhile fearing that Dumont d Urville wasn t abreast of Dillon s activities the French government sent a sloop of war to Vanikoro the Bayonnaise under Commander Legoarant de Tromelin who had been stationed on the American west coast Dropping anchor before Vanikoro a few months after the new Astrolabe s departure the Bayonnaise didn t find any additional evidence but verified that the savages hadn t disturbed the memorial honoring the Count de La Perouse

none	none	 The Torres Strait DURING THE NIGHT of December twenty seven twenty eight the Nautilus left the waterways of Vanikoro behind with extraordinary speed Its heading was southwesterly and in three days it had cleared the seven hundred fifty leagues that separated La Perouse s islands from the southeastern tip of Papua On January one eighteen sixty eight bright and early Conseil joined me on the platform Will master the gallant lad said to me allow me to wish him a happy new year Good heavens Conseil it s just like old times in my office at the Botanical Gardens in Paris I accept your kind wishes and I thank you for them Only I d like to know what you mean by a happy year under the circumstances in which we re placed Is it a year that will bring our imprisonment to an end or a year that will see this strange voyage continue Ye gods Conseil replied I hardly know what to tell master We re certainly seeing some unusual things and for two months we ve had no time for boredom The latest wonder is always the most astonishing and if this progression keeps up I can t imagine what its climax will be In my opinion we ll never again have such an opportunity Never Conseil Besides mister Nemo really lives up to his Latin name since he couldn t be less in the way if he didn t exist True enough Conseil Therefore with all due respect to master I think a happy year would be a year that lets us see everything Everything Conseil No year could be that long But what does Ned Land think about all this Ned Land s thoughts are exactly the opposite of mine Conseil replied He has a practical mind and a demanding stomach He s tired of staring at fish and eating them day in and day out This shortage of wine bread and meat isn t suitable for an upstanding Anglo Saxon a man accustomed to beefsteak and unfazed by regular doses of brandy or gin For my part Conseil that doesn t bother me in the least and I ve adjusted very nicely to the diet on board So have I Conseil replied Accordingly I think as much about staying as mister Land about making his escape Thus if this new year isn t a happy one for me it will be for him and vice versa No matter what happens one of us will be pleased So in conclusion I wish master to have whatever his heart desires Thank you Conseil Only I must ask you to postpone the question of new year s gifts and temporarily accept a hearty handshake in their place That s all I have on me Master has never been more generous Conseil replied And with that the gallant lad went away By January two we had fared eleven thousand three hundred forty miles hence five thousand two hundred fifty leagues from our starting point in the seas of Japan Before the Nautilus s spur there stretched the dangerous waterways of the Coral Sea off the northeast coast of Australia Our boat cruised along a few miles away from that daunting shoal where Captain Cook s ships wellnigh miscarried on June ten seventeen seventy The craft that Cook was aboard charged into some coral rock and if his vessel didn t go down it was thanks to the circumstance that a piece of coral broke off in the collision and plugged the very hole it had made in the hull I would have been deeply interested in visiting this long three hundred sixty league reef against which the ever surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps But just then the Nautilus s slanting fins took us to great depths and I could see nothing of those high coral walls I had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets Among others I noted some long finned albacore a species in the genus Scomber as big as tuna bluish on the flanks and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies These fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh We also caught a large number of yellow green gilthead half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado plus some flying gurnards authentic underwater swallows that on dark nights alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers Among mollusks and zoophytes I found in our trawl s meshes various species of alcyonarian coral sea urchins hammer shells spurred star shells wentletrap snails horn shells glass snails The local flora was represented by fine floating algae sea tangle and kelp from the genus Macrocystis saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire from which I selected a wonderful Nemastoma geliniaroidea classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum On January four two days after crossing the Coral Sea we raised the coast of Papua On this occasion Captain Nemo told me that he intended to reach the Indian Ocean via the Torres Strait This was the extent of his remarks Ned saw with pleasure that this course would bring us once again closer to European seas The Torres Strait is regarded as no less dangerous for its bristling reefs than for the savage inhabitants of its coasts It separates Queensland from the huge island of Papua also called New Guinea Papua is four hundred leagues long by one hundred thirty leagues wide with a surface area of forty thousand geographic leagues It s located between latitude zero degrees nineteen and ten degrees two south and between longitude one hundred twenty eight degrees twenty three and one hundred forty six degrees fifteen At noon while the chief officer was taking the sun s altitude I spotted the summits of the Arfak Mountains rising in terraces and ending in sharp peaks Discovered in fifteen eleven by the Portuguese Francisco Serrano these shores were successively visited by Don Jorge de Meneses in fifteen twenty six by Juan de Grijalva in fifteen twenty seven by the Spanish general Alvaro de Saavedra in fifteen twenty eight by Inigo Ortiz in fifteen forty five by the Dutchman Schouten in sixteen sixteen by Nicolas Sruick in seventeen fifty three by Tasman Dampier Fumel Carteret Edwards Bougainville Cook McClure and Thomas Forrest by Rear Admiral d Entrecasteaux in seventeen ninety two by Louis Isidore Duperrey in eighteen twenty three and by Captain Dumont d Urville in eighteen twenty seven It s the heartland of the blacks who occupy all Malaysia mister de Rienzi has said and I hadn t the foggiest inkling that sailors luck was about to bring me face to face with these daunting Andaman aborigines So the Nautilus hove before the entrance to the world s most dangerous strait a passageway that even the boldest navigators hesitated to clear the strait that Luis Vaez de Torres faced on returning from the South Seas in Melanesia the strait in which sloops of war under Captain Dumont d Urville ran aground in eighteen forty and nearly miscarried with all hands And even the Nautilus rising superior to every danger in the sea was about to become intimate with its coral reefs The Torres Strait is about thirty four leagues wide but it s obstructed by an incalculable number of islands islets breakers and rocks that make it nearly impossible to navigate Consequently Captain Nemo took every desired precaution in crossing it Floating flush with the water the Nautilus moved ahead at a moderate pace Like a cetacean s tail its propeller churned the waves slowly Taking advantage of this situation my two companions and I found seats on the ever deserted platform In front of us stood the pilothouse and unless I m extremely mistaken Captain Nemo must have been inside steering his Nautilus himself Under my eyes I had the excellent charts of the Torres Strait that had been surveyed and drawn up by the hydrographic engineer Vincendon Dumoulin and Sublieutenant now Admiral Coupvent Desbois who were part of Dumont d Urville s general staff during his final voyage to circumnavigate the globe These along with the efforts of Captain King are the best charts for untangling the snarl of this narrow passageway and I consulted them with scrupulous care Around the Nautilus the sea was boiling furiously A stream of waves bearing from southeast to northwest at a speed of two and a half miles per hour broke over heads of coral emerging here and there That s one rough sea Ned Land told me Abominable indeed I replied and hardly suitable for a craft like the Nautilus That damned captain the Canadian went on must really be sure of his course because if these clumps of coral so much as brush us they ll rip our hull into a thousand pieces The situation was indeed dangerous but as if by magic the Nautilus seemed to glide right down the middle of these rampaging reefs It didn t follow the exact course of the Zealous and the new Astrolabe which had proved so ill fated for Captain Dumont d Urville It went more to the north hugged the Murray Islands and returned to the southwest near Cumberland Passage I thought it was about to charge wholeheartedly into this opening but it went up to the northwest through a large number of little known islands and islets and steered toward Tound Island and the Bad Channel I was already wondering if Captain Nemo rash to the point of sheer insanity wanted his ship to tackle the narrows where Dumont d Urville s two sloops of war had gone aground when he changed direction a second time and cut straight to the west heading toward Gueboroa Island By then it was three o clock in the afternoon The current was slacking off it was almost full tide The Nautilus drew near this island which I can see to this day with its remarkable fringe of screw pines We hugged it from less than two miles out A sudden jolt threw me down The Nautilus had just struck a reef and it remained motionless listing slightly to port When I stood up I saw Captain Nemo and his chief officer on the platform They were examining the ship s circumstances exchanging a few words in their incomprehensible dialect Here is what those circumstances entailed Two miles to starboard lay Gueboroa Island its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm To the south and east heads of coral were already on display left uncovered by the ebbing waters We had run aground at full tide and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate an inconvenient state of affairs for floating the Nautilus off However the ship hadn t suffered in any way so solidly joined was its hull But although it could neither sink nor split open it was in serious danger of being permanently attached to these reefs and that would have been the finish of Captain Nemo s submersible I was mulling this over when the captain approached cool and calm forever in control of himself looking neither alarmed nor annoyed An accident I said to him No an incident he answered me But an incident I replied that may oblige you to become a resident again of these shores you avoid Captain Nemo gave me an odd look and gestured no Which told me pretty clearly that nothing would ever force him to set foot on a land mass again Then he said No Professor Aronnax the Nautilus isn t consigned to perdition It will still carry you through the midst of the ocean s wonders Our voyage is just beginning and I ve no desire to deprive myself so soon of the pleasure of your company Even so Captain Nemo I went on ignoring his ironic turn of phrase the Nautilus has run aground at a moment when the sea is full Now then the tides aren t strong in the Pacific and if you can t unballast the Nautilus which seems impossible to me I don t see how it will float off You re right professor the Pacific tides aren t strong Captain Nemo replied But in the Torres Strait one still finds a meter and a half difference in level between high and low seas Today is January four and in five days the moon will be full Now then I ll be quite astonished if that good natured satellite doesn t sufficiently raise these masses of water and do me a favor for which I ll be forever grateful This said Captain Nemo went below again to the Nautilus s interior followed by his chief officer As for our craft it no longer stirred staying as motionless as if these coral polyps had already walled it in with their indestructible cement Well sir Ned Land said to me coming up after the captain s departure Well Ned my friend we ll serenely wait for the tide on the ninth because it seems the moon will have the good nature to float us away As simple as that As simple as that So our captain isn t going to drop his anchors put his engines on the chains and do anything to haul us off Since the tide will be sufficient Conseil replied simply The Canadian stared at Conseil then he shrugged his shoulders The seaman in him was talking now Sir he answered you can trust me when I say this hunk of iron will never navigate again on the seas or under them It s only fit to be sold for its weight So I think it s time we gave Captain Nemo the slip Ned my friend I replied unlike you I haven t given up on our valiant Nautilus and in four days we ll know where we stand on these Pacific tides Besides an escape attempt might be timely if we were in sight of the coasts of England or Provence but in the waterways of Papua it s another story And we ll always have that as a last resort if the Nautilus doesn t right itself which I d regard as a real calamity But couldn t we at least get the lay of the land Ned went on Here s an island On this island there are trees Under those trees land animals loaded with cutlets and roast beef which I d be happy to sink my teeth into In this instance our friend Ned is right Conseil said and I side with his views Couldn t master persuade his friend Captain Nemo to send the three of us ashore if only so our feet don t lose the knack of treading on the solid parts of our planet I can ask him I replied but he ll refuse Let master take the risk Conseil said and we ll know where we stand on the captain s affability Much to my surprise Captain Nemo gave me the permission I asked for and he did so with grace and alacrity not even exacting my promise to return on board But fleeing across the New Guinea territories would be extremely dangerous and I wouldn t have advised Ned Land to try it Better to be prisoners aboard the Nautilus than to fall into the hands of Papuan natives The skiff was put at our disposal for the next morning I hardly needed to ask whether Captain Nemo would be coming along I likewise assumed that no crewmen would be assigned to us that Ned Land would be in sole charge of piloting the longboat Besides the shore lay no more than two miles off and it would be child s play for the Canadian to guide that nimble skiff through those rows of reefs so ill fated for big ships The next day January five after its deck paneling was opened the skiff was wrenched from its socket and launched to sea from the top of the platform Two men were sufficient for this operation The oars were inside the longboat and we had only to take our seats At eight o clock armed with rifles and axes we pulled clear of the Nautilus The sea was fairly calm A mild breeze blew from shore In place by the oars Conseil and I rowed vigorously and Ned steered us into the narrow lanes between the breakers The skiff handled easily and sped swiftly Ned Land couldn t conceal his glee He was a prisoner escaping from prison and never dreaming he would need to reenter it Meat he kept repeating Now we ll eat red meat Actual game A real mess call by thunder I m not saying fish aren t good for you but we mustn t overdo em and a slice of fresh venison grilled over live coals will be a nice change from our standard fare You glutton Conseil replied you re making my mouth water It remains to be seen I said whether these forests do contain game and if the types of game aren t of such size that they can hunt the hunter Fine Professor Aronnax replied the Canadian whose teeth seemed to be as honed as the edge of an ax But if there s no other quadruped on this island I ll eat tiger tiger sirloin Our friend Ned grows disturbing Conseil replied Whatever it is Ned Land went on any animal having four feet without feathers or two feet with feathers will be greeted by my very own one gun salute Oh good I replied The reckless mister Land is at it again Don t worry Professor Aronnax just keep rowing the Canadian replied I only need twenty five minutes to serve you one of my own special creations By eight thirty the Nautilus s skiff had just run gently aground on a sandy strand after successfully clearing the ring of coral that surrounds Gueboroa Island CHAPTER twenty one Some Days Ashore STEPPING ASHORE had an exhilarating effect on me Ned Land tested the soil with his foot as if he were laying claim to it Yet it had been only two months since we had become as Captain Nemo expressed it passengers on the Nautilus in other words the literal prisoners of its commander In a few minutes we were a gunshot away from the coast The soil was almost entirely madreporic but certain dry stream beds were strewn with granite rubble proving that this island was of primordial origin The entire horizon was hidden behind a curtain of wonderful forests Enormous trees sometimes as high as two hundred feet were linked to each other by garlands of tropical creepers genuine natural hammocks that swayed in a mild breeze There were mimosas banyan trees beefwood teakwood hibiscus screw pines palm trees all mingling in wild profusion and beneath the shade of their green canopies at the feet of their gigantic trunks there grew orchids leguminous plants and ferns Meanwhile ignoring all these fine specimens of Papuan flora the Canadian passed up the decorative in favor of the functional He spotted a coconut palm beat down some of its fruit broke them open and we drank their milk and ate their meat with a pleasure that was a protest against our standard fare on the Nautilus Excellent Ned Land said Exquisite Conseil replied And I don t think the Canadian said that your Nemo would object to us stashing a cargo of coconuts aboard his vessel I imagine not I replied but he won t want to sample them Too bad for him Conseil said And plenty good for us Ned Land shot back There ll be more left over A word of caution mister Land I told the harpooner who was about to ravage another coconut palm Coconuts are admirable things but before we stuff the skiff with them it would be wise to find out whether this island offers other substances just as useful Some fresh vegetables would be well received in the Nautilus s pantry Master is right Conseil replied and I propose that we set aside three places in our longboat one for fruit another for vegetables and a third for venison of which I still haven t glimpsed the tiniest specimen Don t give up so easily Conseil the Canadian replied So let s continue our excursion I went on but keep a sharp lookout This island seems uninhabited but it still might harbor certain individuals who aren t so finicky about the sort of game they eat Hee hee Ned put in with a meaningful movement of his jaws Ned Oh horrors Conseil exclaimed Ye gods the Canadian shot back I m starting to appreciate the charms of cannibalism Ned Ned Don t say that Conseil answered You a cannibal Why I ll no longer be safe next to you I who share your cabin Does this mean I ll wake up half devoured one fine day I m awfully fond of you Conseil my friend but not enough to eat you when there s better food around Then I daren t delay Conseil replied The hunt is on We absolutely must bag some game to placate this man eater or one of these mornings master won t find enough pieces of his manservant to serve him While exchanging this chitchat we entered beneath the dark canopies of the forest and for two hours we explored it in every direction We couldn t have been luckier in our search for edible vegetation and some of the most useful produce in the tropical zones supplied us with a valuable foodstuff missing on board I mean the breadfruit tree which is quite abundant on Gueboroa Island and there I chiefly noted the seedless variety that in Malaysia is called rima This tree is distinguished from other trees by a straight trunk forty feet high To the naturalist s eye its gracefully rounded crown formed of big multilobed leaves was enough to denote the artocarpus that has been so successfully transplanted to the Mascarene Islands east of Madagascar From its mass of greenery huge globular fruit stood out a decimeter wide and furnished on the outside with creases that assumed a hexangular pattern It s a handy plant that nature gives to regions lacking in wheat without needing to be cultivated it bears fruit eight months out of the year Ned Land was on familiar terms with this fruit He had already eaten it on his many voyages and knew how to cook its edible substance So the very sight of it aroused his appetite and he couldn t control himself Sir he told me I ll die if I don t sample a little breadfruit pasta Sample some Ned my friend sample all you like We re here to conduct experiments let s conduct them It won t take a minute the Canadian replied Equipped with a magnifying glass he lit a fire of deadwood that was soon crackling merrily Meanwhile Conseil and I selected the finest artocarpus fruit Some still weren t ripe enough and their thick skins covered white slightly fibrous pulps But a great many others were yellowish and gelatinous just begging to be picked This fruit contained no pits Conseil brought a dozen of them to Ned Land who cut them into thick slices and placed them over a fire of live coals all the while repeating You ll see sir how tasty this bread is Especially since we ve gone without baked goods for so long Conseil said It s more than just bread the Canadian added It s a dainty pastry You ve never eaten any sir No Ned All right get ready for something downright delectable If you don t come back for seconds I m no longer the King of Harpooners After a few minutes the parts of the fruit exposed to the fire were completely toasted On the inside there appeared some white pasta a sort of soft bread center whose flavor reminded me of artichoke This bread was excellent I must admit and I ate it with great pleasure Unfortunately I said this pasta won t stay fresh so it seems pointless to make a supply for on board By thunder sir Ned Land exclaimed There you go talking like a naturalist but meantime I ll be acting like a baker Conseil harvest some of this fruit to take with us when we go back And how will you prepare it I asked the Canadian I ll make a fermented batter from its pulp that ll keep indefinitely without spoiling When I want some I ll just cook it in the galley on board it ll have a slightly tart flavor but you ll find it excellent So mister Ned I see that this bread is all we need Not quite professor the Canadian replied We need some fruit to go with it or at least some vegetables Then let s look for fruit and vegetables When our breadfruit harvesting was done we took to the trail to complete this dry land dinner We didn t search in vain and near noontime we had an ample supply of bananas This delicious produce from the Torrid Zones ripens all year round and Malaysians who give them the name pisang eat them without bothering to cook them In addition to bananas we gathered some enormous jackfruit with a very tangy flavor some tasty mangoes and some pineapples of unbelievable size But this foraging took up a good deal of our time which even so we had no cause to regret Conseil kept Ned under observation The harpooner walked in the lead and during his stroll through this forest he gathered with sure hands some excellent fruit that should have completed his provisions So Conseil asked you have everything you need Ned my friend Humph the Canadian put in What You re complaining All this vegetation doesn t make a meal Ned replied Just side dishes dessert But where s the soup course Where s the roast Right I said Ned promised us cutlets which seems highly questionable to me Sir the Canadian replied our hunting not only isn t over it hasn t even started Patience We re sure to end up bumping into some animal with either feathers or fur if not in this locality then in another And if not today then tomorrow because we mustn t wander too far off Conseil added That s why I propose that we return to the skiff What Already Ned exclaimed We ought to be back before nightfall I said But what hour is it then the Canadian asked Two o clock at least Conseil replied How time flies on solid ground exclaimed mister Ned Land with a sigh of regret Off we go Conseil replied So we returned through the forest and we completed our harvest by making a clean sweep of some palm cabbages that had to be picked from the crowns of their trees some small beans that I recognized as the abrou of the Malaysians and some high quality yams We were overloaded when we arrived at the skiff However Ned Land still found these provisions inadequate But fortune smiled on him Just as we were boarding he spotted several trees twenty five to thirty feet high belonging to the palm species As valuable as the artocarpus these trees are justly ranked among the most useful produce in Malaysia They were sago palms vegetation that grows without being cultivated like mulberry trees they reproduce by means of shoots and seeds Ned Land knew how to handle these trees Taking his ax and wielding it with great vigor he soon stretched out on the ground two or three sago palms whose maturity was revealed by the white dust sprinkled over their palm fronds I watched him more as a naturalist than as a man in hunger He began by removing from each trunk an inch thick strip of bark that covered a network of long hopelessly tangled fibers that were puttied with a sort of gummy flour This flour was the starch like sago an edible substance chiefly consumed by the Melanesian peoples For the time being Ned Land was content to chop these trunks into pieces as if he were making firewood later he would extract the flour by sifting it through cloth to separate it from its fibrous ligaments let it dry out in the sun and leave it to harden inside molds Finally at five o clock in the afternoon laden with all our treasures we left the island beach and half an hour later pulled alongside the Nautilus Nobody appeared on our arrival The enormous sheet iron cylinder seemed deserted Our provisions loaded on board I went below to my stateroom There I found my supper ready I ate and then fell asleep The next day January six nothing new on board Not a sound inside not a sign of life The skiff stayed alongside in the same place we had left it We decided to return to Gueboroa Island Ned Land hoped for better luck in his hunting than on the day before and he wanted to visit a different part of the forest By sunrise we were off Carried by an inbound current the longboat reached the island in a matter of moments We disembarked and thinking it best to abide by the Canadian s instincts we followed Ned Land whose long legs threatened to outpace us Ned Land went westward up the coast then fording some stream beds he reached open plains that were bordered by wonderful forests Some kingfishers lurked along the watercourses but they didn t let us approach Their cautious behavior proved to me that these winged creatures knew where they stood on bipeds of our species and I concluded that if this island wasn t inhabited at least human beings paid it frequent visits After crossing a pretty lush prairie we arrived on the outskirts of a small wood enlivened by the singing and soaring of a large number of birds Still they re merely birds Conseil said But some are edible the harpooner replied Wrong Ned my friend Conseil answered because I see only ordinary parrots here Conseil my friend Ned replied in all seriousness parrots are like pheasant to people with nothing else on their plates And I might add I said that when these birds are properly cooked they re at least worth a stab of the fork Indeed under the dense foliage of this wood a whole host of parrots fluttered from branch to branch needing only the proper upbringing to speak human dialects At present they were cackling in chorus with parakeets of every color with solemn cockatoos that seemed to be pondering some philosophical problem while bright red lories passed by like pieces of bunting borne on the breeze in the midst of kalao parrots raucously on the wing Papuan lories painted the subtlest shades of azure and a whole variety of delightful winged creatures none terribly edible However one bird unique to these shores which never passes beyond the boundaries of the Aru and Papuan Islands was missing from this collection But I was given a chance to marvel at it soon enough After crossing through a moderately dense thicket we again found some plains obstructed by bushes There I saw some magnificent birds soaring aloft the arrangement of their long feathers causing them to head into the wind Their undulating flight the grace of their aerial curves and the play of their colors allured and delighted the eye I had no trouble identifying them Birds of paradise I exclaimed Order Passeriforma division Clystomora Conseil replied Partridge family Ned Land asked I doubt it mister Land Nevertheless I m counting on your dexterity to catch me one of these delightful representatives of tropical nature I ll give it a try professor though I m handier with a harpoon than a rifle Malaysians who do a booming business in these birds with the Chinese have various methods for catching them that we couldn t use Sometimes they set snares on the tops of the tall trees that the bird of paradise prefers to inhabit At other times they capture it with a tenacious glue that paralyzes its movements They will even go so far as to poison the springs where these fowl habitually drink But in our case all we could do was fire at them on the wing which left us little chance of getting one And in truth we used up a good part of our ammunition in vain Near eleven o clock in the morning we cleared the lower slopes of the mountains that form the island s center and we still hadn t bagged a thing Hunger spurred us on The hunters had counted on consuming the proceeds of their hunting and they had miscalculated Luckily and much to his surprise Conseil pulled off a right and left shot and insured our breakfast He brought down a white pigeon and a ringdove which were briskly plucked hung from a spit and roasted over a blazing fire of deadwood While these fascinating animals were cooking Ned prepared some bread from the artocarpus Then the pigeon and ringdove were devoured to the bones and declared excellent Nutmeg on which these birds habitually gorge themselves sweetens their flesh and makes it delicious eating They taste like chicken stuffed with truffles Conseil said All right Ned I asked the Canadian now what do you need Game with four paws Professor Aronnax Ned Land replied All these pigeons are only appetizers snacks So till I ve bagged an animal with cutlets I won t be happy Nor I Ned until I ve caught a bird of paradise Then let s keep hunting Conseil replied but while heading back to the sea We ve arrived at the foothills of these mountains and I think we ll do better if we return to the forest regions It was good advice and we took it After an hour s walk we reached a genuine sago palm forest A few harmless snakes fled underfoot Birds of paradise stole off at our approach and I was in real despair of catching one when Conseil walking in the lead stooped suddenly gave a triumphant shout and came back to me carrying a magnificent bird of paradise Oh bravo Conseil I exclaimed Master is too kind Conseil replied Not at all my boy That was a stroke of genius catching one of these live birds with your bare hands If master will examine it closely he ll see that I deserve no great praise
229_130880_000097_000000	train-clean-100	 And why not 
none	none	Conseil Because this bird is as drunk as a lord Drunk Yes master drunk from the nutmegs it was devouring under that nutmeg tree where I caught it See Ned my friend see the monstrous results of intemperance Damnation the Canadian shot back Considering the amount of gin I ve had these past two months you ve got nothing to complain about Meanwhile I was examining this unusual bird Conseil was not mistaken Tipsy from that potent juice our bird of paradise had been reduced to helplessness It was unable to fly It was barely able to walk But this didn t alarm me and I just let it sleep off its nutmeg This bird belonged to the finest of the eight species credited to Papua and its neighboring islands It was a great emerald one of the rarest birds of paradise It measured three decimeters long Its head was comparatively small and its eyes placed near the opening of its beak were also small But it offered a wonderful mixture of hues a yellow beak brown feet and claws hazel wings with purple tips pale yellow head and scruff of the neck emerald throat the belly and chest maroon to brown Two strands made of a horn substance covered with down rose over its tail which was lengthened by long very light feathers of wonderful fineness and they completed the costume of this marvelous bird that the islanders have poetically named the sun bird How I wished I could take this superb bird of paradise back to Paris to make a gift of it to the zoo at the Botanical Gardens which doesn t own a single live specimen So it must be a rarity or something the Canadian asked in the tone of a hunter who from the viewpoint of his art gives the game a pretty low rating A great rarity my gallant comrade and above all very hard to capture alive And even after they re dead there s still a major market for these birds So the natives have figured out how to create fake ones like people create fake pearls or diamonds What Conseil exclaimed They make counterfeit birds of paradise Yes Conseil And is master familiar with how the islanders go about it Perfectly familiar During the easterly monsoon season birds of paradise lose the magnificent feathers around their tails that naturalists call below the wing feathers These feathers are gathered by the fowl forgers and skillfully fitted onto some poor previously mutilated parakeet Then they paint over the suture varnish the bird and ship the fruits of their unique labors to museums and collectors in Europe Good enough Ned Land put in If it isn t the right bird it s still the right feathers and so long as the merchandise isn t meant to be eaten I see no great harm But if my desires were fulfilled by the capture of this bird of paradise those of our Canadian huntsman remained unsatisfied Luckily near two o clock Ned Land brought down a magnificent wild pig of the type the natives call bari outang This animal came in the nick of time for us to bag some real quadruped meat and it was warmly welcomed Ned Land proved himself quite gloriously with his gunshot Hit by an electric bullet the pig dropped dead on the spot The Canadian properly skinned and cleaned it after removing half a dozen cutlets destined to serve as the grilled meat course of our evening meal Then the hunt was on again and once more would be marked by the exploits of Ned and Conseil In essence beating the bushes the two friends flushed a herd of kangaroos that fled by bounding away on their elastic paws But these animals didn t flee so swiftly that our electric capsules couldn t catch up with them Oh professor shouted Ned Land whose hunting fever had gone to his brain What excellent game especially in a stew What a supply for the Nautilus Two three five down And just think how we ll devour all this meat ourselves while those numbskulls on board won t get a shred In his uncontrollable glee I think the Canadian might have slaughtered the whole horde if he hadn t been so busy talking But he was content with a dozen of these fascinating marsupials which make up the first order of aplacental mammals as Conseil just had to tell us These animals were small in stature They were a species of those rabbit kangaroos that usually dwell in the hollows of trees and are tremendously fast but although of moderate dimensions they at least furnish a meat that s highly prized We were thoroughly satisfied with the results of our hunting A gleeful Ned proposed that we return the next day to this magic island which he planned to depopulate of its every edible quadruped But he was reckoning without events By six o clock in the evening we were back on the beach The skiff was aground in its usual place The Nautilus looking like a long reef emerged from the waves two miles offshore Without further ado Ned Land got down to the important business of dinner He came wonderfully to terms with its entire cooking Grilling over the coals those cutlets from the bari outang soon gave off a succulent aroma that perfumed the air But I catch myself following in the Canadian s footsteps Look at me in ecstasy over freshly grilled pork Please grant me a pardon as I ve already granted one to mister Land and on the same grounds In short dinner was excellent Two ringdoves rounded out this extraordinary menu Sago pasta bread from the artocarpus mangoes half a dozen pineapples and the fermented liquor from certain coconuts heightened our glee I suspect that my two fine companions weren t quite as clearheaded as one could wish What if we don t return to the Nautilus this evening Conseil said What if we never return to it Ned Land added Just then a stone whizzed toward us landed at our feet and cut short the harpooner s proposition CHAPTER twenty two The Lightning Bolts of Captain Nemo 
835_130876_000006_000000	train-clean-360	WITHOUT STANDING UP we stared in the direction of the forest my hand stopping halfway to my mouth Ned Land s completing its assignment 
none	none	Stones don t fall from the sky Conseil said or else they deserve to be called meteorites 
835_130876_000008_000000	train-clean-360	A second well polished stone removed a tasty ringdove leg from Conseil s hand giving still greater relevance to his observation 
835_130876_000009_000000	train-clean-360	We all three stood up rifles to our shoulders ready to answer any attack 
835_130876_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Apes maybe Ned Land exclaimed 
none	none	Nearly Conseil replied Savages
835_130876_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Head for the skiff I said moving toward the sea 
835_130876_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Indeed it was essential to beat a retreat because some twenty natives armed with bows and slings appeared barely a hundred paces off on the outskirts of a thicket that masked the horizon to our right 
835_130876_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The skiff was aground ten fathoms away from us 
835_130876_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The savages approached without running but they favored us with a show of the greatest hostility 
none	none	It was raining stones and arrows 
835_130876_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Ned Land was unwilling to leave his provisions behind and despite the impending danger he clutched his pig on one side his kangaroos on the other and scampered off with respectable speed 
835_130876_000017_000000	train-clean-360	In two minutes we were on the strand 
none	none	Loading provisions and weapons into the skiff pushing it to sea and positioning its two oars were the work of an instant 
835_130876_000017_000002	train-clean-360	We hadn t gone two cable lengths when a hundred savages howling and gesticulating entered the water up to their waists 
835_130876_000017_000003	train-clean-360	I looked to see if their appearance might draw some of the Nautilus s men onto the platform 
835_130876_000017_000004	train-clean-360	But no Lying well out that enormous machine still seemed completely deserted 
none	none	Twenty minutes later we boarded ship 
835_130876_000018_000001	train-clean-360	The hatches were open After mooring the skiff we reentered the Nautilus s interior 
835_130876_000078_000000	train-clean-360	I went below to the lounge 
835_130876_000019_000000	train-clean-360	I went below to the lounge from which some chords were wafting Captain Nemo was there leaning over the organ deep in a musical trance 
835_130876_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Captain I said to him 
835_130876_000021_000000	train-clean-360	He didn t hear me 
835_130876_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Captain I went on touching him with my hand 
835_130876_000023_000000	train-clean-360	He trembled and turning around 
835_130876_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah it s you professor he said to me 
835_130876_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 Well did you have a happy hunt 
835_130876_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Was your herb gathering a success 
835_130876_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes captain I replied but unfortunately we ve brought back a horde of bipeds whose proximity worries me 
835_130876_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 What sort of bipeds 
none	none	Savages
835_130876_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Savages Captain Nemo replied in an ironic tone 
835_130876_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 You set foot on one of the shores of this globe professor and you re surprised to find savages there 
835_130876_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Where aren t there savages And besides are they any worse than men elsewhere these people you call savages 
none	none	But captain
835_130876_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Speaking for myself sir I ve encountered them everywhere 
835_130876_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Well then I replied if you don t want to welcome them aboard the Nautilus you d better take some precautions 
835_130876_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Easy professor no cause for alarm 
none	none	But there are a large number of these natives
835_130876_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 What s your count 
835_130876_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 At least a hundred 
none	none	Professor Aronnax replied Captain Nemo whose fingers took their places again on the organ keys if every islander in Papua were to gather on that beach the Nautilus would still have nothing to fear from their attacks 
835_130876_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The captain s fingers then ran over the instrument s keyboard and I noticed that he touched only its black keys which gave his melodies a basically Scottish color 
none	none	Soon he had forgotten my presence and was lost in a reverie that I no longer tried to dispel I climbed onto the platform 
835_130876_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Night had already fallen because in this low latitude the sun sets quickly without any twilight I could see Gueboroa Island only dimly 
none	none	But numerous fires had been kindled on the beach attesting that the natives had no thoughts of leaving it 
835_130876_000039_000000	train-clean-360	For several hours I was left to myself sometimes musing on the islanders but no longer fearing them because the captain s unflappable confidence had won me over and sometimes forgetting them to marvel at the splendors of this tropical night 
none	none	My memories took wing toward France in the wake of those zodiacal stars due to twinkle over it in a few hours The moon shone in the midst of the constellations at their zenith I then remembered that this loyal good natured satellite would return to this same place the day after tomorrow to raise the tide and tear the Nautilus from its coral bed Near midnight seeing that all was quiet over the darkened waves as well as under the waterside trees I repaired to my cabin and fell into a peaceful sleep 
835_130876_000040_000000	train-clean-360	The night passed without mishap 
835_130876_000040_000001	train-clean-360	No doubt the Papuans had been frightened off by the mere sight of this monster aground in the bay because our hatches stayed open offering easy access to the Nautilus s interior 
835_130876_000041_000000	train-clean-360	At six o clock in the morning January eight I climbed onto the platform The morning shadows were lifting 
835_130876_000041_000001	train-clean-360	The island was soon on view through the dissolving mists first its beaches then its summits 
835_130876_000042_000000	train-clean-360	The islanders were still there in greater numbers than on the day before perhaps five hundred or six hundred of them 
none	none	Taking advantage of the low tide some of them had moved forward over the heads of coral to within two cable lengths of the Nautilus I could easily distinguish them They obviously were true Papuans men of fine stock athletic in build forehead high and broad nose large but not flat teeth white Their woolly red tinted hair was in sharp contrast to their bodies which were black and glistening like those of Nubians 
835_130876_000042_000003	train-clean-360	Beneath their pierced distended earlobes there dangled strings of beads made from bone Generally these savages were naked 
835_130876_000042_000004	train-clean-360	I noted some women among them dressed from hip to knee in grass skirts held up by belts made of vegetation 
none	none	Some of the chieftains adorned their necks with crescents and with necklaces made from beads of red and white glass Armed with bows arrows and shields nearly all of them carried from their shoulders a sort of net which held those polished stones their slings hurl with such dexterity 
835_130876_000043_000000	train-clean-360	One of these chieftains came fairly close to the Nautilus examining it with care 
835_130876_000043_000001	train-clean-360	He must have been a mado of high rank because he paraded in a mat of banana leaves that had ragged edges and was accented with bright colors 
835_130876_000044_000000	train-clean-360	I could easily have picked off this islander he stood at such close range but I thought it best to wait for an actual show of hostility Between Europeans and savages it s acceptable for Europeans to shoot back but not to attack first 
835_130876_000045_000000	train-clean-360	During this whole time of low tide the islanders lurked near the Nautilus but they weren t boisterous 
835_130876_000045_000001	train-clean-360	I often heard them repeat the word assai and from their gestures I understood they were inviting me to go ashore an invitation I felt obliged to decline 
835_130876_000046_000000	train-clean-360	So the skiff didn t leave shipside that day much to the displeasure of mister Land who couldn t complete his provisions The adroit Canadian spent his time preparing the meat and flour products he had brought from Gueboroa Island 
none	none	As for the savages they went back to shore near eleven o clock in the morning when the heads of coral began to disappear under the waves of the rising tide But I saw their numbers swell considerably on the beach It was likely that they had come from neighboring islands or from the mainland of Papua proper 
835_130876_000046_000002	train-clean-360	However I didn t see one local dugout canoe 
none	none	Having nothing better to do I decided to dredge these beautiful clear waters which exhibited a profusion of shells zoophytes and open sea plants 
835_130876_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Besides it was the last day the Nautilus would spend in these waterways if tomorrow it still floated off to the open sea as Captain Nemo had promised 
none	none	So I summoned Conseil who brought me a small light dragnet similar to those used in oyster fishing What about these savages Conseil asked me With all due respect to master they don t strike me as very wicked
835_130876_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 They re cannibals even so my boy 
835_130876_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 A person can be both a cannibal and a decent man Conseil replied just as a person can be both gluttonous and honorable The one doesn t exclude the other 
none	none	Fine Conseil And I agree that there are honorable cannibals who decently devour their prisoners 
835_130876_000052_000002	train-clean-360	However I m opposed to being devoured even in all decency so I ll keep on my guard especially since the Nautilus s commander seems to be taking no precautions And now let s get to work 
835_130876_000053_000000	train-clean-360	For two hours our fishing proceeded energetically but without bringing up any rarities 
835_130876_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Our dragnet was filled with Midas abalone harp shells obelisk snails and especially the finest hammer shells I had seen to that day 
none	none	We also gathered in a few sea cucumbers some pearl oysters and a dozen small turtles that we saved for the ship s pantry But just when I least expected it I laid my hands on a wonder a natural deformity I d have to call it something very seldom encountered Conseil had just made a cast of the dragnet and his gear had come back up loaded with a variety of fairly ordinary seashells when suddenly he saw me plunge my arms swiftly into the net pull out a shelled animal and give a conchological yell in other words the most piercing yell a human throat can produce Eh What happened to master Conseil asked very startled Did master get bitten
835_130876_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 No my boy but I d gladly have sacrificed a finger for such a find 
none	none	What find This shell I said displaying the subject of my triumph
835_130876_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 But that s simply an olive shell of the tent olive species genus Oliva order Pectinibranchia class Gastropoda branch Mollusca 
none	none	Yes yes Conseil 
835_130876_000060_000001	train-clean-360	But instead of coiling from right to left this olive shell rolls from left to right 
835_130876_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 It can t be Conseil exclaimed 
835_130876_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes my boy it s a left handed shell 
835_130876_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 A left handed shell Conseil repeated his heart pounding 
835_130876_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Look at its spiral 
none	none	Oh master can trust me on this Conseil said taking the valuable shell in trembling hands but never have I felt such excitement 
835_130876_000066_000000	train-clean-360	And there was good reason to be excited 
835_130876_000066_000001	train-clean-360	In fact as naturalists have ventured to observe dextrality is a well known law of nature In their rotational and orbital movements stars and their satellites go from right to left 
835_130876_000066_000002	train-clean-360	Man uses his right hand more often than his left and consequently his various instruments and equipment staircases locks watch springs et cetera are designed to be used in a right to left manner Now then nature has generally obeyed this law in coiling her shells They re right handed with only rare exceptions and when by chance a shell s spiral is left handed collectors will pay its weight in gold for it 
none	none	So Conseil and I were deep in the contemplation of our treasure and I was solemnly promising myself to enrich the Paris Museum with it when an ill timed stone hurled by one of the islanders whizzed over and shattered the valuable object in Conseil s hands 
835_130876_000068_000000	train-clean-360	I gave a yell of despair 
835_130876_000068_000001	train-clean-360	Conseil pounced on his rifle and aimed at a savage swinging a sling just ten meters away from him I tried to stop him but his shot went off and shattered a bracelet of amulets dangling from the islander s arm 
none	none	Conseil I shouted Conseil Eh What 
835_130876_000070_000002	train-clean-360	Didn t master see that this man eater initiated the attack 
835_130876_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 A shell isn t worth a human life I told him 
835_130876_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh the rascal Conseil exclaimed 
835_130876_000072_000001	train-clean-360	 I d rather he cracked my shoulder 
none	none	Conseil was in dead earnest but I didn t subscribe to his views However the situation had changed in only a short time and we hadn t noticed 
835_130876_000073_000001	train-clean-360	Now some twenty dugout canoes were surrounding the Nautilus 
835_130876_000073_000002	train-clean-360	Hollowed from tree trunks these dugouts were long narrow and well designed for speed keeping their balance by means of two bamboo poles that floated on the surface of the water They were maneuvered by skillful half naked paddlers and I viewed their advance with definite alarm 
none	none	It was obvious these Papuans had already entered into relations with Europeans and knew their ships But this long iron cylinder lying in the bay with no masts or funnels what were they to make of it Nothing good because at first they kept it at a respectful distance However seeing that it stayed motionless they regained confidence little by little and tried to become more familiar with it Now then it was precisely this familiarity that we needed to prevent Since our weapons made no sound when they went off they would have only a moderate effect on these islanders who reputedly respect nothing but noisy mechanisms 
835_130876_000074_000002	train-clean-360	Without thunderclaps lightning bolts would be much less frightening although the danger lies in the flash not the noise 
835_130876_000075_000000	train-clean-360	Just then the dugout canoes drew nearer to the Nautilus and a cloud of arrows burst over us 
none	none	Fire and brimstone it s hailing Conseil said And poisoned hail perhaps
835_130876_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 We ve got to alert Captain Nemo I said reentering the hatch 
none	none	I went below to the lounge 
835_130876_000078_000001	train-clean-360	I found no one there 
835_130876_000078_000002	train-clean-360	I ventured a knock at the door opening into the captain s stateroom 
835_130876_000079_000000	train-clean-360	The word Enter answered me 
835_130876_000079_000001	train-clean-360	I did so and found Captain Nemo busy with calculations in which there was no shortage of X and other algebraic signs 
835_130876_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Am I disturbing you I said out of politeness 
835_130876_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 Correct Professor Aronnax the captain answered me But I imagine you have pressing reasons for looking me up 
835_130876_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Very pressing 
835_130876_000082_000001	train-clean-360	Native dugout canoes are surrounding us and in a few minutes we re sure to be assaulted by several hundred savages 
835_130876_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah Captain Nemo put in serenely 
none	none	They ve come in their dugouts Yes sir
835_130876_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Well sir closing the hatches should do the trick 
835_130876_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 Precisely and that s what I came to tell you 
835_130876_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing easier Captain Nemo said 
835_130876_000088_000000	train-clean-360	And he pressed an electric button transmitting an order to the crew s quarters 
835_130876_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 There sir all under control he told me after a few moments The skiff is in place and the hatches are closed 
none	none	I don t imagine you re worried that these gentlemen will stave in walls that shells from your frigate couldn t breach
835_130876_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 No captain but one danger still remains 
none	none	What s that sir Tomorrow at about this time we ll need to reopen the hatches to renew the Nautilus s air No argument sir since our craft breathes in the manner favored by cetaceans
835_130876_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 But if these Papuans are occupying the platform at that moment I don t see how you can prevent them from entering 
835_130876_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 Then sir you assume they ll board the ship 
835_130876_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 I m certain of it 
835_130876_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 Well sir let them come aboard 
835_130876_000097_000001	train-clean-360	I see no reason to prevent them Deep down they re just poor devils these Papuans and I don t want my visit to Gueboroa Island to cost the life of a single one of these unfortunate people 
835_130876_000098_000000	train-clean-360	On this note I was about to withdraw but Captain Nemo detained me and invited me to take a seat next to him 
835_130876_000098_000001	train-clean-360	He questioned me with interest on our excursions ashore and on our hunting but seemed not to understand the Canadian s passionate craving for red meat Then our conversation skimmed various subjects and without being more forthcoming Captain Nemo proved more affable 
835_130876_000099_000000	train-clean-360	Among other things we came to talk of the Nautilus s circumstances aground in the same strait where Captain Dumont d Urville had nearly miscarried 
835_130876_000099_000001	train-clean-360	Then pertinent to this 
835_130876_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 He was one of your great seamen the captain told me one of your shrewdest navigators that d Urville 
835_130876_000100_000001	train-clean-360	He was the Frenchman s Captain Cook 
835_130876_000100_000002	train-clean-360	A man wise but unlucky Braving the ice banks of the South Pole the coral of Oceania the cannibals of the Pacific only to perish wretchedly in a train wreck If that energetic man was able to think about his life in its last seconds imagine what his final thoughts must have been 
835_130876_000101_000000	train-clean-360	As he spoke Captain Nemo seemed deeply moved an emotion I felt was to his credit 
none	none	Then chart in hand we returned to the deeds of the French navigator his voyages to circumnavigate the globe his double attempt at the South Pole which led to his discovery of the Adelie Coast and the Louis Philippe Peninsula finally his hydrographic surveys of the chief islands in Oceania
835_130876_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 What your d Urville did on the surface of the sea Captain Nemo told me I ve done in the ocean s interior but more easily more completely than he 
none	none	Constantly tossed about by hurricanes the Zealous and the new Astrolabe couldn t compare with the Nautilus a quiet work room truly at rest in the midst of the waters
835_130876_000104_000000	train-clean-360	 Even so captain I said there is one major similarity between Dumont d Urville s sloops of war and the Nautilus 
none	none	What s that sir
835_130876_000106_000000	train-clean-360	 Like them the Nautilus has run aground 
835_130876_000107_000000	train-clean-360	 The Nautilus is not aground sir Captain Nemo replied icily The Nautilus was built to rest on the ocean floor and I don t need to undertake the arduous labors the maneuvers d Urville had to attempt in order to float off his sloops of war The Zealous and the new Astrolabe wellnigh perished but my Nautilus is in no danger 
835_130876_000107_000001	train-clean-360	Tomorrow on the day stated and at the hour stated the tide will peacefully lift it off and it will resume its navigating through the seas 
835_130876_000108_000000	train-clean-360	 Captain I said I don t doubt 
835_130876_000109_000000	train-clean-360	 Tomorrow Captain Nemo added standing up tomorrow at two forty in the afternoon the Nautilus will float off and exit the Torres Strait undamaged 
835_130876_000110_000000	train-clean-360	Pronouncing these words in an extremely sharp tone Captain Nemo gave me a curt bow 
835_130876_000110_000001	train-clean-360	This was my dismissal and I reentered my stateroom 
none	none	There I found Conseil who wanted to know the upshot of my interview with the captain
835_130876_000112_000000	train-clean-360	 My boy I replied when I expressed the belief that these Papuan natives were a threat to his Nautilus the captain answered me with great irony 
835_130876_000112_000001	train-clean-360	So I ve just one thing to say to you have faith in him and sleep in peace 
835_130876_000113_000000	train-clean-360	 Master has no need for my services 
none	none	No my friend 
835_130876_000114_000001	train-clean-360	What s Ned Land up to 
835_130876_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 Begging master s indulgence Conseil replied but our friend Ned is concocting a kangaroo pie that will be the eighth wonder 
none	none	I was left to myself 
6235_36641_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I went to bed 
none	none	but slept pretty poorly I kept hearing noises from the savages who were stamping on the platform and letting out deafening yells The night passed in this way without the crew ever emerging from their usual inertia They were no more disturbed by the presence of these man eaters than soldiers in an armored fortress are troubled by ants running over the armor plate 
835_130876_000117_000000	train-clean-360	I got up at six o clock in the morning 
835_130876_000117_000001	train-clean-360	The hatches weren t open So the air inside hadn t been renewed but the air tanks were kept full for any eventuality and would function appropriately to shoot a few cubic meters of oxygen into the Nautilus s thin atmosphere 
835_130876_000118_000000	train-clean-360	I worked in my stateroom until noon without seeing Captain Nemo even for an instant 
835_130876_000118_000001	train-clean-360	Nobody on board seemed to be making any preparations for departure 
835_130876_000119_000000	train-clean-360	I still waited for a while then I made my way to the main lounge Its timepiece marked two thirty 
835_130876_000119_000001	train-clean-360	In ten minutes the tide would reach its maximum elevation and if Captain Nemo hadn t made a rash promise the Nautilus would immediately break free 
835_130876_000119_000002	train-clean-360	If not many months might pass before it could leave its coral bed 
835_130876_000120_000000	train-clean-360	But some preliminary vibrations could soon be felt over the boat s hull I heard its plating grind against the limestone roughness of that coral base 
835_130876_000121_000000	train-clean-360	At two thirty five Captain Nemo appeared in the lounge 
835_130876_000122_000000	train-clean-360	 We re about to depart he said 
835_130876_000123_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah I put in 
835_130876_000124_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve given orders to open the hatches 
835_130876_000125_000000	train-clean-360	 What about the Papuans 
none	none	What about them Captain Nemo replied with a light shrug of his shoulders
835_130876_000127_000000	train-clean-360	 Won t they come inside the Nautilus 
835_130876_000128_000000	train-clean-360	 How will they manage that 
835_130876_000129_000000	train-clean-360	 By jumping down the hatches you re about to open 
835_130876_000130_000000	train-clean-360	 Professor Aronnax Captain Nemo replied serenely the Nautilus s hatches aren t to be entered in that fashion even when they re open 
835_130876_000131_000000	train-clean-360	I gaped at the captain 
none	none	You don t understand he said to me
835_130876_000133_000000	train-clean-360	 Not in the least 
835_130876_000134_000000	train-clean-360	 Well come along and you ll see 
835_130876_000135_000000	train-clean-360	I headed to the central companionway 
none	none	There very puzzled Ned Land and Conseil watched the crewmen opening the hatches while a frightful clamor and furious shouts resounded outside 
835_130876_000136_000000	train-clean-360	The hatch lids fell back onto the outer plating Twenty horrible faces appeared 
835_130876_000136_000001	train-clean-360	But when the first islander laid hands on the companionway railing he was flung backward by some invisible power lord knows what 
835_130876_000136_000002	train-clean-360	He ran off howling in terror and wildly prancing around 
835_130876_000137_000000	train-clean-360	Ten of his companions followed him 
835_130876_000137_000001	train-clean-360	All ten met the same fate 
none	none	Conseil was in ecstasy 
835_130876_000138_000001	train-clean-360	Carried away by his violent instincts Ned Land leaped up the companionway 
835_130876_000138_000002	train-clean-360	But as soon as his hands seized the railing he was thrown backward in his turn 
none	none	Damnation he exclaimed
835_130876_000139_000001	train-clean-360	 I ve been struck by a lightning bolt 
none	none	These words explained everything to me It wasn t just a railing that led to the platform it was a metal cable fully charged with the ship s electricity 
835_130876_000140_000002	train-clean-360	Anyone who touched it got a fearsome shock and such a shock would have been fatal if Captain Nemo had thrown the full current from his equipment into this conducting cable It could honestly be said that he had stretched between himself and his assailants a network of electricity no one could clear with impunity 
835_130876_000141_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile crazed with terror the unhinged Papuans beat a retreat As for us half laughing we massaged and comforted poor Ned Land who was swearing like one possessed 
none	none	But just then lifted off by the tide s final undulations the Nautilus left its coral bed at exactly that fortieth minute pinpointed by the captain Its propeller churned the waves with lazy majesty Gathering speed little by little the ship navigated on the surface of the ocean and safe and sound it left behind the dangerous narrows of the Torres Strait CHAPTER twenty three Aegri Somnia Latin troubled dreams Ed THE FOLLOWING DAY January ten the Nautilus resumed its travels in midwater but at a remarkable speed that I estimated to be at least thirty five miles per hour The propeller was going so fast I could neither follow nor count its revolutions I thought about how this marvelous electric force not only gave motion heat and light to the Nautilus but even protected it against outside attack transforming it into a sacred ark no profane hand could touch without being blasted my wonderment was boundless and it went from the submersible itself to the engineer who had created it We were traveling due west and on January eleven we doubled Cape Wessel located in longitude one hundred thirty five degrees and latitude ten degrees north the western tip of the Gulf of Carpentaria Reefs were still numerous but more widely scattered and were fixed on the chart with the greatest accuracy The Nautilus easily avoided the Money breakers to port and the Victoria reefs to starboard positioned at longitude one hundred thirty degrees on the tenth parallel which we went along rigorously On January thirteen arriving in the Timor Sea Captain Nemo raised the island of that name at longitude one hundred twenty two degrees This island whose surface area measures sixteen twenty five square leagues is governed by rajahs These aristocrats deem themselves the sons of crocodiles in other words descendants with the most exalted origins to which a human being can lay claim Accordingly their scaly ancestors infest the island s rivers and are the subjects of special veneration They are sheltered nurtured flattered pampered and offered a ritual diet of nubile maidens and woe to the foreigner who lifts a finger against these sacred saurians But the Nautilus wanted nothing to do with these nasty animals Timor Island was visible for barely an instant at noon while the chief officer determined his position I also caught only a glimpse of little Roti Island part of this same group whose women have a well established reputation for beauty in the Malaysian marketplace After our position fix the Nautilus s latitude bearings were modulated to the southwest Our prow pointed to the Indian Ocean Where would Captain Nemo s fancies take us Would he head up to the shores of Asia Would he pull nearer to the beaches of Europe Unlikely choices for a man who avoided populated areas So would he go down south Would he double the Cape of Good Hope then Cape Horn and push on to the Antarctic pole Finally would he return to the seas of the Pacific where his Nautilus could navigate freely and easily Time would tell After cruising along the Cartier Hibernia Seringapatam and Scott reefs the solid element s last exertions against the liquid element we were beyond all sight of shore by January fourteen The Nautilus slowed down in an odd manner and very unpredictable in its ways it sometimes swam in the midst of the waters sometimes drifted on their surface During this phase of our voyage Captain Nemo conducted interesting experiments on the different temperatures in various strata of the sea Under ordinary conditions such readings are obtained using some pretty complicated instruments whose findings are dubious to say the least whether they re thermometric sounding lines whose glass often shatters under the water s pressure or those devices based on the varying resistance of metals to electric currents The results so obtained can t be adequately double checked By contrast Captain Nemo would seek the sea s temperature by going himself into its depths and when he placed his thermometer in contact with the various layers of liquid he found the sought for degree immediately and with certainty And so by loading up its ballast tanks or by sinking obliquely with its slanting fins the Nautilus successively reached depths of three thousand four thousand five thousand seven thousand nine thousand and ten thousand meters and the ultimate conclusion from these experiments was that in all latitudes the sea had a permanent temperature of four point five degrees centigrade at a depth of one thousand meters I watched these experiments with the most intense fascination Captain Nemo brought a real passion to them I often wondered why he took these observations Were they for the benefit of his fellow man It was unlikely because sooner or later his work would perish with him in some unknown sea Unless he intended the results of his experiments for me But that meant this strange voyage of mine would come to an end and no such end was in sight Be that as it may Captain Nemo also introduced me to the different data he had obtained on the relative densities of the water in our globe s chief seas From this news I derived some personal enlightenment having nothing to do with science It happened the morning of January fifteen The captain with whom I was strolling on the platform asked me if I knew how salt water differs in density from sea to sea I said no adding that there was a lack of rigorous scientific observations on this subject I ve taken such observations he told me and I can vouch for their reliability Fine I replied but the Nautilus lives in a separate world and the secrets of its scientists don t make their way ashore You re right professor he told me after a few moments of silence This is a separate world It s as alien to the earth as the planets accompanying our globe around the sun and we ll never become familiar with the work of scientists on Saturn or Jupiter But since fate has linked our two lives I can reveal the results of my observations to you I m all attention captain You re aware professor that salt water is denser than fresh water but this density isn t uniform In essence if I represent the density of fresh water by one point zero then I find one point twenty eight for the waters of the Atlantic one point twenty six for the waters of the Pacific one point thirty for the waters of the Mediterranean Aha I thought so he ventures into the Mediterranean one point eighteen for the waters of the Ionian Sea and one point twenty nine for the waters of the Adriatic Assuredly the Nautilus didn t avoid the heavily traveled seas of Europe and from this insight I concluded that the ship would take us back perhaps very soon to more civilized shores I expected Ned Land to greet this news with unfeigned satisfaction For several days our work hours were spent in all sorts of experiments on the degree of salinity in waters of different depths or on their electric properties coloration and transparency and in every instance Captain Nemo displayed an ingenuity equaled only by his graciousness toward me Then I saw no more of him for some days and again lived on board in seclusion On January sixteen the Nautilus seemed to have fallen asleep just a few meters beneath the surface of the water Its electric equipment had been turned off and the motionless propeller let it ride with the waves I assumed that the crew were busy with interior repairs required by the engine s strenuous mechanical action My companions and I then witnessed an unusual sight The panels in the lounge were open and since the Nautilus s beacon was off a hazy darkness reigned in the midst of the waters Covered with heavy clouds the stormy sky gave only the faintest light to the ocean s upper strata I was observing the state of the sea under these conditions and even the largest fish were nothing more than ill defined shadows when the Nautilus was suddenly transferred into broad daylight At first I thought the beacon had gone back on and was casting its electric light into the liquid mass I was mistaken and after a hasty examination I discovered my error The Nautilus had drifted into the midst of some phosphorescent strata which in this darkness came off as positively dazzling This effect was caused by myriads of tiny luminous animals whose brightness increased when they glided over the metal hull of our submersible In the midst of these luminous sheets of water I then glimpsed flashes of light like those seen inside a blazing furnace from streams of molten lead or from masses of metal brought to a white heat flashes so intense that certain areas of the light became shadows by comparison in a fiery setting from which every shadow should seemingly have been banished No this was no longer the calm emission of our usual lighting This light throbbed with unprecedented vigor and activity You sensed that it was alive In essence it was a cluster of countless open sea infusoria of noctiluca an eighth of an inch wide actual globules of transparent jelly equipped with a threadlike tentacle up to twenty five thousand of which have been counted in thirty cubic centimeters of water And the power of their light was increased by those glimmers unique to medusas starfish common jellyfish angel wing clams and other phosphorescent zoophytes which were saturated with grease from organic matter decomposed by the sea and perhaps with mucus secreted by fish For several hours the Nautilus drifted in this brilliant tide and our wonderment grew when we saw huge marine animals cavorting in it like the fire dwelling salamanders of myth In the midst of these flames that didn t burn I could see swift elegant porpoises the tireless pranksters of the seas and sailfish three meters long those shrewd heralds of hurricanes whose fearsome broadswords sometimes banged against the lounge window Then smaller fish appeared miscellaneous triggerfish leather jacks unicornfish and a hundred others that left stripes on this luminous atmosphere in their course Some magic lay behind this dazzling sight Perhaps some atmospheric condition had intensified this phenomenon Perhaps a storm had been unleashed on the surface of the waves But only a few meters down the Nautilus felt no tempest s fury and the ship rocked peacefully in the midst of the calm waters And so it went some new wonder constantly delighting us Conseil observed and classified his zoophytes articulates mollusks and fish The days passed quickly and I no longer kept track of them Ned as usual kept looking for changes of pace from our standard fare Like actual snails we were at home in our shell and I can vouch that it s easy to turn into a full fledged snail So this way of living began to seem simple and natural to us and we no longer envisioned a different lifestyle on the surface of the planet earth when something happened to remind us of our strange circumstances On January eighteen the Nautilus lay in longitude one hundred five degrees and latitude fifteen degrees south The weather was threatening the sea rough and billowy The wind was blowing a strong gust from the east The barometer which had been falling for some days forecast an approaching struggle of the elements I had climbed onto the platform just as the chief officer was taking his readings of hour angles Out of habit I waited for him to pronounce his daily phrase But that day it was replaced by a different phrase just as incomprehensible Almost at once I saw Captain Nemo appear lift his spyglass and inspect the horizon For some minutes the captain stood motionless rooted to the spot contained within the field of his lens Then he lowered his spyglass and exchanged about ten words with his chief officer The latter seemed to be in the grip of an excitement he tried in vain to control More in command of himself Captain Nemo remained cool Furthermore he seemed to be raising certain objections that his chief officer kept answering with flat assurances At least that s what I gathered from their differences in tone and gesture As for me I stared industriously in the direction under observation but without spotting a thing Sky and water merged into a perfectly clean horizon line Meanwhile Captain Nemo strolled from one end of the platform to the other not glancing at me perhaps not even seeing me His step was firm but less regular than usual Sometimes he would stop cross his arms over his chest and observe the sea What could he be looking for over that immense expanse By then the Nautilus lay hundreds of miles from the nearest coast The chief officer kept lifting his spyglass and stubbornly examining the horizon walking up and down stamping his foot in his nervous agitation a sharp contrast to his superior But this mystery would inevitably be cleared up and soon because Captain Nemo gave orders to increase speed at once the engine stepped up its drive power setting the propeller in swifter rotation Just then the chief officer drew the captain s attention anew The latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point indicated He observed it a good while As for me deeply puzzled I went below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long range telescope I habitually used Leaning my elbows on the beacon housing which jutted from the stern of the platform I got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea But no sooner had I peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was snatched from my hands I spun around Captain Nemo was standing before me but I almost didn t recognize him His facial features were transfigured Gleaming with dark fire his eyes had shrunk beneath his frowning brow His teeth were half bared His rigid body clenched fists and head drawn between his shoulders all attested to a fierce hate breathing from every pore He didn t move My spyglass fell from his hand and rolled at his feet Had I accidentally caused these symptoms of anger Did this incomprehensible individual think I had detected some secret forbidden to guests on the Nautilus No I wasn t the subject of his hate because he wasn t even looking at me his eyes stayed stubbornly focused on that inscrutable point of the horizon Finally Captain Nemo regained his self control His facial appearance so profoundly changed now resumed its usual calm He addressed a few words to his chief officer in their strange language then he turned to me Professor Aronnax he told me in a tone of some urgency I ask that you now honor one of the binding agreements between us Which one captain You and your companions must be placed in confinement until I see fit to set you free You re in command I answered gaping at him But may I address a question to you You may not sir After that I stopped objecting and started obeying since resistance was useless I went below to the cabin occupied by Ned Land and Conseil and I informed them of the captain s decision I ll let the reader decide how this news was received by the Canadian In any case there was no time for explanations Four crewmen were waiting at the door and they led us to the cell where we had spent our first night aboard the Nautilus Ned Land tried to lodge a complaint but the only answer he got was a door shut in his face Will master tell me what this means Conseil asked me I told my companions what had happened They were as astonished as I was but no wiser Then I sank into deep speculation and Captain Nemo s strange facial seizure kept haunting me I was incapable of connecting two ideas in logical order and I had strayed into the most absurd hypotheses when I was snapped out of my mental struggles by these words from Ned Land Well look here Lunch is served Indeed the table had been laid Apparently Captain Nemo had given this order at the same time he commanded the Nautilus to pick up speed Will master allow me to make him a recommendation Conseil asked me Yes my boy I replied Well master needs to eat his lunch It s prudent because we have no idea what the future holds You re right Conseil Unfortunately Ned Land said they ve only given us the standard menu Ned my friend Conseil answered what would you say if they d given us no lunch at all This dose of sanity cut the harpooner s complaints clean off We sat down at the table Our meal proceeded pretty much in silence I ate very little Conseil everlastingly prudent force fed himself and despite the menu Ned Land didn t waste a bite Then lunch over each of us propped himself in a corner Just then the luminous globe lighting our cell went out leaving us in profound darkness Ned Land soon dozed off and to my astonishment Conseil also fell into a heavy slumber I was wondering what could have caused this urgent need for sleep when I felt a dense torpor saturate my brain I tried to keep my eyes open but they closed in spite of me I was in the grip of anguished hallucinations Obviously some sleep inducing substance had been laced into the food we d just eaten So imprisonment wasn t enough to conceal Captain Nemo s plans from us sleep was needed as well Then I heard the hatches close The sea s undulations which had been creating a gentle rocking motion now ceased Had the Nautilus left the surface of the ocean Was it reentering the motionless strata deep in the sea I tried to fight off this drowsiness It was impossible My breathing grew weaker I felt a mortal chill freeze my dull nearly paralyzed limbs Like little domes of lead my lids fell over my eyes I couldn t raise them A morbid sleep full of hallucinations seized my whole being Then the visions disappeared and left me in utter oblivion CHAPTER twenty four The Coral Realm 
258_130878_000002_000000	train-clean-360	THE NEXT DAY I woke up with my head unusually clear 
258_130878_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Much to my surprise I was in my stateroom 
none	none	No doubt my companions had been put back in their cabin without noticing it any more than I had Like me they would have no idea what took place during the night and to unravel this mystery I could count only on some future happenstance 
258_130878_000003_000000	train-clean-360	I then considered leaving my stateroom 
258_130878_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Was I free or still a prisoner Perfectly free 
258_130878_000003_000002	train-clean-360	I opened my door headed down the gangways and climbed the central companionway 
258_130878_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Hatches that had been closed the day before were now open 
none	none	I arrived on the platform Ned Land and Conseil were there waiting for me 
258_130878_000004_000001	train-clean-360	I questioned them They knew nothing 
258_130878_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Lost in a heavy sleep of which they had no memory they were quite startled to be back in their cabin 
none	none	As for the Nautilus it seemed as tranquil and mysterious as ever It was cruising on the surface of the waves at a moderate speed Nothing seemed to have changed on board Ned Land observed the sea with his penetrating eyes It was deserted The Canadian sighted nothing new on the horizon neither sail nor shore A breeze was blowing noisily from the west and disheveled by the wind long billows made the submersible roll very noticeably 
258_130878_000007_000000	train-clean-360	After renewing its air the Nautilus stayed at an average depth of fifteen meters enabling it to return quickly to the surface of the waves 
258_130878_000007_000001	train-clean-360	And contrary to custom it executed such a maneuver several times during that day of January nineteen 
258_130878_000007_000002	train-clean-360	The chief officer would then climb onto the platform and his usual phrase would ring through the ship s interior 
none	none	As for Captain Nemo he didn t appear Of the other men on board I saw only my emotionless steward who served me with his usual mute efficiency 
258_130878_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Near two o clock I was busy organizing my notes in the lounge when the captain opened the door and appeared 
258_130878_000009_000001	train-clean-360	I bowed to him He gave me an almost imperceptible bow in return without saying a word to me 
258_130878_000009_000002	train-clean-360	I resumed my work hoping he might give me some explanation of the previous afternoon s events 
none	none	He did nothing of the sort I stared at him 
258_130878_000009_000004	train-clean-360	His face looked exhausted his reddened eyes hadn t been refreshed by sleep his facial features expressed profound sadness real chagrin 
258_130878_000009_000005	train-clean-360	He walked up and down sat and stood picked up a book at random discarded it immediately consulted his instruments without taking his customary notes and seemed unable to rest easy for an instant 
none	none	Finally he came over to me and said
258_130878_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you a physician Professor Aronnax 
258_130878_000012_000000	train-clean-360	This inquiry was so unexpected that I stared at him a good while without replying 
none	none	Are you a physician he repeated Several of your scientific colleagues took their degrees in medicine such as Gratiolet Moquin Tandon and others
258_130878_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 That s right I said I am a doctor I used to be on call at the hospitals 
258_130878_000014_000001	train-clean-360	I was in practice for several years before joining the museum 
258_130878_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Excellent sir 
258_130878_000016_000000	train-clean-360	My reply obviously pleased Captain Nemo 
258_130878_000016_000001	train-clean-360	But not knowing what he was driving at I waited for further questions ready to reply as circumstances dictated 
258_130878_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Professor Aronnax the captain said to me would you consent to give your medical attentions to one of my men 
258_130878_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Someone is sick 
none	none	Yes
258_130878_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I m ready to go with you 
none	none	Come 
258_130878_000022_000000	train-clean-360	I admit that my heart was pounding 
none	none	Lord knows why but I saw a definite connection between this sick crewman and yesterday s happenings and the mystery of those events concerned me at least as much as the man s sickness 
258_130878_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Nemo led me to the Nautilus s stern and invited me into a cabin located next to the sailors quarters 
none	none	On a bed there lay a man some forty years old with strongly molded features the very image of an Anglo Saxon 
258_130878_000025_000000	train-clean-360	I bent over him 
258_130878_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Not only was he sick he was wounded Swathed in blood soaked linen his head was resting on a folded pillow I undid the linen bandages while the wounded man gazed with great staring eyes and let me proceed without making a single complaint 
none	none	It was a horrible wound 
258_130878_000026_000001	train-clean-360	The cranium had been smashed open by some blunt instrument leaving the naked brains exposed and the cerebral matter had suffered deep abrasions 
258_130878_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Blood clots had formed in this dissolving mass taking on the color of wine dregs Both contusion and concussion of the brain had occurred 
none	none	The sick man s breathing was labored and muscle spasms quivered in his face Cerebral inflammation was complete and had brought on a paralysis of movement and sensation 
258_130878_000027_000000	train-clean-360	I took the wounded man s pulse 
none	none	It was intermittent The body s extremities were already growing cold and I saw that death was approaching without any possibility of my holding it in check After dressing the poor man s wound I redid the linen bandages around his head and I turned to Captain Nemo
258_130878_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 How did he get this wound I asked him 
none	none	That s not important the captain replied evasively The Nautilus suffered a collision that cracked one of the engine levers and it struck this man 
258_130878_000029_000001	train-clean-360	My chief officer was standing beside him This man leaped forward to intercept the blow 
none	none	A brother lays down his life for his brother a friend for his friend what could be simpler That s the law for everyone on board the Nautilus But what s your diagnosis of his condition I hesitated to speak my mind
258_130878_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 You may talk freely the captain told me 
258_130878_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 This man doesn t understand French 
none	none	I took a last look at the wounded man then I replied This man will be dead in two hours Nothing can save him Nothing Captain Nemo clenched his fists and tears slid from his eyes which I had thought incapable of weeping 
258_130878_000037_000000	train-clean-360	For a few moments more I observed the dying man whose life was ebbing little by little 
258_130878_000037_000001	train-clean-360	He grew still more pale under the electric light that bathed his deathbed 
258_130878_000037_000002	train-clean-360	I looked at his intelligent head furrowed with premature wrinkles that misfortune perhaps misery had etched long before 
258_130878_000037_000003	train-clean-360	I was hoping to detect the secret of his life in the last words that might escape from his lips 
none	none	You may go Professor Aronnax Captain Nemo told me I left the captain in the dying man s cabin and I repaired to my stateroom very moved by this scene All day long I was aquiver with gruesome forebodings 
258_130878_000039_000002	train-clean-360	That night I slept poorly and between my fitful dreams I thought I heard a distant moaning like a funeral dirge 
258_130878_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Was it a prayer for the dead murmured in that language I couldn t understand 
258_130878_000040_000000	train-clean-360	The next morning I climbed on deck 
none	none	Captain Nemo was already there As soon as he saw me he came over
258_130878_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Professor he said to me would it be convenient for you to make an underwater excursion today 
258_130878_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 With my companions I asked 
258_130878_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 If they re agreeable 
258_130878_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 We re yours to command captain 
258_130878_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Then kindly put on your diving suits 
none	none	As for the dead or dying man he hadn t come into the picture I rejoined Ned Land and Conseil 
258_130878_000046_000002	train-clean-360	I informed them of Captain Nemo s proposition Conseil was eager to accept and this time the Canadian proved perfectly amenable to going with us 
none	none	It was eight o clock in the morning By eight thirty we were suited up for this new stroll and equipped with our two devices for lighting and breathing The double door opened and accompanied by Captain Nemo with a dozen crewmen following we set foot on the firm seafloor where the Nautilus was resting ten meters down 
258_130878_000048_000000	train-clean-360	A gentle slope gravitated to an uneven bottom whose depth was about fifteen fathoms 
258_130878_000048_000001	train-clean-360	This bottom was completely different from the one I had visited during my first excursion under the waters of the Pacific Ocean 
258_130878_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Here I saw no fine grained sand no underwater prairies not one open sea forest 
none	none	I immediately recognized the wondrous region in which Captain Nemo did the honors that day It was the coral realm 
258_130878_000049_000000	train-clean-360	In the zoophyte branch class Alcyonaria one finds the order Gorgonaria which contains three groups sea fans isidian polyps and coral polyps It s in this last that precious coral belongs an unusual substance that at different times has been classified in the mineral vegetable and animal kingdoms 
none	none	Medicine to the ancients jewelry to the moderns it wasn t decisively placed in the animal kingdom until sixteen ninety four by Peysonnel of Marseilles A coral is a unit of tiny animals assembled over a polypary that s brittle and stony in nature 
258_130878_000050_000001	train-clean-360	These polyps have a unique generating mechanism that reproduces them via the budding process and they have an individual existence while also participating in a communal life 
none	none	Hence they embody a sort of natural socialism I was familiar with the latest research on this bizarre zoophyte which turns to stone while taking on a tree form as some naturalists have very aptly observed and nothing could have been more fascinating to me than to visit one of these petrified forests that nature has planted on the bottom of the sea 
258_130878_000051_000000	train-clean-360	We turned on our Ruhmkorff devices and went along a coral shoal in the process of forming which given time will someday close off this whole part of the Indian Ocean 
none	none	Our path was bordered by hopelessly tangled bushes formed from snarls of shrubs all covered with little star shaped white streaked flowers Only contrary to plants on shore these tree forms become attached to rocks on the seafloor by heading from top to bottom 
258_130878_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Our lights produced a thousand delightful effects while playing over these brightly colored boughs 
none	none	I fancied I saw these cylindrical membrane filled tubes trembling beneath the water s undulations I was tempted to gather their fresh petals which were adorned with delicate tentacles some newly in bloom others barely opened while nimble fish with fluttering fins brushed past them like flocks of birds But if my hands came near the moving flowers of these sensitive lively creatures an alarm would instantly sound throughout the colony The white petals retracted into their red sheaths the flowers vanished before my eyes and the bush changed into a chunk of stony nipples 
258_130878_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Sheer chance had placed me in the presence of the most valuable specimens of this zoophyte 
258_130878_000053_000001	train-clean-360	This coral was the equal of those fished up from the Mediterranean off the Barbary Coast or the shores of France and Italy 
258_130878_000053_000002	train-clean-360	With its bright colors it lived up to those poetic names of blood flower and blood foam that the industry confers on its finest exhibits 
258_130878_000053_000003	train-clean-360	Coral sells for as much as five hundred francs per kilogram and in this locality the liquid strata hid enough to make the fortunes of a whole host of coral fishermen This valuable substance often merges with other polyparies forming compact hopelessly tangled units known as macciota and I noted some wonderful pink samples of this coral 
none	none	But as the bushes shrank the tree forms magnified Actual petrified thickets and long alcoves from some fantastic school of architecture kept opening up before our steps Captain Nemo entered beneath a dark gallery whose gentle slope took us to a depth of one hundred meters 
258_130878_000054_000001	train-clean-360	The light from our glass coils produced magical effects at times lingering on the wrinkled roughness of some natural arch or some overhang suspended like a chandelier which our lamps flecked with fiery sparks 
none	none	Amid these shrubs of precious coral I observed other polyps no less unusual melita coral rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths then a few tufts of genus Corallina some green and others red actually a type of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts which after long disputes naturalists have finally placed in the vegetable kingdom But as one intellectual has remarked Here perhaps is the actual point where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone but without breaking away from its crude starting point 
258_130878_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Finally after two hours of walking we reached a depth of about three hundred meters in other words the lowermost limit at which coral can begin to form 
258_130878_000055_000001	train-clean-360	But here it was no longer some isolated bush or a modest grove of low timber 
none	none	It was an immense forest huge mineral vegetation enormous petrified trees linked by garlands of elegant hydras from the genus Plumularia those tropical creepers of the sea all decked out in shades and gleams We passed freely under their lofty boughs lost up in the shadows of the waves while at our feet organ pipe coral stony coral star coral fungus coral and sea anemone from the genus Caryophylia formed a carpet of flowers all strewn with dazzling gems 
258_130878_000056_000000	train-clean-360	What an indescribable sight 
258_130878_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Oh if only we could share our feelings Why were we imprisoned behind these masks of metal and glass Why were we forbidden to talk with each other 
none	none	At least let us lead the lives of the fish that populate this liquid element or better yet the lives of amphibians which can spend long hours either at sea or on shore traveling through their double domain as their whims dictate 
258_130878_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile Captain Nemo had called a halt 
258_130878_000057_000001	train-clean-360	My companions and I stopped walking and turning around I saw the crewmen form a semicircle around their leader 
258_130878_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Looking with greater care I observed that four of them were carrying on their shoulders an object that was oblong in shape 
258_130878_000058_000000	train-clean-360	At this locality we stood in the center of a huge clearing surrounded by the tall tree forms of this underwater forest Our lamps cast a sort of brilliant twilight over the area making inordinately long shadows on the seafloor 
258_130878_000058_000001	train-clean-360	Past the boundaries of the clearing the darkness deepened again relieved only by little sparkles given off by the sharp crests of coral 
258_130878_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Ned Land and Conseil stood next to me 
258_130878_000059_000001	train-clean-360	We stared and it dawned on me that I was about to witness a strange scene Observing the seafloor I saw that it swelled at certain points from low bulges that were encrusted with limestone deposits and arranged with a symmetry that betrayed the hand of man 
258_130878_000060_000000	train-clean-360	In the middle of the clearing on a pedestal of roughly piled rocks there stood a cross of coral extending long arms you would have thought were made of petrified blood 
258_130878_000061_000000	train-clean-360	At a signal from Captain Nemo one of his men stepped forward and a few feet from this cross detached a mattock from his belt and began to dig a hole 
258_130878_000062_000000	train-clean-360	I finally understood 
258_130878_000062_000001	train-clean-360	This clearing was a cemetery this hole a grave that oblong object the body of the man who must have died during the night 
258_130878_000062_000002	train-clean-360	Captain Nemo and his men had come to bury their companion in this communal resting place on the inaccessible ocean floor 
none	none	No 
258_130878_000063_000001	train-clean-360	My mind was reeling as never before 
258_130878_000063_000002	train-clean-360	Never had ideas of such impact raced through my brain 
none	none	I didn t want to see what my eyes saw 
258_130878_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile the grave digging went slowly 
none	none	Fish fled here and there as their retreat was disturbed 
258_130878_000064_000002	train-clean-360	I heard the pick ringing on the limestone soil its iron tip sometimes giving off sparks when it hit a stray piece of flint on the sea bottom 
258_130878_000064_000003	train-clean-360	The hole grew longer wider and soon was deep enough to receive the body 
258_130878_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Then the pallbearers approached 
none	none	Wrapped in white fabric made from filaments of the fan mussel the body was lowered into its watery grave Captain Nemo arms crossed over his chest knelt in a posture of prayer as did all the friends of him who had loved them My two companions and I bowed reverently 
258_130878_000066_000000	train-clean-360	The grave was then covered over with the rubble dug from the seafloor and it formed a low mound 
258_130878_000067_000000	train-clean-360	When this was done Captain Nemo and his men stood up then they all approached the grave sank again on bended knee and extended their hands in a sign of final farewell 
258_130878_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Then the funeral party went back up the path to the Nautilus returning beneath the arches of the forest through the thickets along the coral bushes going steadily higher 
258_130878_000069_000000	train-clean-360	Finally the ship s rays appeared 
258_130878_000069_000001	train-clean-360	Their luminous trail guided us to the Nautilus 
258_130878_000069_000002	train-clean-360	By one o clock we had returned 
258_130878_000070_000000	train-clean-360	After changing clothes I climbed onto the platform and in the grip of dreadfully obsessive thoughts I sat next to the beacon 
258_130878_000071_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Nemo rejoined me 
none	none	I stood up and said to him
258_130878_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 So as I predicted that man died during the night 
258_130878_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Professor Aronnax Captain Nemo replied 
258_130878_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 And now he rests beside his companions in that coral cemetery 
258_130878_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes forgotten by the world but not by us 
258_130878_000075_000001	train-clean-360	We dig the graves then entrust the polyps with sealing away our dead for eternity 
none	none	And with a sudden gesture the captain hid his face in his clenched fists vainly trying to hold back a sob Then he added
258_130878_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 There lies our peaceful cemetery hundreds of feet beneath the surface of the waves 
258_130878_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 At least captain your dead can sleep serenely there out of the reach of sharks 
258_130878_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes sir Captain Nemo replied solemnly of sharks and men

seven SECOND PART CHAPTER one The Indian Ocean NOW WE BEGIN the second part of this voyage under the seas The first ended in that moving scene at the coral cemetery which left a profound impression on my mind And so Captain Nemo would live out his life entirely in the heart of this immense sea and even his grave lay ready in its impenetrable depths There the last sleep of the Nautilus s occupants friends bound together in death as in life would be disturbed by no monster of the deep No man either the captain had added Always that same fierce implacable defiance of human society As for me I was no longer content with the hypotheses that satisfied Conseil That fine lad persisted in seeing the Nautilus s commander as merely one of those unappreciated scientists who repay humanity s indifference with contempt For Conseil the captain was still a misunderstood genius who tired of the world s deceptions had been driven to take refuge in this inaccessible environment where he was free to follow his instincts But to my mind this hypothesis explained only one side of Captain Nemo In fact the mystery of that last afternoon when we were locked in prison and put to sleep the captain s violent precaution of snatching from my grasp a spyglass poised to scour the horizon and the fatal wound given that man during some unexplained collision suffered by the Nautilus all led me down a plain trail No Captain Nemo wasn t content simply to avoid humanity His fearsome submersible served not only his quest for freedom but also perhaps it was used in lord knows what schemes of dreadful revenge Right now nothing is clear to me I still glimpse only glimmers in the dark and I must limit my pen as it were to taking dictation from events But nothing binds us to Captain Nemo He believes that escaping from the Nautilus is impossible We are not even constrained by our word of honor No promises fetter us We re simply captives prisoners masquerading under the name guests for the sake of everyday courtesy Even so Ned Land hasn t given up all hope of recovering his freedom He s sure to take advantage of the first chance that comes his way No doubt I will do likewise And yet I will feel some regret at making off with the Nautilus s secrets so generously unveiled for us by Captain Nemo Because ultimately should we detest or admire this man Is he the persecutor or the persecuted And in all honesty before I leave him forever I want to finish this underwater tour of the world whose first stages have been so magnificent I want to observe the full series of these wonders gathered under the seas of our globe I want to see what no man has seen yet even if I must pay for this insatiable curiosity with my life What are my discoveries to date Nothing relatively speaking since so far we ve covered only six thousand leagues across the Pacific Nevertheless I m well aware that the Nautilus is drawing near to populated shores and if some chance for salvation becomes available to us it would be sheer cruelty to sacrifice my companions to my passion for the unknown I must go with them perhaps even guide them But will this opportunity ever arise The human being robbed of his free will craves such an opportunity but the scientist forever inquisitive dreads it That day January twenty one eighteen sixty eight the chief officer went at noon to take the sun s altitude I climbed onto the platform lit a cigar and watched him at work It seemed obvious to me that this man didn t understand French because I made several remarks in a loud voice that were bound to provoke him to some involuntary show of interest had he understood them but he remained mute and emotionless While he took his sights with his sextant one of the Nautilus s sailors that muscular man who had gone with us to Crespo Island during our first underwater excursion came up to clean the glass panes of the beacon I then examined the fittings of this mechanism whose power was increased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed like those in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused This electric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum illuminating power In essence its light was generated in a vacuum insuring both its steadiness and intensity Such a vacuum also reduced wear on the graphite points between which the luminous arc expanded This was an important savings for Captain Nemo who couldn t easily renew them But under these conditions wear and tear were almost nonexistent When the Nautilus was ready to resume its underwater travels I went below again to the lounge The hatches closed once more and our course was set due west We then plowed the waves of the Indian Ocean vast liquid plains with an area of five hundred fifty million hectares whose waters are so transparent it makes you dizzy to lean over their surface There the Nautilus generally drifted at a depth between one hundred and two hundred meters It behaved in this way for some days To anyone without my grand passion for the sea these hours would surely have seemed long and monotonous but my daily strolls on the platform where I was revived by the life giving ocean air the sights in the rich waters beyond the lounge windows the books to be read in the library and the composition of my memoirs took up all my time and left me without a moment of weariness or boredom All in all we enjoyed a highly satisfactory state of health The diet on board agreed with us perfectly and for my part I could easily have gone without those changes of pace that Ned Land in a spirit of protest kept taxing his ingenuity to supply us What s more in this constant temperature we didn t even have to worry about catching colds Besides the ship had a good stock of the madrepore Dendrophylia known in Provence by the name sea fennel and a poultice made from the dissolved flesh of its polyps will furnish an excellent cough medicine For some days we saw a large number of aquatic birds with webbed feet known as gulls or sea mews Some were skillfully slain and when cooked in a certain fashion they make a very acceptable platter of water game Among the great wind riders carried over long distances from every shore and resting on the waves from their exhausting flights I spotted some magnificent albatross birds belonging to the Longipennes long winged family whose discordant calls sound like the braying of an ass The Totipalmes fully webbed family was represented by swift frigate birds nimbly catching fish at the surface and by numerous tropic birds of the genus Phaeton among others the red tailed tropic bird the size of a pigeon its white plumage shaded with pink tints that contrasted with its dark hued wings The Nautilus s nets hauled up several types of sea turtle from the hawksbill genus with arching backs whose scales are highly prized Diving easily these reptiles can remain a good while underwater by closing the fleshy valves located at the external openings of their nasal passages When they were captured some hawksbills were still asleep inside their carapaces a refuge from other marine animals The flesh of these turtles was nothing memorable but their eggs made an excellent feast As for fish they always filled us with wonderment when staring through the open panels we could unveil the secrets of their aquatic lives I noted several species I hadn t previously been able to observe I ll mention chiefly some trunkfish unique to the Red Sea the sea of the East Indies and that part of the ocean washing the coasts of equinoctial America Like turtles armadillos sea urchins and crustaceans these fish are protected by armor plate that s neither chalky nor stony but actual bone Sometimes this armor takes the shape of a solid triangle sometimes that of a solid quadrangle Among the triangular type I noticed some half a decimeter long with brown tails yellow fins and wholesome exquisitely tasty flesh I even recommend that they be acclimatized to fresh water a change incidentally that a number of saltwater fish can make with ease I ll also mention some quadrangular trunkfish topped by four large protuberances along the back trunkfish sprinkled with white spots on the underside of the body which make good house pets like certain birds boxfish armed with stings formed by extensions of their bony crusts and whose odd grunting has earned them the nickname sea pigs then some trunkfish known as dromedaries with tough leathery flesh and big conical humps From the daily notes kept by mister Conseil I also retrieve certain fish from the genus Tetradon unique to these seas southern puffers with red backs and white chests distinguished by three lengthwise rows of filaments and jugfish seven inches long decked out in the brightest colors Then as specimens of other genera blowfish resembling a dark brown egg furrowed with white bands and lacking tails globefish genuine porcupines of the sea armed with stings and able to inflate themselves until they look like a pin cushion bristling with needles seahorses common to every ocean flying dragonfish with long snouts and highly distended pectoral fins shaped like wings which enable them if not to fly at least to spring into the air spatula shaped paddlefish whose tails are covered with many scaly rings snipefish with long jaws excellent animals twenty five centimeters long and gleaming with the most cheerful colors bluish gray dragonets with wrinkled heads myriads of leaping blennies with black stripes and long pectoral fins gliding over the surface of the water with prodigious speed delicious sailfish that can hoist their fins in a favorable current like so many unfurled sails splendid nurseryfish on which nature has lavished yellow azure silver and gold yellow mackerel with wings made of filaments bullheads forever spattered with mud which make distinct hissing sounds sea robins whose livers are thought to be poisonous ladyfish that can flutter their eyelids finally archerfish with long tubular snouts real oceangoing flycatchers armed with a rifle unforeseen by either Remington or Chassepot it slays insects by shooting them with a simple drop of water From the eighty ninth fish genus in Lacepede s system of classification belonging to his second subclass of bony fish characterized by gill covers and a bronchial membrane I noted some scorpionfish whose heads are adorned with stings and which have only one dorsal fin these animals are covered with small scales or have none at all depending on the subgenus to which they belong The second subgenus gave us some Didactylus specimens three to four decimeters long streaked with yellow their heads having a phantasmagoric appearance As for the first subgenus it furnished several specimens of that bizarre fish aptly nicknamed toadfish whose big head is sometimes gouged with deep cavities sometimes swollen with protuberances bristling with stings and strewn with nodules it sports hideously irregular horns its body and tail are adorned with callosities its stings can inflict dangerous injuries it s repulsive and horrible From January twenty one to the twenty third the Nautilus traveled at the rate of two hundred fifty leagues in twenty four hours hence five hundred forty miles at twenty two miles per hour If during our trip we were able to identify these different varieties of fish it s because they were attracted by our electric light and tried to follow alongside but most of them were outdistanced by our speed and soon fell behind temporarily however a few managed to keep pace in the Nautilus s waters On the morning of the twenty fourth in latitude twelve degrees five south and longitude ninety four degrees thirty three we raised Keeling Island a madreporic upheaving planted with magnificent coconut trees which had been visited by mister Darwin and Captain Fitzroy The Nautilus cruised along a short distance off the shore of this desert island Our dragnets brought up many specimens of polyps and echinoderms plus some unusual shells from the branch Mollusca Captain Nemo s treasures were enhanced by some valuable exhibits from the delphinula snail species to which I joined some pointed star coral a sort of parasitic polypary that often attaches itself to seashells Soon Keeling Island disappeared below the horizon and our course was set to the northwest toward the tip of the Indian peninsula Civilization Ned Land told me that day Much better than those Papuan Islands where we ran into more savages than venison On this Indian shore professor there are roads and railways English French and Hindu villages We wouldn t go five miles without bumping into a fellow countryman Come on now isn t it time for our sudden departure from Captain Nemo No no Ned I replied in a very firm tone Let s ride it out as you seafaring fellows say The Nautilus is approaching populated areas It s going back toward Europe let it take us there After we arrive in home waters we can do as we see fit Besides I don t imagine Captain Nemo will let us go hunting on the coasts of Malabar or Coromandel as he did in the forests of New Guinea Well sir can t we manage without his permission I didn t answer the Canadian I wanted no arguments Deep down I was determined to fully exploit the good fortune that had put me on board the Nautilus After leaving Keeling Island our pace got generally slower It also got more unpredictable often taking us to great depths Several times we used our slanting fins which internal levers could set at an oblique angle to our waterline Thus we went as deep as two or three kilometers down but without ever verifying the lowest depths of this sea near India which soundings of thirteen thousand meters have been unable to reach As for the temperature in these lower strata the thermometer always and invariably indicated four degrees centigrade I merely observed that in the upper layers the water was always colder over shallows than in the open sea On January twenty five the ocean being completely deserted the Nautilus spent the day on the surface churning the waves with its powerful propeller and making them spurt to great heights Under these conditions who wouldn t have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean I spent three quarters of the day on the platform I stared at the sea Nothing on the horizon except near four o clock in the afternoon a long steamer to the west running on our opposite tack Its masting was visible for an instant but it couldn t have seen the Nautilus because we were lying too low in the water I imagine that steamboat belonged to the Peninsular Oriental line which provides service from the island of Ceylon to Sidney also calling at King George Sound and Melbourne At five o clock in the afternoon just before that brief twilight that links day with night in tropical zones Conseil and I marveled at an unusual sight It was a delightful animal whose discovery according to the ancients is a sign of good luck Aristotle Athenaeus Pliny and Oppian studied its habits and lavished on its behalf all the scientific poetry of Greece and Italy They called it nautilus and pompilius But modern science has not endorsed these designations and this mollusk is now known by the name argonaut Anyone consulting Conseil would soon learn from the gallant lad that the branch Mollusca is divided into five classes that the first class features the Cephalopoda whose members are sometimes naked sometimes covered with a shell which consists of two families the Dibranchiata and the Tetrabranchiata which are distinguished by their number of gills that the family Dibranchiata includes three genera the argonaut the squid and the cuttlefish and that the family Tetrabranchiata contains only one genus the nautilus After this catalog if some recalcitrant listener confuses the argonaut which is acetabuliferous in other words a bearer of suction tubes with the nautilus which is tentaculiferous a bearer of tentacles it will be simply unforgivable Now it was a school of argonauts then voyaging on the surface of the ocean We could count several hundred of them They belonged to that species of argonaut covered with protuberances and exclusive to the seas near India These graceful mollusks were swimming backward by means of their locomotive tubes sucking water into these tubes and then expelling it Six of their eight tentacles were long thin and floated on the water while the other two were rounded into palms and spread to the wind like light sails I could see perfectly their undulating spiral shaped shells which Cuvier aptly compared to an elegant cockleboat It s an actual boat indeed It transports the animal that secretes it without the animal sticking to it The argonaut is free to leave its shell I told Conseil but it never does Not unlike Captain Nemo Conseil replied sagely Which is why he should have christened his ship the Argonaut For about an hour the Nautilus cruised in the midst of this school of mollusks Then lord knows why they were gripped with a sudden fear As if at a signal every sail was abruptly lowered arms folded bodies contracted shells turned over by changing their center of gravity and the whole flotilla disappeared under the waves It was instantaneous and no squadron of ships ever maneuvered with greater togetherness Just then night fell suddenly and the waves barely surged in the breeze spreading placidly around the Nautilus s side plates The next day January twenty six 
405_130895_000045_000000	train-clean-100	we cut the equator 
none	none	on the eighty second meridian and we reentered the northern hemisphere During that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort Dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous There were Port Jackson sharks with a brown back a whitish belly and eleven rows of teeth bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye and Isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles Often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting By this point Ned Land had lost all self control He wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters especially certain smooth hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic and some big five meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him But the Nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man eaters On January twenty seven at the entrance to the huge Bay of Bengal we repeatedly encountered a gruesome sight human corpses floating on the surface of the waves Carried by the Ganges to the high seas these were deceased Indian villagers who hadn t been fully devoured by vultures the only morticians in these parts But there was no shortage of sharks to assist them with their undertaking chores Near seven o clock in the evening the Nautilus lay half submerged navigating in the midst of milky white waves As far as the eye could see the ocean seemed lactified Was it an effect of the moon s rays No because the new moon was barely two days old and was still lost below the horizon in the sun s rays The entire sky although lit up by stellar radiation seemed pitch black in comparison with the whiteness of these waters Conseil couldn t believe his eyes and he questioned me about the causes of this odd phenomenon Luckily I was in a position to answer him That s called a milk sea I told him a vast expanse of white waves often seen along the coasts of Amboina and in these waterways But Conseil asked could master tell me the cause of this effect because I presume this water hasn t really changed into milk No my boy and this whiteness that amazes you is merely due to the presence of myriads of tiny creatures called infusoria a sort of diminutive glowworm that s colorless and gelatinous in appearance as thick as a strand of hair and no longer than one fifth of a millimeter Some of these tiny creatures stick together over an area of several leagues Several leagues Conseil exclaimed Yes my boy and don t even try to compute the number of these infusoria You won t pull it off because if I m not mistaken certain navigators have cruised through milk seas for more than forty miles I m not sure that Conseil heeded my recommendation because he seemed to be deep in thought no doubt trying to calculate how many one fifths of a millimeter are found in forty square miles As for me I continued to observe this phenomenon For several hours the Nautilus s spur sliced through these whitish waves and I watched it glide noiselessly over this soapy water as if it were cruising through those foaming eddies that a bay s currents and countercurrents sometimes leave between each other Near midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual hue but behind us all the way to the horizon the skies kept mirroring the whiteness of those waves and for a good while seemed imbued with the hazy glow of an aurora borealis CHAPTER two A New Proposition from Captain Nemo ON JANUARY twenty eight in latitude nine degrees four north when the Nautilus returned at noon to the surface of the sea it lay in sight of land some eight miles to the west 
229_130880_000002_000001	train-clean-100	Right off I observed a cluster of mountains about two thousand feet high whose shapes were very whimsically sculpted After our position fix I reentered the lounge and when our bearings were reported on the chart I saw that we were off the island of Ceylon that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the Indian peninsula 
229_130880_000003_000000	train-clean-100	I went looking in the library for a book about this island one of the most fertile in the world 
none	none	Sure enough I found a volume entitled Ceylon and the Singhalese by H C Sirr esquire 
229_130880_000003_000002	train-clean-100	Reentering the lounge I first noted the bearings of Ceylon on which antiquity lavished so many different names 
none	none	It was located between latitude five degrees fifty five and nine degrees forty nine north and between longitude seventy nine degrees forty two and eighty two degrees four east of the meridian of Greenwich its length is two hundred seventy five miles its maximum width one hundred fifty miles its circumference nine hundred miles its surface area twenty four thousand four hundred forty eight square miles in other words a little smaller than that of Ireland 
229_130880_000004_000000	train-clean-100	Just then Captain Nemo and his chief officer appeared 
none	none	The captain glanced at the chart Then turning to me The island of Ceylon he said is famous for its pearl fisheries Would you be interested Professor Aronnax in visiting one of those fisheries
229_130880_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 Certainly captain 
none	none	Fine 
229_130880_000008_000001	train-clean-100	It s easily done 
none	none	Only when we see the fisheries we ll see no fishermen The annual harvest hasn t yet begun No matter I ll give orders to make for the Gulf of Mannar and we ll arrive there late
836_130900_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 tonight 
229_130880_000009_000000	train-clean-100	The captain said a few words to his chief officer who went out immediately 
none	none	Soon the Nautilus reentered its liquid element and the pressure gauge indicated that it was staying at a depth of thirty feet 
229_130880_000010_000000	train-clean-100	With the chart under my eyes I looked for the Gulf of Mannar 
229_130880_000010_000001	train-clean-100	I found it by the ninth parallel off the northwestern shores of Ceylon 
none	none	It was formed by the long curve of little Mannar Island 
229_130880_000010_000003	train-clean-100	To reach it we had to go all the way up Ceylon s west coast 
none	none	Professor Captain Nemo then told me there are pearl fisheries in the Bay of Bengal the seas of the East Indies the seas of China and Japan plus those seas south of the United States the Gulf of Panama and the Gulf of California but it s off Ceylon that such fishing reaps its richest rewards 
229_130880_000011_000001	train-clean-100	No doubt we ll be arriving a little early 
none	none	Fishermen gather in the Gulf of Mannar only during the month of March and for thirty days some three hundred boats concentrate on the lucrative harvest of these treasures from the sea Each boat is manned by ten oarsmen and ten fishermen The latter divide into two groups dive in rotation and descend to a depth of twelve meters with the help of a heavy stone clutched between their feet and attached by a rope to their boat
229_130880_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 You mean I said that such primitive methods are still all that they use 
none	none	All Captain Nemo answered me although these fisheries belong to the most industrialized people in the world the English to whom the Treaty of Amiens granted them in eighteen oh two
229_130880_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Yet it strikes me that diving suits like yours could perform yeoman service in such work 
229_130880_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes since those poor fishermen can t stay long underwater On his voyage to Ceylon the Englishman Percival made much of a Kaffir who stayed under five minutes without coming up to the surface but I find that hard to believe 
none	none	I know that some divers can last up to fifty seven seconds and highly skillful ones to eighty seven but such men are rare and when the poor fellows climb back on board the water coming out of their noses and ears is tinted with blood I believe the average time underwater that these fishermen can tolerate is thirty seconds during which they hastily stuff their little nets with all the pearl oysters they can tear loose But these fishermen generally don t live to advanced age their vision weakens ulcers break out on their eyes sores form on their bodies and some are even stricken with apoplexy on the ocean floor
405_130894_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes I said 
229_130880_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes I said it s a sad occupation and one that exists only to gratify the whims of fashion 
229_130880_000016_000001	train-clean-100	But tell me captain how many oysters can a boat fish up in a workday 
none	none	About forty thousand to fifty thousand 
229_130880_000017_000001	train-clean-100	It s even said that in eighteen fourteen when the English government went fishing on its own behalf its divers worked just twenty days and brought up seventy six million oysters 
none	none	At least I asked the fishermen are well paid aren t they
229_130880_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 Hardly professor 
none	none	In Panama they make just one dollar per week In most places they earn only a penny for each oyster that has a pearl and they bring up so many that have none
229_130880_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 Only one penny to those poor people who make their employers rich That s atrocious 
229_130880_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 On that note professor Captain Nemo told me you and your companions will visit the Mannar oysterbank and if by chance some eager fisherman arrives early well we can watch him at work 
none	none	That suits me captain
229_130880_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 By the way Professor Aronnax you aren t afraid of sharks are you 
229_130880_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 Sharks I exclaimed 
none	none	This struck me as a pretty needless question to say the least
229_130880_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Well Captain Nemo went on 
229_130880_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 I admit captain I m not yet on very familiar terms with that genus of fish 
229_130880_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 We re used to them the rest of us Captain Nemo answered And in time you will be too 
none	none	Anyhow we ll be armed and on our way we might hunt a man eater or two It s a fascinating sport So professor I ll see you tomorrow bright and early This said in a carefree tone Captain Nemo left the lounge 
229_130880_000030_000000	train-clean-100	If you re invited to hunt bears in the Swiss mountains you might say Oh good I get to go bear hunting tomorrow If you re invited to hunt lions on the Atlas plains or tigers in the jungles of India you might say Ha 
229_130880_000030_000001	train-clean-100	Now s my chance to hunt lions and tigers But if you re invited to hunt sharks in their native element you might want to think it over before accepting 
none	none	As for me I passed a hand over my brow where beads of cold sweat were busy forming Let s think this over I said to myself and let s take our time Hunting otters in underwater forests as we did in the forests of Crespo Island is an acceptable activity But to roam the bottom of the sea when you re almost certain to meet man eaters in the neighborhood that s another story I know that in certain countries particularly the Andaman Islands Negroes don t hesitate to attack sharks dagger in one hand and noose in the other but I also know that many who face those fearsome animals don t come back alive Besides I m not a Negro and even if I were a Negro in this instance I don t think a little hesitation on my part would be out of place And there I was fantasizing about sharks envisioning huge jaws armed with multiple rows of teeth and capable of cutting a man in half I could already feel a definite pain around my pelvic girdle And how I resented the offhand manner in which the captain had extended his deplorable invitation You would have thought it was an issue of going into the woods on some harmless fox hunt Thank heavens I said to myself Conseil will never want to come along and that ll be my excuse for not going with the captain 
229_130880_000035_000000	train-clean-100	As for Ned Land I admit I felt less confident of his wisdom Danger however great held a perennial attraction for his aggressive nature 
229_130880_000036_000000	train-clean-100	I went back to reading Sirr s book but I leafed through it mechanically Between the lines I kept seeing fearsome wide open jaws 
none	none	Just then Conseil and the Canadian entered with a calm even gleeful air Little did they know what was waiting for them Ye gods sir Ned Land told me
229_130880_000038_000001	train-clean-100	 Your Captain Nemo the devil take him has just made us a very pleasant proposition 
229_130880_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh I said You know about 
none	none	With all due respect to master Conseil replied the Nautilus s commander has invited us together with master for a visit tomorrow to Ceylon s magnificent pearl fisheries 
229_130880_000040_000001	train-clean-100	He did so in the most cordial terms and conducted himself like a true gentleman 
229_130880_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 He didn t tell you anything else 
229_130880_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Nothing sir the Canadian replied 
229_130880_000042_000001	train-clean-100	 He said you d already discussed this little stroll 
229_130880_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Indeed I said 
none	none	But didn t he give you any details on
229_130880_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 Not a one mister Naturalist 
229_130880_000044_000001	train-clean-100	You will be going with us right 
none	none	Me 
229_130880_000045_000001	train-clean-100	Why yes certainly of course 
229_130880_000045_000002	train-clean-100	I can see that you like the idea mister Land 
none	none	Yes It will be a really unusual experience And possibly dangerous I added in an insinuating tone
229_130880_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 Dangerous Ned Land replied 
229_130880_000048_000001	train-clean-100	 A simple trip to an oysterbank 
229_130880_000049_000000	train-clean-100	Assuredly Captain Nemo hadn t seen fit to plant the idea of sharks in the minds of my companions 
229_130880_000049_000001	train-clean-100	For my part I stared at them with anxious eyes as if they were already missing a limb or two Should I alert them 
229_130880_000049_000002	train-clean-100	Yes surely but I hardly knew how to go about it 
none	none	Would master Conseil said to me give us some background on pearl fishing
229_130880_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 On the fishing itself I asked 
229_130880_000051_000001	train-clean-100	 Or on the occupational hazards that 
229_130880_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 On the fishing the Canadian replied 
229_130880_000052_000001	train-clean-100	 Before we tackle the terrain it helps to be familiar with it 
229_130880_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 All right sit down my friends and I ll teach you everything I myself have just been taught by the Englishman H C Sirr 
229_130880_000054_000000	train-clean-100	Ned and Conseil took seats on a couch and right off the Canadian said to me 
229_130880_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Sir just what is a pearl exactly 
none	none	My gallant Ned I replied for poets a pearl is a tear from the sea for Orientals it s a drop of solidified dew for the ladies it s a jewel they can wear on their fingers necks and ears that s oblong in shape glassy in luster and formed from mother of pearl for chemists it s a mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate with a little gelatin protein and finally for naturalists it s a simple festering secretion from the organ that produces mother of pearl in certain bivalves Branch Mollusca Conseil said class Acephala order Testacea Correct my scholarly Conseil Now then those Testacea capable of producing pearls include rainbow abalone turbo snails giant clams and saltwater scallops briefly all those that secrete mother of pearl in other words that blue azure violet or white substance lining the insides of their valves
229_130880_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 Are mussels included too the Canadian asked 
none	none	Yes 
229_130880_000060_000001	train-clean-100	The mussels of certain streams in Scotland Wales Ireland Saxony Bohemia and France 
229_130880_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 Good the Canadian replied 
none	none	From now on we ll pay closer attention to em
229_130880_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 But I went on for secreting pearls the ideal mollusk is the pearl oyster Meleagrina margaritifera that valuable shellfish 
229_130880_000062_000001	train-clean-100	Pearls result simply from mother of pearl solidifying into a globular shape Either they stick to the oyster s shell or they become embedded in the creature s folds 
229_130880_000062_000002	train-clean-100	On the valves a pearl sticks fast on the flesh it lies loose 
229_130880_000062_000003	train-clean-100	But its nucleus is always some small hard object say a sterile egg or a grain of sand around which the mother of pearl is deposited in thin concentric layers over several years in succession 
none	none	Can one find several pearls in the same oyster Conseil asked Yes my boy There are some shellfish that turn into real jewel coffers They even mention one oyster about which I remain dubious that supposedly contained at least one hundred fifty sharks one hundred fifty sharks Ned Land yelped
229_130880_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 Did I say sharks I exclaimed hastily 
none	none	I meant one hundred fifty pearls Sharks wouldn t make sense Indeed Conseil said But will master now tell us how one goes about extracting these pearls One proceeds in several ways and often when pearls stick to the valves fishermen even pull them loose with pliers But usually the shellfish are spread out on mats made from the esparto grass that covers the beaches 
229_130880_000068_000001	train-clean-100	Thus they die in the open air and by the end of ten days they ve rotted sufficiently 
229_130880_000068_000002	train-clean-100	Next they re immersed in huge tanks of salt water then they re opened up and washed At this point the sorters begin their twofold task 
none	none	First they remove the layers of mother of pearl which are known in the industry by the names legitimate silver bastard white or bastard black and these are shipped out in cases weighing one hundred twenty five to one hundred fifty kilograms Then they remove the oyster s meaty tissue boil it and finally strain it in order to extract even the smallest pearls
229_130880_000069_000000	train-clean-100	 Do the prices of these pearls differ depending on their size Conseil asked 
none	none	Not only on their size I replied but also according to their shape their water in other words their color and their orient in other words that dappled shimmering glow that makes them so delightful to the eye 
229_130880_000070_000001	train-clean-100	The finest pearls are called virgin pearls or paragons they form in isolation within the mollusk s tissue They re white often opaque but sometimes of opalescent transparency and usually spherical or pear shaped 
229_130880_000070_000002	train-clean-100	The spherical ones are made into bracelets the pear shaped ones into earrings and since they re the most valuable they re priced individually The other pearls that stick to the oyster s shell are more erratically shaped and are priced by weight 
229_130880_000070_000003	train-clean-100	Finally classed in the lowest order the smallest pearls are known by the name seed pearls they re priced by the measuring cup and are used mainly in the creation of embroidery for church vestments 
none	none	But it must be a long hard job sorting out these pearls by size the Canadian said No my friend 
229_130880_000072_000001	train-clean-100	That task is performed with eleven strainers or sieves that are pierced with different numbers of holes Those pearls staying in the strainers with twenty to eighty holes are in the first order 
none	none	Those not slipping through the sieves pierced with one hundred to eight hundred holes are in the second order Finally those pearls for which one uses strainers pierced with nine hundred to one thousand holes make up the seed pearls How ingenious Conseil said to reduce dividing and classifying pearls to a mechanical operation 
229_130880_000073_000001	train-clean-100	And could master tell us the profits brought in by harvesting these banks of pearl oysters 
229_130880_000074_000000	train-clean-100	 According to Sirr s book I replied these Ceylon fisheries are farmed annually for a total profit of three million man eaters 
229_130880_000075_000000	train-clean-100	 Francs Conseil rebuked 
229_130880_000076_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes francs 
229_130880_000076_000001	train-clean-100	three million francs I went on 
229_130880_000076_000002	train-clean-100	 But I don t think these fisheries bring in the returns they once did Similarly the Central American fisheries used to make an annual profit of four million francs during the reign of King Charles V but now they bring in only two thirds of that amount 
none	none	All in all it s estimated that nine million francs is the current yearly return for the whole pearl harvesting industry But Conseil asked haven t certain famous pearls been quoted at extremely high prices Yes my boy They say Julius Caesar gave Servilia a pearl worth one hundred twenty thousand francs in our currency I ve even heard stories the Canadian said about some lady in ancient times who drank pearls in vinegar
229_130880_000080_000000	train-clean-100	 Cleopatra Conseil shot back 
229_130880_000081_000000	train-clean-100	 It must have tasted pretty bad Ned Land added 
none	none	Abominable Ned my friend Conseil replied
229_130880_000082_000001	train-clean-100	 But when a little glass of vinegar is worth one million five hundred thousand francs its taste is a small price to pay 
none	none	I m sorry I didn t marry the gal the Canadian said throwing up his hands with an air of discouragement Ned Land married to Cleopatra Conseil exclaimed But I was all set to tie the knot Conseil the Canadian replied in all seriousness and it wasn t my fault the whole business fell through I even bought a pearl necklace for my fiancee Kate Tender but she married somebody else instead Well that necklace cost me only one dollar fifty cents but you can absolutely trust me on this professor its pearls were so big they wouldn t have gone through that strainer with twenty holes
229_130880_000086_000000	train-clean-100	 My gallant Ned I replied laughing those were artificial pearls ordinary glass beads whose insides were coated with Essence of Orient 
none	none	Wow the Canadian replied
229_130880_000087_000001	train-clean-100	 That Essence of Orient must sell for quite a large sum 
229_130880_000088_000000	train-clean-100	 As little as zero 
229_130880_000088_000001	train-clean-100	It comes from the scales of a European carp it s nothing more than a silver substance that collects in the water and is preserved in ammonia 
229_130880_000088_000002	train-clean-100	It s worthless 
229_130880_000089_000000	train-clean-100	 Maybe that s why Kate Tender married somebody else replied mister Land philosophically 
229_130880_000090_000000	train-clean-100	 But I said getting back to pearls of great value I don t think any sovereign ever possessed one superior to the pearl owned by Captain Nemo 
none	none	This one Conseil said pointing to a magnificent jewel in its glass case Exactly And I m certainly not far off when I estimate its value at two million uh Francs Conseil said quickly
229_130880_000094_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes I said two million francs and no doubt all it cost our captain was the effort to pick it up 
229_130880_000095_000000	train-clean-100	 Ha Ned Land exclaimed 
none	none	During our stroll tomorrow who says we won t run into one just like it Bah Conseil put in And why not
229_130880_000098_000000	train-clean-100	 What good would a pearl worth millions do us here on the Nautilus 
229_130880_000099_000000	train-clean-100	 Here no Ned Land said 
none	none	But elsewhere
229_130880_000100_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh Elsewhere Conseil put in shaking his head 
229_130880_000101_000000	train-clean-100	 In fact I said mister 
229_130880_000101_000001	train-clean-100	Land is right 
229_130880_000101_000002	train-clean-100	And if we ever brought back to Europe or America a pearl worth millions it would make the story of our adventures more authentic and much more rewarding 
229_130880_000102_000000	train-clean-100	 That s how I see it the Canadian said 
none	none	But said Conseil who perpetually returned to the didactic side of things is this pearl fishing ever dangerous
229_130880_000104_000000	train-clean-100	 No I replied quickly especially if one takes certain precautions 
229_130880_000105_000000	train-clean-100	 What risks would you run in a job like that Ned Land said Swallowing a few gulps of salt water 
229_130880_000106_000000	train-clean-100	 Whatever you say Ned Then trying to imitate Captain Nemo s carefree tone I asked By the way gallant Ned are you afraid of sharks 
229_130880_000107_000000	train-clean-100	 Me the Canadian replied 
229_130880_000107_000001	train-clean-100	 I m a professional harpooner It s my job to make a mockery of them 
none	none	It isn t an issue I said of fishing for them with a swivel hook hoisting them onto the deck of a ship chopping off the tail with a sweep of the ax opening the belly ripping out the heart and tossing it into the sea
229_130880_000109_000000	train-clean-100	 So it s an issue of 
none	none	Yes precisely In the water In the water Ye gods just give me a good harpoon 
229_130880_000113_000001	train-clean-100	You see sir these sharks are badly designed 
229_130880_000113_000002	train-clean-100	They have to roll their bellies over to snap you up and in the meantime 
none	none	Ned Land had a way of pronouncing the word snap that sent chills down the spine Well how about you Conseil 
229_130880_000115_000001	train-clean-100	What are your feelings about these man eaters 
none	none	Me Conseil said
229_130880_000116_000001	train-clean-100	 I m afraid I must be frank with master 
none	none	Good for you I thought If master faces these sharks Conseil said I think his loyal manservant should face them with him CHAPTER three A Pearl Worth Ten Million NIGHT FELL I went to bed 
6235_36641_000008_000002	train-clean-360	I slept pretty poorly 
none	none	Man eaters played a major role in my dreams And I found it more or less appropriate that the French word for shark requin has its linguistic roots in the word requiem 
6235_36641_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The next day at four o clock in the morning I was awakened by the steward whom Captain Nemo had placed expressly at my service I got up quickly dressed and went into the lounge 
6235_36641_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Nemo was waiting for me 
6235_36641_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Professor Aronnax he said to me are you ready to start 
none	none	I m ready
6235_36641_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Kindly follow me 
6235_36641_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 What about my companions captain 
6235_36641_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 They ve been alerted and are waiting for us 
6235_36641_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Aren t we going to put on our diving suits I asked 
none	none	Not yet I haven t let the Nautilus pull too near the coast and we re fairly well out from the Mannar oysterbank But I have the skiff ready and it will take us to the exact spot where we ll disembark which will save us a pretty long trek It s carrying our diving equipment and we ll suit up just before we begin our underwater exploring 
6235_36641_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Nemo took me to the central companionway whose steps led to the platform 
none	none	Ned and Conseil were there enraptured with the pleasure trip getting under way 
6235_36641_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Oars in position five of the Nautilus s sailors were waiting for us aboard the skiff which was moored alongside 
none	none	The night was still dark Layers of clouds cloaked the sky and left only a few stars in view My eyes flew to the side where land lay but I saw only a blurred line covering three quarters of the horizon from southwest to northwest Going up Ceylon s west coast during the night the Nautilus lay west of the bay or rather that gulf formed by the mainland and Mannar Island Under these dark waters there stretched the bank of shellfish an inexhaustible field of pearls more than twenty miles long 
6235_36641_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Nemo Conseil Ned Land and I found seats in the stern of the skiff 
none	none	The longboat s coxswain took the tiller his four companions leaned into their oars the moorings were cast off and we pulled clear 
6235_36641_000020_000000	train-clean-360	The skiff headed southward 
6235_36641_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The oarsmen took their time I watched their strokes vigorously catch the water and they always waited ten seconds before rowing again following the practice used in most navies 
none	none	While the longboat coasted drops of liquid flicked from the oars and hit the dark troughs of the waves pitter pattering like splashes of molten lead Coming from well out a mild swell made the skiff roll gently and a few cresting billows lapped at its bow 
6235_36641_000021_000000	train-clean-360	We were silent 
6235_36641_000021_000001	train-clean-360	What was Captain Nemo thinking 
none	none	Perhaps that this approaching shore was too close for comfort contrary to the Canadian s views in which it still seemed too far away As for Conseil he had come along out of simple curiosity Near five thirty the first glimmers of light on the horizon defined the upper lines of the coast with greater distinctness Fairly flat to the east it swelled a little toward the south Five miles still separated it from us and its beach merged with the misty waters 
6235_36641_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Between us and the shore the sea was deserted Not a boat not a diver 
6235_36641_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Profound solitude reigned over this gathering place of pearl fishermen 
none	none	As Captain Nemo had commented we were arriving in these waterways a month too soon 
6235_36641_000023_000000	train-clean-360	At six o clock the day broke suddenly with that speed unique to tropical regions which experience no real dawn or dusk The sun s rays pierced the cloud curtain gathered on the easterly horizon and the radiant orb rose swiftly 
none	none	I could clearly see the shore which featured a few sparse trees here and there 
6235_36641_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The skiff advanced toward Mannar Island which curved to the south Captain Nemo stood up from his thwart and studied the sea 
none	none	At his signal the anchor was lowered but its chain barely ran because the bottom lay no more than a meter down and this locality was one of the shallowest spots near the bank of shellfish Instantly the skiff wheeled around under the ebb tide s outbound thrust Here we are Professor Aronnax Captain Nemo then said You observe this confined bay 
6235_36641_000027_000001	train-clean-360	A month from now in this very place the numerous fishing boats of the harvesters will gather and these are the waters their divers will ransack so daringly This bay is felicitously laid out for their type of fishing It s sheltered from the strongest winds and the sea is never very turbulent here highly favorable conditions for diving work Now let s put on our underwater suits and we ll begin our stroll 
none	none	I didn t reply and while staring at these suspicious waves I began to put on my heavy aquatic clothes helped by the longboat s sailors Captain Nemo and my two companions suited up as well None of the Nautilus s men were to go with us on this new excursion Soon we were imprisoned up to the neck in india rubber clothing and straps fastened the air devices onto our backs As for the Ruhmkorff device it didn t seem to be in the picture Before inserting my head into its copper capsule I commented on this to the captain
6235_36641_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Our lighting equipment would be useless to us the captain answered me We won t be going very deep and the sun s rays will be sufficient to light our way 
6235_36641_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Besides it s unwise to carry electric lanterns under these waves 
6235_36641_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Their brightness might unexpectedly attract certain dangerous occupants of these waterways 
6235_36641_000031_000000	train-clean-360	As Captain Nemo pronounced these words I turned to Conseil and Ned Land 
6235_36641_000031_000001	train-clean-360	But my two friends had already encased their craniums in their metal headgear and they could neither hear nor reply 
none	none	I had one question left to address to Captain Nemo
6235_36641_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 What about our weapons I asked him 
6235_36641_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 Our rifles 
none	none	Rifles 
6235_36641_000034_000001	train-clean-360	What for 
none	none	Don t your mountaineers attack bears dagger in hand And isn t steel surer than lead 
6235_36641_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Here s a sturdy blade Slip it under your belt and let s be off 
6235_36641_000035_000000	train-clean-360	I stared at my companions 
none	none	They were armed in the same fashion and Ned Land was also brandishing an enormous harpoon he had stowed in the skiff before leaving the Nautilus 
6235_36641_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Then following the captain s example I let myself be crowned with my heavy copper sphere and our air tanks immediately went into action 
none	none	An instant later the longboat s sailors helped us overboard one after the other and we set foot on level sand in a meter and a half of water Captain Nemo gave us a hand signal 
6235_36641_000048_000001	train-clean-360	We followed him 
6235_36641_000037_000001	train-clean-360	We followed him down a gentle slope and disappeared under the waves 
6235_36641_000038_000000	train-clean-360	There the obsessive fears in my brain left me 
6235_36641_000038_000001	train-clean-360	I became surprisingly calm again 
6235_36641_000038_000002	train-clean-360	The ease with which I could move increased my confidence and the many strange sights captivated my imagination 
6235_36641_000039_000000	train-clean-360	The sun was already sending sufficient light under these waves The tiniest objects remained visible 
6235_36641_000039_000001	train-clean-360	After ten minutes of walking we were in five meters of water and the terrain had become almost flat 
none	none	Like a covey of snipe over a marsh there rose underfoot schools of unusual fish from the genus Monopterus whose members have no fin but their tail I recognized the Javanese eel a genuine eight decimeter serpent with a bluish gray belly which without the gold lines over its flanks could easily be confused with the conger eel From the butterfish genus whose oval bodies are very flat I observed several adorned in brilliant colors and sporting a dorsal fin like a sickle edible fish that when dried and marinated make an excellent dish known by the name karawade then some sea poachers fish belonging to the genus Aspidophoroides whose bodies are covered with scaly armor divided into eight lengthwise sections Meanwhile as the sun got progressively higher it lit up the watery mass more and more The seafloor changed little by little Its fine grained sand was followed by a genuine causeway of smooth crags covered by a carpet of mollusks and zoophytes Among other specimens in these two branches I noted some windowpane oysters with thin valves of unequal size a type of ostracod unique to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean then orange hued lucina with circular shells awl shaped auger shells some of those Persian murex snails that supply the Nautilus with such wonderful dye spiky periwinkles fifteen centimeters long that rose under the waves like hands ready to grab you turban snails with shells made of horn and bristling all over with spines lamp shells edible duck clams that feed the Hindu marketplace subtly luminous jellyfish of the species Pelagia panopyra and finally some wonderful Oculina flabelliforma magnificent sea fans that fashion one of the most luxuriant tree forms in this ocean In the midst of this moving vegetation under arbors of water plants there raced legions of clumsy articulates in particular some fanged frog crabs whose carapaces form a slightly rounded triangle robber crabs exclusive to these waterways and horrible parthenope crabs whose appearance was repulsive to the eye One animal no less hideous which I encountered several times was the enormous crab that mister Darwin observed to which nature has given the instinct and requisite strength to eat coconuts it scrambles up trees on the beach and sends the coconuts tumbling they fracture in their fall and are opened by its powerful pincers Here under these clear waves this crab raced around with matchless agility while green turtles from the species frequenting the Malabar coast moved sluggishly among the crumbling rocks 
6235_36641_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Near seven o clock we finally surveyed the bank of shellfish where pearl oysters reproduce by the millions 
none	none	These valuable mollusks stick to rocks where they re strongly attached by a mass of brown filaments that forbids their moving about In this respect oysters are inferior even to mussels to whom nature has not denied all talent for locomotion The shellfish Meleagrina that womb for pearls whose valves are nearly equal in size has the shape of a round shell with thick walls and a very rough exterior Some of these shells were furrowed with flaky greenish bands that radiated down from the top These were the young oysters 
6235_36641_000044_000002	train-clean-360	The others had rugged black surfaces measured up to fifteen centimeters in width and were ten or more years old 
none	none	Captain Nemo pointed to this prodigious heap of shellfish and I saw that these mines were genuinely inexhaustible since nature s creative powers are greater than man s destructive instincts True to those instincts Ned Land greedily stuffed the finest of these mollusks into a net he carried at his side 
6235_36641_000046_000000	train-clean-360	But we couldn t stop 
none	none	We had to follow the captain who headed down trails seemingly known only to himself The seafloor rose noticeably and when I lifted my arms sometimes they would pass above the surface of the sea Then the level of the oysterbank would lower unpredictably Often we went around tall pointed rocks rising like pyramids In their dark crevices huge crustaceans aiming their long legs like heavy artillery watched us with unblinking eyes while underfoot there crept millipedes bloodworms aricia worms and annelid worms whose antennas and tubular tentacles were incredibly long 
6235_36641_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Just then a huge cave opened up in our path hollowed from a picturesque pile of rocks whose smooth heights were completely hung with underwater flora 
6235_36641_000047_000001	train-clean-360	At first this cave looked pitch black to me 
none	none	Inside the sun s rays seemed to diminish by degrees Their hazy transparency was nothing more than drowned light Captain Nemo went in We followed him My eyes soon grew accustomed to this comparative gloom 
6235_36641_000048_000003	train-clean-360	I distinguished the unpredictably contoured springings of a vault supported by natural pillars firmly based on a granite foundation like the weighty columns of Tuscan architecture Why had our incomprehensible guide taken us into the depths of this underwater crypt 
6235_36641_000048_000004	train-clean-360	I would soon find out 
6235_36641_000049_000000	train-clean-360	After going down a fairly steep slope our feet trod the floor of a sort of circular pit 
none	none	There Captain Nemo stopped and his hand indicated an object that I hadn t yet noticed It was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions a titanic giant clam a holy water font that could have held a whole lake a basin more than two meters wide hence even bigger than the one adorning the Nautilus s lounge 
6235_36641_000051_000000	train-clean-360	I approached this phenomenal mollusk 
6235_36641_000051_000001	train-clean-360	Its mass of filaments attached it to a table of granite and there it grew by itself in the midst of the cave s calm waters 
6235_36641_000051_000002	train-clean-360	I estimated the weight of this giant clam at three hundred kilograms 
none	none	Hence such an oyster held fifteen kilos of meat and you d need the stomach of King Gargantua to eat a couple dozen Captain Nemo was obviously familiar with this bivalve s existence This wasn t the first time he d paid it a visit and I thought his sole reason for leading us to this locality was to show us a natural curiosity I was mistaken 
6235_36641_000052_000002	train-clean-360	Captain Nemo had an explicit personal interest in checking on the current condition of this giant clam 
6235_36641_000053_000000	train-clean-360	The mollusk s two valves were partly open 
none	none	The captain approached and stuck his dagger vertically between the shells to discourage any ideas about closing then with his hands he raised the fringed membrane filled tunic that made up the animal s mantle There between its leaflike folds I saw a loose pearl as big as a coconut Its globular shape perfect clarity and wonderful orient made it a jewel of incalculable value Carried away by curiosity I stretched out my hand to take it weigh it fondle it But the captain stopped me signaled no removed his dagger in one swift motion and let the two valves snap shut 
6235_36641_000055_000000	train-clean-360	I then understood Captain Nemo s intent 
none	none	By leaving the pearl buried beneath the giant clam s mantle he allowed it to grow imperceptibly With each passing year the mollusk s secretions added new concentric layers The captain alone was familiar with the cave where this wonderful fruit of nature was ripening he alone reared it so to speak in order to transfer it one day to his dearly beloved museum 
6235_36641_000055_000003	train-clean-360	Perhaps following the examples of oyster farmers in China and India he had even predetermined the creation of this pearl by sticking under the mollusk s folds some piece of glass or metal that was gradually covered with mother of pearl In any case comparing this pearl to others I already knew about and to those shimmering in the captain s collection I estimated that it was worth at least ten million francs 
none	none	It was a superb natural curiosity rather than a luxurious piece of jewelry because I don t know of any female ear that could handle it 
6235_36641_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Our visit to this opulent giant clam came to an end Captain Nemo left the cave and we climbed back up the bank of shellfish in the midst of these clear waters not yet disturbed by divers at work 
6235_36641_000057_000000	train-clean-360	We walked by ourselves genuine loiterers stopping or straying as our fancies dictated 
6235_36641_000057_000001	train-clean-360	For my part I was no longer worried about those dangers my imagination had so ridiculously exaggerated The shallows drew noticeably closer to the surface of the sea and soon walking in only a meter of water my head passed well above the level of the ocean 
6235_36641_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Conseil rejoined me and gluing his huge copper capsule to mine his eyes gave me a friendly greeting But this lofty plateau measured only a few fathoms and soon we reentered Our Element 
6235_36641_000057_000003	train-clean-360	I think I ve now earned the right to dub it that 
6235_36641_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Ten minutes later Captain Nemo stopped suddenly 
none	none	I thought he d called a halt so that we could turn and start back No With a gesture he ordered us to crouch beside him at the foot of a wide crevice His hand motioned toward a spot within the liquid mass and I looked carefully 
6235_36641_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Five meters away a shadow appeared and dropped to the seafloor The alarming idea of sharks crossed my mind 
none	none	But I was mistaken and once again we didn t have to deal with monsters of the deep 
6235_36641_000060_000000	train-clean-360	It was a man a living man a black Indian fisherman a poor devil who no doubt had come to gather what he could before harvest time I saw the bottom of his dinghy moored a few feet above his head He would dive and go back up in quick succession 
none	none	A stone cut in the shape of a sugar loaf which he gripped between his feet while a rope connected it to his boat served to lower him more quickly to the ocean floor This was the extent of his equipment Arriving on the seafloor at a depth of about five meters he fell to his knees and stuffed his sack with shellfish gathered at random Then he went back up emptied his sack pulled up his stone and started all over again the whole process lasting only thirty seconds 
6235_36641_000061_000000	train-clean-360	This diver didn t see us 
6235_36641_000061_000001	train-clean-360	A shadow cast by our crag hid us from his view 
none	none	And besides how could this poor Indian ever have guessed that human beings creatures like himself were near him under the waters eavesdropping on his movements not missing a single detail of his fishing 
6235_36641_000062_000000	train-clean-360	So he went up and down several times 
6235_36641_000062_000001	train-clean-360	He gathered only about ten shellfish per dive because he had to tear them from the banks where each clung with its tough mass of filaments And how many of these oysters for which he risked his life would have no pearl in them 
6235_36641_000063_000000	train-clean-360	I observed him with great care 
none	none	His movements were systematically executed and for half an hour no danger seemed to threaten him So I had gotten used to the sight of this fascinating fishing when all at once just as the Indian was kneeling on the seafloor I saw him make a frightened gesture stand and gather himself to spring back to the surface of the waves 
6235_36641_000064_000000	train-clean-360	I understood his fear 
6235_36641_000064_000001	train-clean-360	A gigantic shadow appeared above the poor diver It was a shark of huge size moving in diagonally eyes ablaze jaws wide open 
6235_36641_000065_000000	train-clean-360	I was speechless with horror unable to make a single movement 
none	none	With one vigorous stroke of its fins the voracious animal shot toward the Indian who jumped aside and avoided the shark s bite but not the thrashing of its tail because that tail struck him across the chest and stretched him out on the seafloor 
6235_36641_000067_000000	train-clean-360	This scene lasted barely a few seconds 
none	none	The shark returned rolled over on its back and was getting ready to cut the Indian in half when Captain Nemo who was stationed beside me suddenly stood up Then he strode right toward the monster dagger in hand ready to fight it at close quarters Just as it was about to snap up the poor fisherman the man eater saw its new adversary repositioned itself on its belly and headed swiftly toward him 
6235_36641_000069_000000	train-clean-360	I can see Captain Nemo s bearing to this day 
none	none	Bracing himself he waited for the fearsome man eater with wonderful composure and when the latter rushed at him the captain leaped aside with prodigious quickness avoided a collision and sank his dagger into its belly But that wasn t the end of the story A dreadful battle was joined 
6235_36641_000070_000000	train-clean-360	The shark bellowed so to speak 
6235_36641_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Blood was pouring into the waves from its wounds 
none	none	The sea was dyed red and through this opaque liquid I could see nothing else Nothing else until the moment when through a rift in the clouds I saw the daring captain clinging to one of the animal s fins fighting the monster at close quarters belaboring his enemy s belly with stabs of the dagger yet unable to deliver the deciding thrust in other words a direct hit to the heart In its struggles the man eater churned the watery mass so furiously its eddies threatened to knock me over 
6235_36641_000072_000000	train-clean-360	I wanted to run to the captain s rescue 
6235_36641_000072_000001	train-clean-360	But I was transfixed with horror unable to move 
6235_36641_000073_000000	train-clean-360	I stared wild eyed 
none	none	I saw the fight enter a new phase The captain fell to the seafloor toppled by the enormous mass weighing him down 
6235_36641_000073_000002	train-clean-360	Then the shark s jaws opened astoundingly wide like a pair of industrial shears and that would have been the finish of Captain Nemo had not Ned Land quick as thought rushed forward with his harpoon and driven its dreadful point into the shark s underside 
6235_36641_000074_000000	train-clean-360	The waves were saturated with masses of blood 
none	none	The waters shook with the movements of the man eater which thrashed about with indescribable fury 
6235_36641_000074_000002	train-clean-360	Ned Land hadn t missed his target This was the monster s death rattle 
6235_36641_000074_000003	train-clean-360	Pierced to the heart it was struggling with dreadful spasms whose aftershocks knocked Conseil off his feet 
6235_36641_000075_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile Ned Land pulled the captain clear 
none	none	Uninjured the latter stood up went right to the Indian quickly cut the rope binding the man to his stone took the fellow in his arms and with a vigorous kick of the heel rose to the surface of the sea 
6235_36641_000076_000000	train-clean-360	The three of us followed him and a few moments later miraculously safe we reached the fisherman s longboat 
6235_36641_000077_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Nemo s first concern was to revive this unfortunate man I wasn t sure he would succeed 
6235_36641_000077_000001	train-clean-360	I hoped so since the poor devil hadn t been under very long 
6235_36641_000077_000002	train-clean-360	But that stroke from the shark s tail could have been his deathblow 
none	none	Fortunately after vigorous massaging by Conseil and the captain I saw the nearly drowned man regain consciousness little by little He opened his eyes 
6235_36641_000078_000001	train-clean-360	How startled he must have felt how frightened even at seeing four huge copper craniums leaning over him 
none	none	And above all what must he have thought when Captain Nemo pulled a bag of pearls from a pocket in his diving suit and placed it in the fisherman s hands This magnificent benefaction from the Man of the Waters to the poor Indian from Ceylon was accepted by the latter with trembling hands 
6235_36641_000079_000002	train-clean-360	His bewildered eyes indicated that he didn t know to what superhuman creatures he owed both his life and his fortune 
none	none	At the captain s signal we returned to the bank of shellfish and retracing our steps we walked for half an hour until we encountered the anchor connecting the seafloor with the Nautilus s skiff 
6235_36641_000081_000000	train-clean-360	Back on board the sailors helped divest us of our heavy copper carapaces 
6235_36641_000082_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Nemo s first words were spoken to the Canadian 
6235_36641_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you mister Land he told him 
6235_36641_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 Tit for tat captain Ned Land replied 
6235_36641_000084_000001	train-clean-360	 I owed it to you 
6235_36641_000085_000000	train-clean-360	The ghost of a smile glided across the captain s lips and that was all 
6235_36641_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 To the Nautilus he said 
6235_36641_000087_000000	train-clean-360	The longboat flew over the waves 
6235_36641_000087_000001	train-clean-360	A few minutes later we encountered the shark s corpse again floating 
none	none	From the black markings on the tips of its fins I recognized the dreadful Squalus melanopterus from the seas of the East Indies a variety in the species of sharks proper 
6235_36641_000088_000001	train-clean-360	It was more than twenty five feet long its enormous mouth occupied a third of its body It was an adult as could be seen from the six rows of teeth forming an isosceles triangle in its upper jaw 
none	none	Conseil looked at it with purely scientific fascination and I m sure he placed it not without good reason in the class of cartilaginous fish order Chondropterygia with fixed gills family Selacia genus Squalus While I was contemplating this inert mass suddenly a dozen of these voracious melanoptera appeared around our longboat but paying no attention to us they pounced on the corpse and quarreled over every scrap of it By eight thirty we were back on board the Nautilus 
6235_36641_000092_000000	train-clean-360	There I fell to thinking about the incidents that marked our excursion over the Mannar oysterbank 
none	none	Two impressions inevitably stood out One concerned Captain Nemo s matchless bravery the other his devotion to a human being a representative of that race from which he had fled beneath the seas 
6235_36641_000092_000002	train-clean-360	In spite of everything this strange man hadn t yet succeeded in completely stifling his heart 
6235_36641_000093_000000	train-clean-360	When I shared these impressions with him he answered me in a tone touched with emotion 
none	none	That Indian professor lives in the land of the oppressed and I am to this day and will be until my last breath a native of that same land CHAPTER four The Red Sea DURING THE DAY of January twenty nine the island of Ceylon disappeared below the horizon and at a speed of twenty miles per hour the Nautilus glided into the labyrinthine channels that separate the Maldive and Laccadive Islands It likewise hugged Kiltan Island a shore of madreporic origin discovered by Vasco da Gama in fourteen ninety nine and one of nineteen chief islands in the island group of the Laccadives located between latitude ten degrees and fourteen degrees thirty north and between longitude fifty degrees seventy two and sixty nine degrees east By then we had fared sixteen thousand two hundred twenty miles or seven thousand five hundred leagues from our starting point in the seas of Japan The next day January thirty when the Nautilus rose to the surface of the ocean there was no more land in sight Setting its course to the north northwest the ship headed toward the Gulf of Oman carved out between Arabia and the Indian peninsula and providing access to the Persian Gulf This was obviously a blind alley with no possible outlet So 
405_130894_000092_000000	train-clean-100	where was Captain Nemo 
none	none	taking us I was unable to say Which didn t satisfy the Canadian who that day asked me where we were going We re going mister Ned where the captain s fancy takes us His fancy the Canadian replied won t take us very far The Persian Gulf has no outlet and if we enter those waters it won t be long before we return in our tracks All right we ll return mister Land and after the Persian Gulf if the Nautilus wants to visit the Red Sea the Strait of Bab el Mandeb is still there to let us in I don t have to tell you sir Ned Land replied that the Red Sea is just as landlocked as the gulf since the Isthmus of Suez hasn t been cut all the way through yet and even if it was a boat as secretive as ours wouldn t risk a canal intersected with locks So the Red Sea won t be our way back to Europe either But I didn t say we d return to Europe What do you figure then I figure that after visiting these unusual waterways of Arabia and Egypt the Nautilus will go back down to the Indian Ocean perhaps through Mozambique Channel perhaps off the Mascarene Islands and then make for the Cape of Good Hope And once we re at the Cape of Good Hope the Canadian asked with typical persistence Well then we ll enter that Atlantic Ocean with which we aren t yet familiar What s wrong Ned my friend Are you tired of this voyage under the seas Are you bored with the constantly changing sight of these underwater wonders Speaking for myself I ll be extremely distressed to see the end of a voyage so few men will ever have a chance to make But don t you realize Professor Aronnax the Canadian replied that soon we ll have been imprisoned for three whole months aboard this Nautilus No Ned I didn t realize it I don t want to realize it and I don t keep track of every day and every hour But when will it be over In its appointed time Meanwhile there s nothing we can do about it and our discussions are futile My gallant Ned if you come and tell me A chance to escape is available to us then I ll discuss it with you But that isn t the case and in all honesty I don t think Captain Nemo ever ventures into European seas This short dialogue reveals that in my mania for the Nautilus I was turning into the spitting image of its commander As for Ned Land he ended our talk in his best speechifying style That s all fine and dandy But in my humble opinion a life in jail is a life without joy For four days until February three the Nautilus inspected the Gulf of Oman at various speeds and depths It seemed to be traveling at random as if hesitating over which course to follow but it never crossed the Tropic of Cancer After leaving this gulf we raised Muscat for an instant the most important town in the country of Oman I marveled at its strange appearance in the midst of the black rocks surrounding it against which the white of its houses and forts stood out sharply I spotted the rounded domes of its mosques the elegant tips of its minarets and its fresh leafy terraces But it was only a fleeting vision and the Nautilus soon sank beneath the dark waves of these waterways Then our ship went along at a distance of six miles from the Arabic coasts of Mahra and Hadhramaut their undulating lines of mountains relieved by a few ancient ruins On February five we finally put into the Gulf of Aden a genuine funnel stuck into the neck of Bab el Mandeb and bottling these Indian waters in the Red Sea On February six the Nautilus cruised in sight of the city of Aden perched on a promontory connected to the continent by a narrow isthmus a sort of inaccessible Gibraltar whose fortifications the English rebuilt after capturing it in eighteen thirty nine I glimpsed the octagonal minarets of this town which used to be one of the wealthiest busiest commercial centers along this coast as the Arab historian Idrisi tells it I was convinced that when Captain Nemo reached this point he would back out again but I was mistaken and much to my surprise he did nothing of the sort The next day February seven we entered the Strait of Bab el Mandeb whose name means Gate of Tears in the Arabic language Twenty miles wide it s only fifty two kilometers long and with the Nautilus launched at full speed clearing it was the work of barely an hour But I didn t see a thing not even Perim Island where the British government built fortifications to strengthen Aden s position There were many English and French steamers plowing this narrow passageway liners going from Suez to Bombay Calcutta Melbourne Reunion Island and Mauritius far too much traffic for the Nautilus to make an appearance on the surface So it wisely stayed in midwater Finally at noon we were plowing the waves of the Red Sea The Red Sea that great lake so famous in biblical traditions seldom replenished by rains fed by no important rivers continually drained by a high rate of evaporation its water level dropping a meter and a half every year If it were fully landlocked like a lake this odd gulf might dry up completely on this score it s inferior to its neighbors the Caspian Sea and the Dead Sea whose levels lower only to the point where their evaporation exactly equals the amounts of water they take to their hearts This Red Sea is twenty six hundred kilometers long with an average width of two hundred forty In the days of the Ptolemies and the Roman emperors it was a great commercial artery for the world and when its isthmus has been cut through it will completely regain that bygone importance that the Suez railways have already brought back in part I would not even attempt to understand the whim that induced Captain Nemo to take us into this gulf But I wholeheartedly approved of the Nautilus s entering it It adopted a medium pace sometimes staying on the surface sometimes diving to avoid some ship and so I could observe both the inside and topside of this highly unusual sea On February eight as early as the first hours of daylight Mocha appeared before us a town now in ruins whose walls would collapse at the mere sound of a cannon and which shelters a few leafy date trees here and there This once important city used to contain six public marketplaces plus twenty six mosques and its walls protected by fourteen forts fashioned a three kilometer girdle around it Then the Nautilus drew near the beaches of Africa where the sea is considerably deeper There through the open panels and in a midwater of crystal clarity our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs of algae and fucus What an indescribable sight and what a variety of settings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic islands leveled off by the Libyan coast But soon the Nautilus hugged the eastern shore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory This was off the coast of Tihama and there such zoophyte displays not only flourished below sea level but they also fashioned picturesque networks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it the latter were more whimsical but less colorful than the former which kept their bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters How many delightful hours I spent in this way at the lounge window How many new specimens of underwater flora and fauna I marveled at beneath the light of our electric beacon Mushroom shaped fungus coral some slate colored sea anemone including the species Thalassianthus aster among others organ pipe coral arranged like flutes and just begging for a puff from the god Pan shells unique to this sea that dwell in madreporic cavities and whose bases are twisted into squat spirals and finally a thousand samples of a polypary I hadn t observed until then the common sponge First division in the polyp group the class Spongiaria has been created by scientists precisely for this unusual exhibit whose usefulness is beyond dispute The sponge is definitely not a plant as some naturalists still believe but an animal of the lowest order a polypary inferior even to coral Its animal nature isn t in doubt and we can t accept even the views of the ancients who regarded it as halfway between plant and animal But I must say that naturalists are not in agreement on the structural mode of sponges For some it s a polypary and for others such as Professor Milne Edwards it s a single solitary individual The class Spongiaria contains about three hundred species that are encountered in a large number of seas and even in certain streams where they ve been given the name freshwater sponges But their waters of choice are the Red Sea and the Mediterranean near the Greek Islands or the coast of Syria These waters witness the reproduction and growth of soft delicate bath sponges whose prices run as high as one hundred fifty francs apiece the yellow sponge from Syria the horn sponge from Barbary et cetera But since I had no hope of studying these zoophytes in the seaports of the Levant from which we were separated by the insuperable Isthmus of Suez I had to be content with observing them in the waters of the Red Sea So I called Conseil to my side while at an average depth of eight to nine meters the Nautilus slowly skimmed every beautiful rock on the easterly coast There sponges grew in every shape globular stalklike leaflike fingerlike With reasonable accuracy they lived up to their nicknames of basket sponges chalice sponges distaff sponges elkhorn sponges lion s paws peacock s tails and Neptune s gloves designations bestowed on them by fishermen more poetically inclined than scientists A gelatinous semifluid substance coated the fibrous tissue of these sponges and from this tissue there escaped a steady trickle of water that after carrying sustenance to each cell was being expelled by a contracting movement This jellylike substance disappears when the polyp dies emitting ammonia as it rots Finally nothing remains but the fibers either gelatinous or made of horn that constitute your household sponge which takes on a russet hue and is used for various tasks depending on its degree of elasticity permeability or resistance to saturation These polyparies were sticking to rocks shells of mollusks and even the stalks of water plants They adorned the smallest crevices some sprawling others standing or hanging like coral outgrowths I told Conseil that sponges are fished up in two ways either by dragnet or by hand The latter method calls for the services of a diver but it s preferable because it spares the polypary s tissue leaving it with a much higher market value Other zoophytes swarming near the sponges consisted chiefly of a very elegant species of jellyfish mollusks were represented by varieties of squid that according to Professor Orbigny are unique to the Red Sea and reptiles by virgata turtles belonging to the genus Chelonia which furnished our table with a dainty but wholesome dish As for fish they were numerous and often remarkable Here are the ones that the Nautilus s nets most frequently hauled on board rays including spotted rays that were oval in shape and brick red in color their bodies strewn with erratic blue speckles and identifiable by their jagged double stings silver backed skates common stingrays with stippled tails butterfly rays that looked like huge two meter cloaks flapping at middepth toothless guitarfish that were a type of cartilaginous fish closer to the shark trunkfish known as dromedaries that were one and a half feet long and had humps ending in backward curving stings serpentine moray eels with silver tails and bluish backs plus brown pectorals trimmed in gray piping a species of butterfish called the fiatola decked out in thin gold stripes and the three colors of the French flag Montague blennies four decimeters long superb jacks handsomely embellished by seven black crosswise streaks with blue and yellow fins plus gold and silver scales snooks standard mullet with yellow heads parrotfish wrasse triggerfish gobies et cetera plus a thousand other fish common to the oceans we had already crossed On February nine the Nautilus cruised in the widest part of the Red Sea measuring one hundred ninety miles straight across from Suakin on the west coast to Qunfidha on the east coast At noon that day after our position fix Captain Nemo climbed onto the platform where I happened to be I vowed not to let him go below again without at least sounding him out on his future plans As soon as he saw me he came over graciously offered me a cigar and said to me Well professor are you pleased with this Red Sea Have you seen enough of its hidden wonders its fish and zoophytes its gardens of sponges and forests of coral Have you glimpsed the towns built on its shores Yes Captain Nemo I replied and the Nautilus is wonderfully suited to this whole survey Ah it s a clever boat Yes sir clever daring and invulnerable It fears neither the Red Sea s dreadful storms nor its currents and reefs Indeed I said this sea is mentioned as one of the worst and in the days of the ancients if I m not mistaken it had an abominable reputation Thoroughly abominable Professor Aronnax The Greek and Latin historians can find nothing to say in its favor and the Greek geographer Strabo adds that it s especially rough during the rainy season and the period of summer prevailing winds The Arab Idrisi referring to it by the name Gulf of Colzoum relates that ships perished in large numbers on its sandbanks and that no one risked navigating it by night This he claims is a sea subject to fearful hurricanes strewn with inhospitable islands and with nothing good to offer either on its surface or in its depths As a matter of fact the same views can also be found in Arrian Agatharchides and Artemidorus One can easily see I answered that those historians didn t navigate aboard the Nautilus Indeed the captain replied with a smile and in this respect the moderns aren t much farther along than the ancients It took many centuries to discover the mechanical power of steam Who knows whether we ll see a second Nautilus within the next one hundred years Progress is slow Professor Aronnax It s true I replied Your ship is a century ahead of its time perhaps several centuries It would be most unfortunate if such a secret were to die with its inventor Captain Nemo did not reply After some minutes of silence We were discussing he said the views of ancient historians on the dangers of navigating this Red Sea True I replied But weren t their fears exaggerated Yes and no Professor Aronnax answered Captain Nemo who seemed to know his Red Sea by heart To a modern ship well rigged solidly constructed and in control of its course thanks to obedient steam some conditions are no longer hazardous that offered all sorts of dangers to the vessels of the ancients Picture those early navigators venturing forth in sailboats built from planks lashed together with palm tree ropes caulked with powdered resin and coated with dogfish grease They didn t even have instruments for taking their bearings they went by guesswork in the midst of currents they barely knew Under such conditions shipwrecks had to be numerous But nowadays steamers providing service between Suez and the South Seas have nothing to fear from the fury of this gulf despite the contrary winds of its monsoons Their captains and passengers no longer prepare for departure with sacrifices to placate the gods and after returning they don t traipse in wreaths and gold ribbons to say thanks at the local temple Agreed I said And steam seems to have killed off all gratitude in seamen s hearts But since you seem to have made a special study of this sea captain can you tell me how it got its name Many explanations exist on the subject Professor Aronnax Would you like to hear the views of one chronicler in the fourteenth century Gladly This fanciful fellow claims the sea was given its name after the crossing of the Israelites when the Pharaoh perished in those waves that came together again at Moses command To mark that miraculous sequel the sea turned a red without equal Thus no other course would do but to name it for its hue An artistic explanation Captain Nemo I replied but I m unable to rest content with it So I ll ask you for your own personal views Here they come To my thinking Professor Aronnax this Red Sea designation must be regarded as a translation of the Hebrew word Edrom and if the ancients gave it that name it was because of the unique color of its waters Until now however I ve seen only clear waves without any unique hue Surely but as we move ahead to the far end of this gulf you ll note its odd appearance I recall seeing the bay of El Tur completely red like a lake of blood And you attribute this color to the presence of microscopic algae Yes It s a purplish mucilaginous substance produced by those tiny buds known by the name trichodesmia forty thousand of which are needed to occupy the space of one square millimeter Perhaps you ll encounter them when we reach El Tur Hence Captain Nemo this isn t the first time you ve gone through the Red Sea aboard the Nautilus No sir Then since you ve already mentioned the crossing of the Israelites and the catastrophe that befell the Egyptians I would ask if you ve ever discovered any traces under the waters of that great historic event No professor and for an excellent reason What s that It s because that same locality where Moses crossed with all his people is now so clogged with sand camels can barely get their legs wet You can understand that my Nautilus wouldn t have enough water for itself And that locality is I asked That locality lies a little above Suez in a sound that used to form a deep estuary when the Red Sea stretched as far as the Bitter Lakes Now whether or not their crossing was literally miraculous the Israelites did cross there in returning to the Promised Land and the Pharaoh s army did perish at precisely that locality So I think that excavating those sands would bring to light a great many weapons and tools of Egyptian origin Obviously I replied And for the sake of archaeology let s hope that sooner or later such excavations do take place once new towns are settled on the isthmus after the Suez Canal has been cut through a canal by the way of little use to a ship such as the Nautilus Surely but of great use to the world at large Captain Nemo said The ancients well understood the usefulness to commerce of connecting the Red Sea with the Mediterranean but they never dreamed of cutting a canal between the two and instead they picked the Nile as their link If we can trust tradition it was probably Egypt s King Sesostris who started digging the canal needed to join the Nile with the Red Sea What s certain is that in six hundred fifteen B C King Necho II was hard at work on a canal that was fed by Nile water and ran through the Egyptian plains opposite Arabia This canal could be traveled in four days and it was so wide two triple tiered galleys could pass through it abreast Its construction was continued by Darius the Great son of Hystaspes and probably completed by King Ptolemy II Strabo saw it used for shipping but the weakness of its slope between its starting point near Bubastis and the Red Sea left it navigable only a few months out of the year This canal served commerce until the century of Rome s Antonine emperors it was then abandoned and covered with sand subsequently reinstated by Arabia s Caliph Omar I and finally filled in for good in seven hundred sixty one or seven hundred sixty two A D by Caliph Al Mansur in an effort to prevent supplies from reaching Mohammed ibn Abdullah who had rebelled against him During his Egyptian campaign your General Napoleon Bonaparte discovered traces of this old canal in the Suez desert and when the tide caught him by surprise he wellnigh perished just a few hours before rejoining his regiment at Hadjaroth the very place where Moses had pitched camp three thousand three hundred years before him Well captain what the ancients hesitated to undertake mister de Lesseps is now finishing up his joining of these two seas will shorten the route from Cadiz to the East Indies by nine thousand kilometers and he ll soon change Africa into an immense island Yes Professor Aronnax and you have every right to be proud of your fellow countryman Such a man brings a nation more honor than the greatest commanders Like so many others he began with difficulties and setbacks but he triumphed because he has the volunteer spirit And it s sad to think that this deed which should have been an international deed which would have insured that any administration went down in history will succeed only through the efforts of one man So all hail to mister de Lesseps Yes all hail to that great French citizen I replied quite startled by how emphatically Captain Nemo had just spoken Unfortunately he went on I can t take you through that Suez Canal but the day after tomorrow you ll be able to see the long jetties of Port Said when we re in the Mediterranean In the Mediterranean I exclaimed Yes professor Does that amaze you What amazes me is thinking we ll be there the day after tomorrow Oh really Yes captain although since I ve been aboard your vessel I should have formed the habit of not being amazed by anything But what is it that startles you The thought of how hideously fast the Nautilus will need to go if it s to double the Cape of Good Hope circle around Africa and lie in the open Mediterranean by the day after tomorrow And who says it will circle Africa professor What s this talk about doubling the Cape of Good Hope But unless the Nautilus navigates on dry land and crosses over the isthmus Or under it Professor Aronnax Under it Surely Captain Nemo replied serenely Under that tongue of land nature long ago made what man today is making on its surface What There s a passageway Yes an underground passageway that I ve named the Arabian Tunnel It starts below Suez and leads to the Bay of Pelusium But isn t that isthmus only composed of quicksand To a certain depth But at merely fifty meters one encounters a firm foundation of rock And it s by luck that you discovered this passageway I asked more and more startled Luck plus logic professor and logic even more than luck Captain I hear you but I can t believe my ears Oh sir The old saying still holds good Aures habent et non audient Not only does this passageway exist but I ve taken advantage of it on several occasions Without it I wouldn t have ventured today into such a blind alley as the Red Sea Latin They have ears but hear not Ed Is it indiscreet to ask how you discovered this tunnel Sir the captain answered me there can be no secrets between men who will never leave each other I ignored this innuendo and waited for Captain Nemo s explanation Professor he told me the simple logic of the naturalist led me to discover this passageway and I alone am familiar with it I d noted that in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean there exist a number of absolutely identical species of fish eels butterfish greenfish bass jewelfish flying fish Certain of this fact I wondered if there weren t a connection between the two seas If there were its underground current had to go from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean simply because of their difference in level So I caught a large number of fish in the vicinity of Suez I slipped copper rings around their tails and tossed them back into the sea A few months later off the coast of Syria I recaptured a few specimens of my fish adorned with their telltale rings So this proved to me that some connection existed between the two seas I searched for it with my Nautilus I discovered it I ventured into it and soon professor you also will have cleared my Arabic tunnel CHAPTER five Arabian Tunnel THE SAME DAY I reported to Conseil and Ned Land that part of the foregoing conversation directly concerning them When I told them we would be lying in Mediterranean waters within two days Conseil clapped his hands but the Canadian shrugged his shoulders An underwater tunnel he exclaimed A connection between two seas Who ever heard of such malarkey Ned my friend Conseil replied had you ever heard of the Nautilus No yet here it is So don t shrug your shoulders so blithely and don t discount something with the feeble excuse that you ve never heard of it We ll soon see Ned Land shot back shaking his head After all I d like nothing better than to believe in your captain s little passageway and may Heaven grant it really does take us to the Mediterranean The same evening at latitude twenty one degrees thirty north the Nautilus was afloat on the surface of the sea and drawing nearer to the Arab coast I spotted Jidda an important financial center for Egypt Syria Turkey and the East Indies I could distinguish with reasonable clarity the overall effect of its buildings the ships made fast along its wharves and those bigger vessels whose draft of water required them to drop anchor at the port s offshore mooring The sun fairly low on the horizon struck full force on the houses in this town accenting their whiteness Outside the city limits some wood or reed huts indicated the quarter where the bedouins lived Soon Jidda faded into the shadows of evening and the Nautilus went back beneath the mildly phosphorescent waters The next day February ten several ships appeared running on our opposite tack The Nautilus resumed its underwater navigating but at the moment of our noon sights the sea was deserted and the ship rose again to its waterline With Ned and Conseil I went to sit on the platform The coast to the east looked like a slightly blurred mass in a damp fog Leaning against the sides of the skiff we were chatting of one thing and another when Ned Land stretched his hand toward a point in the water saying to me See anything out there professor No Ned I replied but you know I don t have your eyes Take a good look Ned went on There ahead to starboard almost level with the beacon Don t you see a mass that seems to be moving around Right I said after observing carefully I can make out something like a long blackish object on the surface of the water A second Nautilus Conseil said No the Canadian replied unless I m badly mistaken that s some marine animal Are there whales in the Red Sea Conseil asked Yes my boy I replied they re sometimes found here That s no whale continued Ned Land whose eyes never strayed from the object they had sighted We re old chums whales and I and I couldn t mistake their little ways Let s wait and see Conseil said The Nautilus is heading that direction and we ll soon know what we re in for In fact that blackish object was soon only a mile away from us It looked like a huge reef stranded in midocean What was it I still couldn t make up my mind Oh it s moving off It s diving Ned Land exclaimed Damnation What can that animal be It doesn t have a forked tail like baleen whales or sperm whales and its fins look like sawed off limbs But in that case I put in Good lord the Canadian went on it s rolled over on its back and it s raising its breasts in the air It s a siren Conseil exclaimed With all due respect to master it s an actual mermaid That word siren put me back on track and I realized that the animal belonged to the order Sirenia marine creatures that legends have turned into mermaids half woman half fish No I told Conseil that s no mermaid it s an unusual creature of which only a few specimens are left in the Red Sea That s a dugong Order Sirenia group Pisciforma subclass Monodelphia class Mammalia branch Vertebrata Conseil replied And when Conseil has spoken there s nothing else to be said Meanwhile Ned Land kept staring His eyes were gleaming with desire at the sight of that animal His hands were ready to hurl a harpoon You would have thought he was waiting for the right moment to jump overboard and attack the creature in its own element Oh sir he told me in a voice trembling with excitement I ve never killed anything like that His whole being was concentrated in this last word Just then Captain Nemo appeared on the platform He spotted the dugong He understood the Canadian s frame of mind and addressed him directly If you held a harpoon mister Land wouldn t your hands be itching to put it to work Positively sir And just for one day would it displease you to return to your fisherman s trade and add this cetacean to the list of those you ve already hunted down It wouldn t displease me one bit All right you can try your luck Thank you sir Ned Land replied his eyes ablaze Only the captain went on I urge you to aim carefully at this animal in your own personal interest Is the dugong dangerous to attack I asked despite the Canadian s shrug of the shoulders Yes sometimes the captain replied These animals have been known to turn on their assailants and capsize their longboats But with mister Land that danger isn t to be feared His eye is sharp his arm is sure If I recommend that he aim carefully at this dugong it s because the animal is justly regarded as fine game and I know mister Land doesn t despise a choice morsel Aha the Canadian put in This beast offers the added luxury of being good to eat Yes mister Land Its flesh is actual red meat highly prized and set aside throughout Malaysia for the tables of aristocrats Accordingly this excellent animal has been hunted so bloodthirstily that like its manatee relatives it has become more and more scarce In that case captain Conseil said in all seriousness on the offchance that this creature might be the last of its line wouldn t it be advisable to spare its life in the interests of science Maybe the Canadian answered it would be better to hunt it down in the interests of mealtime Then proceed mister Land Captain Nemo replied Just then as mute and emotionless as ever seven crewmen climbed onto the platform One carried a harpoon and line similar to those used in whale fishing Its deck paneling opened the skiff was wrenched from its socket and launched to sea Six rowers sat on the thwarts and the coxswain took the tiller Ned Conseil and I found seats in the stern Aren t you coming captain I asked No sir but I wish you happy hunting The skiff pulled clear and carried off by its six oars it headed swiftly toward the dugong which by then was floating two miles from the Nautilus Arriving within a few cable lengths of the cetacean our longboat slowed down and the sculls dipped noiselessly into the tranquil waters Harpoon in hand Ned Land went to take his stand in the skiff s bow Harpoons used for hunting whales are usually attached to a very long rope that pays out quickly when the wounded animal drags it with him But this rope measured no more than about ten fathoms and its end had simply been fastened to a small barrel that while floating would indicate the dugong s movements beneath the waters I stood up and could clearly observe the Canadian s adversary This dugong which also boasts the name halicore closely resembled a manatee Its oblong body ended in a very long caudal fin and its lateral fins in actual fingers It differs from the manatee in that its upper jaw is armed with two long pointed teeth that form diverging tusks on either side This dugong that Ned Land was preparing to attack was of colossal dimensions easily exceeding seven meters in length It didn t stir and seemed to be sleeping on the surface of the waves a circumstance that should have made it easier to capture The skiff approached cautiously to within three fathoms of the animal The oars hung suspended above their rowlocks I was crouching His body leaning slightly back Ned Land brandished his harpoon with expert hands Suddenly a hissing sound was audible and the dugong disappeared Although the harpoon had been forcefully hurled it apparently had hit only water Damnation exclaimed the furious Canadian I missed it No I said the animal s wounded there s its blood but your weapon didn t stick in its body My harpoon Get my harpoon Ned Land exclaimed The sailors went back to their sculling and the coxswain steered the longboat toward the floating barrel We fished up the harpoon and the skiff started off in pursuit of the animal The latter returned from time to time to breathe at the surface of the sea Its wound hadn t weakened it because it went with tremendous speed Driven by energetic arms the longboat flew on its trail Several times we got within a few fathoms of it and the Canadian hovered in readiness to strike but then the dugong would steal away with a sudden dive and it proved impossible to overtake the beast I ll let you assess the degree of anger consuming our impatient Ned Land He hurled at the hapless animal the most potent swearwords in the English language For my part I was simply distressed to see this dugong outwit our every scheme We chased it unflaggingly for a full hour and I d begun to think it would prove too difficult to capture when the animal got the untimely idea of taking revenge on us a notion it would soon have cause to regret It wheeled on the skiff to assault us in its turn This maneuver did not escape the Canadian Watch out he said The coxswain pronounced a few words in his bizarre language and no doubt he alerted his men to keep on their guard Arriving within twenty feet of the skiff the dugong stopped sharply sniffing the air with its huge nostrils pierced not at the tip of its muzzle but on its topside Then it gathered itself and sprang at us The skiff couldn t avoid the collision Half overturned it shipped a ton or two of water that we had to bail out But thanks to our skillful coxswain we were fouled on the bias rather than broadside so we didn t capsize Clinging to the stempost Ned Land thrust his harpoon again and again into the gigantic animal which imbedded its teeth in our gunwale and lifted the longboat out of the water as a lion would lift a deer We were thrown on top of each other and I have no idea how the venture would have ended had not the Canadian still thirsting for the beast s blood finally pierced it to the heart I heard its teeth grind on sheet iron and the dugong disappeared taking our harpoon along with it But the barrel soon popped up on the surface and a few moments later the animal s body appeared and rolled over on its back Our skiff rejoined it took it in tow and headed to the Nautilus It took pulleys of great strength to hoist this dugong onto the platform The beast weighed five thousand kilograms It was carved up in sight of the Canadian who remained to watch every detail of the operation At dinner the same day my steward served me some slices of this flesh skillfully dressed by the ship s cook I found it excellent even better than veal if not beef The next morning February eleven the Nautilus s pantry was enriched by more dainty game A covey of terns alighted on the Nautilus They were a species of Sterna nilotica unique to Egypt beak black head gray and stippled eyes surrounded by white dots back wings and tail grayish belly and throat white feet red Also caught were a couple dozen Nile duck superior tasting wildfowl whose neck and crown of the head are white speckled with black By then the Nautilus had reduced speed It moved ahead at a saunter so to speak I observed that the Red Sea s water was becoming less salty the closer we got to Suez Near five o clock in the afternoon we sighted Cape Ras Mohammed to the north This cape forms the tip of Arabia Petraea which lies between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba The Nautilus entered the Strait of Jubal which leads to the Gulf of Suez I could clearly make out a high mountain crowning Ras Mohammed between the two gulfs It was Mt Horeb that biblical Mt Sinai on whose summit Moses met God face to face that summit the mind s eye always pictures as wreathed in lightning At six o clock sometimes afloat and sometimes submerged the Nautilus passed well out from El Tur which sat at the far end of a bay whose waters seemed to be dyed red as Captain Nemo had already mentioned Then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence occasionally broken by the calls of pelicans and nocturnal birds by the sound of surf chafing against rocks or by the distant moan of a steamer churning the waves of the gulf with noisy blades From eight to nine o clock the Nautilus stayed a few meters beneath the waters According to my calculations we had to be quite close to Suez Through the panels in the lounge I spotted rocky bottoms brightly lit by our electric rays It seemed to me that the strait was getting narrower and narrower At nine fifteen when our boat returned to the surface I climbed onto the platform I was quite impatient to clear Captain Nemo s tunnel couldn t sit still and wanted to breathe the fresh night air Soon in the shadows I spotted a pale signal light glimmering a mile away half discolored by mist A floating lighthouse said someone next to me I turned and discovered the captain That s the floating signal light of Suez he went on It won t be long before we reach the entrance to the tunnel It can t be very easy to enter it No sir Accordingly I m in the habit of staying in the pilothouse and directing maneuvers myself And now if you ll kindly go below Professor Aronnax the Nautilus is about to sink beneath the waves and it will only return to the surface after we ve cleared the Arabian Tunnel I followed Captain Nemo The hatch closed the ballast tanks filled with water and the submersible sank some ten meters down Just as I was about to repair to my stateroom the captain stopped me Professor he said to me would you like to go with me to the wheelhouse I was afraid to ask I replied Come along then This way you ll learn the full story about this combination underwater and underground navigating Captain Nemo led me to the central companionway In midstair he opened a door went along the upper gangways and arrived at the wheelhouse which as you know stands at one end of the platform It was a cabin measuring six feet square and closely resembling those occupied by the helmsmen of steamboats on the Mississippi or Hudson rivers In the center stood an upright wheel geared to rudder cables running to the Nautilus s stern Set in the cabin s walls were four deadlights windows of biconvex glass that enabled the man at the helm to see in every direction The cabin was dark but my eyes soon grew accustomed to its darkness and I saw the pilot a muscular man whose hands rested on the pegs of the wheel Outside the sea was brightly lit by the beacon shining behind the cabin at the other end of the platform Now Captain Nemo said let s look for our passageway Electric wires linked the pilothouse with the engine room and from this cabin the captain could simultaneously signal heading and speed to his Nautilus He pressed a metal button and at once the propeller slowed down significantly I stared in silence at the high sheer wall we were skirting just then the firm base of the sandy mountains on the coast For an hour we went along it in this fashion staying only a few meters away Captain Nemo never took his eyes off the two concentric circles of the compass hanging in the cabin At a mere gesture from him the helmsman would instantly change the Nautilus s heading Standing by the port deadlight I spotted magnificent coral substructures zoophytes algae and crustaceans with enormous quivering claws that stretched forth from crevices in the rock At ten fifteen Captain Nemo himself took the helm Dark and deep a wide gallery opened ahead of us The Nautilus was brazenly swallowed up Strange rumblings were audible along our sides It was the water of the Red Sea hurled toward the Mediterranean by the tunnel s slope Our engines tried to offer resistance by churning the waves with propeller in reverse but the Nautilus went with the torrent as swift as an arrow Along the narrow walls of this passageway I saw only brilliant streaks hard lines fiery furrows all scrawled by our speeding electric light With my hand I tried to curb the pounding of my heart At ten thirty five Captain Nemo left the steering wheel and turned to me The Mediterranean he told me In less than twenty minutes swept along by the torrent the Nautilus had just cleared the Isthmus of Suez CHAPTER six The Greek Islands AT SUNRISE the next morning February twelve the Nautilus rose to the surface of the waves I rushed onto the platform The hazy silhouette of Pelusium was outlined three miles to the south A torrent had carried us from one sea to the other But although that tunnel was easy to descend going back up must have been impossible Near seven o clock Ned and Conseil joined me Those two inseparable companions had slept serenely utterly unaware of the Nautilus s feat Well mister Naturalist the Canadian asked in a gently mocking tone and how about that Mediterranean We re floating on its surface Ned my friend What Conseil put in Last night Yes last night in a matter of minutes we cleared that insuperable isthmus I don t believe a word of it the Canadian replied And you re in the wrong mister Land I went on That flat coastline curving southward is the coast of Egypt Tell it to the marines sir answered the stubborn Canadian But if master says so Conseil told him then so be it What s more Ned I said Captain Nemo himself did the honors in his tunnel and I stood beside him in the pilothouse while he steered the Nautilus through that narrow passageway You hear Ned Conseil said And you Ned who have such good eyes I added you can spot the jetties of Port Said stretching out to sea The Canadian looked carefully Correct he said You re right professor and your captain s a superman We re in the Mediterranean Fine So now let s have a chat about our little doings if you please but in such a way that nobody overhears I could easily see what the Canadian was driving at In any event I thought it best to let him have his chat and we all three went to sit next to the beacon where we were less exposed to the damp spray from the billows Now Ned we re all ears I said What have you to tell us What I ve got to tell you is very simple the Canadian replied We re in Europe and before Captain Nemo s whims take us deep into the polar seas or back to Oceania I say we should leave this Nautilus I confess that such discussions with the Canadian always baffled me I didn t want to restrict my companions freedom in any way and yet I had no desire to leave Captain Nemo Thanks to him and his submersible I was finishing my undersea research by the day and I was rewriting my book on the great ocean depths in the midst of its very element Would I ever again have such an opportunity to observe the ocean s wonders Absolutely not So I couldn t entertain this idea of leaving the Nautilus before completing our course of inquiry Ned my friend I said answer me honestly Are you bored with this ship Are you sorry that fate has cast you into Captain Nemo s hands The Canadian paused for a short while before replying Then crossing his arms Honestly he said I m not sorry about this voyage under the seas I ll be glad to have done it but in order to have done it it has to finish That s my feeling It will finish Ned Where and when Where I don t know When I can t say Or rather I suppose it will be over when these seas have nothing more to teach us Everything that begins in this world must inevitably come to an end I think as master does Conseil replied and it s extremely possible that after crossing every sea on the globe Captain Nemo will bid the three of us a fond farewell Bid us a fond farewell the Canadian exclaimed You mean beat us to a fare thee well Let s not exaggerate mister Land I went on We have nothing to fear from the captain but neither do I share Conseil s views We re privy to the Nautilus s secrets and I don t expect that its commander just to set us free will meekly stand by while we spread those secrets all over the world But in that case what do you expect the Canadian asked That we ll encounter advantageous conditions for escaping just as readily in six months as now Great Scott Ned Land put in And where if you please will we be in six months mister Naturalist Perhaps here perhaps in China You know how quickly the Nautilus moves It crosses oceans like swallows cross the air or express trains continents It doesn t fear heavily traveled seas Who can say it won t hug the coasts of France England or America where an escape attempt could be carried out just as effectively as here Professor Aronnax the Canadian replied your arguments are rotten to the core You talk way off in the future We ll be here we ll be there Me I m talking about right now we are here and we must take advantage of it I was hard pressed by Ned Land s common sense and I felt myself losing ground I no longer knew what arguments to put forward on my behalf Sir Ned went on let s suppose that by some impossibility Captain Nemo offered your freedom to you this very day Would you accept I don t know I replied And suppose he adds that this offer he s making you today won t ever be repeated then would you accept I did not reply And what thinks our friend Conseil Ned Land asked Your friend Conseil the fine lad replied serenely has nothing to say for himself He s a completely disinterested party on this question Like his master like his comrade Ned he s a bachelor Neither wife parents nor children are waiting for him back home He s in master s employ he thinks like master he speaks like master and much to his regret he can t be counted on to form a majority Only two persons face each other here master on one side Ned Land on the other That said your friend Conseil is listening and he s ready to keep score I couldn t help smiling as Conseil wiped himself out of existence Deep down the Canadian must have been overjoyed at not having to contend with him Then sir Ned Land said since Conseil is no more we ll have this discussion between just the two of us I ve talked you ve listened What s your reply It was obvious that the matter had to be settled and evasions were distasteful to me Ned my friend I said here s my reply You have right on your side and my arguments can t stand up to yours It will never do to count on Captain Nemo s benevolence The most ordinary good sense would forbid him to set us free On the other hand good sense decrees that we take advantage of our first opportunity to leave the Nautilus Fine Professor Aronnax that s wisely said But one proviso I said just one The opportunity must be the real thing Our first attempt to escape must succeed because if it misfires we won t get a second chance and Captain Nemo will never forgive us That s also well put the Canadian replied But your proviso applies to any escape attempt whether it happens in two years or two days So this is still the question if a promising opportunity comes up we have to grab it Agreed And now Ned will you tell me what you mean by a promising opportunity One that leads the Nautilus on a cloudy night within a short distance of some European coast And you ll try to get away by swimming Yes if we re close enough to shore and the ship s afloat on the surface No if we re well out and the ship s navigating under the waters And in that event In that event I ll try to get hold of the skiff I know how to handle it We ll stick ourselves inside undo the bolts and rise to the surface without the helmsman in the bow seeing a thing Fine Ned Stay on the lookout for such an opportunity but don t forget one slipup will finish us I won t forget sir And now Ned would you like to know my overall thinking on your plan Gladly Professor Aronnax Well then I think and I don t mean I hope that your promising opportunity won t ever arise Why not Because Captain Nemo recognizes that we haven t given up all hope of recovering our freedom and he ll keep on his guard above all in seas within sight of the coasts of Europe I m of master s opinion Conseil said We ll soon see Ned Land replied shaking his head with a determined expression And now Ned Land I added let s leave it at that Not another word on any of this The day you re ready alert us and we re with you I turn it all over to you That s how we ended this conversation which later was to have such serious consequences At first I must say events seemed to confirm my forecasts much to the Canadian s despair Did Captain Nemo view us with distrust in these heavily traveled seas or did he simply want to hide from the sight of those ships of every nation that plowed the Mediterranean I have no idea but usually he stayed in midwater and well out from any coast Either the Nautilus surfaced only enough to let its pilothouse emerge or it slipped away to the lower depths although between the Greek Islands and Asia Minor we didn t find bottom even at two thousand meters down Accordingly I became aware of the isle of Karpathos one of the Sporades Islands only when Captain Nemo placed his finger over a spot on the world map and quoted me this verse from Virgil Est in Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates Caeruleus Proteus Latin There in King Neptune s domain by Karpathos his spokesman is azure hued Proteus Ed It was indeed that bygone abode of Proteus the old shepherd of King Neptune s flocks an island located between Rhodes and Crete which Greeks now call Karpathos Italians Scarpanto Through the lounge window I could see only its granite bedrock The next day February fourteen I decided to spend a few hours studying the fish of this island group but for whatever reason the panels remained hermetically sealed After determining the Nautilus s heading I noted that it was proceeding toward the ancient island of Crete also called Candia At the time I had shipped aboard the Abraham Lincoln this whole island was in rebellion against its tyrannical rulers the Ottoman Empire of Turkey But since then I had absolutely no idea what happened to this revolution and Captain Nemo deprived of all contact with the shore was hardly the man to keep me informed So I didn t allude to this event when that evening I chanced to be alone with the captain in the lounge Besides he seemed silent and preoccupied Then contrary to custom he ordered that both panels in the lounge be opened and going from the one to the other he carefully observed the watery mass For what purpose I hadn t a guess and for my part I spent my time studying the fish that passed before my eyes Among others I noted that sand goby mentioned by Aristotle and commonly known by the name sea loach which is encountered exclusively in the salty waters next to the Nile Delta Near them some semiphosphorescent red porgy rolled by a variety of gilthead that the Egyptians ranked among their sacred animals lauding them in religious ceremonies when their arrival in the river s waters announced the fertile flood season I also noticed some wrasse known as the tapiro three decimeters long bony fish with transparent scales whose bluish gray color is mixed with red spots they re enthusiastic eaters of marine vegetables which gives them an exquisite flavor hence these tapiro were much in demand by the epicures of ancient Rome and their entrails were dressed with brains of peacock tongue of flamingo and testes of moray to make that divine platter that so enraptured the Roman emperor Vitellius Another resident of these seas caught my attention and revived all my memories of antiquity This was the remora which travels attached to the bellies of sharks as the ancients tell it when these little fish cling to the undersides of a ship they can bring it to a halt and by so impeding Mark Antony s vessel during the Battle of Actium one of them facilitated the victory of Augustus Caesar From such slender threads hang the destinies of nations I also observed some wonderful snappers belonging to the order Lutianida sacred fish for the Greeks who claimed they could drive off sea monsters from the waters they frequent their Greek name anthias means flower and they live up to it in the play of their colors and in those fleeting reflections that turn their dorsal fins into watered silk their hues are confined to a gamut of reds from the pallor of pink to the glow of ruby I couldn t take my eyes off these marine wonders when I was suddenly jolted by an unexpected apparition In the midst of the waters a man appeared a diver carrying a little leather bag at his belt It was no corpse lost in the waves It was a living man swimming vigorously sometimes disappearing to breathe at the surface then instantly diving again I turned to Captain Nemo and in an agitated voice A man A castaway I exclaimed We must rescue him at all cost The captain didn t reply but went to lean against the window The man drew near and gluing his face to the panel he stared at us To my deep astonishment Captain Nemo gave him a signal The diver answered with his hand immediately swam up to the surface of the sea and didn t reappear Don t be alarmed the captain told me That s Nicolas from Cape Matapan nicknamed Il Pesce He s well known throughout the Cyclades Islands A bold diver Water is his true element and he lives in the sea more than on shore going constantly from one island to another even to Crete Italian The Fish Ed You know him captain Why not Professor Aronnax This said Captain Nemo went to a cabinet standing near the lounge s left panel Next to this cabinet I saw a chest bound with hoops of iron its lid bearing a copper plaque that displayed the Nautilus s monogram with its motto Mobilis in Mobili Just then ignoring my presence the captain opened this cabinet a sort of safe that contained a large number of ingots They were gold ingots And they represented an enormous sum of money Where had this precious metal come from How had the captain amassed this gold and what was he about to do with it I didn t pronounce a word I gaped Captain Nemo took out the ingots one by one and arranged them methodically inside the chest filling it to the top At which point I estimate that it held more than one thousand kilograms of gold in other words close to five million francs After securely fastening the chest Captain Nemo wrote an address on its lid in characters that must have been modern Greek This done the captain pressed a button whose wiring was in communication with the crew s quarters Four men appeared and not without difficulty pushed the chest out of the lounge Then I heard them hoist it up the iron companionway by means of pulleys Just then Captain Nemo turned to me You were saying professor he asked me I wasn t saying a thing captain Then sir with your permission I ll bid you good evening And with that Captain Nemo left the lounge I reentered my stateroom very puzzled as you can imagine I tried in vain to fall asleep I kept searching for a relationship between the appearance of the diver and that chest filled with gold Soon from certain rolling and pitching movements I sensed that the Nautilus had left the lower strata and was back on the surface of the water Then I heard the sound of footsteps on the platform I realized that the skiff was being detached and launched to sea For an instant it bumped the Nautilus s side then all sounds ceased Two hours later the same noises the same comings and goings were repeated Hoisted on board the longboat was readjusted into its socket and the Nautilus plunged back beneath the waves So those millions had been delivered to their address At what spot on the continent Who was the recipient of Captain Nemo s gold The next day I related the night s events to Conseil and the Canadian events that had aroused my curiosity to a fever pitch My companions were as startled as I was But where does he get those millions Ned Land asked To this no reply was possible After breakfast I made my way to the lounge and went about my work I wrote up my notes until five o clock in the afternoon Just then was it due to some personal indisposition I felt extremely hot and had to take off my jacket made of fan mussel fabric A perplexing circumstance because we weren t in the low latitudes and besides once the Nautilus was submerged it shouldn t be subject to any rise in temperature I looked at the pressure gauge It marked a depth of sixty feet a depth beyond the reach of atmospheric heat I kept on working but the temperature rose to the point of becoming unbearable Could there be a fire on board I wondered I was about to leave the lounge when Captain Nemo entered He approached the thermometer consulted it and turned to me forty two degrees centigrade he said I ve detected as much captain I replied and if it gets even slightly hotter we won t be able to stand it Oh professor it won t get any hotter unless we want it to You mean you can control this heat No but I can back away from the fireplace producing it So it s outside Surely We re cruising in a current of boiling water It can t be I exclaimed Look The panels had opened and I could see a completely white sea around the Nautilus Steaming sulfurous fumes uncoiled in the midst of waves bubbling like water in a boiler I leaned my hand against one of the windows but the heat was so great I had to snatch it back Where are we I asked Near the island of Santorini professor the captain answered me and right in the channel that separates the volcanic islets of Nea Kameni and Palea Kameni I wanted to offer you the unusual sight of an underwater eruption I thought I said that the formation of such new islands had come to an end Nothing ever comes to an end in these volcanic waterways Captain Nemo replied and thanks to its underground fires our globe is continuously under construction in these regions According to the Latin historians Cassiodorus and Pliny by the year nineteen of the Christian era a new island the divine Thera had already appeared in the very place these islets have more recently formed Then Thera sank under the waves only to rise and sink once more in the year sixty nine A D From that day to this such plutonic construction work has been in abeyance But on February three eighteen sixty six a new islet named George Island emerged in the midst of sulfurous steam near Nea Kameni and was fused to it on the sixth of the same month Seven days later on February thirteen the islet of Aphroessa appeared leaving a ten meter channel between itself and Nea Kameni I was in these seas when that phenomenon occurred and I was able to observe its every phase The islet of Aphroessa was circular in shape measuring three hundred feet in diameter and thirty feet in height It was made of black glassy lava mixed with bits of feldspar Finally on March ten a smaller islet called Reka appeared next to Nea Kameni and since then these three islets have fused to form one single selfsame island What about this channel we re in right now I asked Here it is Captain Nemo replied showing me a chart of the Greek Islands You observe that I ve entered the new islets in their place But will this channel fill up one day Very likely Professor Aronnax because since eighteen sixty six eight little lava islets have surged up in front of the port of saint Nicolas on Palea Kameni So it s obvious that Nea and Palea will join in days to come In the middle of the Pacific tiny infusoria build continents but here they re built by volcanic phenomena Look sir Look at the construction work going on under these waves I returned to the window The Nautilus was no longer moving The heat had become unbearable From the white it had recently been the sea was turning red a coloration caused by the presence of iron salts Although the lounge was hermetically sealed it was filling with an intolerable stink of sulfur and I could see scarlet flames of such brightness they overpowered our electric light I was swimming in perspiration I was stifling I was about to be cooked Yes I felt myself cooking in actual fact We can t stay any longer in this boiling water I told the captain No it wouldn t be advisable replied Nemo the Emotionless He gave an order The Nautilus tacked about and retreated from this furnace it couldn t brave with impunity A quarter of an hour later we were breathing fresh air on the surface of the waves It then occurred to me that if Ned had chosen these waterways for our escape attempt we wouldn t have come out alive from this sea of fire The next day February sixteen we left this basin which tallies depths of three thousand meters between Rhodes and Alexandria and passing well out from Cerigo Island after doubling Cape Matapan the Nautilus left the Greek Islands behind CHAPTER seven The Mediterranean in Forty Eight Hours THE MEDITERRANEAN your ideal blue sea to Greeks simply the sea to Hebrews the great sea to Romans mare nostrum Bordered by orange trees aloes cactus and maritime pine trees perfumed with the scent of myrtle framed by rugged mountains saturated with clean transparent air but continuously under construction by fires in the earth this sea is a genuine battlefield where Neptune and Pluto still struggle for world domination Here on these beaches and waters says the French historian Michelet a man is revived by one of the most invigorating climates in the world Latin our sea Ed But as beautiful as it was I could get only a quick look at this basin whose surface area comprises two million square kilometers Even Captain Nemo s personal insights were denied me because that mystifying individual didn t appear one single time during our high speed crossing I estimate that the Nautilus covered a track of some six hundred leagues under the waves of this sea and this voyage was accomplished in just twenty four hours times two Departing from the waterways of Greece on the morning of February sixteen we cleared the Strait of Gibraltar by sunrise on the eighteenth It was obvious to me that this Mediterranean pinned in the middle of those shores he wanted to avoid gave Captain Nemo no pleasure Its waves and breezes brought back too many memories if not too many regrets Here he no longer had the ease of movement and freedom of maneuver that the oceans allowed him and his Nautilus felt cramped so close to the coasts of both Africa and Europe Accordingly our speed was twenty five miles that is twelve four kilometer leagues per hour Needless to say Ned Land had to give up his escape plans much to his distress Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second he could hardly make use of the skiff Leaving the Nautilus under these conditions would have been like jumping off a train racing at this speed a rash move if there ever was one Moreover to renew our air supply the submersible rose to the surface of the waves only at night and relying solely on compass and log it steered by dead reckoning Inside the Mediterranean then I could catch no more of its fast passing scenery than a traveler might see from an express train in other words I could view only the distant horizons because the foregrounds flashed by like lightning But Conseil and I were able to observe those Mediterranean fish whose powerful fins kept pace for a while in the Nautilus s waters We stayed on watch before the lounge windows and our notes enable me to reconstruct in a few words the ichthyology of this sea Among the various fish inhabiting it some I viewed others I glimpsed and the rest I missed completely because of the Nautilus s speed Kindly allow me to sort them out using this whimsical system of classification It will at least convey the quickness of my observations In the midst of the watery mass brightly lit by our electric beams there snaked past those one meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime A type of ray from the genus Oxyrhynchus five feet wide had a white belly with a spotted ash gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge wide open shawl Other rays passed by so quickly I couldn t tell if they deserved that name eagle ray coined by the ancient Greeks or those designations of rat ray bat ray and toad ray that modern fishermen have inflicted on them Dogfish known as topes twelve feet long and especially feared by divers were racing with each other Looking like big bluish shadows thresher sharks went by eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell Dorados from the genus Sparus some measuring up to thirteen decimeters appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons which contrasted with the dark color of their fins fish sacred to the goddess Venus their eyes set in brows of gold a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt equally at home in rivers lakes and oceans living in every clime tolerating any temperature their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far off days Magnificent sturgeons nine to ten meters long and extremely fast banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels showing bluish backs with small brown spots they resemble sharks without equaling their strength and are encountered in every sea in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers fighting the currents of the Volga Danube Po Rhine Loire and Oder while feeding on herring mackerel salmon and codfish although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish they rate as a delicacy they re eaten fresh dried marinated or salt preserved and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the Roman epicure Lucullus But whenever the Nautilus drew near the surface those denizens of the Mediterranean I could observe most productively belonged to the sixty third genus of bony fish These were tuna from the genus Scomber blue black on top silver on the belly armor their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam They are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun and they did just that with the Nautilus as they had once done with the vessels of the Count de La Perouse For long hours they competed in speed with our submersible I couldn t stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing their heads small their bodies sleek spindle shaped and in some cases over three meters long their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength their caudal fins forked Like certain flocks of birds whose speed they equal these tuna swim in triangle formation which prompted the ancients to say they d boned up on geometry and military strategy And yet they can t escape the Provencal fishermen who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of Turkey and Italy and these valuable animals as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind leap right into the Marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands Just for the record I ll mention those Mediterranean fish that Conseil and I barely glimpsed There were whitish eels of the species Gymnotus fasciatus that passed like elusive wisps of steam conger eels three to four meters long that were tricked out in green blue and yellow three foot hake with a liver that makes a dainty morsel wormfish drifting like thin seaweed sea robins that poets call lyrefish and seamen pipers and whose snouts have two jagged triangular plates shaped like old Homer s lyre swallowfish swimming as fast as the bird they re named after redheaded groupers whose dorsal fins are trimmed with filaments some shad spotted with black gray brown blue yellow and green that actually respond to tinkling handbells splendid diamond shaped turbot that were like aquatic pheasants with yellowish fins stippled in brown and the left topside mostly marbled in brown and yellow finally schools of wonderful red mullet real oceanic birds of paradise that ancient Romans bought for as much as ten thousand sesterces apiece and which they killed at the table so they could heartlessly watch it change color from cinnabar red when alive to pallid white when dead And as for other fish common to the Atlantic and Mediterranean I was unable to observe miralets triggerfish puffers seahorses jewelfish trumpetfish blennies gray mullet wrasse smelt flying fish anchovies sea bream porgies garfish or any of the chief representatives of the order Pleuronecta such as sole flounder plaice dab and brill simply because of the dizzying speed with which the Nautilus hustled through these opulent waters As for marine mammals on passing by the mouth of the Adriatic Sea I thought I recognized two or three sperm whales equipped with the single dorsal fin denoting the genus Physeter some pilot whales from the genus Globicephalus exclusive to the Mediterranean the forepart of the head striped with small distinct lines and also a dozen seals with white bellies and black coats known by the name monk seals and just as solemn as if they were three meter Dominicans For his part Conseil thought he spotted a turtle six feet wide and adorned with three protruding ridges that ran lengthwise I was sorry to miss this reptile because from Conseil s description I believe I recognized the leatherback turtle a pretty rare species For my part I noted only some loggerhead turtles with long carapaces As for zoophytes for a few moments I was able to marvel at a wonderful orange hued hydra from the genus Galeolaria that clung to the glass of our port panel it consisted of a long lean filament that spread out into countless branches and ended in the most delicate lace ever spun by the followers of Arachne Unfortunately I couldn t fish up this wonderful specimen and surely no other Mediterranean zoophytes would have been offered to my gaze if on the evening of the sixteenth the Nautilus hadn t slowed down in an odd fashion This was the situation By then we were passing between Sicily and the coast of Tunisia In the cramped space between Cape Bon and the Strait of Messina the sea bottom rises almost all at once It forms an actual ridge with only seventeen meters of water remaining above it while the depth on either side is one hundred seventy meters Consequently the Nautilus had to maneuver with caution so as not to bump into this underwater barrier I showed Conseil the position of this long reef on our chart of the Mediterranean But with all due respect to master Conseil ventured to observe it s like an actual isthmus connecting Europe to Africa Yes my boy I replied it cuts across the whole Strait of Sicily and Smith s soundings prove that in the past these two continents were genuinely connected between Cape Boeo and Cape Farina I can easily believe it Conseil said I might add I went on that there s a similar barrier between Gibraltar and Ceuta and in prehistoric times it closed off the Mediterranean completely Gracious Conseil put in Suppose one day some volcanic upheaval raises these two barriers back above the waves That s most unlikely Conseil If master will allow me to finish I mean that if this phenomenon occurs it might prove distressing to mister de Lesseps who has gone to such pains to cut through his isthmus Agreed but I repeat Conseil such a phenomenon won t occur The intensity of these underground forces continues to diminish Volcanoes were quite numerous in the world s early days but they re going extinct one by one the heat inside the earth is growing weaker the temperature in the globe s lower strata is cooling appreciably every century and to our globe s detriment because its heat is its life But the sun The sun isn t enough Conseil Can it restore heat to a corpse Not that I ve heard Well my friend someday the earth will be just such a cold corpse Like the moon which long ago lost its vital heat our globe will become lifeless and unlivable In how many centuries Conseil asked In hundreds of thousands of years my boy Then we have ample time to finish our voyage Conseil replied if Ned Land doesn t mess things up Thus reassured Conseil went back to studying the shallows that the Nautilus was skimming at moderate speed On the rocky volcanic seafloor there bloomed quite a collection of moving flora sponges sea cucumbers jellyfish called sea gooseberries that were adorned with reddish tendrils and gave off a subtle phosphorescence members of the genus Beroe that are commonly known by the name melon jellyfish and are bathed in the shimmer of the whole solar spectrum free swimming crinoids one meter wide that reddened the waters with their crimson hue treelike basket stars of the greatest beauty sea fans from the genus Pavonacea with long stems numerous edible sea urchins of various species plus green sea anemones with a grayish trunk and a brown disk lost beneath the olive colored tresses of their tentacles Conseil kept especially busy observing mollusks and articulates and although his catalog is a little dry I wouldn t want to wrong the gallant lad by leaving out his personal observations From the branch Mollusca he mentions numerous comb shaped scallops hooflike spiny oysters piled on top of each other triangular coquina three pronged glass snails with yellow fins and transparent shells orange snails from the genus Pleurobranchus that looked like eggs spotted or speckled with greenish dots members of the genus Aplysia also known by the name sea hares other sea hares from the genus Dolabella plump paper bubble shells umbrella shells exclusive to the Mediterranean abalone whose shell produces a mother of pearl much in demand pilgrim scallops saddle shells that diners in the French province of Languedoc are said to like better than oysters some of those cockleshells so dear to the citizens of Marseilles fat white venus shells that are among the clams so abundant off the coasts of North America and eaten in such quantities by New Yorkers variously colored comb shells with gill covers burrowing date mussels with a peppery flavor I relish furrowed heart cockles whose shells have riblike ridges on their arching summits triton shells pocked with scarlet bumps carniaira snails with backward curving tips that make them resemble flimsy gondolas crowned ferola snails atlanta snails with spiral shells gray nudibranchs from the genus Tethys that were spotted with white and covered by fringed mantles nudibranchs from the suborder Eolidea that looked like small slugs sea butterflies crawling on their backs seashells from the genus Auricula including the oval shaped Auricula myosotis tan wentletrap snails common periwinkles violet snails cineraira snails rock borers ear shells cabochon snails pandora shells et cetera As for the articulates in his notes Conseil has very appropriately divided them into six classes three of which belong to the marine world These classes are the Crustacea Cirripedia and Annelida Crustaceans are subdivided into nine orders and the first of these consists of the decapods in other words animals whose head and thorax are usually fused whose cheek and mouth mechanism is made up of several pairs of appendages and whose thorax has four five or six pairs of walking legs Conseil used the methods of our mentor Professor Milne Edwards who puts the decapods in three divisions Brachyura Macrura and Anomura These names may look a tad fierce but they re accurate and appropriate Among the Brachyura Conseil mentions some amanthia crabs whose fronts were armed with two big diverging tips those inachus scorpions that lord knows why symbolized wisdom to the ancient Greeks spider crabs of the massena and spinimane varieties that had probably gone astray in these shallows because they usually live in the lower depths xanthid crabs pilumna crabs rhomboid crabs granular box crabs easy on the digestion as Conseil ventured to observe toothless masked crabs ebalia crabs cymopolia crabs woolly handed crabs et cetera Among the Macrura which are subdivided into five families hardshells burrowers crayfish prawns and ghost crabs Conseil mentions some common spiny lobsters whose females supply a meat highly prized slipper lobsters or common shrimp waterside gebia shrimp and all sorts of edible species but he says nothing of the crayfish subdivision that includes the true lobster because spiny lobsters are the only type in the Mediterranean Finally among the Anomura he saw common drocina crabs dwelling inside whatever abandoned seashells they could take over homola crabs with spiny fronts hermit crabs hairy porcelain crabs et cetera There Conseil s work came to a halt He didn t have time to finish off the class Crustacea through an examination of its stomatopods amphipods homopods isopods trilobites branchiopods ostracods and entomostraceans And in order to complete his study of marine articulates he needed to mention the class Cirripedia which contains water fleas and carp lice plus the class Annelida which he would have divided without fail into tubifex worms and dorsibranchian worms But having gone past the shallows of the Strait of Sicily the Nautilus resumed its usual deep water speed From then on no more mollusks no more zoophytes no more articulates Just a few large fish sweeping by like shadows During the night of February sixteen seventeen we entered the second Mediterranean basin whose maximum depth we found at three thousand meters The Nautilus driven downward by its propeller and slanting fins descended to the lowest strata of this sea There in place of natural wonders the watery mass offered some thrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes In essence we were then crossing that part of the whole Mediterranean so fertile in casualties From the coast of Algiers to the beaches of Provence how many ships have wrecked how many vessels have vanished Compared to the vast liquid plains of the Pacific the Mediterranean is a mere lake but it s an unpredictable lake with fickle waves today kindly and affectionate to those frail single masters drifting between a double ultramarine of sky and water tomorrow bad tempered and turbulent agitated by the winds demolishing the strongest ships beneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop So in our swift cruise through these deep strata how many vessels I saw lying on the seafloor some already caked with coral others clad only in a layer of rust plus anchors cannons shells iron fittings propeller blades parts of engines cracked cylinders staved in boilers then hulls floating in midwater here upright there overturned Some of these wrecked ships had perished in collisions others from hitting granite reefs I saw a few that had sunk straight down their masting still upright their rigging stiffened by the water They looked like they were at anchor by some immense open offshore mooring where they were waiting for their departure time When the Nautilus passed between them covering them with sheets of electricity they seemed ready to salute us with their colors and send us their serial numbers But no nothing but silence and death filled this field of catastrophes I observed that these Mediterranean depths became more and more cluttered with such gruesome wreckage as the Nautilus drew nearer to the Strait of Gibraltar By then the shores of Africa and Europe were converging and in this narrow space collisions were commonplace There I saw numerous iron undersides the phantasmagoric ruins of steamers some lying down others rearing up like fearsome animals One of these boats made a dreadful first impression sides torn open funnel bent paddle wheels stripped to the mountings rudder separated from the sternpost and still hanging from an iron chain the board on its stern eaten away by marine salts How many lives were dashed in this shipwreck How many victims were swept under the waves Had some sailor on board lived to tell the story of this dreadful disaster or do the waves still keep this casualty a secret It occurred to me lord knows why that this boat buried under the sea might have been the Atlas lost with all hands some twenty years ago and never heard from again Oh what a gruesome tale these Mediterranean depths could tell this huge boneyard where so much wealth has been lost where so many victims have met their deaths Meanwhile briskly unconcerned the Nautilus ran at full propeller through the midst of these ruins On February eighteen near three o clock in the morning it hove before the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar There are two currents here an upper current long known to exist that carries the ocean s waters into the Mediterranean basin then a lower countercurrent the only present day proof of its existence being logic In essence the Mediterranean receives a continual influx of water not only from the Atlantic but from rivers emptying into it since local evaporation isn t enough to restore the balance the total amount of added water should make this sea s level higher every year Yet this isn t the case and we re naturally forced to believe in the existence of some lower current that carries the Mediterranean s surplus through the Strait of Gibraltar and into the Atlantic basin And so it turned out The Nautilus took full advantage of this countercurrent It advanced swiftly through this narrow passageway For an instant I could glimpse the wonderful ruins of the Temple of Hercules buried undersea as Pliny and Avianus have mentioned together with the flat island they stand on and a few minutes later we were floating on the waves of the Atlantic CHAPTER eight The Bay of Vigo THE ATLANTIC A vast expanse of water whose surface area is twenty five million square miles with a length of nine thousand miles and an average width of twenty seven hundred A major sea nearly unknown to the ancients except perhaps the Carthaginians those Dutchmen of antiquity who went along the west coasts of Europe and Africa on their commercial junkets An ocean whose parallel winding shores form an immense perimeter fed by the world s greatest rivers the saint Lawrence Mississippi Amazon Plata Orinoco Niger Senegal Elbe Loire and Rhine which bring it waters from the most civilized countries as well as the most undeveloped areas A magnificent plain of waves plowed continuously by ships of every nation shaded by every flag in the world and ending in those two dreadful headlands so feared by navigators Cape Horn and the Cape of Tempests The Nautilus broke these waters with the edge of its spur after doing nearly ten thousand leagues in three and a half months a track longer than a great circle of the earth Where were we heading now and what did the future have in store for us Emerging from the Strait of Gibraltar the Nautilus took to the high seas It returned to the surface of the waves so our daily strolls on the platform were restored to us I climbed onto it instantly Ned Land and Conseil along with me Twelve miles away Cape saint Vincent was hazily visible the southwestern tip of the Hispanic peninsula The wind was blowing a pretty strong gust from the south The sea was swelling and surging Its waves made the Nautilus roll and jerk violently It was nearly impossible to stand up on the platform which was continuously buffeted by this enormously heavy sea After inhaling a few breaths of air we went below once more I repaired to my stateroom Conseil returned to his cabin but the Canadian looking rather worried followed me Our quick trip through the Mediterranean hadn t allowed him to put his plans into execution and he could barely conceal his disappointment After the door to my stateroom was closed he sat and stared at me silently Ned my friend I told him I know how you feel but you mustn t blame yourself Given the way the Nautilus was navigating it would have been sheer insanity to think of escaping Ned Land didn t reply His pursed lips and frowning brow indicated that he was in the grip of his monomania Look here I went on as yet there s no cause for despair We re going up the coast of Portugal France and England aren t far off and there we ll easily find refuge Oh I grant you if the Nautilus had emerged from the Strait of Gibraltar and made for that cape in the south if it were taking us toward those regions that have no continents then I d share your alarm But we now know that Captain Nemo doesn t avoid the seas of civilization and in a few days I think we can safely take action Ned Land stared at me still more intently and finally unpursed his lips We ll do it this evening he said I straightened suddenly I admit that I was less than ready for this announcement I wanted to reply to the Canadian but words failed me We agreed to wait for the right circumstances Ned Land went on Now we ve got those circumstances This evening we ll be just a few miles off the coast of Spain It ll be cloudy tonight The wind s blowing toward shore You gave me your promise Professor Aronnax and I m counting on you Since I didn t say anything the Canadian stood up and approached me We ll do it this evening at nine o clock he said I ve alerted Conseil By that time Captain Nemo will be locked in his room and probably in bed Neither the mechanics or the crewmen will be able to see us Conseil and I will go to the central companionway As for you Professor Aronnax you ll stay in the library two steps away and wait for my signal The oars mast and sail are in the skiff I ve even managed to stow some provisions inside I ve gotten hold of a monkey wrench to unscrew the nuts bolting the skiff to the Nautilus s hull So everything s ready I ll see you this evening The sea is rough I said Admitted the Canadian replied but we ve got to risk it Freedom is worth paying for Besides the longboat s solidly built and a few miles with the wind behind us is no big deal By tomorrow who knows if this ship won t be one hundred leagues out to sea If circumstances are in our favor between ten and eleven this evening we ll be landing on some piece of solid ground or we ll be dead So we re in God s hands and I ll see you this evening This said the Canadian withdrew leaving me close to dumbfounded I had imagined that if it came to this I would have time to think about it to talk it over My stubborn companion hadn t granted me this courtesy But after all what would I have said to him Ned Land was right a hundred times over These were near ideal circumstances and he was taking full advantage of them In my selfish personal interests could I go back on my word and be responsible for ruining the future lives of my companions Tomorrow might not Captain Nemo take us far away from any shore Just then a fairly loud hissing told me that the ballast tanks were filling and the Nautilus sank beneath the waves of the Atlantic I stayed in my stateroom I wanted to avoid the captain to hide from his eyes the agitation overwhelming me What an agonizing day I spent torn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at abandoning this marvelous Nautilus leaving my underwater research incomplete How could I relinquish this ocean my own Atlantic as I liked to call it without observing its lower strata without wresting from it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas of the East Indies and the Pacific I was putting down my novel half read I was waking up as my dream neared its climax How painfully the hours passed as I sometimes envisioned myself safe on shore with my companions or despite my better judgment as I sometimes wished that some unforeseen circumstances would prevent Ned Land from carrying out his plans Twice I went to the lounge I wanted to consult the compass I wanted to see if the Nautilus s heading was actually taking us closer to the coast or spiriting us farther away But no The Nautilus was still in Portuguese waters Heading north it was cruising along the ocean s beaches So I had to resign myself to my fate and get ready to escape My baggage wasn t heavy My notes nothing more As for Captain Nemo I wondered what he would make of our escaping what concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him and what he would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being found out Certainly I had no complaints to register with him on the contrary Never was hospitality more wholehearted than his Yet in leaving him I couldn t be accused of ingratitude No solemn promises bound us to him In order to keep us captive he had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our word of honor But his avowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our every effort I hadn t seen the captain since our visit to the island of Santorini Would fate bring me into his presence before our departure I both desired and dreaded it I listened for footsteps in the stateroom adjoining mine Not a sound reached my ear His stateroom had to be deserted Then I began to wonder if this eccentric individual was even on board Since that night when the skiff had left the Nautilus on some mysterious mission my ideas about him had subtly changed In spite of everything I thought that Captain Nemo must have kept up some type of relationship with the shore Did he himself never leave the Nautilus Whole weeks had often gone by without my encountering him What was he doing all the while During all those times I d thought he was convalescing in the grip of some misanthropic fit was he instead far away from the ship involved in some secret activity whose nature still eluded me All these ideas and a thousand others assaulted me at the same time In these strange circumstances the scope for conjecture was unlimited I felt an unbearable queasiness This day of waiting seemed endless The hours struck too slowly to keep up with my impatience As usual dinner was served me in my stateroom Full of anxiety I ate little I left the table at seven o clock one hundred twenty minutes I was keeping track of them still separated me from the moment I was to rejoin Ned Land My agitation increased My pulse was throbbing violently I couldn t stand still I walked up and down hoping to calm my troubled mind with movement The possibility of perishing in our reckless undertaking was the least of my worries my heart was pounding at the thought that our plans might be discovered before we had left the Nautilus at the thought of being hauled in front of Captain Nemo and finding him angered or worse saddened by my deserting him I wanted to see the lounge one last time I went down the gangways and arrived at the museum where I had spent so many pleasant and productive hours I stared at all its wealth all its treasures like a man on the eve of his eternal exile a man departing to return no more For so many days now these natural wonders and artistic masterworks had been central to my life and I was about to leave them behind forever I wanted to plunge my eyes through the lounge window and into these Atlantic waters but the panels were hermetically sealed and a mantle of sheet iron separated me from this ocean with which I was still unfamiliar Crossing through the lounge I arrived at the door contrived in one of the canted corners that opened into the captain s stateroom Much to my astonishment this door was ajar I instinctively recoiled If Captain Nemo was in his stateroom he might see me But not hearing any sounds I approached The stateroom was deserted I pushed the door open I took a few steps inside Still the same austere monastic appearance Just then my eye was caught by some etchings hanging on the wall which I hadn t noticed during my first visit They were portraits of great men of history who had spent their lives in perpetual devotion to a great human ideal Thaddeus Kosciusko the hero whose dying words had been Finis Poloniae Markos Botzaris for modern Greece the reincarnation of Sparta s King Leonidas Daniel O Connell Ireland s defender George Washington founder of the American Union Daniele Manin the Italian patriot Abraham Lincoln dead from the bullet of a believer in slavery and finally that martyr for the redemption of the black race John Brown hanging from his gallows as Victor Hugo s pencil has so terrifyingly depicted Latin Save Poland s borders Ed What was the bond between these heroic souls and the soul of Captain Nemo From this collection of portraits could I finally unravel the mystery of his existence Was he a fighter for oppressed peoples a liberator of enslaved races Had he figured in the recent political or social upheavals of this century Was he a hero of that dreadful civil war in America a war lamentable yet forever glorious Suddenly the clock struck eight The first stroke of its hammer on the chime snapped me out of my musings I shuddered as if some invisible eye had plunged into my innermost thoughts and I rushed outside the stateroom There my eyes fell on the compass Our heading was still northerly The log indicated a moderate speed the pressure gauge a depth of about sixty feet So circumstances were in favor of the Canadian s plans I stayed in my stateroom I dressed warmly fishing boots otter cap coat of fan mussel fabric lined with sealskin I was ready I was waiting Only the propeller s vibrations disturbed the deep silence reigning on board I cocked an ear and listened Would a sudden outburst of voices tell me that Ned Land s escape plans had just been detected A ghastly uneasiness stole through me I tried in vain to recover my composure A few minutes before nine o clock I glued my ear to the captain s door Not a sound I left my stateroom and returned to the lounge which was deserted and plunged in near darkness I opened the door leading to the library The same inadequate light the same solitude I went to man my post near the door opening into the well of the central companionway I waited for Ned Land s signal At this point the propeller s vibrations slowed down appreciably then they died out altogether Why was the Nautilus stopping Whether this layover would help or hinder Ned Land s schemes I couldn t have said The silence was further disturbed only by the pounding of my heart Suddenly I felt a mild jolt I realized the Nautilus had come to rest on the ocean floor My alarm increased The Canadian s signal hadn t reached me I longed to rejoin Ned Land and urge him to postpone his attempt I sensed that we were no longer navigating under normal conditions Just then the door to the main lounge opened and Captain Nemo appeared He saw me and without further preamble Ah professor he said in an affable tone I ve been looking for you Do you know your Spanish history Even if he knew it by heart a man in my disturbed befuddled condition couldn t have quoted a syllable of his own country s history Well Captain Nemo went on Did you hear my question Do you know the history of Spain Very little of it I replied The most learned men the captain said still have much to learn Have a seat he added and I ll tell you about an unusual episode in this body of history The captain stretched out on a couch and I mechanically took a seat near him but half in the shadows Professor he said listen carefully This piece of history concerns you in one definite respect because it will answer a question you ve no doubt been unable to resolve I m listening captain I said not knowing what my partner in this dialogue was driving at and wondering if this incident related to our escape plans Professor Captain Nemo went on if you re amenable we ll go back in time to seventeen oh two You re aware of the fact that in those days your King Louis XIV thought an imperial gesture would suffice to humble the Pyrenees in the dust so he inflicted his grandson the Duke of Anjou on the Spaniards Reigning more or less poorly under the name King Philip V this aristocrat had to deal with mighty opponents abroad In essence the year before the royal houses of Holland Austria and England had signed a treaty of alliance at The Hague aiming to wrest the Spanish crown from King Philip V and to place it on the head of an archduke whom they prematurely dubbed King Charles III Spain had to withstand these allies But the country had practically no army or navy Yet it wasn t short of money provided that its galleons laden with gold and silver from America could enter its ports Now then late in seventeen oh two Spain was expecting a rich convoy which France ventured to escort with a fleet of twenty three vessels under the command of Admiral de Chateau Renault because by that time the allied navies were roving the Atlantic This convoy was supposed to put into Cadiz but after learning that the English fleet lay across those waterways the admiral decided to make for a French port The Spanish commanders in the convoy objected to this decision They wanted to be taken to a Spanish port if not to Cadiz then to the Bay of Vigo located on Spain s northwest coast and not blockaded Admiral de Chateau Renault was so indecisive as to obey this directive and the galleons entered the Bay of Vigo Unfortunately this bay forms an open offshore mooring that s impossible to defend So it was essential to hurry and empty the galleons before the allied fleets arrived and there would have been ample time for this unloading if a wretched question of trade agreements hadn t suddenly come up Are you clear on the chain of events Captain Nemo asked me Perfectly clear I said not yet knowing why I was being given this history lesson Then I ll continue Here s what came to pass The tradesmen of Cadiz had negotiated a charter whereby they were to receive all merchandise coming from the West Indies Now then unloading the ingots from those galleons at the port of Vigo would have been a violation of their rights So they lodged a complaint in Madrid and they obtained an order from the indecisive King Philip V without unloading the convoy would stay in custody at the offshore mooring of Vigo until the enemy fleets had retreated Now then just as this decision was being handed down English vessels arrived in the Bay of Vigo on October twenty two seventeen oh two Despite his inferior forces Admiral de Chateau Renault fought courageously But when he saw that the convoy s wealth was about to fall into enemy hands he burned and scuttled the galleons which went to the bottom with their immense treasures Captain Nemo stopped I admit it I still couldn t see how this piece of history concerned me Well I asked him Well Professor Aronnax Captain Nemo answered me we re actually in that Bay of Vigo and all that s left is for you to probe the mysteries of the place The captain stood up and invited me to follow him I d had time to collect myself I did so The lounge was dark but the sea s waves sparkled through the transparent windows I stared Around the Nautilus for a half mile radius the waters seemed saturated with electric light The sandy bottom was clear and bright Dressed in diving suits crewmen were busy clearing away half rotted barrels and disemboweled trunks in the midst of the dingy hulks of ships Out of these trunks and kegs spilled ingots of gold and silver cascades of jewels pieces of eight The sand was heaped with them Then laden with these valuable spoils the men returned to the Nautilus dropped off their burdens inside and went to resume this inexhaustible fishing for silver and gold I understood This was the setting of that battle on October twenty two seventeen oh two Here in this very place those galleons carrying treasure to the Spanish government had gone to the bottom Here whenever he needed Captain Nemo came to withdraw these millions to ballast his Nautilus It was for him for him alone that America had yielded up its precious metals He was the direct sole heir to these treasures wrested from the Incas and those peoples conquered by Hernando Cortez Did you know professor he asked me with a smile that the sea contained such wealth I know it s estimated I replied that there are two million metric tons of silver held in suspension in seawater Surely but in extracting that silver your expenses would outweigh your profits Here by contrast I have only to pick up what other men have lost and not only in this Bay of Vigo but at a thousand other sites where ships have gone down whose positions are marked on my underwater chart Do you understand now that I m rich to the tune of billions I understand captain Nevertheless allow me to inform you that by harvesting this very Bay of Vigo you re simply forestalling the efforts of a rival organization What organization A company chartered by the Spanish government to search for these sunken galleons The company s investors were lured by the bait of enormous gains because this scuttled treasure is estimated to be worth five hundred million francs It was five hundred million francs Captain Nemo replied but no more Right I said Hence a timely warning to those investors would be an act of charity Yet who knows if it would be well received Usually what gamblers regret the most isn t the loss of their money so much as the loss of their insane hopes But ultimately I feel less sorry for them than for the thousands of unfortunate people who would have benefited from a fair distribution of this wealth whereas now it will be of no help to them No sooner had I voiced this regret than I felt it must have wounded Captain Nemo No help he replied with growing animation Sir what makes you assume this wealth goes to waste when I m the one amassing it Do you think I toil to gather this treasure out of selfishness Who says I don t put it to good use Do you think I m unaware of the suffering beings and oppressed races living on this earth poor people to comfort victims to avenge Don t you understand Captain Nemo stopped on these last words perhaps sorry that he had said too much But I had guessed Whatever motives had driven him to seek independence under the seas he remained a human being before all else His heart still throbbed for suffering humanity and his immense philanthropy went out both to downtrodden races and to individuals And now I knew where Captain Nemo had delivered those millions when the Nautilus navigated the waters where Crete was in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire CHAPTER nine A Lost Continent THE NEXT MORNING February nineteen I beheld the Canadian entering my stateroom I was expecting this visit He wore an expression of great disappointment Well sir he said to me Well Ned the fates were against us yesterday Yes That damned captain had to call a halt just as we were going to escape from his boat Yes Ned he had business with his bankers His bankers Or rather his bank vaults By which I mean this ocean where his wealth is safer than in any national treasury I then related the evening s incidents to the Canadian secretly hoping he would come around to the idea of not deserting the captain but my narrative had no result other than Ned s voicing deep regret that he hadn t strolled across the Vigo battlefield on his own behalf Anyhow he said it s not over yet My first harpoon missed that s all We ll succeed the next time and as soon as this evening if need be What s the Nautilus s heading I asked I ve no idea Ned replied All right at noon we ll find out what our position is The Canadian returned to Conseil s side As soon as I was dressed 
836_130900_000005_000001	train-clean-360	I went into the lounge 
none	none	The compass wasn t encouraging The Nautilus s course was south southwest We were turning our backs on Europe I could hardly wait until our position was reported on the chart Near eleven thirty the ballast tanks emptied and the submersible rose to the surface of the ocean I leaped onto the platform Ned Land was already there No more shore in sight Nothing but the immenseness of the sea A few sails were on the horizon no doubt ships going as far as Cape Sao Roque to find favorable winds for doubling the Cape of Good Hope The sky was overcast A squall was on the way Furious Ned tried to see through the mists on the horizon He still hoped that behind all that fog there lay those shores he longed for At noon the sun made a momentary appearance Taking advantage of this rift in the clouds the chief officer took the orb s altitude Then the sea grew turbulent we went below again and the hatch closed once more When I consulted the chart an hour later I saw that the Nautilus s position was marked at longitude sixteen degrees seventeen and latitude thirty three degrees twenty two a good one hundred fifty leagues from the nearest coast It wouldn t do to even dream of escaping and I ll let the reader decide how promptly the Canadian threw a tantrum when I ventured to tell him our situation As for me I wasn t exactly grief stricken I felt as if a heavy weight had been lifted from me and I was able to resume my regular tasks in a state of comparative calm Near eleven o clock in the evening I received a most unexpected visit from Captain Nemo He asked me very graciously if I felt exhausted from our vigil the night before I said no Then Professor Aronnax I propose an unusual excursion Propose away captain So far you ve visited the ocean depths only by day and under sunlight Would you like to see these depths on a dark night Very much I warn you this will be an exhausting stroll We ll need to walk long hours and scale a mountain The roads aren t terribly well kept up Everything you say captain just increases my curiosity I m ready to go with you Then come along professor and we ll go put on our diving suits Arriving at the wardrobe I saw that neither my companions nor any crewmen would be coming with us on this excursion Captain Nemo hadn t even suggested my fetching Ned or Conseil In a few moments we had put on our equipment Air tanks abundantly charged were placed on our backs but the electric lamps were not in readiness I commented on this to the captain They ll be useless to us he replied I thought I hadn t heard him right but I couldn t repeat my comment because the captain s head had already disappeared into its metal covering I finished harnessing myself I felt an alpenstock being placed in my hand and a few minutes later after the usual procedures we set foot on the floor of the Atlantic three hundred meters down Midnight was approaching The waters were profoundly dark but Captain Nemo pointed to a reddish spot in the distance a sort of wide glow shimmering about two miles from the Nautilus What this fire was what substances fed it how and why it kept burning in the liquid mass I couldn t say Anyhow it lit our way although hazily but I soon grew accustomed to this unique gloom and in these circumstances I understood the uselessness of the Ruhmkorff device Side by side Captain Nemo and I walked directly toward this conspicuous flame The level seafloor rose imperceptibly We took long strides helped by our alpenstocks but in general our progress was slow because our feet kept sinking into a kind of slimy mud mixed with seaweed and assorted flat stones As we moved forward I heard a kind of pitter patter above my head Sometimes this noise increased and became a continuous crackle I soon realized the cause It was a heavy rainfall rattling on the surface of the waves Instinctively I worried that I might get soaked By water in the midst of water I couldn t help smiling at this outlandish notion But to tell the truth wearing these heavy diving suits you no longer feel the liquid element you simply think you re in the midst of air a little denser than air on land that s all After half an hour of walking the seafloor grew rocky Jellyfish microscopic crustaceans and sea pen coral lit it faintly with their phosphorescent glimmers I glimpsed piles of stones covered by a couple million zoophytes and tangles of algae My feet often slipped on this viscous seaweed carpet and without my alpenstock I would have fallen more than once When I turned around I could still see the Nautilus s whitish beacon which was starting to grow pale in the distance Those piles of stones just mentioned were laid out on the ocean floor with a distinct but inexplicable symmetry I spotted gigantic furrows trailing off into the distant darkness their length incalculable There also were other peculiarities I couldn t make sense of It seemed to me that my heavy lead soles were crushing a litter of bones that made a dry crackling noise So what were these vast plains we were now crossing I wanted to ask the captain but I still didn t grasp that sign language that allowed him to chat with his companions when they went with him on his underwater excursions Meanwhile the reddish light guiding us had expanded and inflamed the horizon The presence of this furnace under the waters had me extremely puzzled Was it some sort of electrical discharge Was I approaching some natural phenomenon still unknown to scientists on shore Or rather and this thought did cross my mind had the hand of man intervened in that blaze Had human beings fanned those flames In these deep strata would I meet up with more of Captain Nemo s companions friends he was about to visit who led lives as strange as his own Would I find a whole colony of exiles down here men tired of the world s woes men who had sought and found independence in the ocean s lower depths All these insane inadmissible ideas dogged me and in this frame of mind continually excited by the series of wonders passing before my eyes I wouldn t have been surprised to find on this sea bottom one of those underwater towns Captain Nemo dreamed about Our path was getting brighter and brighter The red glow had turned white and was radiating from a mountain peak about eight hundred feet high But what I saw was simply a reflection produced by the crystal waters of these strata The furnace that was the source of this inexplicable light occupied the far side of the mountain In the midst of the stone mazes furrowing this Atlantic seafloor Captain Nemo moved forward without hesitation He knew this dark path No doubt he had often traveled it and was incapable of losing his way I followed him with unshakeable confidence He seemed like some Spirit of the Sea and as he walked ahead of me I marveled at his tall figure which stood out in black against the glowing background of the horizon It was one o clock in the morning We arrived at the mountain s lower gradients But in grappling with them we had to venture up difficult trails through a huge thicket Yes a thicket of dead trees Trees without leaves without sap turned to stone by the action of the waters and crowned here and there by gigantic pines It was like a still erect coalfield its roots clutching broken soil its boughs clearly outlined against the ceiling of the waters like thin black paper cutouts Picture a forest clinging to the sides of a peak in the Harz Mountains but a submerged forest The trails were cluttered with algae and fucus plants hosts of crustaceans swarming among them I plunged on scaling rocks straddling fallen tree trunks snapping marine creepers that swayed from one tree to another startling the fish that flitted from branch to branch Carried away I didn t feel exhausted any more I followed a guide who was immune to exhaustion What a sight How can I describe it How can I portray these woods and rocks in this liquid setting their lower parts dark and sullen their upper parts tinted red in this light whose intensity was doubled by the reflecting power of the waters We scaled rocks that crumbled behind us collapsing in enormous sections with the hollow rumble of an avalanche To our right and left there were carved gloomy galleries where the eye lost its way Huge glades opened up seemingly cleared by the hand of man and I sometimes wondered whether some residents of these underwater regions would suddenly appear before me But Captain Nemo kept climbing I didn t want to fall behind I followed him boldly My alpenstock was a great help One wrong step would have been disastrous on the narrow paths cut into the sides of these chasms but I walked along with a firm tread and without the slightest feeling of dizziness Sometimes I leaped over a crevasse whose depth would have made me recoil had I been in the midst of glaciers on shore sometimes I ventured out on a wobbling tree trunk fallen across a gorge without looking down having eyes only for marveling at the wild scenery of this region There leaning on erratically cut foundations monumental rocks seemed to defy the laws of balance From between their stony knees trees sprang up like jets under fearsome pressure supporting other trees that supported them in turn Next natural towers with wide steeply carved battlements leaned at angles that on dry land the laws of gravity would never have authorized And I too could feel the difference created by the water s powerful density despite my heavy clothing copper headpiece and metal soles I climbed the most impossibly steep gradients with all the nimbleness I swear it of a chamois or a Pyrenees mountain goat As for my account of this excursion under the waters I m well aware that it sounds incredible I m the chronicler of deeds seemingly impossible and yet incontestably real This was no fantasy This was what I saw and felt Two hours after leaving the Nautilus we had cleared the timberline and one hundred feet above our heads stood the mountain peak forming a dark silhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far slope Petrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling zigzags Fish rose in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall grass The rocky mass was gouged with impenetrable crevices deep caves unfathomable holes at whose far ends I could hear fearsome things moving around My blood would curdle as I watched some enormous antenna bar my path or saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the shadow of some cavity A thousand specks of light glittered in the midst of the gloom They were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans crouching in their lairs giant lobsters rearing up like spear carriers and moving their claws with a scrap iron clanking titanic crabs aiming their bodies like cannons on their carriages and hideous devilfish intertwining their tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes What was this astounding world that I didn t yet know In what order did these articulates belong these creatures for which the rocks provided a second carapace Where had nature learned the secret of their vegetating existence and for how many centuries had they lived in the ocean s lower strata But I couldn t linger Captain Nemo on familiar terms with these dreadful animals no longer minded them We arrived at a preliminary plateau where still other surprises were waiting for me There picturesque ruins took shape betraying the hand of man not our Creator They were huge stacks of stones in which you could distinguish the indistinct forms of palaces and temples now arrayed in hosts of blossoming zoophytes and over it all not ivy but a heavy mantle of algae and fucus plants But what part of the globe could this be this land swallowed by cataclysms Who had set up these rocks and stones like the dolmens of prehistoric times Where was I where had Captain Nemo s fancies taken me I wanted to ask him Unable to I stopped him I seized his arm But he shook his head pointed to the mountain s topmost peak and seemed to tell me Come on Come with me Come higher I followed him with one last burst of energy and in a few minutes I had scaled the peak which crowned the whole rocky mass by some ten meters I looked back down the side we had just cleared There the mountain rose only seven hundred to eight hundred feet above the plains but on its far slope it crowned the receding bottom of this part of the Atlantic by a height twice that My eyes scanned the distance and took in a vast area lit by intense flashes of light In essence this mountain was a volcano Fifty feet below its peak amid a shower of stones and slag a wide crater vomited torrents of lava that were dispersed in fiery cascades into the heart of the liquid mass So situated this volcano was an immense torch that lit up the lower plains all the way to the horizon As I said this underwater crater spewed lava but not flames Flames need oxygen from the air and are unable to spread underwater but a lava flow which contains in itself the principle of its incandescence can rise to a white heat overpower the liquid element and turn it into steam on contact Swift currents swept away all this diffuse gas and torrents of lava slid to the foot of the mountain like the disgorgings of a Mt Vesuvius over the city limits of a second Torre del Greco In fact there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins demolished overwhelmed laid low its roofs caved in its temples pulled down its arches dislocated its columns stretching over the earth in these ruins you could still detect the solid proportions of a sort of Tuscan architecture farther off the remains of a gigantic aqueduct here the caked heights of an acropolis along with the fluid forms of a Parthenon there the remnants of a wharf as if some bygone port had long ago harbored merchant vessels and triple tiered war galleys on the shores of some lost ocean still farther off long rows of collapsing walls deserted thoroughfares a whole Pompeii buried under the waters which Captain Nemo had resurrected before my eyes Where was I Where was I I had to find out at all cost I wanted to speak I wanted to rip off the copper sphere imprisoning my head But Captain Nemo came over and stopped me with a gesture Then picking up a piece of chalky stone he advanced to a black basaltic rock and scrawled this one word ATLANTIS What lightning flashed through my mind Atlantis that ancient land of Meropis mentioned by the historian Theopompus Plato s Atlantis the continent whose very existence has been denied by such philosophers and scientists as Origen Porphyry Iamblichus d Anville Malte Brun and Humboldt who entered its disappearance in the ledger of myths and folk tales the country whose reality has nevertheless been accepted by such other thinkers as Posidonius Pliny Ammianus Marcellinus Tertullian Engel Scherer Tournefort Buffon and d Avezac I had this land right under my eyes furnishing its own unimpeachable evidence of the catastrophe that had overtaken it So this was the submerged region that had existed outside Europe Asia and Libya beyond the Pillars of Hercules home of those powerful Atlantean people against whom ancient Greece had waged its earliest wars The writer whose narratives record the lofty deeds of those heroic times is Plato himself His dialogues Timaeus and Critias were drafted with the poet and legislator Solon as their inspiration as it were One day Solon was conversing with some elderly wise men in the Egyptian capital of Sais a town already eight thousand years of age as documented by the annals engraved on the sacred walls of its temples One of these elders related the history of another town one thousand years older still This original city of Athens ninety centuries old had been invaded and partly destroyed by the Atlanteans These Atlanteans he said resided on an immense continent greater than Africa and Asia combined taking in an area that lay between latitude twelve degrees and forty degrees north Their dominion extended even to Egypt They tried to enforce their rule as far as Greece but they had to retreat before the indomitable resistance of the Hellenic people Centuries passed A cataclysm occurred floods earthquakes A single night and day were enough to obliterate this Atlantis whose highest peaks Madeira the Azores the Canaries the Cape Verde Islands still emerge above the waves These were the historical memories that Captain Nemo s scrawl sent rushing through my mind Thus led by the strangest of fates I was treading underfoot one of the mountains of that continent My hands were touching ruins many thousands of years old contemporary with prehistoric times I was walking in the very place where contemporaries of early man had walked My heavy soles were crushing the skeletons of animals from the age of fable animals that used to take cover in the shade of these trees now turned to stone Oh why was I so short of time I would have gone down the steep slopes of this mountain crossed this entire immense continent which surely connects Africa with America and visited its great prehistoric cities Under my eyes there perhaps lay the warlike town of Makhimos or the pious village of Eusebes whose gigantic inhabitants lived for whole centuries and had the strength to raise blocks of stone that still withstood the action of the waters One day perhaps some volcanic phenomenon will bring these sunken ruins back to the surface of the waves Numerous underwater volcanoes have been sighted in this part of the ocean and many ships have felt terrific tremors when passing over these turbulent depths A few have heard hollow noises that announced some struggle of the elements far below others have hauled in volcanic ash hurled above the waves As far as the equator this whole seafloor is still under construction by plutonic forces And in some remote epoch built up by volcanic disgorgings and successive layers of lava who knows whether the peaks of these fire belching mountains may reappear above the surface of the Atlantic As I mused in this way trying to establish in my memory every detail of this impressive landscape Captain Nemo was leaning his elbows on a moss covered monument motionless as if petrified in some mute trance Was he dreaming of those lost generations asking them for the secret of human destiny Was it here that this strange man came to revive himself basking in historical memories reliving that bygone life he who had no desire for our modern one I would have given anything to know his thoughts to share them understand them We stayed in this place an entire hour contemplating its vast plains in the lava s glow which sometimes took on a startling intensity Inner boilings sent quick shivers running through the mountain s crust Noises from deep underneath clearly transmitted by the liquid medium reverberated with majestic amplitude Just then the moon appeared for an instant through the watery mass casting a few pale rays over this submerged continent It was only a fleeting glimmer but its effect was indescribable The captain stood up and took one last look at these immense plains then his hand signaled me to follow him We went swiftly down the mountain Once past the petrified forest I could see the Nautilus s beacon twinkling like a star The captain walked straight toward it and we were back on board just as the first glimmers of dawn were whitening the surface of the ocean CHAPTER ten The Underwater Coalfields THE NEXT DAY February twenty I overslept I was so exhausted from the night before I didn t get up until eleven o clock I dressed quickly I hurried to find out the Nautilus s heading The instruments indicated that it was running southward at a speed of twenty miles per hour and a depth of one hundred meters Conseil entered I described our nocturnal excursion to him and since the panels were open he could still catch a glimpse of this submerged continent In fact the Nautilus was skimming only ten meters over the soil of these Atlantis plains The ship scudded along like an air balloon borne by the wind over some prairie on land but it would be more accurate to say that we sat in the lounge as if we were riding in a coach on an express train As for the foregrounds passing before our eyes they were fantastically carved rocks forests of trees that had crossed over from the vegetable kingdom into the mineral kingdom their motionless silhouettes sprawling beneath the waves There also were stony masses buried beneath carpets of axidia and sea anemone bristling with long vertical water plants then strangely contoured blocks of lava that testified to all the fury of those plutonic developments While this bizarre scenery was glittering under our electric beams I told Conseil the story of the Atlanteans who had inspired the old French scientist Jean Bailly to write so many entertaining albeit utterly fictitious pages I told the lad about the wars of these heroic people I discussed the question of Atlantis with the fervor of a man who no longer had any doubts But Conseil was so distracted he barely heard me and his lack of interest in any commentary on this historical topic was soon explained Bailly believed that Atlantis was located at the North Pole Ed In essence numerous fish had caught his eye and when fish pass by Conseil vanishes into his world of classifying and leaves real life behind In which case I could only tag along and resume our ichthyological research Even so these Atlantic fish were not noticeably different from those we had observed earlier There were rays of gigantic size five meters long and with muscles so powerful they could leap above the waves sharks of various species including a fifteen foot glaucous shark with sharp triangular teeth and so transparent it was almost invisible amid the waters brown lantern sharks prism shaped humantin sharks armored with protuberant hides sturgeons resembling their relatives in the Mediterranean trumpet snouted pipefish a foot and a half long yellowish brown with small gray fins and no teeth or tongue unreeling like slim supple snakes Among bony fish Conseil noticed some blackish marlin three meters long with a sharp sword jutting from the upper jaw bright colored weevers known in Aristotle s day as sea dragons and whose dorsal stingers make them quite dangerous to pick up then dolphinfish with brown backs striped in blue and edged in gold handsome dorados moonlike opahs that look like azure disks but which the sun s rays turn into spots of silver finally eight meter swordfish from the genus Xiphias swimming in schools sporting yellowish sickle shaped fins and six foot broadswords stalwart animals plant eaters rather than fish eaters obeying the tiniest signals from their females like henpecked husbands But while observing these different specimens of marine fauna I didn t stop examining the long plains of Atlantis Sometimes an unpredictable irregularity in the seafloor would force the Nautilus to slow down and then it would glide into the narrow channels between the hills with a cetacean s dexterity If the labyrinth became hopelessly tangled the submersible would rise above it like an airship and after clearing the obstacle it would resume its speedy course just a few meters above the ocean floor It was an enjoyable and impressive way of navigating that did indeed recall the maneuvers of an airship ride with the major difference that the Nautilus faithfully obeyed the hands of its helmsman The terrain consisted mostly of thick slime mixed with petrified branches but it changed little by little near four o clock in the afternoon it grew rockier and seemed to be strewn with pudding stones and a basaltic gravel called tuff together with bits of lava and sulfurous obsidian I expected these long plains to change into mountain regions and in fact as the Nautilus was executing certain turns I noticed that the southerly horizon was blocked by a high wall that seemed to close off every exit Its summit obviously poked above the level of the ocean It had to be a continent or at least an island either one of the Canaries or one of the Cape Verde Islands Our bearings hadn t been marked on the chart perhaps deliberately and I had no idea what our position was In any case this wall seemed to signal the end of Atlantis of which all in all we had crossed only a small part Nightfall didn t interrupt my observations I was left to myself Conseil had repaired to his cabin The Nautilus slowed down hovering above the muddled masses on the seafloor sometimes grazing them as if wanting to come to rest sometimes rising unpredictably to the surface of the waves Then I glimpsed a few bright constellations through the crystal waters specifically five or six of those zodiacal stars trailing from the tail end of Orion I would have stayed longer at my window marveling at these beauties of sea and sky but the panels closed Just then the Nautilus had arrived at the perpendicular face of that high wall How the ship would maneuver I hadn t a guess I repaired to my stateroom 
405_130894_000006_000005	train-clean-100	The Nautilus did not stir 
none	none	I fell asleep with the firm intention of waking up in just a few hours But it was eight o clock the next day when 
839_130898_000052_000000	train-clean-100	I returned to the lounge 
none	none	I stared at the pressure gauge It told me that the Nautilus was afloat on the surface of the ocean Furthermore I heard the sound of footsteps on the platform Yet there were no rolling movements to indicate the presence of waves undulating above me I climbed as far as the hatch It was open But instead of the broad daylight I was expecting I found that I was surrounded by total darkness Where were we Had I been mistaken Was it still night No Not one star was twinkling and nighttime is never so utterly black I wasn t sure what to think when a voice said to me Is that you professor Ah Captain Nemo I replied Where are we Underground professor Underground I exclaimed And the Nautilus is still floating It always floats But I don t understand Wait a little while Our beacon is about to go on and if you want some light on the subject you ll be satisfied I set foot on the platform and waited The darkness was so profound I couldn t see even Captain Nemo However looking at the zenith directly overhead I thought I caught sight of a feeble glimmer a sort of twilight filtering through a circular hole Just then the beacon suddenly went on and its intense brightness made that hazy light vanish This stream of electricity dazzled my eyes and after momentarily shutting them I looked around The Nautilus was stationary It was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf As for the water now buoying the ship it was a lake completely encircled by an inner wall about two miles in diameter hence six miles around Its level as indicated by the pressure gauge would be the same as the outside level because some connection had to exist between this lake and the sea Slanting inward over their base these high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense upside down funnel that measured five hundred or six hundred meters in height At its summit there gaped the circular opening through which I had detected that faint glimmer obviously daylight Before more carefully examining the interior features of this enormous cavern and before deciding if it was the work of nature or humankind I went over to Captain Nemo Where are we I said In the very heart of an extinct volcano the captain answered me a volcano whose interior was invaded by the sea after some convulsion in the earth While you were sleeping professor the Nautilus entered this lagoon through a natural channel that opens ten meters below the surface of the ocean This is our home port secure convenient secret and sheltered against winds from any direction Along the coasts of your continents or islands show me any offshore mooring that can equal this safe refuge for withstanding the fury of hurricanes Indeed I replied here you re in perfect safety Captain Nemo Who could reach you in the heart of a volcano But don t I see an opening at its summit Yes its crater a crater formerly filled with lava steam and flames but which now lets in this life giving air we re breathing But which volcanic mountain is this I asked It s one of the many islets with which this sea is strewn For ships a mere reef for us an immense cavern I discovered it by chance and chance served me well But couldn t someone enter through the mouth of its crater No more than I could exit through it You can climb about one hundred feet up the inner base of this mountain but then the walls overhang they lean too far in to be scaled I can see captain that nature is your obedient servant any time or any place You re safe on this lake and nobody else can visit its waters But what s the purpose of this refuge The Nautilus doesn t need a harbor No professor but it needs electricity to run batteries to generate its electricity sodium to feed its batteries coal to make its sodium and coalfields from which to dig its coal Now then right at this spot the sea covers entire forests that sank underwater in prehistoric times today turned to stone transformed into carbon fuel they offer me inexhaustible coal mines So captain your men practice the trade of miners here Precisely These mines extend under the waves like the coalfields at Newcastle Here dressed in diving suits pick and mattock in hand my men go out and dig this carbon fuel for which I don t need a single mine on land When I burn this combustible to produce sodium the smoke escaping from the mountain s crater gives it the appearance of a still active volcano And will we see your companions at work No at least not this time because I m eager to continue our underwater tour of the world Accordingly I ll rest content with drawing on my reserve stock of sodium We ll stay here long enough to load it on board in other words a single workday then we ll resume our voyage So Professor Aronnax if you d like to explore this cavern and circle its lagoon seize the day I thanked the captain and went to look for my two companions who hadn t yet left their cabin I invited them to follow me not telling them where we were They climbed onto the platform Conseil whom nothing could startle saw it as a perfectly natural thing to fall asleep under the waves and wake up under a mountain But Ned Land had no idea in his head other than to see if this cavern offered some way out After breakfast near ten o clock we went down onto the embankment So here we are back on shore Conseil said I d hardly call this shore the Canadian replied And besides we aren t on it but under it A sandy beach unfolded before us measuring five hundred feet at its widest point between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain s walls Via this strand you could easily circle the lake But the base of these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay picturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones All these crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by the action of underground fires and they glistened under the stream of electric light from our beacon Stirred up by our footsteps the mica rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a cloud of sparks The ground rose appreciably as it moved away from the sand flats by the waves and we soon arrived at some long winding gradients genuinely steep paths that allowed us to climb little by little but we had to tread cautiously in the midst of pudding stones that weren t cemented together and our feet kept skidding on glassy trachyte made of feldspar and quartz crystals The volcanic nature of this enormous pit was apparent all around us I ventured to comment on it to my companions Can you picture I asked them what this funnel must have been like when it was filled with boiling lava and the level of that incandescent liquid rose right to the mountain s mouth like cast iron up the insides of a furnace I can picture it perfectly Conseil replied But will master tell me why this huge smelter suspended operations and how it is that an oven was replaced by the tranquil waters of a lake In all likelihood Conseil because some convulsion created an opening below the surface of the ocean the opening that serves as a passageway for the Nautilus Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed inside the mountain There ensued a dreadful struggle between the elements of fire and water a struggle ending in King Neptune s favor But many centuries have passed since then and this submerged volcano has changed into a peaceful cavern That s fine Ned Land answered I accept the explanation but in our personal interests I m sorry this opening the professor mentions wasn t made above sea level But Ned my friend Conseil answered if it weren t an underwater passageway the Nautilus couldn t enter it And I might add mister Land I said that the waters wouldn t have rushed under the mountain and the volcano would still be a volcano So you have nothing to be sorry about Our climb continued The gradients got steeper and narrower Sometimes they were cut across by deep pits that had to be cleared Masses of overhanging rock had to be gotten around You slid on your knees you crept on your belly But helped by the Canadian s strength and Conseil s dexterity we overcame every obstacle At an elevation of about thirty meters the nature of the terrain changed without becoming any easier Pudding stones and trachyte gave way to black basaltic rock here lying in slabs all swollen with blisters there shaped like actual prisms and arranged into a series of columns that supported the springings of this immense vault a wonderful sample of natural architecture Then among this basaltic rock there snaked long hardened lava flows inlaid with veins of bituminous coal and in places covered by wide carpets of sulfur The sunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger shedding a hazy light over all the volcanic waste forever buried in the heart of this extinct mountain But when we had ascended to an elevation of about two hundred fifty feet we were stopped by insurmountable obstacles The converging inside walls changed into overhangs and our climb into a circular stroll At this topmost level the vegetable kingdom began to challenge the mineral kingdom Shrubs and even a few trees emerged from crevices in the walls I recognized some spurges that let their caustic purgative sap trickle out There were heliotropes very remiss at living up to their sun worshipping reputations since no sunlight ever reached them their clusters of flowers drooped sadly their colors and scents were faded Here and there chrysanthemums sprouted timidly at the feet of aloes with long sad sickly leaves But between these lava flows I spotted little violets that still gave off a subtle fragrance and I confess that I inhaled it with delight The soul of a flower is its scent and those splendid water plants flowers of the sea have no souls We had arrived at the foot of a sturdy clump of dragon trees which were splitting the rocks with exertions of their muscular roots when Ned Land exclaimed Oh sir a hive A hive I answered with a gesture of utter disbelief Yes a hive the Canadian repeated with bees buzzing around I went closer and was forced to recognize the obvious At the mouth of a hole cut in the trunk of a dragon tree there swarmed thousands of these ingenious insects so common to all the Canary Islands where their output is especially prized Naturally enough the Canadian wanted to lay in a supply of honey and it would have been ill mannered of me to say no He mixed sulfur with some dry leaves set them on fire with a spark from his tinderbox and proceeded to smoke the bees out Little by little the buzzing died down and the disemboweled hive yielded several pounds of sweet honey Ned Land stuffed his haversack with it When I ve mixed this honey with our breadfruit batter he told us I ll be ready to serve you a delectable piece of cake But of course Conseil put in it will be gingerbread I m all for gingerbread I said but let s resume this fascinating stroll At certain turns in the trail we were going along the lake appeared in its full expanse The ship s beacon lit up that whole placid surface which experienced neither ripples nor undulations The Nautilus lay perfectly still On its platform and on the embankment crewmen were bustling around black shadows that stood out clearly in the midst of the luminous air Just then we went around the highest ridge of these rocky foothills that supported the vault Then I saw that bees weren t the animal kingdom s only representatives inside this volcano Here and in the shadows birds of prey soared and whirled flying away from nests perched on tips of rock There were sparrow hawks with white bellies and screeching kestrels With all the speed their stiltlike legs could muster fine fat bustards scampered over the slopes I ll let the reader decide whether the Canadian s appetite was aroused by the sight of this tasty game and whether he regretted having no rifle in his hands He tried to make stones do the work of bullets and after several fruitless attempts he managed to wound one of these magnificent bustards To say he risked his life twenty times in order to capture this bird is simply the unadulterated truth but he fared so well the animal went into his sack to join the honeycombs By then we were forced to go back down to the beach because the ridge had become impossible Above us the yawning crater looked like the wide mouth of a well From where we stood the sky was pretty easy to see and I watched clouds race by disheveled by the west wind letting tatters of mist trail over the mountain s summit Proof positive that those clouds kept at a moderate altitude because this volcano didn t rise more than eighteen hundred feet above the level of the ocean Half an hour after the Canadian s latest exploits we were back on the inner beach There the local flora was represented by a wide carpet of samphire a small umbelliferous plant that keeps quite nicely which also boasts the names glasswort saxifrage and sea fennel Conseil picked a couple bunches As for the local fauna it included thousands of crustaceans of every type lobsters hermit crabs prawns mysid shrimps daddy longlegs rock crabs and a prodigious number of seashells such as cowries murex snails and limpets In this locality there gaped the mouth of a magnificent cave My companions and I took great pleasure in stretching out on its fine grained sand Fire had polished the sparkling enamel of its inner walls sprinkled all over with mica rich dust Ned Land tapped these walls and tried to probe their thickness I couldn t help smiling Our conversation then turned to his everlasting escape plans and without going too far I felt I could offer him this hope Captain Nemo had gone down south only to replenish his sodium supplies So I hoped he would now hug the coasts of Europe and America which would allow the Canadian to try again with a greater chance of success We were stretched out in this delightful cave for an hour Our conversation lively at the outset then languished A definite drowsiness overcame us Since I saw no good reason to resist the call of sleep I fell into a heavy doze I dreamed one doesn t choose his dreams that my life had been reduced to the vegetating existence of a simple mollusk It seemed to me that this cave made up my double valved shell Suddenly Conseil s voice startled me awake Get up Get up shouted the fine lad What is it I asked in a sitting position The water s coming up to us I got back on my feet Like a torrent the sea was rushing into our retreat and since we definitely were not mollusks we had to clear out In a few seconds we were safe on top of the cave What happened Conseil asked Some new phenomenon Not quite my friends I replied It was the tide merely the tide which wellnigh caught us by surprise just as it did Sir Walter Scott s hero The ocean outside is rising and by a perfectly natural law of balance the level of this lake is also rising We ve gotten off with a mild dunking Let s go change clothes on the Nautilus Three quarters of an hour later we had completed our circular stroll and were back on board Just then the crewmen finished loading the sodium supplies and the Nautilus could have departed immediately But Captain Nemo gave no orders Would he wait for nightfall and exit through his underwater passageway in secrecy Perhaps Be that as it may by the next day the Nautilus had left its home port and was navigating well out from any shore a few meters beneath the waves of the Atlantic CHAPTER eleven The Sargasso Sea THE NAUTILUS didn t change direction For the time being then we had to set aside any hope of returning to European seas Captain Nemo kept his prow pointing south Where was he taking us I was afraid to guess That day the Nautilus crossed an odd part of the Atlantic Ocean No one is unaware of the existence of that great warm water current known by name as the Gulf Stream After emerging from channels off Florida it heads toward Spitzbergen But before entering the Gulf of Mexico near latitude forty four degrees north this current divides into two arms its chief arm makes for the shores of Ireland and Norway while the second flexes southward at the level of the Azores then it hits the coast of Africa sweeps in a long oval and returns to the Caribbean Sea Now then this second arm more accurately a collar forms a ring of warm water around a section of cool tranquil motionless ocean called the Sargasso Sea This is an actual lake in the open Atlantic and the great current s waters take at least three years to circle it Properly speaking the Sargasso Sea covers every submerged part of Atlantis Certain authors have even held that the many weeds strewn over this sea were torn loose from the prairies of that ancient continent But it s more likely that these grasses algae and fucus plants were carried off from the beaches of Europe and America then taken as far as this zone by the Gulf Stream This is one of the reasons why Christopher Columbus assumed the existence of a New World When the ships of that bold investigator arrived in the Sargasso Sea they had great difficulty navigating in the midst of these weeds which much to their crews dismay slowed them down to a halt and they wasted three long weeks crossing this sector Such was the region our Nautilus was visiting just then a genuine prairie a tightly woven carpet of algae gulfweed and bladder wrack so dense and compact a craft s stempost couldn t tear through it without difficulty Accordingly not wanting to entangle his propeller in this weed choked mass Captain Nemo stayed at a depth some meters below the surface of the waves The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word sargazo meaning gulfweed This gulfweed the swimming gulfweed or berry carrier is the chief substance making up this immense shoal And here s why these water plants collect in this placid Atlantic basin according to the expert on the subject Commander Maury author of The Physical Geography of the Sea The explanation he gives seems to entail a set of conditions that everybody knows Now Maury says if bits of cork or chaff or any floating substance be put into a basin and a circular motion be given to the water all the light substances will be found crowding together near the center of the pool where there is the least motion Just such a basin is the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf Stream and the Sargasso Sea is the center of the whirl I share Maury s view and I was able to study the phenomenon in this exclusive setting where ships rarely go Above us huddled among the brown weeds there floated objects originating from all over tree trunks ripped from the Rocky Mountains or the Andes and sent floating down the Amazon or the Mississippi numerous pieces of wreckage remnants of keels or undersides bulwarks staved in and so weighed down with seashells and barnacles they couldn t rise to the surface of the ocean And the passing years will someday bear out Maury s other view that by collecting in this way over the centuries these substances will be turned to stone by the action of the waters and will then form inexhaustible coalfields Valuable reserves prepared by farseeing nature for that time when man will have exhausted his mines on the continents In the midst of this hopelessly tangled fabric of weeds and fucus plants I noted some delightful pink colored star shaped alcyon coral sea anemone trailing the long tresses of their tentacles some green red and blue jellyfish and especially those big rhizostome jellyfish that Cuvier described whose bluish parasols are trimmed with violet festoons We spent the whole day of February twenty two in the Sargasso Sea where fish that dote on marine plants and crustaceans find plenty to eat The next day the ocean resumed its usual appearance From this moment on for nineteen days from February twenty three to March twelve the Nautilus stayed in the middle of the Atlantic hustling us along at a constant speed of one hundred leagues every twenty four hours It was obvious that Captain Nemo wanted to carry out his underwater program and I had no doubt that he intended after doubling Cape Horn to return to the Pacific South Seas So Ned Land had good reason to worry In these wide seas empty of islands it was no longer feasible to jump ship Nor did we have any way to counter Captain Nemo s whims We had no choice but to acquiesce but if we couldn t attain our end through force or cunning I liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion Once this voyage was over might not Captain Nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence Our word of honor which we sincerely would have kept However this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain But how would he receive our demands for freedom At the very outset and in no uncertain terms hadn t he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned on board the Nautilus Wouldn t he see my four month silence as a tacit acceptance of this situation Would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on I weighed all these considerations turned them over in my mind submitted them to Conseil but he was as baffled as I was In short although I m not easily discouraged I realized that my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day especially at a time when Captain Nemo was recklessly racing toward the south Atlantic During those nineteen days just mentioned no unique incidents distinguished our voyage I saw little of the captain He was at work In the library I often found books he had left open especially books on natural history He had thumbed through my work on the great ocean depths and the margins were covered with his notes which sometimes contradicted my theories and formulations But the captain remained content with this method of refining my work and he rarely discussed it with me Sometimes I heard melancholy sounds reverberating from the organ which he played very expressively but only at night in the midst of the most secretive darkness while the Nautilus slumbered in the wilderness of the ocean During this part of our voyage we navigated on the surface of the waves for entire days The sea was nearly deserted A few sailing ships laden for the East Indies were heading toward the Cape of Good Hope One day we were chased by the longboats of a whaling vessel which undoubtedly viewed us as some enormous baleen whale of great value But Captain Nemo didn t want these gallant gentlemen wasting their time and energy so he ended the hunt by diving beneath the waters This incident seemed to fascinate Ned Land intensely I m sure the Canadian was sorry that these fishermen couldn t harpoon our sheet iron cetacean and mortally wound it During this period the fish Conseil and I observed differed little from those we had already studied in other latitudes Chief among them were specimens of that dreadful cartilaginous genus that s divided into three subgenera numbering at least thirty two species striped sharks five meters long the head squat and wider than the body the caudal fin curved the back with seven big black parallel lines running lengthwise then perlon sharks ash gray pierced with seven gill openings furnished with a single dorsal fin placed almost exactly in the middle of the body Some big dogfish also passed by a voracious species of shark if there ever was one With some justice fishermen s yarns aren t to be trusted but here s what a few of them relate Inside the corpse of one of these animals there were found a buffalo head and a whole calf in another two tuna and a sailor in uniform in yet another a soldier with his saber in another finally a horse with its rider In candor none of these sounds like divinely inspired truth But the fact remains that not a single dogfish let itself get caught in the Nautilus s nets so I can t vouch for their voracity Schools of elegant playful dolphin swam alongside for entire days They went in groups of five or six hunting in packs like wolves over the countryside moreover they re just as voracious as dogfish if I can believe a certain Copenhagen professor who says that from one dolphin s stomach he removed thirteen porpoises and fifteen seals True it was a killer whale belonging to the biggest known species whose length sometimes exceeds twenty four feet The family Delphinia numbers ten genera and the dolphins I saw were akin to the genus Delphinorhynchus remarkable for an extremely narrow muzzle four times as long as the cranium Measuring three meters their bodies were black on top underneath a pinkish white strewn with small very scattered spots From these seas I ll also mention some unusual specimens of croakers fish from the order Acanthopterygia family Scienidea Some authors more artistic than scientific claim that these fish are melodious singers that their voices in unison put on concerts unmatched by human choristers I don t say nay but to my regret these croakers didn t serenade us as we passed Finally to conclude Conseil classified a large number of flying fish Nothing could have made a more unusual sight than the marvelous timing with which dolphins hunt these fish Whatever the range of its flight however evasive its trajectory even up and over the Nautilus the hapless flying fish always found a dolphin to welcome it with open mouth These were either flying gurnards or kitelike sea robins whose lips glowed in the dark at night scrawling fiery streaks in the air before plunging into the murky waters like so many shooting stars Our navigating continued under these conditions until March thirteen That day the Nautilus was put to work in some depth sounding experiments that fascinated me deeply By then we had fared nearly thirteen thousand leagues from our starting point in the Pacific high seas Our position fix placed us in latitude forty five degrees thirty seven south and longitude thirty seven degrees fifty three west These were the same waterways where Captain Denham aboard the Herald payed out fourteen thousand meters of sounding line without finding bottom It was here too that Lieutenant Parker aboard the American frigate Congress was unable to reach the underwater soil at fifteen thousand one hundred forty nine meters Captain Nemo decided to take his Nautilus down to the lowest depths in order to double check these different soundings I got ready to record the results of this experiment The panels in the lounge opened and maneuvers began for reaching those strata so prodigiously far removed It was apparently considered out of the question to dive by filling the ballast tanks Perhaps they wouldn t sufficiently increase the Nautilus s specific gravity Moreover in order to come back up it would be necessary to expel the excess water and our pumps might not have been strong enough to overcome the outside pressure Captain Nemo decided to make for the ocean floor by submerging on an appropriately gradual diagonal with the help of his side fins which were set at a forty five degrees angle to the Nautilus s waterline Then the propeller was brought to its maximum speed and its four blades churned the waves with indescribable violence Under this powerful thrust the Nautilus s hull quivered like a resonating chord and the ship sank steadily under the waters Stationed in the lounge the captain and I watched the needle swerving swiftly over the pressure gauge Soon we had gone below the livable zone where most fish reside Some of these animals can thrive only at the surface of seas or rivers but a minority can dwell at fairly great depths Among the latter I observed a species of dogfish called the cow shark that s equipped with six respiratory slits the telescope fish with its enormous eyes the armored gurnard with gray thoracic fins plus black pectoral fins and a breastplate protected by pale red slabs of bone then finally the grenadier living at a depth of twelve hundred meters by that point tolerating a pressure of one hundred twenty atmospheres I asked Captain Nemo if he had observed any fish at more considerable depths Fish Rarely he answered me But given the current state of marine science who are we to presume what do we really know of these depths Just this captain In going toward the ocean s lower strata we know that vegetable life disappears more quickly than animal life We know that moving creatures can still be encountered where water plants no longer grow We know that oysters and pilgrim scallops live in two thousand meters of water and that Admiral McClintock England s hero of the polar seas pulled in a live sea star from a depth of twenty five hundred meters We know that the crew of the Royal Navy s Bulldog fished up a starfish from twenty six twenty fathoms hence from a depth of more than one vertical league Would you still say Captain Nemo that we really know nothing No professor the captain replied I wouldn t be so discourteous Yet I ll ask you to explain how these creatures can live at such depths I explain it on two grounds I replied In the first place because vertical currents which are caused by differences in the water s salinity and density can produce enough motion to sustain the rudimentary lifestyles of sea lilies and starfish True the captain put in In the second place because oxygen is the basis of life and we know that the amount of oxygen dissolved in salt water increases rather than decreases with depth that the pressure in these lower strata helps to concentrate their oxygen content Oho We know that do we Captain Nemo replied in a tone of mild surprise Well professor we have good reason to know it because it s the truth I might add in fact that the air bladders of fish contain more nitrogen than oxygen when these animals are caught at the surface of the water and conversely more oxygen than nitrogen when they re pulled up from the lower depths Which bears out your formulation But let s continue our observations My eyes flew back to the pressure gauge The instrument indicated a depth of six thousand meters Our submergence had been going on for an hour The Nautilus slid downward on its slanting fins still sinking These deserted waters were wonderfully clear with a transparency impossible to convey An hour later we were at thirteen thousand meters about three and a quarter vertical leagues and the ocean floor was nowhere in sight However at fourteen thousand meters I saw blackish peaks rising in the midst of the waters But these summits could have belonged to mountains as high or even higher than the Himalayas or Mt Blanc and the extent of these depths remained incalculable Despite the powerful pressures it was undergoing the Nautilus sank still deeper I could feel its sheet iron plates trembling down to their riveted joins metal bars arched bulkheads groaned the lounge windows seemed to be warping inward under the water s pressure And this whole sturdy mechanism would surely have given way if as its captain had said it weren t capable of resisting like a solid block While grazing these rocky slopes lost under the waters I still spotted some seashells tube worms lively annelid worms from the genus Spirorbis and certain starfish specimens But soon these last representatives of animal life vanished and three vertical leagues down the Nautilus passed below the limits of underwater existence just as an air balloon rises above the breathable zones in the sky We reached a depth of sixteen thousand meters four vertical leagues and by then the Nautilus s plating was tolerating a pressure of sixteen hundred atmospheres in other words sixteen hundred kilograms per each square centimeter on its surface What an experience I exclaimed Traveling these deep regions where no man has ever ventured before Look captain Look at these magnificent rocks these uninhabited caves these last global haunts where life is no longer possible What unheard of scenery and why are we reduced to preserving it only as a memory Would you like Captain Nemo asked me to bring back more than just a memory What do you mean I mean that nothing could be easier than taking a photograph of this underwater region Before I had time to express the surprise this new proposition caused me a camera was carried into the lounge at Captain Nemo s request The liquid setting electrically lit unfolded with perfect clarity through the wide open panels No shadows no blurs thanks to our artificial light Not even sunshine could have been better for our purposes With the thrust of its propeller curbed by the slant of its fins the Nautilus stood still The camera was aimed at the scenery on the ocean floor and in a few seconds we had a perfect negative I attach a print of the positive In it you can view these primordial rocks that have never seen the light of day this nether granite that forms the powerful foundation of our globe the deep caves cut into the stony mass the outlines of incomparable distinctness whose far edges stand out in black as if from the brush of certain Flemish painters In the distance is a mountainous horizon a wondrously undulating line that makes up the background of this landscape The general effect of these smooth rocks is indescribable black polished without moss or other blemish carved into strange shapes sitting firmly on a carpet of sand that sparkled beneath our streams of electric light Meanwhile his photographic operations over Captain Nemo told me Let s go back up professor We mustn t push our luck and expose the Nautilus too long to these pressures Let s go back up I replied Hold on tight Before I had time to realize why the captain made this recommendation I was hurled to the carpet Its fins set vertically its propeller thrown in gear at the captain s signal the Nautilus rose with lightning speed shooting upward like an air balloon into the sky Vibrating resonantly it knifed through the watery mass Not a single detail was visible In four minutes it had cleared the four vertical leagues separating it from the surface of the ocean and after emerging like a flying fish it fell back into the sea making the waves leap to prodigious heights CHAPTER twelve Sperm Whales and Baleen Whales DURING THE NIGHT of March thirteen fourteen the Nautilus resumed its southward heading Once it was abreast of Cape Horn I thought it would strike west of the cape make for Pacific seas and complete its tour of the world It did nothing of the sort and kept moving toward the southernmost regions So where was it bound The pole That was insanity I was beginning to think that the captain s recklessness more than justified Ned Land s worst fears For a good while the Canadian had said nothing more to me about his escape plans He had become less sociable almost sullen I could see how heavily this protracted imprisonment was weighing on him I could feel the anger building in him Whenever he encountered the captain his eyes would flicker with dark fire and I was in constant dread that his natural vehemence would cause him to do something rash That day March fourteen he and Conseil managed to find me in my stateroom I asked them the purpose of their visit To put a simple question to you sir the Canadian answered me Go on Ned How many men do you think are on board the Nautilus I m unable to say my friend It seems to me Ned Land went on that it wouldn t take much of a crew to run a ship like this one Correct I replied Under existing conditions some ten men at the most should be enough to operate it All right the Canadian said then why should there be any more than that Why I answered I stared at Ned Land whose motives were easy to guess Because I said if I can trust my hunches if I truly understand the captain s way of life his Nautilus isn t simply a ship It s meant to be a refuge for people like its commander people who have severed all ties with the shore Perhaps Conseil said but in a nutshell the Nautilus can hold only a certain number of men so couldn t master estimate their maximum How Conseil By calculating it Master is familiar with the ship s capacity hence the amount of air it contains on the other hand master knows how much air each man consumes in the act of breathing and he can compare this data with the fact that the Nautilus must rise to the surface every twenty four hours Conseil didn t finish his sentence but I could easily see what he was driving at I follow you I said But while they re simple to do such calculations can give only a very uncertain figure No problem the Canadian went on insistently Then here s how to calculate it I replied In one hour each man consumes the oxygen contained in one hundred liters of air hence during twenty four hours the oxygen contained in twenty four hundred liters Therefore we must look for the multiple of twenty four hundred liters of air that gives us the amount found in the Nautilus Precisely Conseil said Now then I went on the Nautilus s capacity is fifteen hundred metric tons and that of a ton is one thousand liters so the Nautilus holds one million five hundred thousand liters of air which divided by twenty four hundred I did a quick pencil calculation gives us the quotient of six hundred twenty five Which is tantamount to saying that the air contained in the Nautilus would be exactly enough for six hundred twenty five men over twenty four hours six hundred twenty five Ned repeated But rest assured I added that between passengers seamen or officers we don t total one tenth of that figure Which is still too many for three men Conseil muttered So my poor Ned I can only counsel patience And Conseil replied even more than patience resignation Conseil had said the true word Even so he went on Captain Nemo can t go south forever He ll surely have to stop if only at the Ice Bank and he ll return to the seas of civilization Then it will be time to resume Ned Land s plans The Canadian shook his head passed his hand over his brow made no reply and left us With master s permission I ll make an observation to him Conseil then told me Our poor Ned broods about all the things he can t have He s haunted by his former life He seems to miss everything that s denied us He s obsessed by his old memories and it s breaking his heart We must understand him What does he have to occupy him here Nothing He isn t a scientist like master and he doesn t share our enthusiasm for the sea s wonders He would risk anything just to enter a tavern in his own country To be sure the monotony of life on board must have seemed unbearable to the Canadian who was accustomed to freedom and activity It was a rare event that could excite him That day however a development occurred that reminded him of his happy years as a harpooner Near eleven o clock in the morning while on the surface of the ocean the Nautilus fell in with a herd of baleen whales This encounter didn t surprise me because I knew these animals were being hunted so relentlessly that they took refuge in the ocean basins of the high latitudes In the maritime world and in the realm of geographic exploration whales have played a major role This is the animal that first dragged the Basques in its wake then Asturian Spaniards Englishmen and Dutchmen emboldening them against the ocean s perils and leading them to the ends of the earth Baleen whales like to frequent the southernmost and northernmost seas Old legends even claim that these cetaceans led fishermen to within a mere seven leagues of the North Pole Although this feat is fictitious it will someday come true because it s likely that by hunting whales in the Arctic or Antarctic regions man will finally reach this unknown spot on the globe We were seated on the platform next to a tranquil sea The month of March since it s the equivalent of October in these latitudes was giving us some fine autumn days It was the Canadian on this topic he was never mistaken who sighted a baleen whale on the eastern horizon If you looked carefully you could see its blackish back alternately rise and fall above the waves five miles from the Nautilus Wow Ned Land exclaimed If I were on board a whaler there s an encounter that would be great fun That s one big animal Look how high its blowholes are spouting all that air and steam Damnation Why am I chained to this hunk of sheet iron Why Ned I replied You still aren t over your old fishing urges How could a whale fisherman forget his old trade sir Who could ever get tired of such exciting hunting You ve never fished these seas Ned Never sir Just the northernmost seas equally in the Bering Strait and the Davis Strait So the southern right whale is still unknown to you Until now it s the bowhead whale you ve hunted and it won t risk going past the warm waters of the equator Oh professor what are you feeding me the Canadian answered in a tolerably skeptical tone I m feeding you the facts By thunder In sixty five just two and a half years ago I to whom you speak I myself stepped onto the carcass of a whale near Greenland and its flank still carried the marked harpoon of a whaling ship from the Bering Sea Now I ask you after it had been wounded west of America how could this animal be killed in the east unless it had cleared the equator and doubled Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope I agree with our friend Ned Conseil said and I m waiting to hear how master will reply to him Master will reply my friends that baleen whales are localized according to species within certain seas that they never leave And if one of these animals went from the Bering Strait to the Davis Strait it s quite simply because there s some passageway from the one sea to the other either along the coasts of Canada or Siberia You expect us to fall for that the Canadian asked tipping me a wink If master says so Conseil replied Which means the Canadian went on since I ve never fished these waterways I don t know the whales that frequent them That s what I ve been telling you Ned All the more reason to get to know them Conseil answered Look Look the Canadian exclaimed his voice full of excitement It s approaching It s coming toward us It s thumbing its nose at me It knows I can t do a blessed thing to it Ned stamped his foot Brandishing an imaginary harpoon his hands positively trembled These cetaceans he asked are they as big as the ones in the northernmost seas Pretty nearly Ned Because I ve seen big baleen whales sir whales measuring up to one hundred feet long I ve even heard that those rorqual whales off the Aleutian Islands sometimes get over one hundred fifty feet That strikes me as exaggerated I replied Those animals are only members of the genus Balaenoptera furnished with dorsal fins and like sperm whales they re generally smaller than the bowhead whale Oh exclaimed the Canadian whose eyes hadn t left the ocean It s getting closer it s coming into the Nautilus s waters Then going on with his conversation You talk about sperm whales he said as if they were little beasts But there are stories of gigantic sperm whales They re shrewd cetaceans I hear that some will cover themselves with algae and fucus plants People mistake them for islets They pitch camp on top make themselves at home light a fire Build houses Conseil said Yes funny man Ned Land replied Then one fine day the animal dives and drags all its occupants down into the depths Like in the voyages of Sinbad the Sailor I answered laughing Oh mister Land you re addicted to tall tales What sperm whales you re handing us I hope you don t really believe in them mister Naturalist the Canadian replied in all seriousness when it comes to whales you can believe anything Look at that one move Look at it stealing away People claim these animals can circle around the world in just fifteen days I don t say nay But what you undoubtedly don t know Professor Aronnax is that at the beginning of the world whales traveled even quicker Oh really Ned And why so Because in those days their tails moved side to side like those on fish in other words their tails were straight up thrashing the water from left to right right to left But spotting that they swam too fast our Creator twisted their tails and ever since they ve been thrashing the waves up and down at the expense of their speed Fine Ned I said then resurrected one of the Canadian s expressions You expect us to fall for that Not too terribly Ned Land replied and no more than if I told you there are whales that are three hundred feet long and weigh one million pounds That s indeed considerable I said But you must admit that certain cetaceans do grow to significant size since they re said to supply as much as one hundred twenty metric tons of oil That I ve seen the Canadian said I can easily believe it Ned just as I can believe that certain baleen whales equal one hundred elephants in bulk Imagine the impact of such a mass if it were launched at full speed Is it true Conseil asked that they can sink ships Ships I doubt it I replied However they say that in eighteen twenty right in these southern seas a baleen whale rushed at the Essex and pushed it backward at a speed of four meters per second Its stern was flooded and the Essex went down fast Ned looked at me with a bantering expression Speaking for myself he said I once got walloped by a whale s tail in my longboat needless to say My companions and I were launched to an altitude of six meters But next to the professor s whale mine was just a baby Do these animals live a long time Conseil asked A thousand years the Canadian replied without hesitation And how Ned I asked do you know that s so Because people say so And why do people say so Because people know so No Ned People don t know so they suppose so and here s the logic with which they back up their beliefs When fishermen first hunted whales four hundred years ago these animals grew to bigger sizes than they do today Reasonably enough it s assumed that today s whales are smaller because they haven t had time to reach their full growth That s why the Count de Buffon s encyclopedia says that cetaceans can live and even must live for a thousand years You understand Ned Land didn t understand He no longer even heard me That baleen whale kept coming closer His eyes devoured it Oh he exclaimed It s not just one whale it s ten twenty a whole gam And I can t do a thing I m tied hand and foot But Ned my friend Conseil said why not ask Captain Nemo for permission to hunt Before Conseil could finish his sentence Ned Land scooted down the hatch and ran to look for the captain A few moments later the two of them reappeared on the platform Captain Nemo observed the herd of cetaceans cavorting on the waters a mile from the Nautilus They re southern right whales he said There goes the fortune of a whole whaling fleet Well sir the Canadian asked couldn t I hunt them just so I don t forget my old harpooning trade Hunt them What for Captain Nemo replied Simply to destroy them We have no use for whale oil on this ship But sir the Canadian went on in the Red Sea you authorized us to chase a dugong There it was an issue of obtaining fresh meat for my crew Here it would be killing for the sake of killing I m well aware that s a privilege reserved for mankind but I don t allow such murderous pastimes When your peers mister Land destroy decent harmless creatures like the southern right whale or the bowhead whale they commit a reprehensible offense Thus they ve already depopulated all of Baffin Bay and they ll wipe out a whole class of useful animals So leave these poor cetaceans alone They have quite enough natural enemies such as sperm whales swordfish and sawfish without you meddling with them I ll let the reader decide what faces the Canadian made during this lecture on hunting ethics Furnishing such arguments to a professional harpooner was a waste of words Ned Land stared at Captain Nemo and obviously missed his meaning But the captain was right Thanks to the mindless barbaric bloodthirstiness of fishermen the last baleen whale will someday disappear from the ocean Ned Land whistled Yankee Doodle between his teeth stuffed his hands in his pockets and turned his back on us Meanwhile Captain Nemo studied the herd of cetaceans then addressed me I was right to claim that baleen whales have enough natural enemies without counting man These specimens will soon have to deal with mighty opponents Eight miles to leeward Professor Aronnax can you see those blackish specks moving about Yes captain I replied Those are sperm whales dreadful animals that I ve sometimes encountered in herds of two hundred or three hundred As for them they re cruel destructive beasts and they deserve to be exterminated The Canadian turned swiftly at these last words Well captain I said on behalf of the baleen whales there s still time It s pointless to run any risks professor The Nautilus will suffice to disperse these sperm whales It s armed with a steel spur quite equal to mister Land s harpoon I imagine The Canadian didn t even bother shrugging his shoulders Attacking cetaceans with thrusts from a spur Who ever heard of such malarkey Wait and see Professor Aronnax Captain Nemo said We ll show you a style of hunting with which you aren t yet familiar We ll take no pity on these ferocious cetaceans They re merely mouth and teeth Mouth and teeth There s no better way to describe the long skulled sperm whale whose length sometimes exceeds twenty five meters The enormous head of this cetacean occupies about a third of its body Better armed than a baleen whale whose upper jaw is adorned solely with whalebone the sperm whale is equipped with twenty five huge teeth that are twenty centimeters high have cylindrical conical summits and weigh two pounds each In the top part of this enormous head inside big cavities separated by cartilage you ll find three hundred to four hundred kilograms of that valuable oil called spermaceti The sperm whale is an awkward animal more tadpole than fish as Professor Fredol has noted It s poorly constructed being defective so to speak over the whole left side of its frame with good eyesight only in its right eye Meanwhile that monstrous herd kept coming closer It had seen the baleen whales and was preparing to attack You could tell in advance that the sperm whales would be victorious not only because they were better built for fighting than their harmless adversaries but also because they could stay longer underwater before returning to breathe at the surface There was just time to run to the rescue of the baleen whales The Nautilus proceeded to midwater Conseil Ned and I sat in front of the lounge windows Captain Nemo made his way to the helmsman s side to operate his submersible as an engine of destruction Soon I felt the beats of our propeller getting faster and we picked up speed The battle between sperm whales and baleen whales had already begun when the Nautilus arrived It maneuvered to cut into the herd of long skulled predators At first the latter showed little concern at the sight of this new monster meddling in the battle But they soon had to sidestep its thrusts What a struggle Ned Land quickly grew enthusiastic and even ended up applauding Brandished in its captain s hands the Nautilus was simply a fearsome harpoon He hurled it at those fleshy masses and ran them clean through leaving behind two squirming animal halves As for those daunting strokes of the tail hitting our sides the ship never felt them No more than the collisions it caused One sperm whale exterminated it ran at another tacked on the spot so as not to miss its prey went ahead or astern obeyed its rudder dived when the cetacean sank to deeper strata rose with it when it returned to the surface struck it head on or slantwise hacked at it or tore it and from every direction and at any speed skewered it with its dreadful spur What bloodshed What a hubbub on the surface of the waves What sharp hisses and snorts unique to these frightened animals Their tails churned the normally peaceful strata into actual billows This Homeric slaughter dragged on for an hour and the long skulled predators couldn t get away Several times ten or twelve of them teamed up trying to crush the Nautilus with their sheer mass Through the windows you could see their enormous mouths paved with teeth their fearsome eyes Losing all self control Ned Land hurled threats and insults at them You could feel them clinging to the submersible like hounds atop a wild boar in the underbrush But by forcing the pace of its propeller the Nautilus carried them off dragged them under or brought them back to the upper level of the waters untroubled by their enormous weight or their powerful grip Finally this mass of sperm whales thinned out The waves grew tranquil again I felt us rising to the surface of the ocean The hatch opened and we rushed onto the platform The sea was covered with mutilated corpses A fearsome explosion couldn t have slashed torn or shredded these fleshy masses with greater violence We were floating in the midst of gigantic bodies bluish on the back whitish on the belly and all deformed by enormous protuberances A few frightened sperm whales were fleeing toward the horizon The waves were dyed red over an area of several miles and the Nautilus was floating in the middle of a sea of blood Captain Nemo rejoined us Well mister Land he said Well sir replied the Canadian whose enthusiasm had subsided it s a dreadful sight for sure But I m a hunter not a butcher and this is plain butchery It was a slaughter of destructive animals the captain replied and the Nautilus is no butcher knife I prefer my harpoon the Canadian answered To each his own the captain replied staring intently at Ned Land I was in dread the latter would give way to some violent outburst that might have had deplorable consequences But his anger was diverted by the sight of a baleen whale that the Nautilus had pulled alongside of just then This animal had been unable to escape the teeth of those sperm whales I recognized the southern right whale its head squat its body dark all over Anatomically it s distinguished from the white whale and the black right whale by the fusion of its seven cervical vertebrae and it numbers two more ribs than its relatives Floating on its side its belly riddled with bites the poor cetacean was dead Still hanging from the tip of its mutilated fin was a little baby whale that it had been unable to rescue from the slaughter Its open mouth let water flow through its whalebone like a murmuring surf Captain Nemo guided the Nautilus next to the animal s corpse Two of his men climbed onto the whale s flank and to my astonishment I saw them draw from its udders all the milk they held in other words enough to fill two or three casks The captain offered me a cup of this still warm milk I couldn t help showing my distaste for such a beverage He assured me that this milk was excellent no different from cow s milk I sampled it and agreed So this milk was a worthwhile reserve ration for us because in the form of salt butter or cheese it would provide a pleasant change of pace from our standard fare From that day on I noted with some uneasiness that Ned Land s attitudes toward Captain Nemo grew worse and worse and I decided to keep a close watch on the Canadian s movements and activities CHAPTER thirteen The Ice Bank THE NAUTILUS resumed its unruffled southbound heading It went along the fiftieth meridian with considerable speed Would it go to the pole I didn t think so because every previous attempt to reach this spot on the globe had failed Besides the season was already quite advanced since March thirteen on Antarctic shores corresponds with September thirteen in the northernmost regions which marks the beginning of the equinoctial period On March fourteen at latitude fifty five degrees I spotted floating ice plain pale bits of rubble twenty to twenty five feet long which formed reefs over which the sea burst into foam The Nautilus stayed on the surface of the ocean Having fished in the Arctic seas Ned Land was already familiar with the sight of icebergs Conseil and I were marveling at them for the first time In the sky toward the southern horizon there stretched a dazzling white band English whalers have given this the name ice blink No matter how heavy the clouds may be they can t obscure this phenomenon It announces the presence of a pack or shoal of ice Indeed larger blocks of ice soon appeared their brilliance varying at the whim of the mists Some of these masses displayed green veins as if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate Others looked like enormous amethysts letting the light penetrate their insides The latter reflected the sun s rays from the thousand facets of their crystals The former tinted with a bright limestone sheen would have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble town The farther down south we went the more these floating islands grew in numbers and prominence Polar birds nested on them by the thousands These were petrels cape pigeons or puffins and their calls were deafening Mistaking the Nautilus for the corpse of a whale some of them alighted on it and prodded its resonant sheet iron with pecks of their beaks During this navigating in the midst of the ice Captain Nemo often stayed on the platform He observed these deserted waterways carefully I saw his calm eyes sometimes perk up In these polar seas forbidden to man did he feel right at home the lord of these unreachable regions Perhaps But he didn t say He stood still reviving only when his pilot s instincts took over Then steering his Nautilus with consummate dexterity he skillfully dodged the masses of ice some of which measured several miles in length their heights varying from seventy to eighty meters Often the horizon seemed completely closed off Abreast of latitude sixty degrees every passageway had disappeared Searching with care Captain Nemo soon found a narrow opening into which he brazenly slipped well aware however that it would close behind him Guided by his skillful hands the Nautilus passed by all these different masses of ice which are classified by size and shape with a precision that enraptured Conseil icebergs or mountains ice fields or smooth limitless tracts drift ice or floating floes packs or broken tracts called patches when they re circular and streams when they form long strips The temperature was fairly low Exposed to the outside air the thermometer marked two degrees to three degrees centigrade But we were warmly dressed in furs for which seals and aquatic bears had paid the price Evenly heated by all its electric equipment the Nautilus s interior defied the most intense cold Moreover to find a bearable temperature the ship had only to sink just a few meters beneath the waves Two months earlier we would have enjoyed perpetual daylight in this latitude but night already fell for three or four hours and later it would cast six months of shadow over these circumpolar regions On March fifteen we passed beyond the latitude of the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands The captain told me that many tribes of seals used to inhabit these shores but English and American whalers in a frenzy of destruction slaughtered all the adults including pregnant females and where life and activity once existed those fishermen left behind only silence and death Going along the fifty fifth meridian the Nautilus cut the Antarctic Circle on March sixteen near eight o clock in the morning Ice completely surrounded us and closed off the horizon Nevertheless Captain Nemo went from passageway to passageway always proceeding south But where s he going I asked Straight ahead Conseil replied Ultimately when he can t go any farther he ll stop I wouldn t bet on it I replied And in all honesty I confess that this venturesome excursion was far from displeasing to me I can t express the intensity of my amazement at the beauties of these new regions The ice struck superb poses Here its general effect suggested an oriental town with countless minarets and mosques There a city in ruins flung to the ground by convulsions in the earth These views were varied continuously by the sun s oblique rays or were completely swallowed up by gray mists in the middle of blizzards Then explosions cave ins and great iceberg somersaults would occur all around us altering the scenery like the changing landscape in a diorama If the Nautilus was submerged during these losses of balance we heard the resulting noises spread under the waters with frightful intensity and the collapse of these masses created daunting eddies down to the ocean s lower strata The Nautilus then rolled and pitched like a ship left to the fury of the elements Often no longer seeing any way out I thought we were imprisoned for good but Captain Nemo guided by his instincts discovered new passageways from the tiniest indications He was never wrong when he observed slender threads of bluish water streaking through these ice fields Accordingly I was sure that he had already risked his Nautilus in the midst of the Antarctic seas However during the day of March sixteen these tracts of ice completely barred our path It wasn t the Ice Bank as yet just huge ice fields cemented together by the cold This obstacle couldn t stop Captain Nemo and he launched his ship against the ice fields with hideous violence The Nautilus went into these brittle masses like a wedge splitting them with dreadful cracklings It was an old fashioned battering ram propelled with infinite power Hurled aloft ice rubble fell back around us like hail Through brute force alone the submersible carved out a channel for itself Carried away by its momentum the ship sometimes mounted on top of these tracts of ice and crushed them with its weight or at other times when cooped up beneath the ice fields it split them with simple pitching movements creating wide punctures Violent squalls assaulted us during the daytime Thanks to certain heavy mists we couldn t see from one end of the platform to the other The wind shifted abruptly to every point on the compass The snow was piling up in such packed layers it had to be chipped loose with blows from picks Even in a temperature of merely five degrees centigrade every outside part of the Nautilus was covered with ice A ship s rigging would have been unusable because all its tackle would have jammed in the grooves of the pulleys Only a craft without sails driven by an electric motor that needed no coal could face such high latitudes Under these conditions the barometer generally stayed quite low It fell as far as seventy three point five centimeters Our compass indications no longer offered any guarantees The deranged needles would mark contradictory directions as we approached the southern magnetic pole which doesn t coincide with the South Pole proper In fact according to the astronomer Hansteen this magnetic pole is located fairly close to latitude seventy degrees and longitude one hundred thirty degrees or abiding by the observations of Louis Isidore Duperrey in longitude one hundred thirty five degrees and latitude seventy degrees thirty Hence we had to transport compasses to different parts of the ship take many readings and strike an average Often we could chart our course only by guesswork a less than satisfactory method in the midst of these winding passageways whose landmarks change continuously At last on March eighteen after twenty futile assaults the Nautilus was decisively held in check No longer was it an ice stream patch or field it was an endless immovable barrier formed by ice mountains fused to each other The Ice Bank the Canadian told me For Ned Land as well as for every navigator before us I knew that this was the great insurmountable obstacle When the sun appeared for an instant near noon Captain Nemo took a reasonably accurate sight that gave our position as longitude fifty one degrees thirty and latitude sixty seven degrees thirty nine south This was a position already well along in these Antarctic regions As for the liquid surface of the sea there was no longer any semblance of it before our eyes Before the Nautilus s spur there lay vast broken plains a tangle of confused chunks with all the helter skelter unpredictability typical of a river s surface a short while before its ice breakup but in this case the proportions were gigantic Here and there stood sharp peaks lean spires that rose as high as two hundred feet farther off a succession of steeply cut cliffs sporting a grayish tint huge mirrors that reflected the sparse rays of a sun half drowned in mist Beyond a stark silence reigned in this desolate natural setting a silence barely broken by the flapping wings of petrels or puffins By this point everything was frozen even sound So the Nautilus had to halt in its venturesome course among these tracts of ice Sir Ned Land told me that day if your captain goes any farther Yes He ll be a superman How so Ned Because nobody can clear the Ice Bank Your captain s a powerful man but damnation he isn t more powerful than nature If she draws a boundary line there you stop like it or not Correct Ned Land but I still want to know what s behind this Ice Bank Behold my greatest source of irritation a wall Master is right Conseil said Walls were invented simply to frustrate scientists All walls should be banned Fine the Canadian put in But we already know what s behind this Ice Bank What I asked Ice ice and more ice You may be sure of that Ned I answered but I m not That s why I want to see for myself Well professor the Canadian replied you can just drop that idea You ve made it to the Ice Bank which is already far enough but you won t get any farther neither your Captain Nemo or his Nautilus And whether he wants to or not we ll head north again in other words to the land of sensible people I had to agree that Ned Land was right and until ships are built to navigate over tracts of ice they ll have to stop at the Ice Bank Indeed despite its efforts despite the powerful methods it used to split this ice the Nautilus was reduced to immobility Ordinarily when someone can t go any farther he still has the option of returning in his tracks But here it was just as impossible to turn back as to go forward because every passageway had closed behind us and if our submersible remained even slightly stationary it would be frozen in without delay Which is exactly what happened near two o clock in the afternoon and fresh ice kept forming over the ship s sides with astonishing speed I had to admit that Captain Nemo s leadership had been most injudicious Just then I was on the platform Observing the situation for some while the captain said to me Well professor What think you I think we re trapped captain Trapped What do you mean I mean we can t go forward backward or sideways I think that s the standard definition of trapped at least in the civilized world So Professor Aronnax you think the Nautilus won t be able to float clear Only with the greatest difficulty captain since the season is already too advanced for you to depend on an ice breakup Oh professor Captain Nemo replied in an ironic tone you never change You see only impediments and obstacles I promise you not only will the Nautilus float clear it will go farther still Farther south I asked gaping at the captain Yes sir it will go to the pole To the pole I exclaimed unable to keep back a movement of disbelief Yes the captain replied coolly the Antarctic pole that unknown spot crossed by every meridian on the globe As you know I do whatever I like with my Nautilus Yes I did know that I knew this man was daring to the point of being foolhardy But to overcome all the obstacles around the South Pole even more unattainable than the North Pole which still hadn t been reached by the boldest navigators wasn t this an absolutely insane undertaking one that could occur only in the brain of a madman It then dawned on me to ask Captain Nemo if he had already discovered this pole which no human being had ever trod underfoot No sir he answered me but we ll discover it together Where others have failed I ll succeed Never before has my Nautilus cruised so far into these southernmost seas but I repeat it will go farther still I d like to believe you captain I went on in a tone of some sarcasm Oh I do believe you Let s forge ahead There are no obstacles for us Let s shatter this Ice Bank Let s blow it up and if it still resists let s put wings on the Nautilus and fly over it Over it professor Captain Nemo replied serenely No not over it but under it Under it I exclaimed A sudden insight into Captain Nemo s plans had just flashed through my mind I understood The marvelous talents of his Nautilus would be put to work once again in this superhuman undertaking I can see we re starting to understand each other professor Captain Nemo told me with a half smile You already glimpse the potential myself I d say the success of this attempt Maneuvers that aren t feasible for an ordinary ship are easy for the Nautilus If a continent emerges at the pole we ll stop at that continent But on the other hand if open sea washes the pole we ll go to that very place Right I said carried away by the captain s logic Even though the surface of the sea has solidified into ice its lower strata are still open thanks to that divine justice that puts the maximum density of salt water one degree above its freezing point And if I m not mistaken the submerged part of this Ice Bank is in a four to one ratio to its emerging part Very nearly professor For each foot of iceberg above the sea there are three more below Now then since these ice mountains don t exceed a height of one hundred meters they sink only to a depth of three hundred meters And what are three hundred meters to the Nautilus A mere nothing sir We could even go to greater depths and find that temperature layer common to all ocean water and there we d brave with impunity the thirty degrees or forty degrees cold on the surface True sir very true I replied with growing excitement Our sole difficulty Captain Nemo went on lies in our staying submerged for several days without renewing our air supply That s all I answered The Nautilus has huge air tanks we ll fill them up and they ll supply all the oxygen we need Good thinking Professor Aronnax the captain replied with a smile But since I don t want to be accused of foolhardiness I m giving you all my objections in advance You have more Just one If a sea exists at the South Pole it s possible this sea may be completely frozen over so we couldn t come up to the surface My dear sir have you forgotten that the Nautilus is armed with a fearsome spur Couldn t it be launched diagonally against those tracts of ice which would break open from the impact Ah professor you re full of ideas today Besides captain I added with still greater enthusiasm why wouldn t we find open sea at the South Pole just as at the North Pole The cold temperature poles and the geographical poles don t coincide in either the northern or southern hemispheres and until proof to the contrary we can assume these two spots on the earth feature either a continent or an ice free ocean I think as you do Professor Aronnax Captain Nemo replied I ll only point out that after raising so many objections against my plan you re now crushing me under arguments in its favor Captain Nemo was right I was outdoing him in daring It was I who was sweeping him to the pole I was leading the way I was out in front but no you silly fool Captain Nemo already knew the pros and cons of this question and it amused him to see you flying off into impossible fantasies Nevertheless he didn t waste an instant At his signal the chief officer appeared The two men held a quick exchange in their incomprehensible language and either the chief officer had been alerted previously or he found the plan feasible because he showed no surprise But as unemotional as he was he couldn t have been more impeccably emotionless than Conseil when I told the fine lad our intention of pushing on to the South Pole He greeted my announcement with the usual As master wishes and I had to be content with that As for Ned Land no human shoulders ever executed a higher shrug than the pair belonging to our Canadian Honestly sir he told me You and your Captain Nemo I pity you both But we will go to the pole mister Land Maybe but you won t come back And Ned Land reentered his cabin to keep from doing something desperate he said as he left me Meanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way The Nautilus s powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and stored it under high pressure Near four o clock Captain Nemo informed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed I took a last look at the dense Ice Bank we were going to conquer The weather was fair the skies reasonably clear the cold quite brisk namely twelve degrees centigrade but after the wind had lulled this temperature didn t seem too unbearable Equipped with picks some ten men climbed onto the Nautilus s sides and cracked loose the ice around the ship s lower plating which was soon set free This operation was swiftly executed because the fresh ice was still thin We all reentered the interior The main ballast tanks were filled with the water that hadn t yet congealed at our line of flotation The Nautilus submerged without delay I took a seat in the lounge with Conseil Through the open window we stared at the lower strata of this southernmost ocean The thermometer rose again The needle on the pressure gauge swerved over its dial About three hundred meters down just as Captain Nemo had predicted we cruised beneath the undulating surface of the Ice Bank But the Nautilus sank deeper still It reached a depth of eight hundred meters At the surface this water gave a temperature of twelve degrees centigrade but now it gave no more than ten degrees Two degrees had already been gained Thanks to its heating equipment the Nautilus s temperature needless to say stayed at a much higher degree Every maneuver was accomplished with extraordinary precision With all due respect to master Conseil told me we ll pass it by I fully expect to I replied in a tone of deep conviction Now in open water the Nautilus took a direct course to the pole without veering from the fifty second meridian From sixty seven degrees thirty to ninety degrees twenty two and a half degrees of latitude were left to cross in other words slightly more than five hundred leagues The Nautilus adopted an average speed of twenty six miles per hour the speed of an express train If it kept up this pace forty hours would do it for reaching the pole For part of the night the novelty of our circumstances kept Conseil and me at the lounge window The sea was lit by our beacon s electric rays But the depths were deserted Fish didn t linger in these imprisoned waters Here they found merely a passageway for going from the Antarctic Ocean to open sea at the pole Our progress was swift You could feel it in the vibrations of the long steel hull Near two o clock in the morning I went to snatch a few hours of sleep Conseil did likewise I didn t encounter Captain Nemo while going down the gangways I assumed that he was keeping to the pilothouse The next day March nineteen at five o clock in the morning I was back at my post in the lounge The electric log indicated that the Nautilus had reduced speed By then it was rising to the surface but cautiously while slowly emptying its ballast tanks My heart was pounding Would we emerge into the open and find the polar air again No A jolt told me that the Nautilus had bumped the underbelly of the Ice Bank still quite thick to judge from the hollowness of the accompanying noise Indeed we had struck bottom to use nautical terminology but in the opposite direction and at a depth of three thousand feet That gave us four thousand feet of ice overhead of which one thousand feet emerged above water So the Ice Bank was higher here than we had found it on the outskirts A circumstance less than encouraging Several times that day the Nautilus repeated the same experiment and always it bumped against this surface that formed a ceiling above it At certain moments the ship encountered ice at a depth of nine hundred meters denoting a thickness of twelve hundred meters of which three hundred meters rose above the level of the ocean This height had tripled since the moment the Nautilus had dived beneath the waves I meticulously noted these different depths obtaining the underwater profile of this upside down mountain chain that stretched beneath the sea By evening there was still no improvement in our situation The ice stayed between four hundred and five hundred meters deep It was obviously shrinking but what a barrier still lay between us and the surface of the ocean By then it was eight o clock The air inside the Nautilus should have been renewed four hours earlier following daily practice on board But I didn t suffer very much although Captain Nemo hadn t yet made demands on the supplementary oxygen in his air tanks That night my sleep was fitful Hope and fear besieged me by turns I got up several times The Nautilus continued groping Near three o clock in the morning I observed that we encountered the Ice Bank s underbelly at a depth of only fifty meters So only one hundred fifty feet separated us from the surface of the water Little by little the Ice Bank was turning into an ice field again The mountains were changing back into plains My eyes didn t leave the pressure gauge We kept rising on a diagonal going along this shiny surface that sparkled beneath our electric rays Above and below the Ice Bank was subsiding in long gradients Mile after mile it was growing thinner Finally at six o clock in the morning on that memorable day of March nineteen the lounge door opened Captain Nemo appeared Open sea he told me CHAPTER fourteen The South Pole I RUSHED UP onto the platform Yes open sea Barely a few sparse floes some moving icebergs a sea stretching into the distance hosts of birds in the air and myriads of fish under the waters which varied from intense blue to olive green depending on the depth The thermometer marked three degrees centigrade It was as if a comparative springtime had been locked up behind that Ice Bank whose distant masses were outlined on the northern horizon Are we at the pole I asked the captain my heart pounding I ve no idea he answered me At noon we ll fix our position But will the sun show through this mist I said staring at the grayish sky No matter how faintly it shines it will be enough for me the captain replied To the south ten miles from the Nautilus a solitary islet rose to a height of two hundred meters We proceeded toward it but cautiously because this sea could have been strewn with reefs In an hour we had reached the islet Two hours later we had completed a full circle around it It measured four to five miles in circumference A narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore perhaps a continent whose limits we couldn t see The existence of this shore seemed to bear out Commander Maury s hypotheses In essence this ingenious American has noted that between the South Pole and the sixtieth parallel the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north Atlantic From this fact he drew the conclusion that the Antarctic Circle must contain considerable shores since icebergs can t form on the high seas but only along coastlines According to his calculations this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach four thousand kilometers Meanwhile to avoid running aground the Nautilus halted three cable lengths from a strand crowned by superb piles of rocks The skiff was launched to sea Two crewmen carrying instruments the captain Conseil and I were on board It was ten o clock in the morning I hadn t seen Ned Land No doubt in the presence of the South Pole the Canadian hated having to eat his words A few strokes of the oar brought the skiff to the sand where it ran aground Just as Conseil was about to jump ashore I held him back Sir I told Captain Nemo to you belongs the honor of first setting foot on this shore Yes sir the captain replied and if I have no hesitation in treading this polar soil it s because no human being until now has left a footprint here So saying he leaped lightly onto the sand His heart must have been throbbing with intense excitement He scaled an overhanging rock that ended in a small promontory and there mute and motionless with crossed arms and blazing eyes he seemed to be laying claim to these southernmost regions After spending five minutes in this trance he turned to us Whenever you re ready sir he called to me I got out Conseil at my heels leaving the two men in the skiff Over an extensive area the soil consisted of that igneous gravel called tuff reddish in color as if made from crushed bricks The ground was covered with slag lava flows and pumice stones Its volcanic origin was unmistakable In certain localities thin smoke holes gave off a sulfurous odor showing that the inner fires still kept their wide ranging power Nevertheless when I scaled a high escarpment I could see no volcanoes within a radius of several miles In these Antarctic districts as is well known Sir James Clark Ross had found the craters of Mt Erebus and Mt Terror in fully active condition on the one hundred and sixty seventh meridian at latitude seventy seven degrees thirty two The vegetation on this desolate continent struck me as quite limited A few lichens of the species Usnea melanoxanthra sprawled over the black rocks The whole meager flora of this region consisted of certain microscopic buds rudimentary diatoms made up of a type of cell positioned between two quartz rich shells plus long purple and crimson fucus plants buoyed by small air bladders and washed up on the coast by the surf The beach was strewn with mollusks small mussels limpets smooth heart shaped cockles and especially some sea butterflies with oblong membrane filled bodies whose heads are formed from two rounded lobes I also saw myriads of those northernmost sea butterflies three centimeters long which a baleen whale can swallow by the thousands in one gulp The open waters at the shoreline were alive with these delightful pteropods true butterflies of the sea Among other zoophytes present in these shallows there were a few coral tree forms that according to Sir James Clark Ross live in these Antarctic seas at depths as great as one thousand meters then small alcyon coral belonging to the species Procellaria pelagica also a large number of starfish unique to these climes plus some feather stars spangling the sand But it was in the air that life was superabundant There various species of birds flew and fluttered by the thousands deafening us with their calls Crowding the rocks other fowl watched without fear as we passed and pressed familiarly against our feet These were auks as agile and supple in water where they are sometimes mistaken for fast bonito as they are clumsy and heavy on land They uttered outlandish calls and participated in numerous public assemblies that featured much noise but little action Among other fowl I noted some sheathbills from the wading bird family the size of pigeons white in color the beak short and conical the eyes framed by red circles Conseil laid in a supply of them because when they re properly cooked these winged creatures make a pleasant dish In the air there passed sooty albatross with four meter wingspans birds aptly dubbed vultures of the ocean also gigantic petrels including several with arching wings enthusiastic eaters of seal that are known as quebrantahuesos and cape pigeons a sort of small duck the tops of their bodies black and white in short a whole series of petrels some whitish with wings trimmed in brown others blue and exclusive to these Antarctic seas the former so oily I told Conseil that inhabitants of the Faroe Islands simply fit the bird with a wick then light it up Spanish ospreys Ed With that minor addition Conseil replied these fowl would make perfect lamps After this we should insist that nature equip them with wicks in advance Half a mile farther on the ground was completely riddled with penguin nests egg laying burrows from which numerous birds emerged Later Captain Nemo had hundreds of them hunted because their black flesh is highly edible They brayed like donkeys The size of a goose with slate colored bodies white undersides and lemon colored neck bands these animals let themselves be stoned to death without making any effort to get away Meanwhile the mists didn t clear and by eleven o clock the sun still hadn t made an appearance Its absence disturbed me Without it no sights were possible Then how could we tell whether we had reached the pole When I rejoined Captain Nemo I found him leaning silently against a piece of rock and staring at the sky He seemed impatient baffled But what could we do This daring and powerful man couldn t control the sun as he did the sea Noon arrived without the orb of day appearing for a single instant You couldn t even find its hiding place behind the curtain of mist And soon this mist began to condense into snow Until tomorrow the captain said simply and we went back to the Nautilus amid flurries in the air During our absence the nets had been spread and I observed with fascination the fish just hauled on board The Antarctic seas serve as a refuge for an extremely large number of migratory fish that flee from storms in the subpolar zones in truth only to slide down the gullets of porpoises and seals I noted some one decimeter southern bullhead a species of whitish cartilaginous fish overrun with bluish gray stripes and armed with stings then some Antarctic rabbitfish three feet long the body very slender the skin a smooth silver white the head rounded the topside furnished with three fins the snout ending in a trunk that curved back toward the mouth I sampled its flesh but found it tasteless despite Conseil s views which were largely approving The blizzard lasted until the next day It was impossible to stay on the platform From the lounge where I was writing up the incidents of this excursion to the polar continent I could hear the calls of petrel and albatross cavorting in the midst of the turmoil The Nautilus didn t stay idle and cruising along the coast it advanced some ten miles farther south amid the half light left by the sun as it skimmed the edge of the horizon The next day March twenty it stopped snowing The cold was a little more brisk The thermometer marked two degrees centigrade The mist had cleared and on that day I hoped our noon sights could be accomplished Since Captain Nemo hadn t yet appeared only Conseil and I were taken ashore by the skiff The soil s nature was still the same volcanic Traces of lava slag and basaltic rock were everywhere but I couldn t find the crater that had vomited them up There as yonder myriads of birds enlivened this part of the polar continent But they had to share their dominion with huge herds of marine mammals that looked at us with gentle eyes These were seals of various species some stretched out on the ground others lying on drifting ice floes several leaving or reentering the sea Having never dealt with man they didn t run off at our approach and I counted enough of them thereabouts to provision a couple hundred ships Ye gods Conseil said it s fortunate that Ned Land didn t come with us Why so Conseil Because that madcap hunter would kill every animal here Every animal may be overstating it but in truth I doubt we could keep our Canadian friend from harpooning some of these magnificent cetaceans Which would be an affront to Captain Nemo since he hates to slay harmless beasts needlessly He s right Certainly Conseil But tell me haven t you finished classifying these superb specimens of marine fauna Master is well aware Conseil replied that I m not seasoned in practical application When master has told me these animals names They re seals and walruses Two genera our scholarly Conseil hastened to say that belong to the family Pinnipedia order Carnivora group Unguiculata subclass Monodelphia class Mammalia branch Vertebrata Very nice Conseil I replied but these two genera of seals and walruses are each divided into species and if I m not mistaken we now have a chance to actually look at them Let s It was eight o clock in the morning We had four hours to ourselves before the sun could be productively observed I guided our steps toward a huge bay that made a crescent shaped incision in the granite cliffs along the beach There all about us I swear that the shores and ice floes were crowded with marine mammals as far as the eye could see and I involuntarily looked around for old Proteus that mythological shepherd who guarded King Neptune s immense flocks To be specific these were seals They formed distinct male and female groups the father watching over his family the mother suckling her little ones the stronger youngsters emancipated a few paces away When these mammals wanted to relocate they moved in little jumps made by contracting their bodies clumsily helped by their imperfectly developed flippers which as with their manatee relatives form actual forearms In the water their ideal element I must say these animals swim wonderfully thanks to their flexible backbones narrow pelvises close cropped hair and webbed feet Resting on shore they assumed extremely graceful positions Consequently their gentle features their sensitive expressions equal to those of the loveliest women their soft limpid eyes their charming poses led the ancients to glorify them by metamorphosing the males into sea gods and the females into mermaids I drew Conseil s attention to the considerable growth of the cerebral lobes found in these intelligent cetaceans No mammal except man has more abundant cerebral matter Accordingly seals are quite capable of being educated they make good pets and together with certain other naturalists I think these animals can be properly trained to perform yeoman service as hunting dogs for fishermen Most of these seals were sleeping on the rocks or the sand Among those properly termed seals which have no external ears unlike sea lions whose ears protrude I observed several varieties of the species stenorhynchus three meters long with white hair bulldog heads and armed with ten teeth in each jaw four incisors in both the upper and lower plus two big canines shaped like the fleur de lis Among them slithered some sea elephants a type of seal with a short flexible trunk these are the giants of the species with a circumference of twenty feet and a length of ten meters They didn t move as we approached Are these animals dangerous Conseil asked me Only if they re attacked I replied But when these giant seals defend their little ones their fury is dreadful and it isn t rare for them to smash a fisherman s longboat to bits They re within their rights Conseil answered I don t say nay Two miles farther on we were stopped by a promontory that screened the bay from southerly winds It dropped straight down to the sea and surf foamed against it From beyond this ridge there came fearsome bellows such as a herd of cattle might produce Gracious Conseil put in a choir of bulls No I said a choir of walruses Are they fighting with each other Either fighting or playing With all due respect to master this we must see Then see it we must Conseil And there we were climbing these blackish rocks amid sudden landslides and over stones slippery with ice More than once I took a tumble at the expense of my backside Conseil more cautious or more stable barely faltered and would help me up saying If master s legs would kindly adopt a wider stance master will keep his balance Arriving at the topmost ridge of this promontory I could see vast white plains covered with walruses These animals were playing among themselves They were howling not in anger but in glee Walruses resemble seals in the shape of their bodies and the arrangement of their limbs But their lower jaws lack canines and incisors and as for their upper canines they consist of two tusks eighty centimeters long with a circumference of thirty three centimeters at the socket Made of solid ivory without striations harder than elephant tusks and less prone to yellowing these teeth are in great demand Accordingly walruses are the victims of a mindless hunting that soon will destroy them all since their hunters indiscriminately slaughter pregnant females and youngsters and over four thousand individuals are destroyed annually Passing near these unusual animals I could examine them at my leisure since they didn t stir Their hides were rough and heavy a tan color leaning toward a reddish brown their coats were short and less than abundant Some were four meters long More tranquil and less fearful than their northern relatives they posted no sentinels on guard duty at the approaches to their campsite After examining this community of walruses I decided to return in my tracks It was eleven o clock and if Captain Nemo found conditions favorable for taking his sights I wanted to be present at the operation But I held no hopes that the sun would make an appearance that day It was hidden from our eyes by clouds squeezed together on the horizon Apparently the jealous orb didn t want to reveal this inaccessible spot on the globe to any human being Yet I decided to return to the Nautilus We went along a steep narrow path that ran over the cliff s summit By eleven thirty we had arrived at our landing place The beached skiff had brought the captain ashore I spotted him standing on a chunk of basalt His instruments were beside him His eyes were focused on the northern horizon along which the sun was sweeping in its extended arc I found a place near him and waited without speaking Noon arrived and just as on the day before the sun didn t put in an appearance It was sheer bad luck Our noon sights were still lacking If we couldn t obtain them tomorrow we would finally have to give up any hope of fixing our position In essence it was precisely March twenty Tomorrow the twenty first was the day of the equinox the sun would disappear below the horizon for six months not counting refraction and after its disappearance the long polar night would begin Following the September equinox the sun had emerged above the northerly horizon rising in long spirals until December twenty one At that time the summer solstice of these southernmost districts the sun had started back down and tomorrow it would cast its last rays I shared my thoughts and fears with Captain Nemo You re right Professor Aronnax he told me If I can t take the sun s altitude tomorrow I won t be able to try again for another six months But precisely because sailors luck has led me into these seas on March twenty one it will be easy to get our bearings if the noonday sun does appear before our eyes Why easy captain Because when the orb of day sweeps in such long spirals it s difficult to measure its exact altitude above the horizon and our instruments are open to committing serious errors Then what can you do I use only my chronometer Captain Nemo answered me At noon tomorrow March twenty one if after accounting for refraction the sun s disk is cut exactly in half by the northern horizon that will mean I m at the South Pole Right I said Nevertheless it isn t mathematically exact proof because the equinox needn t fall precisely at noon No doubt sir but the error will be under one hundred meters and that s close enough for us Until tomorrow then Captain Nemo went back on board Conseil and I stayed behind until five o clock surveying the beach observing and studying The only unusual object I picked up was an auk s egg of remarkable size for which a collector would have paid more than one thousand francs Its cream colored tint plus the streaks and markings that decorated it like so many hieroglyphics made it a rare trinket I placed it in Conseil s hands and holding it like precious porcelain from China that cautious sure footed lad got it back to the Nautilus in one piece There I put this rare egg inside one of the glass cases in the museum I ate supper feasting with appetite on an excellent piece of seal liver whose flavor reminded me of pork Then I went to bed but not without praying like a good Hindu for the favors of the radiant orb The next day March twenty one bright and early at five o clock in the morning I climbed onto the platform I found Captain Nemo there The weather is clearing a bit he told me I have high hopes After breakfast we ll make our way ashore and choose an observation post This issue settled I went to find Ned Land I wanted to take him with me The obstinate Canadian refused and I could clearly see that his tight lipped mood and his bad temper were growing by the day Under the circumstances I ultimately wasn t sorry that he refused In truth there were too many seals ashore and it would never do to expose this impulsive fisherman to such temptations Breakfast over I made my way ashore The Nautilus had gone a few more miles during the night It lay well out a good league from the coast which was crowned by a sharp peak four hundred to five hundred meters high In addition to me the skiff carried Captain Nemo two crewmen and the instruments in other words a chronometer a spyglass and a barometer During our crossing I saw numerous baleen whales belonging to the three species unique to these southernmost seas the bowhead whale or right whale according to the English which has no dorsal fin the humpback whale from the genus Balaenoptera in other words winged whales beasts with wrinkled bellies and huge whitish fins that genus name regardless do not yet form wings and the finback whale yellowish brown the swiftest of all cetaceans This powerful animal is audible from far away when it sends up towering spouts of air and steam that resemble swirls of smoke Herds of these different mammals were playing about in the tranquil waters and I could easily see that this Antarctic polar basin now served as a refuge for those cetaceans too relentlessly pursued by hunters I also noted long whitish strings of salps a type of mollusk found in clusters and some jellyfish of large size that swayed in the eddies of the billows By nine o clock we had pulled up to shore The sky was growing brighter Clouds were fleeing to the south Mists were rising from the cold surface of the water Captain Nemo headed toward the peak which he no doubt planned to make his observatory It was an arduous climb over sharp lava and pumice stones in the midst of air often reeking with sulfurous fumes from the smoke holes For a man out of practice at treading land the captain scaled the steepest slopes with a supple agility I couldn t equal and which would have been envied by hunters of Pyrenees mountain goats It took us two hours to reach the summit of this half crystal half basalt peak From there our eyes scanned a vast sea which scrawled its boundary line firmly against the background of the northern sky At our feet dazzling tracts of white Over our heads a pale azure clear of mists North of us the sun s disk like a ball of fire already cut into by the edge of the horizon From the heart of the waters jets of liquid rising like hundreds of magnificent bouquets Far off like a sleeping cetacean the Nautilus Behind us to the south and east an immense shore a chaotic heap of rocks and ice whose limits we couldn t see Arriving at the summit of this peak Captain Nemo carefully determined its elevation by means of his barometer since he had to take this factor into account in his noon sights At eleven forty five the sun by then seen only by refraction looked like a golden disk dispersing its last rays over this deserted continent and down to these seas not yet plowed by the ships of man Captain Nemo had brought a spyglass with a reticular eyepiece which corrected the sun s refraction by means of a mirror and he used it to observe the orb sinking little by little along a very extended diagonal that reached below the horizon I held the chronometer My heart was pounding mightily If the lower half of the sun s disk disappeared just as the chronometer said noon we were right at the pole Noon I called The South Pole Captain Nemo replied in a solemn voice handing me the spyglass which showed the orb of day cut into two exactly equal parts by the horizon I stared at the last rays wreathing this peak while shadows were gradually climbing its gradients Just then resting his hand on my shoulder Captain Nemo said to me In sixteen hundred sir the Dutchman Gheritk was swept by storms and currents reaching latitude sixty four degrees south and discovering the South Shetland Islands On January seventeen seventeen seventy three the famous Captain Cook went along the thirty eighth meridian arriving at latitude sixty seven degrees thirty and on January thirty seventeen seventy four along the one hundred and ninth meridian he reached latitude seventy one degrees fifteen In eighteen nineteen the Russian Bellinghausen lay on the sixty ninth parallel and in eighteen twenty one on the sixty sixth at longitude one hundred eleven degrees west In eighteen twenty the Englishman Bransfield stopped at sixty five degrees That same year the American Morrel whose reports are dubious went along the forty second meridian finding open sea at latitude seventy degrees fourteen In eighteen twenty five the Englishman Powell was unable to get beyond sixty two degrees That same year a humble seal fisherman the Englishman Weddell went as far as latitude seventy two degrees fourteen on the thirty fifth meridian and as far as seventy four degrees fifteen on the thirty sixth In eighteen twenty nine the Englishman Forster commander of the Chanticleer laid claim to the Antarctic continent in latitude sixty three degrees twenty six and longitude sixty six degrees twenty six On February one eighteen thirty one the Englishman Biscoe discovered Enderby Land at latitude sixty eight degrees fifty Adelaide Land at latitude sixty seven degrees on February five eighteen thirty two and Graham Land at latitude sixty four degrees forty five on February twenty one In eighteen thirty eight the Frenchman Dumont d Urville stopped at the Ice Bank in latitude sixty two degrees fifty seven sighting the Louis Philippe Peninsula on January twenty one two years later at a new southerly position of sixty six degrees thirty he named the Adelie Coast and eight days later the Clarie Coast at sixty four degrees forty In eighteen thirty eight the American Wilkes advanced as far as the sixty ninth parallel on the one hundredth meridian In eighteen thirty nine the Englishman Balleny discovered the Sabrina Coast at the edge of the polar circle Lastly on January twelve eighteen forty two with his ships the Erebus and the Terror the Englishman Sir James Clark Ross found Victoria Land in latitude seventy degrees fifty six and longitude one hundred seventy one degrees seven east on the twenty third of that same month he reached the seventy fourth parallel a position denoting the Farthest South attained until then on the twenty seventh he lay at seventy six degrees eight on the twenty eighth at seventy seven degrees thirty two on February two at seventy eight degrees four and late in eighteen forty two he returned to seventy one degrees but couldn t get beyond it Well now In eighteen sixty eight on this twenty first day of March I myself Captain Nemo have reached the South Pole at ninety degrees and I hereby claim this entire part of the globe equal to one sixth of the known continents In the name of which sovereign captain In my own name sir So saying Captain Nemo unfurled a black flag bearing a gold N on its quartered bunting Then turning toward the orb of day whose last rays were licking at the sea s horizon Farewell O sun he called Disappear O radiant orb Retire beneath this open sea and let six months of night spread their shadows over my new domains CHAPTER fifteen Accident or Incident THE NEXT DAY March twenty two at six o clock in the morning preparations for departure began The last gleams of twilight were melting into night The cold was brisk The constellations were glittering with startling intensity The wonderful Southern Cross polar star of the Antarctic regions twinkled at its zenith The thermometer marked twelve degrees centigrade and a fresh breeze left a sharp nip in the air Ice floes were increasing over the open water The sea was starting to congeal everywhere Numerous blackish patches were spreading over its surface announcing the imminent formation of fresh ice Obviously this southernmost basin froze over during its six month winter and became utterly inaccessible What happened to the whales during this period No doubt they went beneath the Ice Bank to find more feasible seas As for seals and walruses they were accustomed to living in the harshest climates and stayed on in these icy waterways These animals know by instinct how to gouge holes in the ice fields and keep them continually open they go to these holes to breathe Once the birds have migrated northward to escape the cold these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the polar continent Meanwhile the ballast tanks filled with water and the Nautilus sank slowly At a depth of one thousand feet it stopped Its propeller churned the waves and it headed due north at a speed of fifteen miles per hour Near the afternoon it was already cruising under the immense frozen carapace of the Ice Bank As a precaution the panels in the lounge stayed closed because the Nautilus s hull could run afoul of some submerged block of ice So I spent the day putting my notes into final form My mind was completely wrapped up in my memories of the pole We had reached that inaccessible spot without facing exhaustion or danger as if our seagoing passenger carriage had glided there on railroad tracks And now we had actually started our return journey Did it still have comparable surprises in store for me I felt sure it did so inexhaustible is this series of underwater wonders As it was in the five and a half months since fate had brought us on board we had cleared fourteen thousand leagues and over this track longer than the earth s equator so many fascinating or frightening incidents had beguiled our voyage that hunting trip in the Crespo forests our running aground in the Torres Strait the coral cemetery the pearl fisheries of Ceylon the Arabic tunnel the fires of Santorini those millions in the Bay of Vigo Atlantis the South Pole During the night all these memories crossed over from one dream to the next not giving my brain a moment s rest At three o clock in the morning I was awakened by a violent collision 
836_130900_000016_000000	train-clean-360	I sat up 
none	none	in bed listening in the darkness and then was suddenly hurled into the middle of my stateroom Apparently the Nautilus had gone aground then heeled over sharply Leaning against the walls I dragged myself down the gangways to the lounge whose ceiling lights were on The furniture had been knocked over Fortunately the glass cases were solidly secured at the base and had stood fast Since we were no longer vertical the starboard pictures were glued to the tapestries while those to port had their lower edges hanging a foot away from the wall So the Nautilus was lying on its starboard side completely stationary to boot In its interior I heard the sound of footsteps and muffled voices But Captain Nemo didn t appear Just as I was about to leave the lounge Ned Land and Conseil entered What happened I instantly said to them I came to ask master that Conseil replied Damnation the Canadian exclaimed I know full well what happened The Nautilus has gone aground and judging from the way it s listing I don t think it ll pull through like that first time in the Torres Strait But I asked are we at least back on the surface of the sea We have no idea Conseil replied It s easy to find out I answered I consulted the pressure gauge Much to my surprise it indicated a depth of three hundred sixty meters What s the meaning of this I exclaimed We must confer with Captain Nemo Conseil said But where do we find him Ned Land asked Follow me I told my two companions We left the lounge Nobody in the library Nobody by the central companionway or the crew s quarters I assumed that Captain Nemo was stationed in the pilothouse Best to wait The three of us returned to the lounge I ll skip over the Canadian s complaints He had good grounds for an outburst I didn t answer him back letting him blow off all the steam he wanted We had been left to ourselves for twenty minutes trying to detect the tiniest noises inside the Nautilus when Captain Nemo entered He didn t seem to see us His facial features usually so emotionless revealed a certain uneasiness He studied the compass and pressure gauge in silence then went and put his finger on the world map at a spot in the sector depicting the southernmost seas I hesitated to interrupt him But some moments later when he turned to me I threw back at him a phrase he had used in the Torres Strait An incident captain No sir he replied this time an accident Serious Perhaps Is there any immediate danger No The Nautilus has run aground Yes And this accident came about Through nature s unpredictability not man s incapacity No errors were committed in our maneuvers Nevertheless we can t prevent a loss of balance from taking its toll One may defy human laws but no one can withstand the laws of nature Captain Nemo had picked an odd time to philosophize All in all this reply told me nothing May I learn sir I asked him what caused this accident An enormous block of ice an entire mountain has toppled over he answered me When an iceberg is eroded at the base by warmer waters or by repeated collisions its center of gravity rises Then it somersaults it turns completely upside down That s what happened here When it overturned one of these blocks hit the Nautilus as it was cruising under the waters Sliding under our hull this block then raised us with irresistible power lifting us into less congested strata where we now lie on our side But can t we float the Nautilus clear by emptying its ballast tanks to regain our balance That sir is being done right now You can hear the pumps working Look at the needle on the pressure gauge It indicates that the Nautilus is rising but this block of ice is rising with us and until some obstacle halts its upward movement our position won t change Indeed the Nautilus kept the same heel to starboard No doubt it would straighten up once the block came to a halt But before that happened who knew if we might not hit the underbelly of the Ice Bank and be hideously squeezed between two frozen surfaces I mused on all the consequences of this situation Captain Nemo didn t stop studying the pressure gauge Since the toppling of this iceberg the Nautilus had risen about one hundred fifty feet but it still stayed at the same angle to the perpendicular Suddenly a slight movement could be felt over the hull Obviously the Nautilus was straightening a bit Objects hanging in the lounge were visibly returning to their normal positions The walls were approaching the vertical Nobody said a word Hearts pounding we could see and feel the ship righting itself The floor was becoming horizontal beneath our feet Ten minutes went by Finally we re upright I exclaimed Yes Captain Nemo said heading to the lounge door But will we float off I asked him Certainly he replied since the ballast tanks aren t yet empty and when they are the Nautilus must rise to the surface of the sea The captain went out and soon I saw that at his orders the Nautilus had halted its upward movement In fact it soon would have hit the underbelly of the Ice Bank but it had stopped in time and was floating in midwater That was a close call Conseil then said Yes We could have been crushed between these masses of ice or at least imprisoned between them And then with no way to renew our air supply Yes that was a close call If it s over with Ned Land muttered I was unwilling to get into a pointless argument with the Canadian and didn t reply Moreover the panels opened just then and the outside light burst through the uncovered windows We were fully afloat as I have said but on both sides of the Nautilus about ten meters away there rose dazzling walls of ice There also were walls above and below Above because the Ice Bank s underbelly spread over us like an immense ceiling Below because the somersaulting block shifting little by little had found points of purchase on both side walls and had gotten jammed between them The Nautilus was imprisoned in a genuine tunnel of ice about twenty meters wide and filled with quiet water So the ship could easily exit by going either ahead or astern sinking a few hundred meters deeper and then taking an open passageway beneath the Ice Bank The ceiling lights were off yet the lounge was still brightly lit This was due to the reflecting power of the walls of ice which threw the beams of our beacon right back at us Words cannot describe the effects produced by our galvanic rays on these huge whimsically sculpted blocks whose every angle ridge and facet gave off a different glow depending on the nature of the veins running inside the ice It was a dazzling mine of gems in particular sapphires and emeralds whose jets of blue and green crisscrossed Here and there opaline hues of infinite subtlety raced among sparks of light that were like so many fiery diamonds their brilliance more than any eye could stand The power of our beacon was increased a hundredfold like a lamp shining through the biconvex lenses of a world class lighthouse How beautiful Conseil exclaimed Yes I said it s a wonderful sight Isn t it Ned Oh damnation yes Ned Land shot back It s superb I m furious that I have to admit it Nobody has ever seen the like But this sight could cost us dearly And in all honesty I think we re looking at things God never intended for human eyes Ned was right It was too beautiful All at once a yell from Conseil made me turn around What is it I asked Master must close his eyes Master mustn t look With that Conseil clapped his hands over his eyes But what s wrong my boy I ve been dazzled struck blind Involuntarily my eyes flew to the window but I couldn t stand the fire devouring it I realized what had happened The Nautilus had just started off at great speed All the tranquil glimmers of the ice walls had then changed into blazing streaks The sparkles from these myriads of diamonds were merging with each other Swept along by its propeller the Nautilus was traveling through a sheath of flashing light Then the panels in the lounge closed We kept our hands over our eyes which were utterly saturated with those concentric gleams that swirl before the retina when sunlight strikes it too intensely It took some time to calm our troubled vision Finally we lowered our hands Ye gods I never would have believed it Conseil said And I still don t believe it the Canadian shot back When we return to shore jaded from all these natural wonders Conseil added think how we ll look down on those pitiful land masses those puny works of man No the civilized world won t be good enough for us Such words from the lips of this emotionless Flemish boy showed that our enthusiasm was near the boiling point But the Canadian didn t fail to throw his dram of cold water over us The civilized world he said shaking his head Don t worry Conseil my friend we re never going back to that world By this point it was five o clock in the morning Just then there was a collision in the Nautilus s bow I realized that its spur had just bumped a block of ice It must have been a faulty maneuver because this underwater tunnel was obstructed by such blocks and didn t make for easy navigating So I had assumed that Captain Nemo in adjusting his course would go around each obstacle or would hug the walls and follow the windings of the tunnel In either case our forward motion wouldn t receive an absolute check Nevertheless contrary to my expectations the Nautilus definitely began to move backward We re going astern Conseil said Yes I replied Apparently the tunnel has no way out at this end And so So I said our maneuvers are quite simple We ll return in our tracks and go out the southern opening That s all As I spoke I tried to sound more confident than I really felt Meanwhile the Nautilus accelerated its backward movement and running with propeller in reverse it swept us along at great speed This ll mean a delay Ned said What are a few hours more or less so long as we get out Yes Ned Land repeated so long as we get out I strolled for a little while from the lounge into the library My companions kept their seats and didn t move Soon I threw myself down on a couch and picked up a book which my eyes skimmed mechanically A quarter of an hour later Conseil approached me saying Is it deeply fascinating this volume master is reading Tremendously fascinating I replied I believe it Master is reading his own book My own book Indeed my hands were holding my own work on the great ocean depths I hadn t even suspected I closed the book and resumed my strolling Ned and Conseil stood up to leave Stay here my friends I said stopping them Let s stay together until we re out of this blind alley As master wishes Conseil replied The hours passed I often studied the instruments hanging on the lounge wall The pressure gauge indicated that the Nautilus stayed at a constant depth of three hundred meters the compass that it kept heading south the log that it was traveling at a speed of twenty miles per hour an excessive speed in such a cramped area But Captain Nemo knew that by this point there was no such thing as too fast since minutes were now worth centuries At eight twenty five a second collision took place This time astern I grew pale My companions came over I clutched Conseil s hand Our eyes questioned each other and more directly than if our thoughts had been translated into words Just then the captain entered the lounge I went to him Our path is barred to the south I asked him Yes sir When it overturned that iceberg closed off every exit We re boxed in Yes CHAPTER sixteen Shortage of Air CONSEQUENTLY above below and around the Nautilus there were impenetrable frozen walls 
405_130894_000006_000001	train-clean-100	We were the Ice Bank s prisoners The Canadian banged a table with his fearsome fist 
none	none	Conseil kept still I stared at the captain His face had resumed its usual emotionlessness He crossed his arms 
405_130894_000006_000004	train-clean-100	He pondered 
none	none	The Nautilus did not stir 
405_130894_000007_000000	train-clean-100	The captain then broke into speech 
405_130894_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Gentlemen he said in a calm voice there are two ways of dying under the conditions in which we re placed 
405_130894_000009_000000	train-clean-100	This inexplicable individual acted like a mathematics professor working out a problem for his pupils 
405_130894_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 The first way he went on is death by crushing 
405_130894_000010_000001	train-clean-100	The second is death by asphyxiation 
none	none	I don t mention the possibility of death by starvation because the Nautilus s provisions will certainly last longer than we will 
405_130894_000010_000003	train-clean-100	Therefore let s concentrate on our chances of being crushed or asphyxiated 
405_130894_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 As for asphyxiation captain I replied that isn t a cause for alarm because the air tanks are full 
none	none	True Captain Nemo went on but they ll supply air for only two days Now then we ve been buried beneath the waters for thirty six hours and the Nautilus s heavy atmosphere already needs renewing In another forty eight hours our reserve air will be used up Well then captain let s free ourselves within forty eight hours We ll try to at least by cutting through one of these walls surrounding us
405_130894_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Which one I asked 
405_130894_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Borings will tell us that 
none	none	I m going to ground the Nautilus on the lower shelf then my men will put on their diving suits and attack the thinnest of these ice walls
405_130894_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Can the panels in the lounge be left open 
405_130894_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Without ill effect 
none	none	We re no longer in motion 
405_130894_000019_000000	train-clean-100	Captain Nemo went out 
none	none	Hissing sounds soon told me that water was being admitted into the ballast tanks 
405_130894_000019_000002	train-clean-100	The Nautilus slowly settled and rested on the icy bottom at a depth of three hundred fifty meters the depth at which the lower shelf of ice lay submerged 
405_130894_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 My friends I said we re in a serious predicament but I m counting on your courage and energy 
405_130894_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Sir the Canadian replied this is no time to bore you with my complaints 
405_130894_000021_000001	train-clean-100	I m ready to do anything I can for the common good 
405_130894_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Excellent Ned I said extending my hand to the Canadian 
405_130894_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 I might add he went on that I m as handy with a pick as a harpoon If I can be helpful to the captain he can use me any way he wants 
405_130894_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 He won t turn down your assistance 
none	none	Come along Ned I led the Canadian to the room where the Nautilus s men were putting on their diving suits 
405_130894_000025_000001	train-clean-100	I informed the captain of Ned s proposition which was promptly accepted 
none	none	The Canadian got into his underwater costume and was ready as soon as his fellow workers Each of them carried on his back a Rouquayrol device that the air tanks had supplied with a generous allowance of fresh oxygen A considerable but necessary drain on the Nautilus s reserves As for the Ruhmkorff lamps they were unnecessary in the midst of these brilliant waters saturated with our electric rays After Ned was dressed I reentered the lounge whose windows had been uncovered stationed next to Conseil I examined the strata surrounding and supporting the Nautilus 
405_130894_000027_000000	train-clean-100	Some moments later we saw a dozen crewmen set foot on the shelf of ice among them Ned Land easily recognized by his tall figure Captain Nemo was with them 
405_130894_000028_000000	train-clean-100	Before digging into the ice the captain had to obtain borings to insure working in the best direction 
405_130894_000028_000001	train-clean-100	Long bores were driven into the side walls but after fifteen meters the instruments were still impeded by the thickness of those walls 
405_130894_000028_000002	train-clean-100	It was futile to attack the ceiling since that surface was the Ice Bank itself more than four hundred meters high 
405_130894_000028_000003	train-clean-100	Captain Nemo then bored into the lower surface There we were separated from the sea by a ten meter barrier That s how thick the iceberg was 
none	none	From this point on it was an issue of cutting out a piece equal in surface area to the Nautilus s waterline This meant detaching about six thousand five hundred cubic meters to dig a hole through which the ship could descend below this tract of ice 
405_130894_000029_000000	train-clean-100	Work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity Instead of digging all around the Nautilus which would have entailed even greater difficulties Captain Nemo had an immense trench outlined on the ice eight meters from our port quarter Then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference 
none	none	Soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter and huge chunks were loosened from its mass These chunks weighed less than the water and by an unusual effect of specific gravity each chunk took wing as it were to the roof of the tunnel which thickened above by as much as it diminished below 
405_130894_000029_000002	train-clean-100	But this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner 
none	none	After two hours of energetic work Ned Land reentered exhausted He and his companions were replaced by new workmen including Conseil and me 
405_130894_000030_000001	train-clean-100	The Nautilus s chief officer supervised us 
405_130894_000031_000000	train-clean-100	The water struck me as unusually cold but I warmed up promptly while wielding my pick 
405_130894_000031_000001	train-clean-100	My movements were quite free although they were executed under a pressure of thirty atmospheres 
none	none	After two hours of work reentering to snatch some food and rest I found a noticeable difference between the clean elastic fluid supplied me by the Rouquayrol device and the Nautilus s atmosphere which was already charged with carbon dioxide The air hadn t been renewed in forty eight hours and its life giving qualities were considerably weakened 
405_130894_000032_000002	train-clean-100	Meanwhile after twelve hours had gone by we had removed from the outlined surface area a slice of ice only one meter thick hence about six hundred cubic meters Assuming the same work would be accomplished every twelve hours it would still take five nights and four days to see the undertaking through to completion 
405_130894_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Five nights and four days I told my companions 
405_130894_000033_000001	train-clean-100	 And we have oxygen in the air tanks for only two days 
405_130894_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 Without taking into account Ned answered that once we re out of this damned prison we ll still be cooped up beneath the Ice Bank without any possible contact with the open air 
405_130894_000035_000000	train-clean-100	An apt remark 
405_130894_000035_000001	train-clean-100	For who could predict the minimum time we would need to free ourselves 
405_130894_000035_000002	train-clean-100	Before the Nautilus could return to the surface of the waves couldn t we all die of asphyxiation 
405_130894_000035_000003	train-clean-100	Were this ship and everyone on board doomed to perish in this tomb of ice It was a dreadful state of affairs 
405_130894_000035_000004	train-clean-100	But we faced it head on each one of us determined to do his duty to the end 
405_130894_000036_000000	train-clean-100	During the night in line with my forecasts a new one meter slice was removed from this immense socket 
none	none	But in the morning wearing my diving suit I was crossing through the liquid mass in a temperature of six degrees to seven degrees centigrade when I noted that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other The liquid strata farthest from the trench not warmed by the movements of workmen and tools were showing a tendency to solidify In the face of this imminent new danger what would happen to our chances for salvation and how could we prevent this liquid medium from solidifying then cracking the Nautilus s hull like glass 
405_130894_000037_000000	train-clean-100	I didn t tell my two companions about this new danger There was no point in dampening the energy they were putting into our arduous rescue work 
405_130894_000037_000001	train-clean-100	But when I returned on board I mentioned this serious complication to Captain Nemo 
405_130894_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 I know he told me in that calm tone the most dreadful outlook couldn t change 
none	none	It s one more danger but I don t know any way of warding it off Our sole chance for salvation is to work faster than the water solidifies 
405_130894_000038_000003	train-clean-100	We ve got to get there first that s all 
405_130894_000039_000000	train-clean-100	get there first 
none	none	that s all Get there first 
405_130894_000039_000001	train-clean-100	By then I should have been used to this type of talk 
405_130894_000040_000000	train-clean-100	For several hours that day I wielded my pick doggedly The work kept me going 
405_130894_000040_000001	train-clean-100	Besides working meant leaving the Nautilus which meant breathing the clean oxygen drawn from the air tanks and supplied by our equipment which meant leaving the thin foul air behind 
none	none	Near evening one more meter had been dug from the trench When I returned on board I was wellnigh asphyxiated by the carbon dioxide saturating the air 
405_130894_000041_000001	train-clean-100	Oh if only we had the chemical methods that would enable us to drive out this noxious gas There was no lack of oxygen 
405_130894_000041_000002	train-clean-100	All this water contained a considerable amount and after it was decomposed by our powerful batteries this life giving elastic fluid could have been restored to us I had thought it all out but to no avail because the carbon dioxide produced by our breathing permeated every part of the ship To absorb it we would need to fill containers with potassium hydroxide and shake them continually 
405_130894_000041_000003	train-clean-100	But this substance was missing on board and nothing else could replace it 
405_130894_000042_000000	train-clean-100	That evening Captain Nemo was forced to open the spigots of his air tanks and shoot a few spouts of fresh oxygen through the Nautilus s interior Without this precaution we wouldn t have awakened the following morning 
405_130894_000043_000000	train-clean-100	The next day March twenty six I returned to my miner s trade working to remove the fifth meter 
405_130894_000043_000001	train-clean-100	The Ice Bank s side walls and underbelly had visibly thickened 
405_130894_000043_000002	train-clean-100	Obviously they would come together before the Nautilus could break free 
405_130894_000043_000003	train-clean-100	For an instant I was gripped by despair My pick nearly slipped from my hands 
405_130894_000043_000004	train-clean-100	What was the point of this digging if I was to die smothered and crushed by this water turning to stone a torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages I felt like I was lying in the jaws of a fearsome monster jaws irresistibly closing 
405_130894_000044_000000	train-clean-100	Supervising our work working himself Captain Nemo passed near me just then 
none	none	I touched him with my hand and pointed to the walls of our prison The starboard wall had moved forward to a point less than four meters from the Nautilus s hull 
405_130894_000045_000000	train-clean-100	The captain understood and gave me a signal to follow him We returned on board 
none	none	My diving suit removed I went with him to the lounge
405_130894_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 Professor Aronnax he told me this calls for heroic measures or we ll be sealed up in this solidified water as if it were cement 
none	none	Yes I said
405_130894_000047_000001	train-clean-100	 But what can we do 
405_130894_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh he exclaimed if only my Nautilus were strong enough to stand that much pressure without being crushed 
405_130894_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 Well I asked not catching the captain s meaning 
405_130894_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t you understand he went on that the congealing of this water could come to our rescue 
none	none	Don t you see that by solidifying it could burst these tracts of ice imprisoning us just as its freezing can burst the hardest stones 
405_130894_000050_000002	train-clean-100	Aren t you aware that this force could be the instrument of our salvation rather than our destruction 
405_130894_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes captain maybe so 
405_130894_000051_000001	train-clean-100	But whatever resistance to crushing the Nautilus may have it still couldn t stand such dreadful pressures and it would be squashed as flat as a piece of sheet iron 
none	none	I know it sir 
405_130894_000052_000001	train-clean-100	So we can t rely on nature to rescue us only our own efforts 
405_130894_000052_000002	train-clean-100	We must counteract this solidification We must hold it in check 
405_130894_000052_000003	train-clean-100	Not only are the side walls closing in but there aren t ten feet of water ahead or astern of the Nautilus All around us this freeze is gaining fast 
405_130894_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 How long I asked will the oxygen in the air tanks enable us to breathe on board 
none	none	The captain looked me straight in the eye
405_130894_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 After tomorrow he said the air tanks will be empty 
405_130894_000056_000000	train-clean-100	I broke out in a cold sweat 
none	none	But why should I have been startled by this reply On March twenty two the Nautilus had dived under the open waters at the pole 
405_130894_000056_000003	train-clean-100	It was now the twenty sixth We had lived off the ship s stores for five days And all remaining breathable air had to be saved for the workmen Even today as I write these lines my sensations are so intense that an involuntary terror sweeps over me and my lungs still seem short of air 
405_130894_000057_000000	train-clean-100	Meanwhile motionless and silent Captain Nemo stood lost in thought An idea visibly crossed his mind 
405_130894_000057_000001	train-clean-100	But he seemed to brush it aside He told himself no 
405_130894_000057_000002	train-clean-100	At last these words escaped his lips 
405_130894_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 Boiling water he muttered 
405_130894_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 Boiling water I exclaimed 
none	none	Yes sir 
405_130894_000060_000001	train-clean-100	We re shut up in a relatively confined area If the Nautilus s pumps continually injected streams of boiling water into this space wouldn t that raise its temperature and delay its freezing 
405_130894_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 It s worth trying I said resolutely 
405_130894_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 So let s try it professor 
none	none	By then the thermometer gave seven degrees centigrade outside Captain Nemo led me to the galley where a huge distilling mechanism was at work supplying drinking water via evaporation The mechanism was loaded with water and the full electric heat of our batteries was thrown into coils awash in liquid In a few minutes the water reached one hundred degrees centigrade It was sent to the pumps while new water replaced it in the process The heat generated by our batteries was so intense that after simply going through the mechanism water drawn cold from the sea arrived boiling hot at the body of the pump The steaming water was injected into the icy water outside and after three hours had passed the thermometer gave the exterior temperature as six degrees centigrade 
405_130894_000064_000001	train-clean-100	That was one degree gained Two hours later the thermometer gave only four degrees 
405_130894_000065_000000	train-clean-100	After I monitored the operation s progress double checking it with many inspections I told the captain It s working 
405_130894_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 I think so he answered me 
405_130894_000066_000001	train-clean-100	 We ve escaped being crushed Now we have only asphyxiation to fear 
none	none	During the night the water temperature rose to one degrees centigrade The injections couldn t get it to go a single degree higher But since salt water freezes only at two degrees I was finally assured that there was no danger of it solidifying 
405_130894_000068_000000	train-clean-100	By the next day March twenty seven six meters of ice had been torn from the socket 
none	none	Only four meters were left to be removed That still meant forty eight hours of work The air couldn t be renewed in the Nautilus s interior 
405_130894_000068_000003	train-clean-100	Accordingly that day it kept getting worse 
none	none	An unbearable heaviness weighed me down 
405_130894_000069_000001	train-clean-100	Near three o clock in the afternoon this agonizing sensation affected me to an intense degree Yawns dislocated my jaws 
405_130894_000069_000002	train-clean-100	My lungs were gasping in their quest for that enkindling elastic fluid required for breathing now growing scarcer and scarcer 
none	none	My mind was in a daze I lay outstretched strength gone nearly unconscious My gallant Conseil felt the same symptoms suffered the same sufferings yet never left my side 
405_130894_000069_000004	train-clean-100	He held my hand he kept encouraging me and I even heard him mutter 
405_130894_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh if only I didn t have to breathe to leave more air for master 
405_130894_000071_000000	train-clean-100	It brought tears to my eyes to hear him say these words 
none	none	Since conditions inside were universally unbearable how eagerly how happily we put on our diving suits to take our turns working Picks rang out on that bed of ice 
405_130894_000072_000001	train-clean-100	Arms grew weary hands were rubbed raw but who cared about exhaustion what difference were wounds Life sustaining air reached our lungs 
405_130894_000072_000002	train-clean-100	We could breathe We could breathe 
405_130894_000073_000000	train-clean-100	And yet nobody prolonged his underwater work beyond the time allotted him 
405_130894_000073_000001	train-clean-100	His shift over each man surrendered to a gasping companion the air tank that would revive him 
405_130894_000073_000002	train-clean-100	Captain Nemo set the example and was foremost in submitting to this strict discipline When his time was up he yielded his equipment to another and reentered the foul air on board always calm unflinching and uncomplaining 
none	none	That day the usual work was accomplished with even greater energy Over the whole surface area only two meters were left to be removed Only two meters separated us from the open sea 
405_130894_000074_000001	train-clean-100	But the ship s air tanks were nearly empty 
405_130894_000074_000002	train-clean-100	The little air that remained had to be saved for the workmen 
none	none	Not an atom for the Nautilus 
405_130894_000075_000000	train-clean-100	When I returned on board I felt half suffocated 
405_130894_000075_000001	train-clean-100	What a night I m unable to depict it 
405_130894_000075_000002	train-clean-100	Such sufferings are indescribable The next day I was short winded 
405_130894_000075_000003	train-clean-100	Headaches and staggering fits of dizziness made me reel like a drunk 
none	none	My companions were experiencing the same symptoms 
405_130894_000075_000005	train-clean-100	Some crewmen were at their last gasp 
405_130894_000076_000000	train-clean-100	That day the sixth of our imprisonment Captain Nemo concluded that picks and mattocks were too slow to deal with the ice layer still separating us from open water and he decided to crush this layer The man had kept his energy and composure 
405_130894_000076_000001	train-clean-100	He had subdued physical pain with moral strength 
405_130894_000076_000002	train-clean-100	He could still think plan and act 
405_130894_000077_000000	train-clean-100	At his orders the craft was eased off in other words it was raised from its icy bed by a change in its specific gravity When it was afloat the crew towed it leading it right above the immense trench outlined to match the ship s waterline Next the ballast tanks filled with water the boat sank and was fitted into its socket 
405_130894_000078_000000	train-clean-100	Just then the whole crew returned on board and the double outside door was closed 
none	none	By this point the Nautilus was resting on a bed of ice only one meter thick and drilled by bores in a thousand places The stopcocks of the ballast tanks were then opened wide and one hundred cubic meters of water rushed in increasing the Nautilus s weight by one hundred thousand kilograms 
405_130894_000080_000000	train-clean-100	We waited we listened we forgot our sufferings we hoped once more We had staked our salvation on this one last gamble 
none	none	Despite the buzzing in my head I soon could hear vibrations under the Nautilus s hull 
405_130894_000081_000001	train-clean-100	We tilted 
405_130894_000081_000002	train-clean-100	The ice cracked with an odd ripping sound like paper tearing and the Nautilus began settling downward 
none	none	We re going through Conseil muttered in my ear 
405_130894_000083_000000	train-clean-100	I couldn t answer him 
405_130894_000083_000001	train-clean-100	I clutched his hand 
405_130894_000083_000002	train-clean-100	I squeezed it in an involuntary convulsion 
405_130894_000084_000000	train-clean-100	All at once carried away by its frightful excess load the Nautilus sank into the waters like a cannonball in other words dropping as if in a vacuum 
405_130894_000085_000000	train-clean-100	Our full electric power was then put on the pumps which instantly began to expel water from the ballast tanks After a few minutes we had checked our fall 
405_130894_000085_000001	train-clean-100	The pressure gauge soon indicated an ascending movement 
405_130894_000085_000002	train-clean-100	Brought to full speed the propeller made the sheet iron hull tremble down to its rivets and we sped northward 
none	none	But how long would it take to navigate under the Ice Bank to the open sea 
405_130894_000086_000001	train-clean-100	Another day 
405_130894_000086_000002	train-clean-100	I would be dead first 
405_130894_000087_000000	train-clean-100	Half lying on a couch in the library I was suffocating My face was purple my lips blue my faculties in abeyance I could no longer see or hear 
405_130894_000087_000001	train-clean-100	I had lost all sense of time My muscles had no power to contract 
405_130894_000088_000000	train-clean-100	I m unable to estimate the hours that passed in this way But I was aware that my death throes had begun 
405_130894_000088_000001	train-clean-100	I realized that I was about to die 
405_130894_000089_000000	train-clean-100	Suddenly I regained consciousness 
none	none	A few whiffs of air had entered my lungs 
405_130894_000089_000002	train-clean-100	Had we risen to the surface of the waves Had we cleared the Ice Bank 
none	none	No Ned and Conseil my two gallant friends were sacrificing themselves to save me A few atoms of air were still left in the depths of one Rouquayrol device 
405_130894_000090_000002	train-clean-100	Instead of breathing it themselves they had saved it for me and while they were suffocating they poured life into me drop by drop 
405_130894_000090_000003	train-clean-100	I tried to push the device away They held my hands and for a few moments I could breathe luxuriously 
405_130894_000091_000000	train-clean-100	My eyes flew toward the clock 
none	none	It was eleven in the morning It had to be March twenty eight 
405_130894_000091_000002	train-clean-100	The Nautilus was traveling at the frightful speed of forty miles per hour 
405_130894_000091_000003	train-clean-100	It was writhing in the waters 
none	none	Where was Captain Nemo 
405_130894_000092_000001	train-clean-100	Had he perished 
405_130894_000092_000002	train-clean-100	Had his companions died with him 
none	none	Just then the pressure gauge indicated we were no more than twenty feet from the surface 
405_130894_000093_000001	train-clean-100	Separating us from the open air was a mere tract of ice 
405_130894_000093_000002	train-clean-100	Could we break through it 
none	none	Perhaps 
405_130894_000094_000001	train-clean-100	In any event the Nautilus was going to try 
405_130894_000094_000002	train-clean-100	In fact I could feel it assuming an oblique position lowering its stern and raising its spur 
405_130894_000094_000003	train-clean-100	The admission of additional water was enough to shift its balance 
none	none	Then driven by its powerful propeller it attacked this ice field from below like a fearsome battering ram It split the barrier little by little backing up then putting on full speed against the punctured tract of ice and finally carried away by its supreme momentum it lunged through and onto this frozen surface crushing the ice beneath its weight The hatches were opened or torn off if you prefer and waves of clean air were admitted into every part of the Nautilus CHAPTER seventeen From Cape Horn to the Amazon HOW I GOT ONTO the platform I m unable to say Perhaps the Canadian transferred me there 
405_130895_000003_000001	train-clean-100	But I could breathe I could inhale the life giving sea air 
405_130895_000003_000002	train-clean-100	Next to me my two companions were getting tipsy on the fresh oxygen particles Poor souls who have suffered from long starvation mustn t pounce heedlessly on the first food given them 
405_130895_000003_000003	train-clean-100	We on the other hand didn t have to practice such moderation we could suck the atoms from the air by the lungful and it was the breeze the breeze itself that poured into us this luxurious intoxication 
none	none	Ahhh Conseil was putting in What fine oxygen 
405_130895_000004_000002	train-clean-100	Let master have no fears about breathing 
405_130895_000004_000003	train-clean-100	There s enough for everyone 
405_130895_000005_000000	train-clean-100	As for Ned Land he didn t say a word but his wide open jaws would have scared off a shark 
405_130895_000005_000001	train-clean-100	And what powerful inhalations The Canadian drew like a furnace going full blast 
405_130895_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Our strength returned promptly and when I looked around I saw that we were alone on the platform 
405_130895_000006_000001	train-clean-100	No crewmen Not even Captain Nemo 
none	none	Those strange seamen on the Nautilus were content with the oxygen circulating inside 
405_130895_000006_000003	train-clean-100	Not one of them had come up to enjoy the open air 
405_130895_000007_000000	train-clean-100	The first words I pronounced were words of appreciation and gratitude to my two companions 
none	none	Ned and Conseil had kept me alive during the final hours of our long death throes But no expression of thanks could repay them fully for such devotion Good lord professor Ned Land answered me don t mention it What did we do that s so praiseworthy 
405_130895_000008_000001	train-clean-100	Not a thing 
405_130895_000008_000002	train-clean-100	It was a question of simple arithmetic 
405_130895_000008_000003	train-clean-100	Your life is worth more than ours So we had to save it 
none	none	No Ned I replied it isn t worth more 
405_130895_000009_000001	train-clean-100	Nobody could be better than a kind and generous man like yourself 
405_130895_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 All right all right the Canadian repeated in embarrassment 
none	none	And you my gallant Conseil you suffered a great deal
405_130895_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 Not too much to be candid with master 
none	none	I was lacking a few throatfuls of air but I would have gotten by 
405_130895_000012_000002	train-clean-100	Besides when I saw master fainting it left me without the slightest desire to breathe It took my breath away in a manner of 
none	none	Confounded by this lapse into banality Conseil left his sentence hanging
405_130895_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 My friends I replied very moved we re bound to each other forever and I m deeply indebted to you 
405_130895_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Which I ll take advantage of the Canadian shot back 
none	none	Eh Conseil put in
405_130895_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes Ned Land went on 
405_130895_000017_000001	train-clean-100	 You can repay your debt by coming with me when I leave this infernal Nautilus 
none	none	By the way Conseil said are we going in a favorable direction
405_130895_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes I replied because we re going in the direction of the sun and here the sun is due north 
405_130895_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 Sure Ned Land went on but it remains to be seen whether we ll make for the Atlantic or the Pacific in other words whether we ll end up in well traveled or deserted seas 
405_130895_000021_000000	train-clean-100	I had no reply to this and I feared that Captain Nemo wouldn t take us homeward but rather into that huge ocean washing the shores of both Asia and America 
405_130895_000021_000001	train-clean-100	In this way he would complete his underwater tour of the world going back to those seas where the Nautilus enjoyed the greatest freedom 
405_130895_000021_000002	train-clean-100	But if we returned to the Pacific far from every populated shore what would happen to Ned Land s plans 
405_130895_000022_000000	train-clean-100	We would soon settle this important point 
405_130895_000022_000001	train-clean-100	The Nautilus traveled swiftly 
405_130895_000022_000002	train-clean-100	Soon we had cleared the Antarctic Circle plus the promontory of Cape Horn 
none	none	We were abreast of the tip of South America by March thirty one at seven o clock in the evening 
405_130895_000023_000000	train-clean-100	By then all our past sufferings were forgotten 
405_130895_000023_000001	train-clean-100	The memory of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds We had thoughts only of the future 
none	none	Captain Nemo no longer appeared neither in the lounge nor on the platform 
405_130895_000023_000003	train-clean-100	The positions reported each day on the world map were put there by the chief officer and they enabled me to determine the Nautilus s exact heading Now then that evening it became obvious much to my satisfaction that we were returning north by the Atlantic route 
none	none	I shared the results of my observations with the Canadian and Conseil
405_130895_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 That s good news the Canadian replied but where s the Nautilus going 
405_130895_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 I m unable to say Ned 
405_130895_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 After the South Pole does our captain want to tackle the North Pole then go back to the Pacific by the notorious Northwest Passage 
none	none	I wouldn t double dare him Conseil replied
405_130895_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh well the Canadian said we ll give him the slip long before then 
none	none	In any event Conseil added he s a superman that Captain Nemo and we ll never regret having known him
405_130895_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 Especially once we ve left him Ned Land shot back 
none	none	The next day April one when the Nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon we raised land to the west It was Tierra del Fuego the Land of Fire a name given it by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the natives huts This Land of Fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide extending between latitude fifty three degrees and fifty six degrees south and between longitude sixty seven degrees fifty and seventy seven degrees fifteen west Its coastline looked flat but high mountains rose in the distance I even thought I glimpsed Mt Sarmiento whose elevation is twenty seventy meters above sea level a pyramid shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit which depending on whether it s clear or veiled in vapor predicts fair weather or foul as Ned Land told me
405_130895_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 A first class barometer my friend 
none	none	Yes sir a natural barometer that didn t let me down when I navigated the narrows of the Strait of Magellan 
405_130895_000035_000000	train-clean-100	Just then its peak appeared before us standing out distinctly against the background of the skies 
405_130895_000035_000001	train-clean-100	This forecast fair weather And so it proved 
none	none	Going back under the waters the Nautilus drew near the coast cruising along it for only a few miles Through the lounge windows I could see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants bulb bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens with their smooth viscous filaments they measured as much as three hundred meters long genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough they re often used as mooring lines for ships Another weed known by the name velp and boasting four foot leaves was crammed into the coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor It served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks for crabs and cuttlefish 
405_130895_000036_000002	train-clean-100	Here seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal mixing meat from fish with vegetables from the sea like the English with their Irish stews 
405_130895_000037_000000	train-clean-100	The Nautilus passed over these lush luxuriant depths with tremendous speed 
405_130895_000037_000001	train-clean-100	Near evening it approached the Falkland Islands whose rugged summits I recognized the next day 
405_130895_000037_000002	train-clean-100	The sea was of moderate depth 
none	none	So not without good reason I assumed that these two islands plus the many islets surrounding them used to be part of the Magellan coastline The Falkland Islands were probably discovered by the famous navigator John Davis who gave them the name Davis Southern Islands 
405_130895_000037_000005	train-clean-100	Later Sir Richard Hawkins called them the Maidenland after the Blessed Virgin 
none	none	Subsequently at the beginning of the eighteenth century they were named the Malouines by fishermen from Saint Malo in Brittany then finally dubbed the Falklands by the English to whom they belong today 
405_130895_000038_000000	train-clean-100	In these waterways our nets brought up fine samples of algae in particular certain fucus plants whose roots were laden with the world s best mussels 
405_130895_000038_000001	train-clean-100	Geese and duck alighted by the dozens on the platform and soon took their places in the ship s pantry As for fish I specifically observed some bony fish belonging to the goby genus especially some gudgeon two decimeters long sprinkled with whitish and yellow spots 
405_130895_000039_000000	train-clean-100	I likewise marveled at the numerous medusas including the most beautiful of their breed the compass jellyfish unique to the Falkland seas Some of these jellyfish were shaped like very smooth semispheric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of twelve neat festoons 
405_130895_000039_000001	train-clean-100	Others looked like upside down baskets from which wide leaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing They swam with quiverings of their four leaflike arms letting the opulent tresses of their tentacles dangle in the drift I wanted to preserve a few specimens of these delicate zoophytes but they were merely clouds shadows illusions melting and evaporating outside their native element 
none	none	When the last tips of the Falkland Islands had disappeared below the horizon the Nautilus submerged to a depth between twenty and twenty five meters and went along the South American coast Captain Nemo didn t put in an appearance We didn t leave these Patagonian waterways until April three sometimes cruising under the ocean sometimes on its surface The Nautilus passed the wide estuary formed by the mouth of the Rio de la Plata and on April four we lay abreast of Uruguay albeit fifty miles out 
405_130895_000041_000001	train-clean-100	Keeping to its northerly heading it followed the long windings of South America 
405_130895_000041_000002	train-clean-100	By then we had fared sixteen thousand leagues since coming on board in the seas of Japan 
405_130895_000042_000000	train-clean-100	Near eleven o clock in the morning we cut the Tropic of Capricorn on the thirty seventh meridian passing well out from Cape Frio 
405_130895_000042_000001	train-clean-100	Much to Ned Land s displeasure Captain Nemo had no liking for the neighborhood of Brazil s populous shores because he shot by with dizzying speed Not even the swiftest fish or birds could keep up with us and the natural curiosities in these seas completely eluded our observation 
none	none	This speed was maintained for several days and on the evening of April nine we raised South America s easternmost tip Cape Sao Roque But then the Nautilus veered away again and went looking for the lowest depths of an underwater valley gouged between this cape and Sierra Leone on the coast of Africa Abreast of the West Indies this valley forks into two arms and to the north it ends in an enormous depression nine thousand meters deep From this locality to the Lesser Antilles the ocean s geologic profile features a steeply cut cliff six kilometers high and abreast of the Cape Verde Islands there s another wall just as imposing together these two barricades confine the whole submerged continent of Atlantis 
405_130895_000043_000003	train-clean-100	The floor of this immense valley is made picturesque by mountains that furnish these underwater depths with scenic views This description is based mostly on certain hand drawn charts kept in the Nautilus s library charts obviously rendered by Captain Nemo himself from his own personal observations 
none	none	For two days we visited these deep and deserted waters by means of our slanting fins 
405_130895_000044_000001	train-clean-100	The Nautilus would do long diagonal dives that took us to every level 
none	none	But on April eleven it rose suddenly and the shore reappeared at the mouth of the Amazon River a huge estuary whose outflow is so considerable it desalts the sea over an area of several leagues We cut the Equator Twenty miles to the west lay Guiana French territory where we could easily have taken refuge But the wind was blowing a strong gust and the furious billows would not allow us to face them in a mere skiff No doubt Ned Land understood this because he said nothing to me For my part I made no allusion to his escape plans because I didn t want to push him into an attempt that was certain to misfire I was readily compensated for this delay by fascinating research During those two days of April eleven twelve the Nautilus didn t leave the surface of the sea and its trawl brought up a simply miraculous catch of zoophytes fish and reptiles 
405_130895_000047_000000	train-clean-100	Some zoophytes were dredged up by the chain of our trawl 
none	none	Most were lovely sea anemone belonging to the family Actinidia including among other species the Phyctalis protexta native to this part of the ocean a small cylindrical trunk adorned with vertical lines mottled with red spots and crowned by a wondrous blossoming of tentacles As for mollusks they consisted of exhibits I had already observed turret snails olive shells of the tent olive species with neatly intersecting lines and russet spots standing out sharply against a flesh colored background fanciful spider conchs that looked like petrified scorpions transparent glass snails argonauts some highly edible cuttlefish and certain species of squid that the naturalists of antiquity classified with the flying fish which are used chiefly as bait for catching cod As for the fish in these waterways I noted various species that I hadn t yet had the opportunity to study Among cartilaginous fish some brook lamprey a type of eel fifteen inches long head greenish fins violet back bluish gray belly a silvery brown strewn with bright spots iris of the eye encircled in gold unusual animals that the Amazon s current must have swept out to sea because their natural habitat is fresh water sting rays the snout pointed the tail long slender and armed with an extensive jagged sting small one meter sharks with gray and whitish hides their teeth arranged in several backward curving rows fish commonly known by the name carpet shark batfish a sort of reddish isosceles triangle half a meter long whose pectoral fins are attached by fleshy extensions that make these fish look like bats although an appendage made of horn located near the nostrils earns them the nickname of sea unicorns lastly a couple species of triggerfish the cucuyo whose stippled flanks glitter with a sparkling gold color and the bright purple leatherjacket whose hues glisten like a pigeon s throat I ll finish up this catalog a little dry but quite accurate with the series of bony fish I observed eels belonging to the genus Apteronotus whose snow white snout is very blunt the body painted a handsome black and armed with a very long slender fleshy whip long sardines from the genus Odontognathus like three decimeter pike shining with a bright silver glow Guaranian mackerel furnished with two anal fins black tinted rudderfish that you catch by using torches fish measuring two meters and boasting white firm plump meat that when fresh tastes like eel when dried like smoked salmon semired wrasse sporting scales only at the bases of their dorsal and anal fins grunts on which gold and silver mingle their luster with that of ruby and topaz yellow tailed gilthead whose flesh is extremely dainty and whose phosphorescent properties give them away in the midst of the waters porgies tinted orange with slender tongues croakers with gold caudal fins black surgeonfish four eyed fish from Surinam et cetera This et cetera won t keep me from mentioning one more fish that Conseil with good reason will long remember 
405_130895_000051_000000	train-clean-100	One of our nets had hauled up a type of very flat ray that weighed some twenty kilograms with its tail cut off it would have formed a perfect disk 
405_130895_000051_000001	train-clean-100	It was white underneath and reddish on top with big round spots of deep blue encircled in black its hide quite smooth and ending in a double lobed fin 
none	none	Laid out on the platform it kept struggling with convulsive movements trying to turn over making such efforts that its final lunge was about to flip it into the sea But Conseil being very possessive of his fish rushed at it and before I could stop him he seized it with both hands 
405_130895_000052_000000	train-clean-100	Instantly there he was thrown on his back legs in the air his body half paralyzed and yelling 
none	none	Oh sir sir 
405_130895_000053_000001	train-clean-100	Will you help me 
405_130895_000054_000000	train-clean-100	For once in his life the poor lad didn t address me in the third person 
405_130895_000055_000000	train-clean-100	The Canadian and I sat him up we massaged his contracted arms and when he regained his five senses that eternal classifier mumbled in a broken voice 
none	none	Class of cartilaginous fish order Chondropterygia with fixed gills suborder Selacia family Rajiiforma genus electric ray
405_130895_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes my friend I answered it was an electric ray that put you in this deplorable state 
none	none	Oh master can trust me on this Conseil shot back I ll be revenged on that animal How
405_130895_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 I ll eat it 
405_130895_000061_000000	train-clean-100	Which he did that same evening but strictly as retaliation Because frankly it tasted like leather 
none	none	Poor Conseil had assaulted an electric ray of the most dangerous species the cumana 
405_130895_000062_000001	train-clean-100	Living in a conducting medium such as water this bizarre animal can electrocute other fish from several meters away so great is the power of its electric organ an organ whose two chief surfaces measure at least twenty seven square feet 
none	none	During the course of the next day April twelve the Nautilus drew near the coast of Dutch Guiana by the mouth of the Maroni River There several groups of sea cows were living in family units These were manatees which belong to the order Sirenia like the dugong and Steller s sea cow Harmless and unaggressive these fine animals were six to seven meters long and must have weighed at least four thousand kilograms each I told Ned Land and Conseil that farseeing nature had given these mammals a major role to play In essence manatees like seals are designed to graze the underwater prairies destroying the clusters of weeds that obstruct the mouths of tropical rivers
405_130895_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 And do you know I added what happened since man has almost completely wiped out these beneficial races Rotting weeds have poisoned the air and this poisoned air causes the yellow fever that devastates these wonderful countries This toxic vegetation has increased beneath the seas of the Torrid Zone so the disease spreads unchecked from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata to Florida 
none	none	And if Professor Toussenel is correct this plague is nothing compared to the scourge that will strike our descendants once the seas are depopulated of whales and seals 
405_130895_000065_000001	train-clean-100	By then crowded with jellyfish squid and other devilfish the oceans will have become huge centers of infection because their waves will no longer possess these huge stomachs that God has entrusted with scouring the surface of the sea 
none	none	Meanwhile without scorning these theories the Nautilus s crew captured half a dozen manatees 
405_130895_000066_000001	train-clean-100	In essence it was an issue of stocking the larder with excellent red meat even better than beef or veal Their hunting was not a fascinating sport 
none	none	The manatees let themselves be struck down without offering any resistance Several thousand kilos of meat were hauled below to be dried and stored 
405_130895_000067_000000	train-clean-100	The same day an odd fishing practice further increased the Nautilus s stores so full of game were these seas Our trawl brought up in its meshes a number of fish whose heads were topped by little oval slabs with fleshy edges 
405_130895_000067_000001	train-clean-100	These were suckerfish from the third family of the subbrachian Malacopterygia 
405_130895_000067_000002	train-clean-100	These flat disks on their heads consist of crosswise plates of movable cartilage between which the animals can create a vacuum enabling them to stick to objects like suction cups 
none	none	The remoras I had observed in the Mediterranean were related to this species But the creature at issue here was an Echeneis osteochara unique to this sea 
405_130895_000068_000002	train-clean-100	Right after catching them our seamen dropped them in buckets of water 
405_130895_000069_000000	train-clean-100	Its fishing finished the Nautilus drew nearer to the coast In this locality a number of sea turtles were sleeping on the surface of the waves 
405_130895_000069_000001	train-clean-100	It would have been difficult to capture these valuable reptiles because they wake up at the slightest sound and their solid carapaces are harpoon proof 
405_130895_000069_000002	train-clean-100	But our suckerfish would effect their capture with extraordinary certainty and precision In truth this animal is a living fishhook promising wealth and happiness to the greenest fisherman in the business 
none	none	The Nautilus s men attached to each fish s tail a ring that was big enough not to hamper its movements and to this ring a long rope whose other end was moored on board Thrown into the sea the suckerfish immediately began to play their roles going and fastening themselves onto the breastplates of the turtles Their tenacity was so great they would rip apart rather than let go They were hauled in still sticking to the turtles that came aboard with them In this way we caught several loggerheads reptiles a meter wide and weighing two hundred kilos They re extremely valuable because of their carapaces which are covered with big slabs of horn thin brown transparent with white and yellow markings Besides they were excellent from an edible viewpoint with an exquisite flavor comparable to the green turtle This fishing ended our stay in the waterways of the Amazon and that evening the Nautilus took to the high seas once more CHAPTER eighteen The Devilfish FOR SOME DAYS the Nautilus kept veering away from the American coast It obviously didn t want to frequent the waves of the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea Yet there was no shortage of water under its keel since the average depth of these seas is eighteen hundred meters but these waterways strewn with islands and plowed by steamers probably didn t agree with Captain Nemo On April sixteen we raised Martinique and Guadalupe from a distance of about thirty miles For one instant I could see their lofty peaks The Canadian was quite disheartened having counted on putting his plans into execution in the gulf either by reaching shore or by pulling alongside one of the many boats plying a coastal trade from one island to another An escape attempt would have been quite feasible assuming Ned Land managed to seize the skiff without the captain s knowledge But in midocean it was unthinkable The Canadian Conseil and I had a pretty long conversation on this subject For six months we had been prisoners aboard the Nautilus We had fared seventeen thousand leagues and as Ned Land put it there was no end in sight So he made me a proposition I hadn t anticipated We were to ask Captain Nemo this question straight out did the captain mean to keep us on board his vessel permanently This measure was distasteful to me To my mind it would lead nowhere We could hope for nothing from the Nautilus s commander but could depend only on ourselves Besides for some time now the man had been gloomier more withdrawn less sociable He seemed to be avoiding me I encountered him only at rare intervals He used to take pleasure in explaining the underwater wonders to me now he left me to my research and no longer entered the lounge What changes had come over him From what cause I had no reason to blame myself Was our presence on board perhaps a burden to him Even so I cherished no hopes that the man would set us free So I begged Ned to let me think about it before taking action If this measure proved fruitless it could arouse the captain s suspicions make our circumstances even more arduous and jeopardize the Canadian s plans I might add that I could hardly use our state of health as an argument Except for that grueling ordeal under the Ice Bank at the South Pole we had never felt better neither Ned Conseil nor I The nutritious food life giving air regular routine and uniform temperature kept illness at bay and for a man who didn t miss his past existence on land for a Captain Nemo who was at home here who went where he wished who took paths mysterious to others if not himself in attaining his ends I could understand such a life But we ourselves hadn t severed all ties with humanity For my part I didn t want my new and unusual research to be buried with my bones I had now earned the right to pen the definitive book on the sea and sooner or later I wanted that book to see the light of day There once more through the panels opening into these Caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves I found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes Among other zoophytes there were Portuguese men of war known by the name Physalia pelagica like big oblong bladders with a pearly sheen spreading their membranes to the wind letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads to the eye delightful jellyfish to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid Among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long furnished with a pink proboscis equipped with seventeen hundred organs of locomotion snaking through the waters and as they went throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum From the fish branch there were manta rays enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing six hundred pounds their pectoral fin triangular their midback slightly arched their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head they floated like wreckage from a ship sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters There were American triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments feather shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws sixteen decimeter mackerel with short sharp teeth covered with small scales and related to the albacore species Next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail their shining fins all aquiver genuine masterpieces of jewelry formerly sacred to the goddess Diana much in demand by rich Romans and about which the old saying goes He who catches them doesn t eat them Finally adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of Veronese spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals and silver moonfish worthy of their name rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons How many other marvelous new specimens I still could have observed if little by little the Nautilus hadn t settled to the lower strata Its slanting fins drew it to depths of two thousand and three thousand five hundred meters There animal life was represented by nothing more than sea lilies starfish delightful crinoids with bell shaped heads like little chalices on straight stems top shell snails blood red tooth shells and fissurella snails a large species of coastal mollusk By April twenty we had risen to an average level of fifteen hundred meters The nearest land was the island group of the Bahamas scattered like a batch of cobblestones over the surface of the water There high underwater cliffs reared up straight walls made of craggy chunks arranged like big stone foundations among which there gaped black caves so deep our electric rays couldn t light them to the far ends These rocks were hung with huge weeds immense sea tangle gigantic fucus a genuine trellis of water plants fit for a world of giants In discussing these colossal plants Conseil Ned and I were naturally led into mentioning the sea s gigantic animals The former were obviously meant to feed the latter However through the windows of our almost motionless Nautilus I could see nothing among these long filaments other than the chief articulates of the division Brachyura long legged spider crabs violet crabs and sponge crabs unique to the waters of the Caribbean It was about eleven o clock when Ned Land drew my attention to a fearsome commotion out in this huge seaweed Well I said these are real devilfish caverns and I wouldn t be surprised to see some of those monsters hereabouts What Conseil put in Squid ordinary squid from the class Cephalopoda No I said devilfish of large dimensions But friend Land is no doubt mistaken because I don t see a thing That s regrettable Conseil answered I d like to come face to face with one of those devilfish I ve heard so much about which can drag ships down into the depths Those beasts go by the name of krake Fake is more like it the Canadian replied sarcastically Krakens Conseil shot back finishing his word without wincing at his companion s witticism Nobody will ever make me believe Ned Land said that such animals exist Why not Conseil replied We sincerely believed in master s narwhale We were wrong Conseil No doubt but there are others with no doubts who believe to this day Probably Conseil But as for me I m bound and determined not to accept the existence of any such monster till I ve dissected it with my own two hands Yet Conseil asked me doesn t master believe in gigantic devilfish Yikes Who in Hades ever believed in them the Canadian exclaimed Many people Ned my friend I said No fishermen Scientists maybe Pardon me Ned Fishermen and scientists Why I to whom you speak Conseil said with the world s straightest face I recall perfectly seeing a large boat dragged under the waves by the arms of a cephalopod You saw that the Canadian asked Yes Ned With your own two eyes With my own two eyes Where may I ask In Saint Malo Conseil returned unflappably In the harbor Ned Land said sarcastically No in a church Conseil replied In a church the Canadian exclaimed Yes Ned my friend It had a picture that portrayed the devilfish in question Oh good Ned Land exclaimed with a burst of laughter mister Conseil put one over on me Actually he s right I said I ve heard about that picture But the subject it portrays is taken from a legend and you know how to rate legends in matters of natural history Besides when it s an issue of monsters the human imagination always tends to run wild People not only claimed these devilfish could drag ships under but a certain Olaus Magnus tells of a cephalopod a mile long that looked more like an island than an animal There s also the story of how the Bishop of Trondheim set up an altar one day on an immense rock After he finished saying mass this rock started moving and went back into the sea The rock was a devilfish And that s everything we know the Canadian asked No I replied another bishop Pontoppidan of Bergen also tells of a devilfish so large a whole cavalry regiment could maneuver on it They sure did go on those oldtime bishops Ned Land said Finally the naturalists of antiquity mention some monsters with mouths as big as a gulf which were too huge to get through the Strait of Gibraltar Good work men the Canadian put in But in all these stories is there any truth Conseil asked None at all my friends at least in those that go beyond the bounds of credibility and fly off into fable or legend Yet for the imaginings of these storytellers there had to be if not a cause at least an excuse It can t be denied that some species of squid and other devilfish are quite large though still smaller than cetaceans Aristotle put the dimensions of one squid at five cubits or three point one meters Our fishermen frequently see specimens over one point eight meters long The museums in Trieste and Montpellier have preserved some devilfish carcasses measuring two meters Besides according to the calculations of naturalists one of these animals only six feet long would have tentacles as long as twenty seven Which is enough to make a fearsome monster Does anybody fish for em nowadays the Canadian asked If they don t fish for them sailors at least sight them A friend of mine Captain Paul Bos of Le Havre has often sworn to me that he encountered one of these monsters of colossal size in the seas of the East Indies But the most astonishing event which proves that these gigantic animals undeniably exist took place a few years ago in eighteen sixty one What event was that Ned Land asked Just this In eighteen sixty one to the northeast of Tenerife and fairly near the latitude where we are right now the crew of the gunboat Alecto spotted a monstrous squid swimming in their waters Commander Bouguer approached the animal and attacked it with blows from harpoons and blasts from rifles but without much success because bullets and harpoons crossed its soft flesh as if it were semiliquid jelly After several fruitless attempts the crew managed to slip a noose around the mollusk s body This noose slid as far as the caudal fins and came to a halt Then they tried to haul the monster on board but its weight was so considerable that when they tugged on the rope the animal parted company with its tail and deprived of this adornment it disappeared beneath the waters Finally an actual event Ned Land said An indisputable event my gallant Ned Accordingly people have proposed naming this devilfish Bouguer s Squid And how long was it the Canadian asked Didn t it measure about six meters said Conseil who was stationed at the window and examining anew the crevices in the cliff Precisely I replied Wasn t its head Conseil went on crowned by eight tentacles that quivered in the water like a nest of snakes Precisely Weren t its eyes prominently placed and considerably enlarged Yes Conseil And wasn t its mouth a real parrot s beak but of fearsome size Correct Conseil Well with all due respect to master Conseil replied serenely if this isn t Bouguer s Squid it s at least one of his close relatives I stared at Conseil Ned Land rushed to the window What an awful animal he exclaimed I stared in my turn and couldn t keep back a movement of revulsion Before my eyes there quivered a horrible monster worthy of a place among the most farfetched teratological legends It was a squid of colossal dimensions fully eight meters long It was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the Nautilus It gazed with enormous staring eyes that were tinted sea green Its eight arms or more accurately feet were rooted in its head which has earned these animals the name cephalopod its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the Furies You could plainly see its two hundred fifty suckers arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules Sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it The monster s mouth a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot opened and closed vertically Its tongue also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth would flicker out from between these genuine shears What a freak of nature A bird s beak on a mollusk Its body was spindle shaped and swollen in the middle a fleshy mass that must have weighed twenty thousand to twenty five thousand kilograms Its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown What was irritating this mollusk No doubt the presence of the Nautilus even more fearsome than itself and which it couldn t grip with its mandibles or the suckers on its arms And yet what monsters these devilfish are what vitality our Creator has given them what vigor in their movements thanks to their owning a triple heart Sheer chance had placed us in the presence of this squid and I didn t want to lose this opportunity to meticulously study such a cephalopod specimen I overcame the horror that its appearance inspired in me picked up a pencil and began to sketch it Perhaps this is the same as the Alecto s Conseil said Can t be the Canadian replied because this one s complete while the other one lost its tail That doesn t necessarily follow I said The arms and tails of these animals grow back through regeneration and in seven years the tail on Bouguer s Squid has surely had time to sprout again Anyhow Ned shot back if it isn t this fellow maybe it s one of those Indeed other devilfish had appeared at the starboard window I counted seven of them They provided the Nautilus with an escort and I could hear their beaks gnashing on the sheet iron hull We couldn t have asked for a more devoted following I continued sketching These monsters kept pace in our waters with such precision they seemed to be standing still and I could have traced their outlines in miniature on the window But we were moving at a moderate speed All at once the Nautilus stopped A jolt made it tremble through its entire framework Did we strike bottom I asked In any event we re already clear the Canadian replied because we re afloat The Nautilus was certainly afloat but it was no longer in motion The blades of its propeller weren t churning the waves A minute passed Followed by his chief officer Captain Nemo entered the lounge I hadn t seen him for a good while He looked gloomy to me Without speaking to us without even seeing us perhaps he went to the panel stared at the devilfish and said a few words to his chief officer The latter went out Soon the panels closed The ceiling lit up I went over to the captain An unusual assortment of devilfish I told him as carefree as a collector in front of an aquarium Correct mister Naturalist he answered me and we re going to fight them at close quarters I gaped at the captain I thought my hearing had gone bad At close quarters I repeated Yes sir Our propeller is jammed I think the horn covered mandibles of one of these squid are entangled in the blades That s why we aren t moving And what are you going to do Rise to the surface and slaughter the vermin A difficult undertaking Correct Our electric bullets are ineffective against such soft flesh where they don t meet enough resistance to go off But we ll attack the beasts with axes And harpoons sir the Canadian said if you don t turn down my help I accept it mister Land We ll go with you I said And we followed Captain Nemo heading to the central companionway There some ten men were standing by for the assault armed with boarding axes Conseil and I picked up two more axes Ned Land seized a harpoon By then the Nautilus had returned to the surface of the waves Stationed on the top steps one of the seamen undid the bolts of the hatch But he had scarcely unscrewed the nuts when the hatch flew up with tremendous violence obviously pulled open by the suckers on a devilfish s arm Instantly one of those long arms glided like a snake into the opening and twenty others were quivering above With a sweep of the ax Captain Nemo chopped off this fearsome tentacle which slid writhing down the steps Just as we were crowding each other to reach the platform two more arms lashed the air swooped on the seaman stationed in front of Captain Nemo and carried the fellow away with irresistible violence Captain Nemo gave a shout and leaped outside We rushed after him What a scene Seized by the tentacle and glued to its suckers the unfortunate man was swinging in the air at the mercy of this enormous appendage He gasped he choked he yelled Help Help These words pronounced in French left me deeply stunned So I had a fellow countryman on board perhaps several I ll hear his harrowing plea the rest of my life The poor fellow was done for Who could tear him from such a powerful grip Even so Captain Nemo rushed at the devilfish and with a sweep of the ax hewed one more of its arms His chief officer struggled furiously with other monsters crawling up the Nautilus s sides The crew battled with flailing axes The Canadian Conseil and I sank our weapons into these fleshy masses An intense musky odor filled the air It was horrible For an instant I thought the poor man entwined by the devilfish might be torn loose from its powerful suction Seven arms out of eight had been chopped off Brandishing its victim like a feather one lone tentacle was writhing in the air But just as Captain Nemo and his chief officer rushed at it the animal shot off a spout of blackish liquid secreted by a pouch located in its abdomen It blinded us When this cloud had dispersed the squid was gone and so was my poor fellow countryman What rage then drove us against these monsters We lost all self control Ten or twelve devilfish had overrun the Nautilus s platform and sides We piled helter skelter into the thick of these sawed off snakes which darted over the platform amid waves of blood and sepia ink It seemed as if these viscous tentacles grew back like the many heads of Hydra At every thrust Ned Land s harpoon would plunge into a squid s sea green eye and burst it But my daring companion was suddenly toppled by the tentacles of a monster he could not avoid Oh my heart nearly exploded with excitement and horror The squid s fearsome beak was wide open over Ned Land The poor man was about to be cut in half I ran to his rescue But Captain Nemo got there first His ax disappeared between the two enormous mandibles and the Canadian miraculously saved stood and plunged his harpoon all the way into the devilfish s triple heart Tit for tat Captain Nemo told the Canadian I owed it to myself Ned bowed without answering him This struggle had lasted a quarter of an hour Defeated mutilated battered to death the monsters finally yielded to us and disappeared beneath the waves Red with blood motionless by the beacon Captain Nemo stared at the sea that had swallowed one of his companions and large tears streamed from his eyes CHAPTER nineteen The Gulf Stream THIS DREADFUL SCENE on April twenty none of us will ever be able to forget I wrote it up in a state of intense excitement Later I reviewed my narrative I read it to Conseil and the Canadian They found it accurate in detail but deficient in impact To convey such sights it would take the pen of our most famous poet Victor Hugo author of The Toilers of the Sea As I said Captain Nemo wept while staring at the waves His grief was immense This was the second companion he had lost since we had come aboard And what a way to die Smashed strangled crushed by the fearsome arms of a devilfish ground between its iron mandibles this friend would never rest with his companions in the placid waters of their coral cemetery As for me what had harrowed my heart in the thick of this struggle was the despairing yell given by this unfortunate man Forgetting his regulation language this poor Frenchman had reverted to speaking his own mother tongue to fling out one supreme plea Among the Nautilus s crew allied body and soul with Captain Nemo and likewise fleeing from human contact I had found a fellow countryman Was he the only representative of France in this mysterious alliance obviously made up of individuals from different nationalities This was just one more of those insoluble problems that kept welling up in my mind Captain Nemo reentered his stateroom and I saw no more of him for a good while But how sad despairing and irresolute he must have felt to judge from this ship whose soul he was which reflected his every mood The Nautilus no longer kept to a fixed heading It drifted back and forth riding with the waves like a corpse Its propeller had been disentangled but was barely put to use It was navigating at random It couldn t tear itself away from the setting of this last struggle from this sea that had devoured one of its own Ten days went by in this way It was only on May one that the Nautilus openly resumed its northbound course after raising the Bahamas at the mouth of Old Bahama Channel We then went with the current of the sea s greatest river which has its own banks fish and temperature I mean the Gulf Stream It is indeed a river that runs independently through the middle of the Atlantic its waters never mixing with the ocean s waters It s a salty river saltier than the sea surrounding it Its average depth is three thousand feet its average width sixty miles In certain localities its current moves at a speed of four kilometers per hour The unchanging volume of its waters is greater than that of all the world s rivers combined As discovered by Commander Maury the true source of the Gulf Stream its starting point if you prefer is located in the Bay of Biscay There its waters still weak in temperature and color begin to form It goes down south skirts equatorial Africa warms its waves in the rays of the Torrid Zone crosses the Atlantic reaches Cape Sao Roque on the coast of Brazil and forks into two branches one going to the Caribbean Sea for further saturation with heat particles Then entrusted with restoring the balance between hot and cold temperatures and with mixing tropical and northern waters the Gulf Stream begins to play its stabilizing role Attaining a white heat in the Gulf of Mexico it heads north up the American coast advances as far as Newfoundland swerves away under the thrust of a cold current from the Davis Strait and resumes its ocean course by going along a great circle of the earth on a rhumb line it then divides into two arms near the forty third parallel one helped by the northeast trade winds returns to the Bay of Biscay and the Azores the other washes the shores of Ireland and Norway with lukewarm water goes beyond Spitzbergen where its temperature falls to four degrees centigrade and fashions the open sea at the pole It was on this oceanic river that the Nautilus was then navigating Leaving Old Bahama Channel which is fourteen leagues wide by three hundred fifty meters deep the Gulf Stream moves at the rate of eight kilometers per hour Its speed steadily decreases as it advances northward and we must pray that this steadiness continues because as experts agree if its speed and direction were to change the climates of Europe would undergo disturbances whose consequences are incalculable Near noon I was on the platform with Conseil I shared with him the relevant details on the Gulf Stream When my explanation was over I invited him to dip his hands into its current Conseil did so and he was quite astonished to experience no sensation of either hot or cold That comes I told him from the water temperature of the Gulf Stream which as it leaves the Gulf of Mexico is barely different from your blood temperature This Gulf Stream is a huge heat generator that enables the coasts of Europe to be decked in eternal greenery And if Commander Maury is correct were one to harness the full warmth of this current it would supply enough heat to keep molten a river of iron solder as big as the Amazon or the Missouri Just then the Gulf Stream s speed was two point twenty five meters per second So distinct is its current from the surrounding sea its confined waters stand out against the ocean and operate on a different level from the colder waters Murky as well and very rich in saline material their pure indigo contrasts with the green waves surrounding them Moreover their line of demarcation is so clear that abreast of the Carolinas the Nautilus s spur cut the waves of the Gulf Stream while its propeller was still churning those belonging to the ocean This current swept along with it a whole host of moving creatures Argonauts so common in the Mediterranean voyaged here in schools of large numbers Among cartilaginous fish the most remarkable were rays whose ultra slender tails made up nearly a third of the body which was shaped like a huge diamond twenty five feet long then little one meter sharks the head large the snout short and rounded the teeth sharp and arranged in several rows the body seemingly covered with scales Among bony fish I noted grizzled wrasse unique to these seas deep water gilthead whose iris has a fiery gleam one meter croakers whose large mouths bristle with small teeth and which let out thin cries black rudderfish like those I ve already discussed blue dorados accented with gold and silver rainbow hued parrotfish that can rival the loveliest tropical birds in coloring banded blennies with triangular heads bluish flounder without scales toadfish covered with a crosswise yellow band in the shape of a Greek t swarms of little freckled gobies stippled with brown spots lungfish with silver heads and yellow tails various specimens of salmon mullet with slim figures and a softly glowing radiance that Lacepede dedicated to the memory of his wife and finally the American cavalla a handsome fish decorated by every honorary order bedizened with their every ribbon frequenting the shores of this great nation where ribbons and orders are held in such low esteem I might add that during the night the Gulf Stream s phosphorescent waters rivaled the electric glow of our beacon especially in the stormy weather that frequently threatened us On May eight while abreast of North Carolina we were across from Cape Hatteras once more There the Gulf Stream is seventy five miles wide and two hundred ten meters deep The Nautilus continued to wander at random Seemingly all supervision had been jettisoned Under these conditions I admit that we could easily have gotten away In fact the populous shores offered ready refuge everywhere The sea was plowed continuously by the many steamers providing service between the Gulf of Mexico and New York or Boston and it was crossed night and day by little schooners engaged in coastal trade over various points on the American shore We could hope to be picked up So it was a promising opportunity despite the thirty miles that separated the Nautilus from these Union coasts But one distressing circumstance totally thwarted the Canadian s plans The weather was thoroughly foul We were approaching waterways where storms are commonplace the very homeland of tornadoes and cyclones specifically engendered by the Gulf Stream s current To face a frequently raging sea in a frail skiff was a race to certain disaster Ned Land conceded this himself So he champed at the bit in the grip of an intense homesickness that could be cured only by our escape Sir he told me that day it s got to stop I want to get to the bottom of this Your Nemo s veering away from shore and heading up north But believe you me I had my fill at the South Pole and I m not going with him to the North Pole What can we do Ned since it isn t feasible to escape right now I keep coming back to my idea We ve got to talk to the captain When we were in your own country s seas you didn t say a word Now that we re in mine I intend to speak up Before a few days are out I figure the Nautilus will lie abreast of Nova Scotia and from there to Newfoundland is the mouth of a large gulf and the saint Lawrence empties into that gulf and the saint Lawrence is my own river the river running by Quebec my hometown and when I think about all this my gorge rises and my hair stands on end Honestly sir I d rather jump overboard I can t stay here any longer I m suffocating The Canadian was obviously at the end of his patience His vigorous nature couldn t adapt to this protracted imprisonment His facial appearance was changing by the day His moods grew gloomier and gloomier I had a sense of what he was suffering because I also was gripped by homesickness Nearly seven months had gone by without our having any news from shore Moreover Captain Nemo s reclusiveness his changed disposition and especially his total silence since the battle with the devilfish all made me see things in a different light I no longer felt the enthusiasm of our first days on board You needed to be Flemish like Conseil to accept these circumstances living in a habitat designed for cetaceans and other denizens of the deep Truly if that gallant lad had owned gills instead of lungs I think he would have made an outstanding fish Well sir Ned Land went on seeing that I hadn t replied Well Ned you want me to ask Captain Nemo what he intends to do with us Yes sir Even though he has already made that clear Yes I want it settled once and for all Speak just for me strictly on my behalf if you want But I rarely encounter him He positively avoids me All the more reason you should go look him up I ll confer with him Ned When the Canadian asked insistently When I encounter him Professor Aronnax would you like me to go find him myself No let me do it Tomorrow Today Ned Land said So be it I ll see him today I answered the Canadian who if he took action himself would certainly have ruined everything I was left to myself His request granted I decided to dispose of it immediately I like things over and done with I reentered my stateroom From there I could hear movements inside Captain Nemo s quarters I couldn t pass up this chance for an encounter I knocked on his door I received no reply I knocked again then tried the knob The door opened I entered The captain was there He was bending over his worktable and hadn t heard me Determined not to leave without questioning him I drew closer He looked up sharply with a frowning brow and said in a pretty stern tone Oh it s you What do you want To speak with you captain But I m busy sir I m at work I give you the freedom to enjoy your privacy can t I have the same for myself This reception was less than encouraging But I was determined to give as good as I got Sir I said coolly I need to speak with you on a matter that simply can t wait Whatever could that be sir he replied sarcastically Have you made some discovery that has escaped me Has the sea yielded up some novel secret to you We were miles apart But before I could reply he showed me a manuscript open on the table and told me in a more serious tone Here Professor Aronnax is a manuscript written in several languages It contains a summary of my research under the sea and God willing it won t perish with me Signed with my name complete with my life story this manuscript will be enclosed in a small unsinkable contrivance The last surviving man on the Nautilus will throw this contrivance into the sea and it will go wherever the waves carry it The man s name His life story written by himself So the secret of his existence might someday be unveiled But just then I saw this announcement only as a lead in to my topic Captain I replied I m all praise for this idea you re putting into effect The fruits of your research must not be lost But the methods you re using strike me as primitive Who knows where the winds will take that contrivance into whose hands it may fall Can t you find something better Can t you or one of your men Never sir the captain said swiftly interrupting me But my companions and I would be willing to safeguard this manuscript and if you give us back our freedom Your freedom Captain Nemo put in standing up Yes sir and that s the subject on which I wanted to confer with you For seven months we ve been aboard your vessel and I ask you today in the name of my companions as well as myself if you intend to keep us here forever Professor Aronnax Captain Nemo said I ll answer you today just as I did seven months ago whoever boards the Nautilus must never leave it What you re inflicting on us is outright slavery Call it anything you like But every slave has the right to recover his freedom By any worthwhile available means Who has denied you that right Captain Nemo replied Did I ever try to bind you with your word of honor The captain stared at me crossing his arms Sir I told him to take up this subject a second time would be distasteful to both of us So let s finish what we ve started I repeat it isn t just for myself that I raise this issue To me research is a relief a potent diversion an enticement a passion that can make me forget everything else Like you I m a man neglected and unknown living in the faint hope that someday I can pass on to future generations the fruits of my labors figuratively speaking by means of some contrivance left to the luck of winds and waves In short I can admire you and comfortably go with you while playing a role I only partly understand but I still catch glimpses of other aspects of your life that are surrounded by involvements and secrets that alone on board my companions and I can t share And even when our hearts could beat with yours moved by some of your griefs or stirred by your deeds of courage and genius we ve had to stifle even the slightest token of that sympathy that arises at the sight of something fine and good whether it comes from friend or enemy All right then It s this feeling of being alien to your deepest concerns that makes our situation unacceptable impossible even impossible for me but especially for Ned Land Every man by virtue of his very humanity deserves fair treatment Have you considered how a love of freedom and hatred of slavery could lead to plans of vengeance in a temperament like the Canadian s what he might think attempt endeavor I fell silent Captain Nemo stood up Ned Land can think attempt or endeavor anything he wants what difference is it to me I didn t go looking for him I don t keep him on board for my pleasure As for you Professor Aronnax you re a man able to understand anything even silence I have nothing more to say to you Let this first time you ve come to discuss this subject also be the last because a second time I won t even listen I withdrew From that day forward our position was very strained I reported this conversation to my two companions Now we know Ned said that we can t expect a thing from this man The Nautilus is nearing Long Island We ll escape no matter what the weather But the skies became more and more threatening There were conspicuous signs of a hurricane on the way The atmosphere was turning white and milky Slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were followed on the horizon by layers of nimbocumulus Other low clouds fled swiftly The sea grew towering inflated by long swells Every bird had disappeared except a few petrels friends of the storms The barometer fell significantly indicating a tremendous tension in the surrounding haze The mixture in our stormglass decomposed under the influence of the electricity charging the air A struggle of the elements was approaching The storm burst during the daytime of May thirteen just as the Nautilus was cruising abreast of Long Island a few miles from the narrows to Upper New York Bay I m able to describe this struggle of the elements because Captain Nemo didn t flee into the ocean depths instead from some inexplicable whim he decided to brave it out on the surface The wind was blowing from the southwest initially a stiff breeze in other words with a speed of fifteen meters per second which built to twenty five meters near three o clock in the afternoon This is the figure for major storms Unshaken by these squalls Captain Nemo stationed himself on the platform He was lashed around the waist to withstand the monstrous breakers foaming over the deck I hoisted and attached myself to the same place dividing my wonderment between the storm and this incomparable man who faced it head on The raging sea was swept with huge tattered clouds drenched by the waves I saw no more of the small intervening billows that form in the troughs of the big crests Just long soot colored undulations with crests so compact they didn t foam They kept growing taller They were spurring each other on The Nautilus sometimes lying on its side sometimes standing on end like a mast rolled and pitched frightfully Near five o clock a torrential rain fell but it lulled neither wind nor sea The hurricane was unleashed at a speed of forty five meters per second hence almost forty leagues per hour Under these conditions houses topple roof tiles puncture doors iron railings snap in two and twenty four pounder cannons relocate And yet in the midst of this turmoil the Nautilus lived up to that saying of an expert engineer A well constructed hull can defy any sea This submersible was no resisting rock that waves could demolish it was a steel spindle obediently in motion without rigging or masting and able to brave their fury with impunity Meanwhile I was carefully examining these unleashed breakers They measured up to fifteen meters in height over a length of one hundred fifty to one hundred seventy five meters and the speed of their propagation half that of the wind was fifteen meters per second Their volume and power increased with the depth of the waters I then understood the role played by these waves which trap air in their flanks and release it in the depths of the sea where its oxygen brings life Their utmost pressure it has been calculated can build to three thousand kilograms on every square foot of surface they strike It was such waves in the Hebrides that repositioned a stone block weighing eighty four thousand pounds It was their relatives in the tidal wave on December twenty three eighteen fifty four that toppled part of the Japanese city of Tokyo then went that same day at seven hundred kilometers per hour to break on the beaches of America After nightfall the storm grew in intensity As in the eighteen sixty cyclone on Reunion Island the barometer fell to seven hundred ten millimeters At the close of day I saw a big ship passing on the horizon struggling painfully It lay to at half steam in an effort to hold steady on the waves It must have been a steamer on one of those lines out of New York to Liverpool or Le Havre It soon vanished into the shadows At ten o clock in the evening the skies caught on fire The air was streaked with violent flashes of lightning I couldn t stand this brightness but Captain Nemo stared straight at it as if to inhale the spirit of the storm A dreadful noise filled the air a complicated noise made up of the roar of crashing breakers the howl of the wind claps of thunder The wind shifted to every point of the horizon and the cyclone left the east to return there after passing through north west and south moving in the opposite direction of revolving storms in the southern hemisphere Oh that Gulf Stream It truly lives up to its nickname the Lord of Storms All by itself it creates these fearsome cyclones through the difference in temperature between its currents and the superimposed layers of air The rain was followed by a downpour of fire Droplets of water changed into exploding tufts You would have thought Captain Nemo was courting a death worthy of himself seeking to be struck by lightning In one hideous pitching movement the Nautilus reared its steel spur into the air like a lightning rod and I saw long sparks shoot down it Shattered at the end of my strength I slid flat on my belly to the hatch I opened it and went below to the lounge By then the storm had reached its maximum intensity It was impossible to stand upright inside the Nautilus Captain Nemo reentered near midnight I could hear the ballast tanks filling little by little and the Nautilus sank gently beneath the surface of the waves Through the lounge s open windows I saw large frightened fish passing like phantoms in the fiery waters Some were struck by lightning right before my eyes The Nautilus kept descending I thought it would find calm again at fifteen meters down No The upper strata were too violently agitated It needed to sink to fifty meters searching for a resting place in the bowels of the sea But once there what tranquility we found what silence what peace all around us Who would have known that a dreadful hurricane was then unleashed on the surface of this ocean CHAPTER twenty In Latitude forty seven

839_130898_000007_000000	train-clean-100	IN THE AFTERMATH of this storm we were thrown back to the east Away went any hope of
839_130898_000008_000000	train-clean-100	escaping to the landing places of New York or the saint Lawrence In despair poor Ned went into seclusion like Captain Nemo 
none	none	Conseil and I no longer left each other 
839_130898_000009_000000	train-clean-100	As I said the Nautilus veered to the east 
839_130898_000009_000001	train-clean-100	To be more accurate I should have said to the northeast 
none	none	Sometimes on the surface of the waves sometimes beneath them the ship wandered for days amid these mists so feared by navigators These are caused chiefly by melting ice which keeps the air extremely damp How many ships have perished in these waterways as they tried to get directions from the hazy lights on the coast How many casualties have been caused by these opaque mists How many collisions have occurred with these reefs where the breaking surf is covered by the noise of the wind How many vessels have rammed each other despite their running lights despite the warnings given by their bosun s pipes and alarm bells So the floor of this sea had the appearance of a battlefield where every ship defeated by the ocean still lay some already old and encrusted others newer and reflecting our beacon light on their ironwork and copper undersides Among these vessels how many went down with all hands with their crews and hosts of immigrants at these trouble spots so prominent in the statistics Cape Race saint Paul Island the Strait of Belle Isle the saint Lawrence estuary And in only a few years how many victims have been furnished to the obituary notices by the Royal Mail Inman and Montreal lines by vessels named the Solway the Isis the Paramatta the Hungarian the Canadian the Anglo Saxon the Humboldt and the United States all run aground by the Arctic and the Lyonnais sunk in collisions by the President the Pacific and the City of Glasgow lost for reasons unknown in the midst of their gloomy rubble the Nautilus navigated as if passing the dead in review By May fifteen we were off the southern tip of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland 
839_130898_000011_000001	train-clean-100	These banks are the result of marine sedimentation an extensive accumulation of organic waste brought either from the equator by the Gulf Stream s current or from the North Pole by the countercurrent of cold water that skirts the American coast Here too erratically drifting chunks collect from the ice breakup Here a huge boneyard forms from fish mollusks and zoophytes dying over it by the billions 
none	none	The sea is of no great depth at the Grand Banks A few hundred fathoms at best 
839_130898_000012_000002	train-clean-100	But to the south there is a deep suddenly occurring depression a three thousand meter pit 
none	none	Here the Gulf Stream widens Its waters come to full bloom It loses its speed and temperature but it turns into a sea Among the fish that the Nautilus startled on its way I ll mention a one meter lumpfish blackish on top with orange on the belly and rare among its brethren in that it practices monogamy a good sized eelpout a type of emerald moray whose flavor is excellent wolffish with big eyes in a head somewhat resembling a canine s viviparous blennies whose eggs hatch inside their bodies like those of snakes bloated gobio or black gudgeon measuring two decimeters grenadiers with long tails and gleaming with a silvery glow speedy fish venturing far from their High Arctic seas Our nets also hauled in a bold daring vigorous and muscular fish armed with prickles on its head and stings on its fins a real scorpion measuring two to three meters the ruthless enemy of cod blennies and salmon it was the bullhead of the northerly seas a fish with red fins and a brown body covered with nodules The Nautilus s fishermen had some trouble getting a grip on this animal which thanks to the formation of its gill covers can protect its respiratory organs from any parching contact with the air and can live out of water for a good while And I ll mention for the record some little banded blennies that follow ships into the northernmost seas sharp snouted carp exclusive to the north Atlantic scorpionfish and lastly the gadoid family chiefly the cod species which I detected in their waters of choice over these inexhaustible Grand Banks 
839_130898_000016_000000	train-clean-100	Because Newfoundland is simply an underwater peak you could call these cod mountain fish 
839_130898_000016_000001	train-clean-100	While the Nautilus was clearing a path through their tight ranks Conseil couldn t refrain from making this comment 
839_130898_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Mercy look at these cod he said 
839_130898_000017_000001	train-clean-100	 Why I thought cod were flat like dab or sole 
none	none	Innocent boy I exclaimed Cod are flat only at the grocery store where they re cut open and spread out on display But in the water they re like mullet spindle shaped and perfectly built for speed I can easily believe master Conseil replied
839_130898_000019_000001	train-clean-100	 But what crowds of them 
839_130898_000019_000002	train-clean-100	What swarms 
none	none	Bah My friend there d be many more without their enemies scorpionfish and human beings Do you know how many eggs have been counted in a single female
839_130898_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 I ll go all out Conseil replied 
none	none	five hundred thousand eleven million my friend eleven million I refuse to accept that until I count them myself So count them Conseil 
839_130898_000024_000001	train-clean-100	But it would be less work to believe me Besides Frenchmen Englishmen Americans Danes and Norwegians catch these cod by the thousands 
839_130898_000024_000002	train-clean-100	They re eaten in prodigious quantities and without the astonishing fertility of these fish the seas would soon be depopulated of them 
none	none	Accordingly in England and America alone five thousand ships manned by seventy five thousand seamen go after cod Each ship brings back an average catch of four thousand four hundred fish making twenty two million Off the coast of Norway the total is the same Fine Conseil replied I ll take master s word for it I won t count them
839_130898_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Count what 
none	none	Those eleven million eggs 
839_130898_000027_000001	train-clean-100	But I ll make one comment 
none	none	What s that
839_130898_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 If all their eggs hatched just four codfish could feed England America and Norway 
none	none	As we skimmed the depths of the Grand Banks I could see perfectly those long fishing lines each armed with two hundred hooks that every boat dangled by the dozens The lower end of each line dragged the bottom by means of a small grappling iron and at the surface it was secured to the buoy rope of a cork float The Nautilus had to maneuver shrewdly in the midst of this underwater spiderweb But the ship didn t stay long in these heavily traveled waterways It went up to about latitude forty two degrees This brought it abreast of saint John s in Newfoundland and Heart s Content where the Atlantic Cable reaches its end point 
839_130898_000032_000000	train-clean-100	Instead of continuing north the Nautilus took an easterly heading as if to go along this plateau on which the telegraph cable rests where multiple soundings have given the contours of the terrain with the utmost accuracy 
none	none	It was on May seventeen about five hundred miles from Heart s Content and twenty eight hundred meters down that I spotted this cable lying on the seafloor Conseil whom I hadn t alerted mistook it at first for a gigantic sea snake and was gearing up to classify it in his best manner But I enlightened the fine lad and let him down gently by giving him various details on the laying of this cable The first cable was put down during the years eighteen fifty seven eighteen fifty eight but after transmitting about four hundred telegrams it went dead In eighteen sixty three engineers built a new cable that measured three thousand four hundred kilometers weighed four thousand five hundred metric tons and was shipped aboard the Great Eastern This attempt also failed 
839_130898_000035_000000	train-clean-100	Now then on May twenty five while submerged to a depth of three thousand eight hundred thirty six meters the Nautilus lay in precisely the locality where this second cable suffered the rupture that ruined the undertaking It happened six hundred thirty eight miles from the coast of Ireland 
none	none	At around two o clock in the afternoon all contact with Europe broke off The electricians on board decided to cut the cable before fishing it up and by eleven o clock that evening they had retrieved the damaged part They repaired the joint and its splice then the cable was resubmerged But a few days later it snapped again and couldn t be recovered from the ocean depths These Americans refused to give up 
839_130898_000036_000001	train-clean-100	The daring Cyrus Field who had risked his whole fortune to promote this undertaking called for a new bond issue 
839_130898_000036_000002	train-clean-100	It sold out immediately 
839_130898_000036_000003	train-clean-100	Another cable was put down under better conditions 
none	none	Its sheaves of conducting wire were insulated within a gutta percha covering which was protected by a padding of textile material enclosed in a metal sheath The Great Eastern put back to sea on July thirteen eighteen sixty six 
839_130898_000037_000000	train-clean-100	The operation proceeded apace 
none	none	Yet there was one hitch As they gradually unrolled this third cable the electricians observed on several occasions that someone had recently driven nails into it trying to damage its core Captain Anderson his officers and the engineers put their heads together then posted a warning that if the culprit were detected he would be thrown overboard without a trial After that these villainous attempts were not repeated 
839_130898_000038_000000	train-clean-100	By July twenty three the Great Eastern was lying no farther than eight hundred kilometers from Newfoundland when it received telegraphed news from Ireland of an armistice signed between Prussia and Austria after the Battle of Sadova 
839_130898_000038_000001	train-clean-100	Through the mists on the twenty seventh it sighted the port of Heart s Content 
839_130898_000038_000002	train-clean-100	The undertaking had ended happily and in its first dispatch young America addressed old Europe with these wise words so rarely understood Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth to men of good will 
839_130898_000039_000000	train-clean-100	I didn t expect to find this electric cable in mint condition as it looked on leaving its place of manufacture 
839_130898_000039_000001	train-clean-100	The long snake was covered with seashell rubble and bristling with foraminifera a crust of caked gravel protected it from any mollusks that might bore into it 
none	none	It rested serenely sheltered from the sea s motions under a pressure favorable to the transmission of that electric spark that goes from America to Europe in thirty two one hundred of a second This cable will no doubt last indefinitely because as observers note its gutta percha casing is improved by a stay in salt water 
839_130898_000040_000000	train-clean-100	Besides on this well chosen plateau the cable never lies at depths that could cause a break 
none	none	The Nautilus followed it to its lowest reaches located four thousand four hundred thirty one meters down and even there it rested without any stress or strain 
839_130898_000040_000002	train-clean-100	Then we returned to the locality where the eighteen sixty three accident had taken place 
none	none	There the ocean floor formed a valley one hundred twenty kilometers wide into which you could fit Mt Blanc without its summit poking above the surface of the waves This valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall two thousand meters high We arrived there on May twenty eight and the Nautilus lay no farther than one hundred fifty kilometers from Ireland 
839_130898_000042_000000	train-clean-100	Would Captain Nemo head up north and beach us on the British Isles No Much to my surprise he went back down south and returned to European seas 
839_130898_000042_000001	train-clean-100	As we swung around the Emerald Isle I spotted Cape Clear for an instant plus the lighthouse on Fastnet Rock that guides all those thousands of ships setting out from Glasgow or Liverpool 
839_130898_000043_000000	train-clean-100	An important question then popped into my head 
839_130898_000043_000001	train-clean-100	Would the Nautilus dare to tackle the English Channel 
839_130898_000043_000002	train-clean-100	Ned Land who promptly reappeared after we hugged shore never stopped questioning me What could I answer him 
839_130898_000043_000003	train-clean-100	Captain Nemo remained invisible After giving the Canadian a glimpse of American shores was he about to show me the coast of France 
839_130898_000044_000000	train-clean-100	But the Nautilus kept gravitating southward 
none	none	On May thirty in sight of Land s End it passed between the lowermost tip of England and the Scilly Islands which it left behind to starboard 
839_130898_000045_000000	train-clean-100	If it was going to enter the English Channel it clearly needed to head east 
none	none	It did not 
839_130898_000046_000000	train-clean-100	All day long on May thirty one the Nautilus swept around the sea in a series of circles that had me deeply puzzled 
839_130898_000046_000001	train-clean-100	It seemed to be searching for a locality that it had some trouble finding At noon Captain Nemo himself came to take our bearings He didn t address a word to me 
none	none	He looked gloomier than ever What was filling him with such sadness 
839_130898_000046_000003	train-clean-100	Was it our proximity to these European shores 
none	none	Was he reliving his memories of that country he had left behind 
839_130898_000046_000005	train-clean-100	If so what did he feel 
839_130898_000046_000006	train-clean-100	Remorse or regret For a good while these thoughts occupied my mind and I had a hunch that fate would soon give away the captain s secrets 
839_130898_000047_000000	train-clean-100	The next day June one the Nautilus kept to the same tack It was obviously trying to locate some precise spot in the ocean Just as on the day before Captain Nemo came to take the altitude of the sun 
839_130898_000047_000001	train-clean-100	The sea was smooth the skies clear 
839_130898_000047_000002	train-clean-100	Eight miles to the east a big steamship was visible on the horizon line No flag was flapping from the gaff of its fore and aft sail and I couldn t tell its nationality 
none	none	A few minutes before the sun passed its zenith Captain Nemo raised his sextant and took his sights with the utmost precision The absolute calm of the waves facilitated this operation The Nautilus lay motionless neither rolling nor pitching 
839_130898_000049_000000	train-clean-100	I was on the platform just then 
839_130898_000049_000001	train-clean-100	After determining our position the captain pronounced only these words 
none	none	It s right here 
839_130898_000051_000000	train-clean-100	He went down the hatch 
none	none	Had he seen that vessel change course and seemingly head toward us I m unable to say I returned to the lounge The hatch closed and I heard water hissing in the ballast tanks The Nautilus began to sink on a vertical line because its propeller was in check and no longer furnished any forward motion 
839_130898_000053_000000	train-clean-100	Some minutes later it stopped at a depth of eight hundred thirty three meters and came to rest on the seafloor 
839_130898_000054_000000	train-clean-100	The ceiling lights in the lounge then went out the panels opened and through the windows I saw for a half mile radius the sea brightly lit by the beacon s rays 
839_130898_000055_000000	train-clean-100	I looked to port and saw nothing but the immenseness of these tranquil waters 
none	none	To starboard a prominent bulge on the sea bottom caught my attention You would have thought it was some ruin enshrouded in a crust of whitened seashells as if under a mantle of snow Carefully examining this mass I could identify the swollen outlines of a ship shorn of its masts which must have sunk bow first This casualty certainly dated from some far off time To be so caked with the limestone of these waters this wreckage must have spent many a year on the ocean floor 
839_130898_000057_000000	train-clean-100	What ship was this 
none	none	Why had the Nautilus come to visit its grave Was it something other than a maritime accident that had dragged this craft under the waters I wasn t sure what to think but next to me I heard Captain Nemo s voice slowly say Originally this ship was christened the Marseillais It carried seventy four cannons and was launched in seventeen sixty two On August thirteen seventeen seventy eight commanded by La Poype Vertrieux it fought valiantly against the Preston 
839_130898_000059_000003	train-clean-100	On July four seventeen seventy nine as a member of the squadron under Admiral d Estaing it assisted in the capture of the island of Grenada 
839_130898_000059_000004	train-clean-100	On September five seventeen eighty one under the Count de Grasse it took part in the Battle of Chesapeake Bay 
none	none	In seventeen ninety four the new Republic of France changed the name of this ship On April sixteen of that same year it joined the squadron at Brest under Rear Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse who was entrusted with escorting a convoy of wheat coming from America under the command of Admiral Van Stabel In this second year of the French Revolutionary Calendar on the eleventh and twelfth days in the Month of Pasture this squadron fought an encounter with English vessels 
839_130898_000059_000008	train-clean-100	Sir today is June one eighteen sixty eight or the thirteenth day in the Month of Pasture 
none	none	Seventy four years ago to the day at this very spot in latitude forty seven degrees twenty four and longitude seventeen degrees twenty eight this ship sank after a heroic battle its three masts gone water in its hold a third of its crew out of action it preferred to go to the bottom with its three hundred fifty six seamen rather than surrender and with its flag nailed up on the afterdeck it disappeared beneath the waves to shouts of Long live the Republic This is the Avenger I exclaimed Yes sir The Avenger A splendid name Captain Nemo murmured crossing his arms CHAPTER twenty one A Mass Execution THE WAY HE SAID THIS the unexpectedness of this scene first the biography of this patriotic ship then the excitement with which this eccentric individual pronounced these last words the name Avenger whose significance could not escape me all this taken together had a profound impact on my mind My eyes never left the captain Hands outstretched toward the sea he contemplated the proud wreck with blazing eyes Perhaps I would never learn who he was where he came from or where he was heading but more and more I could see a distinction between the man and the scientist It was no ordinary misanthropy that kept Captain Nemo and his companions sequestered inside the Nautilus s plating but a hate so monstrous or so sublime that the passing years could never weaken it Did this hate also hunger for vengeance Time would soon tell Meanwhile the Nautilus rose slowly to the surface of the sea and I watched the Avenger s murky shape disappearing little by little Soon a gentle rolling told me that we were afloat in the open air Just then a hollow explosion was audible I looked at the captain The captain did not stir Captain I said He didn t reply I left him and climbed onto the platform Conseil and the Canadian were already there What caused that explosion I asked A cannon going off Ned Land replied I stared in the direction of the ship I had spotted It was heading toward the Nautilus and you could tell it had put on steam Six miles separated it from us What sort of craft is it Ned From its rigging and its low masts the Canadian replied I bet it s a warship Here s hoping it pulls up and sinks this damned Nautilus Ned my friend Conseil replied what harm could it do the Nautilus Will it attack us under the waves Will it cannonade us at the bottom of the sea Tell me Ned I asked can you make out the nationality of that craft Creasing his brow lowering his lids and puckering the corners of his eyes the Canadian focused the full power of his gaze on the ship for a short while No sir he replied I can t make out what nation it s from It s flying no flag But I ll swear it s a warship because there s a long pennant streaming from the peak of its mainmast For a quarter of an hour we continued to watch the craft bearing down on us But it was inconceivable to me that it had discovered the Nautilus at such a distance still less that it knew what this underwater machine really was Soon the Canadian announced that the craft was a big battleship a double decker ironclad complete with ram Dark dense smoke burst from its two funnels Its furled sails merged with the lines of its yardarms The gaff of its fore and aft sail flew no flag Its distance still kept us from distinguishing the colors of its pennant which was fluttering like a thin ribbon It was coming on fast If Captain Nemo let it approach a chance for salvation might be available to us Sir Ned Land told me if that boat gets within a mile of us I m jumping overboard and I suggest you follow suit I didn t reply to the Canadian s proposition but kept watching the ship which was looming larger on the horizon Whether it was English French American or Russian it would surely welcome us aboard if we could just get to it Master may recall Conseil then said that we have some experience with swimming He can rely on me to tow him to that vessel if he s agreeable to going with our friend Ned Before I could reply white smoke streamed from the battleship s bow Then a few seconds later the waters splashed astern of the Nautilus disturbed by the fall of a heavy object Soon after an explosion struck my ears What s this They re firing at us I exclaimed Good lads the Canadian muttered That means they don t see us as castaways clinging to some wreckage With all due respect to master gracious Conseil put in shaking off the water that had sprayed over him from another shell With all due respect to master they ve discovered the narwhale and they re cannonading the same But it must be clear to them I exclaimed that they re dealing with human beings Maybe that s why Ned Land replied staring hard at me The full truth dawned on me Undoubtedly people now knew where they stood on the existence of this so called monster Undoubtedly the latter s encounter with the Abraham Lincoln when the Canadian hit it with his harpoon had led Commander Farragut to recognize the narwhale as actually an underwater boat more dangerous than any unearthly cetacean Yes this had to be the case and undoubtedly they were now chasing this dreadful engine of destruction on every sea Dreadful indeed if as we could assume Captain Nemo had been using the Nautilus in works of vengeance That night in the middle of the Indian Ocean when he imprisoned us in the cell hadn t he attacked some ship That man now buried in the coral cemetery wasn t he the victim of some collision caused by the Nautilus Yes I repeat this had to be the case One part of Captain Nemo s secret life had been unveiled And now even though his identity was still unknown at least the nations allied against him knew they were no longer hunting some fairy tale monster but a man who had sworn an implacable hate toward them This whole fearsome sequence of events appeared in my mind s eye Instead of encountering friends on this approaching ship we would find only pitiless enemies Meanwhile shells fell around us in increasing numbers Some meeting the liquid surface would ricochet and vanish into the sea at considerable distances But none of them reached the Nautilus By then the ironclad was no more than three miles off Despite its violent cannonade Captain Nemo hadn t appeared on the platform And yet if one of those conical shells had scored a routine hit on the Nautilus s hull it could have been fatal to him The Canadian then told me Sir we ve got to do everything we can to get out of this jam Let s signal them Damnation Maybe they ll realize we re decent people Ned Land pulled out his handkerchief to wave it in the air But he had barely unfolded it when he was felled by an iron fist and despite his great strength he tumbled to the deck Scum the captain shouted Do you want to be nailed to the Nautilus s spur before it charges that ship Dreadful to hear Captain Nemo was even more dreadful to see His face was pale from some spasm of his heart which must have stopped beating for an instant His pupils were hideously contracted His voice was no longer speaking it was bellowing Bending from the waist he shook the Canadian by the shoulders Then dropping Ned and turning to the battleship whose shells were showering around him O ship of an accursed nation you know who I am he shouted in his powerful voice And I don t need your colors to recognize you Look I ll show you mine And in the bow of the platform Captain Nemo unfurled a black flag like the one he had left planted at the South Pole Just then a shell hit the Nautilus s hull obliquely failed to breach it ricocheted near the captain and vanished into the sea Captain Nemo shrugged his shoulders Then addressing me Go below he told me in a curt tone You and your companions go below Sir I exclaimed are you going to attack this ship Sir I m going to sink it You wouldn t I will Captain Nemo replied icily You re ill advised to pass judgment on me sir Fate has shown you what you weren t meant to see The attack has come Our reply will be dreadful Get back inside From what country is that ship You don t know Fine so much the better At least its nationality will remain a secret to you Go below The Canadian Conseil and I could only obey Some fifteen of the Nautilus s seamen surrounded their captain and stared with a feeling of implacable hate at the ship bearing down on them You could feel the same spirit of vengeance enkindling their every soul I went below just as another projectile scraped the Nautilus s hull and I heard the captain exclaim Shoot you demented vessel Shower your futile shells You won t escape the Nautilus s spur But this isn t the place where you ll perish I don t want your wreckage mingling with that of the Avenger I repaired to my stateroom The captain and his chief officer stayed on the platform The propeller was set in motion The Nautilus swiftly retreated putting us outside the range of the vessel s shells But the chase continued and Captain Nemo was content to keep his distance Near four o clock in the afternoon unable to control the impatience and uneasiness devouring me I went back to the central companionway The hatch was open I ventured onto the platform The captain was still strolling there his steps agitated He stared at the ship which stayed to his leeward five or six miles off He was circling it like a wild beast drawing it eastward letting it chase after him Yet he didn t attack Was he perhaps still undecided I tried to intervene one last time But I had barely queried Captain Nemo when the latter silenced me I m the law I m the tribunal I m the oppressed and there are my oppressors Thanks to them I ve witnessed the destruction of everything I loved cherished and venerated homeland wife children father and mother There lies everything I hate Not another word out of you I took a last look at the battleship which was putting on steam Then I rejoined Ned and Conseil We ll escape I exclaimed Good Ned put in Where s that ship from I ve no idea But wherever it s from it will sink before nightfall In any event it s better to perish with it than be accomplices in some act of revenge whose merits we can t gauge That s my feeling Ned Land replied coolly Let s wait for nightfall Night fell A profound silence reigned on board The compass indicated that the Nautilus hadn t changed direction I could hear the beat of its propeller churning the waves with steady speed Staying on the surface of the water it rolled gently sometimes to one side sometimes to the other My companions and I had decided to escape as soon as the vessel came close enough for us to be heard or seen because the moon would wax full in three days and was shining brightly Once we were aboard that ship if we couldn t ward off the blow that threatened it at least we could do everything that circumstances permitted Several times I thought the Nautilus was about to attack But it was content to let its adversary approach and then it would quickly resume its retreating ways Part of the night passed without incident We kept watch for an opportunity to take action We talked little being too keyed up Ned Land was all for jumping overboard I forced him to wait As I saw it the Nautilus would attack the double decker on the surface of the waves and then it would be not only possible but easy to escape At three o clock in the morning full of uneasiness I climbed onto the platform Captain Nemo hadn t left it He stood in the bow next to his flag which a mild breeze was unfurling above his head His eyes never left that vessel The extraordinary intensity of his gaze seemed to attract it beguile it and draw it more surely than if he had it in tow The moon then passed its zenith Jupiter was rising in the east In the midst of this placid natural setting sky and ocean competed with each other in tranquility and the sea offered the orb of night the loveliest mirror ever to reflect its image And when I compared this deep calm of the elements with all the fury seething inside the plating of this barely perceptible Nautilus I shivered all over The vessel was two miles off It drew nearer always moving toward the phosphorescent glow that signaled the Nautilus s presence I saw its green and red running lights plus the white lantern hanging from the large stay of its foremast Hazy flickerings were reflected on its rigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the limit Showers of sparks and cinders of flaming coal escaped from its funnels spangling the air with stars I stood there until six o clock in the morning Captain Nemo never seeming to notice me The vessel lay a mile and a half off and with the first glimmers of daylight it resumed its cannonade The time couldn t be far away when the Nautilus would attack its adversary and my companions and I would leave forever this man I dared not judge I was about to go below to alert them when the chief officer climbed onto the platform Several seamen were with him Captain Nemo didn t see them or didn t want to see them They carried out certain procedures that on the Nautilus you could call clearing the decks for action They were quite simple The manropes that formed a handrail around the platform were lowered Likewise the pilothouse and the beacon housing were withdrawn into the hull until they lay exactly flush with it The surface of this long sheet iron cigar no longer offered a single protrusion that could hamper its maneuvers I returned to the lounge The Nautilus still emerged above the surface A few morning gleams infiltrated the liquid strata Beneath the undulations of the billows the windows were enlivened by the blushing of the rising sun That dreadful day of June two had dawned At seven o clock the log told me that the Nautilus had reduced speed I realized that it was letting the warship approach Moreover the explosions grew more intensely audible Shells furrowed the water around us drilling through it with an odd hissing sound My friends I said it s time Let s shake hands and may God be with us Ned Land was determined Conseil calm I myself nervous and barely in control We went into the library Just as I pushed open the door leading to the well of the central companionway I heard the hatch close sharply overhead The Canadian leaped up the steps but I stopped him A well known hissing told me that water was entering the ship s ballast tanks Indeed in a few moments the Nautilus had submerged some meters below the surface of the waves I understood this maneuver It was too late to take action The Nautilus wasn t going to strike the double decker where it was clad in impenetrable iron armor but below its waterline where the metal carapace no longer protected its planking We were prisoners once more unwilling spectators at the performance of this gruesome drama But we barely had time to think Taking refuge in my stateroom we stared at each other without pronouncing a word My mind was in a total daze My mental processes came to a dead stop I hovered in that painful state that predominates during the period of anticipation before some frightful explosion I waited I listened I lived only through my sense of hearing Meanwhile the Nautilus s speed had increased appreciably So it was gathering momentum Its entire hull was vibrating Suddenly I let out a yell There had been a collision but it was comparatively mild I could feel the penetrating force of the steel spur I could hear scratchings and scrapings Carried away with its driving power the Nautilus had passed through the vessel s mass like a sailmaker s needle through canvas I couldn t hold still Frantic going insane I leaped out of my stateroom and rushed into the lounge Captain Nemo was there Mute gloomy implacable he was staring through the port panel An enormous mass was sinking beneath the waters and the Nautilus missing none of its death throes was descending into the depths with it Ten meters away I could see its gaping hull into which water was rushing with a sound of thunder then its double rows of cannons and railings Its deck was covered with dark quivering shadows The water was rising Those poor men leaped up into the shrouds clung to the masts writhed beneath the waters It was a human anthill that an invading sea had caught by surprise Paralyzed rigid with anguish my hair standing on end my eyes popping out of my head short of breath suffocating speechless I stared I too I was glued to the window by an irresistible allure The enormous vessel settled slowly Following it down the Nautilus kept watch on its every movement Suddenly there was an eruption The air compressed inside the craft sent its decks flying as if the powder stores had been ignited The thrust of the waters was so great the Nautilus swerved away The poor ship then sank more swiftly Its mastheads appeared laden with victims then its crosstrees bending under clusters of men finally the peak of its mainmast Then the dark mass disappeared and with it a crew of corpses dragged under by fearsome eddies I turned to Captain Nemo This dreadful executioner this true archangel of hate was still staring When it was all over Captain Nemo headed to the door of his stateroom opened it and entered I followed him with my eyes On the rear paneling beneath the portraits of his heroes I saw the portrait of a still youthful woman with two little children Captain Nemo stared at them for a few moments stretched out his arms to them sank to his knees and melted into sobs CHAPTER twenty two The Last Words of Captain Nemo THE PANELS CLOSED over this frightful view but the lights didn t go on in the lounge Inside the Nautilus all was gloom and silence It left this place of devastation with prodigious speed one hundred feet beneath the waters Where was it going North or south Where would the man flee after this horrible act of revenge I reentered my stateroom where Ned and Conseil were waiting silently Captain Nemo filled me with insurmountable horror Whatever he had once suffered at the hands of humanity he had no right to mete out such punishment He had made me if not an accomplice at least an eyewitness to his vengeance Even this was intolerable 
836_130900_000005_000000	train-clean-360	At eleven o clock the electric lights came back on 
none	none	I went into the lounge It was deserted I consulted the various instruments The Nautilus was fleeing northward at a speed of twenty five miles per hour sometimes on the surface of the sea sometimes thirty feet beneath it After our position had been marked on the chart I saw that we were passing into the mouth of the English Channel that our heading would take us to the northernmost seas with incomparable speed I could barely glimpse the swift passing of longnose sharks hammerhead sharks spotted dogfish that frequent these waters big eagle rays swarms of seahorse looking like knights on a chessboard eels quivering like fireworks serpents armies of crab that fled obliquely by crossing their pincers over their carapaces finally schools of porpoise that held contests of speed with the Nautilus But by this point observing studying and classifying were out of the question 
836_130900_000008_000000	train-clean-360	By evening we had cleared two hundred leagues up the Atlantic 
none	none	Shadows gathered and gloom overran the sea until the moon came up I repaired to my stateroom 
836_130900_000009_000001	train-clean-360	I couldn t sleep 
none	none	I was assaulted by nightmares That horrible scene of destruction kept repeating in my mind s eye From that day forward who knows where the Nautilus took us in the north Atlantic basin 
836_130900_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Always at incalculable speed Always amid the High Arctic mists 
none	none	Did it call at the capes of Spitzbergen or the shores of Novaya Zemlya Did it visit such uncharted seas as the White Sea the Kara Sea the Gulf of Ob the Lyakhov Islands or those unknown beaches on the Siberian coast I m unable to say I lost track of the passing hours Time was in abeyance on the ship s clocks As happens in the polar regions it seemed that night and day no longer followed their normal sequence I felt myself being drawn into that strange domain where the overwrought imagination of Edgar Allan Poe was at home Like his fabled Arthur Gordon Pym I expected any moment to see that shrouded human figure very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men thrown across the cataract that protects the outskirts of the pole I estimate but perhaps I m mistaken that the Nautilus s haphazard course continued for fifteen or twenty days and I m not sure how long this would have gone on without the catastrophe that ended our voyage As for Captain Nemo he was no longer in the picture As for his chief officer the same applied Not one crewman was visible for a single instant The Nautilus cruised beneath the waters almost continuously When it rose briefly to the surface to renew our air the hatches opened and closed as if automated No more positions were reported on the world map I didn t know where we were I ll also mention that the Canadian at the end of his strength and patience made no further appearances Conseil couldn t coax a single word out of him and feared that in a fit of delirium while under the sway of a ghastly homesickness Ned would kill himself So he kept a devoted watch on his friend every instant You can appreciate that under these conditions our situation had become untenable One morning whose date I m unable to specify I was slumbering near the first hours of daylight a painful sickly slumber Waking up I saw Ned Land leaning over me and I heard him tell me in a low voice
836_130900_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 We re going to escape 
none	none	I sat up
836_130900_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 When I asked 
none	none	Tonight There doesn t seem to be any supervision left on the Nautilus You d think a total daze was reigning on board Will you be ready sir Yes Where are we In sight of land I saw it through the mists just this morning twenty miles to the east
836_130900_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 What land is it 
none	none	I ve no idea but whatever it is there we ll take refuge Yes Ned 
836_130900_000023_000001	train-clean-360	We ll escape tonight even if the sea swallows us up 
none	none	The sea s rough the wind s blowing hard but a twenty mile run in the Nautilus s nimble longboat doesn t scare me Unknown to the crew I ve stowed some food and flasks of water inside I m with you
836_130900_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 What s more the Canadian added if they catch me I ll defend myself I ll fight to the death 
836_130900_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Then we ll die together Ned my friend 
none	none	My mind was made up The Canadian left me 
836_130900_000028_000002	train-clean-360	I went out on the platform where I could barely stand upright against the jolts of the billows The skies were threatening but land lay inside those dense mists and we had to escape 
none	none	Not a single day or even a single hour could we afford to lose I returned to the lounge dreading yet desiring an encounter with Captain Nemo wanting yet not wanting to see him What would I say to him How could I hide the involuntary horror he inspired in me No 
836_130900_000029_000003	train-clean-360	It was best not to meet him face to face Best to try and forget him 
none	none	And yet How long that day seemed the last I would spend aboard the Nautilus I was left to myself Ned Land and Conseil avoided speaking to me afraid they would give themselves away 
836_130900_000031_000000	train-clean-360	At six o clock I ate supper but I had no appetite 
none	none	Despite my revulsion I forced it down wanting to keep my strength up 
836_130900_000032_000000	train-clean-360	At six thirty Ned Land entered my stateroom 
none	none	He told me We won t see each other again before we go 
836_130900_000033_000001	train-clean-360	At ten o clock the moon won t be up yet 
836_130900_000033_000002	train-clean-360	We ll take advantage of the darkness Come to the skiff 
none	none	Conseil and I will be inside waiting for you The Canadian left without giving me time to answer him I wanted to verify the Nautilus s heading I made my way to the lounge We were racing north northeast with frightful speed fifty meters down I took one last look at the natural wonders and artistic treasures amassed in the museum this unrivaled collection doomed to perish someday in the depths of the seas together with its curator I wanted to establish one supreme impression in my mind I stayed there an hour basking in the aura of the ceiling lights passing in review the treasures shining in their glass cases Then I returned to my stateroom There I dressed in sturdy seafaring clothes I gathered my notes and packed them tenderly about my person 
836_130900_000037_000002	train-clean-360	My heart was pounding mightily I couldn t curb its pulsations 
none	none	My anxiety and agitation would certainly have given me away if Captain Nemo had seen me 
836_130900_000038_000000	train-clean-360	What was he doing just then 
836_130900_000038_000001	train-clean-360	I listened at the door to his stateroom I heard the sound of footsteps 
none	none	Captain Nemo was inside He hadn t gone to bed With his every movement I imagined he would appear and ask me why I wanted to escape I felt in a perpetual state of alarm My imagination magnified this sensation The feeling became so acute I wondered whether it wouldn t be better to enter the captain s stateroom dare him face to face brave it out with word and deed It was an insane idea Fortunately I controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation My nerves calmed a little but with my brain so aroused I did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the Nautilus every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since I went overboard from the Abraham Lincoln the underwater hunting trip the Torres Strait our running aground the savages of Papua the coral cemetery the Suez passageway the island of Santorini the Cretan diver the Bay of Vigo Atlantis the Ice Bank the South Pole our imprisonment in the ice the battle with the devilfish the storm in the Gulf Stream the Avenger and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew All these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater In this strange setting Captain Nemo then grew fantastically His features were accentuated taking on superhuman proportions He was no longer my equal he was the Man of the Waters the Spirit of the Seas By then it was nine thirty I held my head in both hands to keep it from bursting I closed my eyes 
836_130900_000040_000003	train-clean-360	I no longer wanted to think A half hour still to wait 
none	none	A half hour of nightmares that could drive me insane Just then I heard indistinct chords from the organ melancholy harmonies from some undefinable hymn actual pleadings from a soul trying to sever its earthly ties I listened with all my senses at once barely breathing immersed like Captain Nemo in this musical trance that was drawing him beyond the bounds of this world 
836_130900_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Then a sudden thought terrified me 
836_130900_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Captain Nemo had left his stateroom He was in the same lounge I had to cross in order to escape There I would encounter him one last time 
836_130900_000042_000002	train-clean-360	He would see me perhaps speak to me 
none	none	One gesture from him could obliterate me a single word shackle me to his vessel 
836_130900_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Even so ten o clock was about to strike 
none	none	It was time to leave my stateroom and rejoin my companions I dared not hesitate even if Captain Nemo stood before me I opened the door cautiously but as it swung on its hinges it seemed to make a frightful noise This noise existed perhaps only in my imagination I crept forward through the Nautilus s dark gangways pausing after each step to curb the pounding of my heart I arrived at the corner door of the lounge 
836_130900_000046_000001	train-clean-360	I opened it gently The lounge was plunged in profound darkness 
none	none	Chords from the organ were reverberating faintly Captain Nemo was there He didn t see me Even in broad daylight I doubt that he would have noticed me so completely was he immersed in his trance I inched over the carpet avoiding the tiniest bump whose noise might give me away It took me five minutes to reach the door at the far end which led into the library I was about to open it when a gasp from Captain Nemo nailed me to the spot I realized that he was standing up I even got a glimpse of him because some rays of light from the library had filtered into the lounge He was coming toward me arms crossed silent not walking but gliding like a ghost His chest was heaving swelling with sobs And I heard him murmur these words the last of his to reach my ears
836_130900_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 O almighty God 
none	none	Enough Enough Was it a vow of repentance that had just escaped from this man s conscience Frantic I rushed into the library I climbed the central companionway and going along the upper gangway I arrived at the skiff I went through the opening that had already given access to my two companions
836_130900_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Let s go let s go I exclaimed 
836_130900_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Right away the Canadian replied 
none	none	First Ned Land closed and bolted the opening cut into the Nautilus s sheet iron using the monkey wrench he had with him After likewise closing the opening in the skiff the Canadian began to unscrew the nuts still bolting us to the underwater boat Suddenly a noise from the ship s interior became audible Voices were answering each other hurriedly 
836_130900_000055_000001	train-clean-360	What was it Had they spotted our escape 
none	none	I felt Ned Land sliding a dagger into my hand
836_130900_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I muttered we know how to die 
836_130900_000057_000000	train-clean-360	The Canadian paused in his work 
none	none	But one word twenty times repeated one dreadful word told me the reason for the agitation spreading aboard the Nautilus We weren t the cause of the crew s concern
836_130900_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Maelstrom 
836_130900_000058_000001	train-clean-360	Maelstrom they were shouting 
836_130900_000059_000000	train-clean-360	The Maelstrom 
none	none	Could a more frightening name have rung in our ears under more frightening circumstances Were we lying in the dangerous waterways off the Norwegian coast Was the Nautilus being dragged into this whirlpool just as the skiff was about to detach from its plating As you know at the turn of the tide the waters confined between the Faroe and Lofoten Islands rush out with irresistible violence They form a vortex from which no ship has ever been able to escape Monstrous waves race together from every point of the horizon They form a whirlpool aptly called the ocean s navel whose attracting power extends a distance of fifteen kilometers It can suck down not only ships but whales and even polar bears from the northernmost regions This was where the Nautilus had been sent accidentally or perhaps deliberately by its captain It was sweeping around in a spiral whose radius kept growing smaller and smaller The skiff still attached to the ship s plating was likewise carried around at dizzying speed I could feel us whirling I was experiencing that accompanying nausea that follows such continuous spinning motions We were in dread in the last stages of sheer horror our blood frozen in our veins our nerves numb drenched in cold sweat as if from the throes of dying And what a noise around our frail skiff What roars echoing from several miles away What crashes from the waters breaking against sharp rocks on the seafloor where the hardest objects are smashed where tree trunks are worn down and worked into a shaggy fur as Norwegians express it 
836_130900_000062_000000	train-clean-360	What a predicament

none	none	He hadn t finished speaking when a cracking sound occurred The nuts gave way and ripped out of its socket the skiff was hurled like a stone from a sling into the midst of the vortex My head struck against an iron timber and with this violent shock I lost consciousness CHAPTER twenty three Conclusion WE COME TO the conclusion of this voyage under the seas What happened that night how the skiff escaped from the Maelstrom s fearsome eddies how Ned Land Conseil and I got out of that whirlpool I m unable to say But when I regained consciousness I was lying in a fisherman s hut on one of the Lofoten Islands My two companions safe and sound were at my bedside clasping my hands We embraced each other heartily Just now we can t even dream of returning to France Travel between upper Norway and the south is limited So I have to wait for the arrival of a steamboat that provides bimonthly service from North Cape So it is here among these gallant people who have taken us in that I m reviewing my narrative of these adventures It is accurate Not a fact has been omitted not a detail has been exaggerated It s the faithful record of this inconceivable expedition into an element now beyond human reach but where progress will someday make great inroads Will anyone believe me I don t know Ultimately it s unimportant What I can now assert is that I ve earned the right to speak of these seas beneath which in less than ten months I ve cleared twenty thousand leagues in this underwater tour of the world that has shown me so many wonders across the Pacific the Indian Ocean the Red Sea the Mediterranean the Atlantic the southernmost and northernmost seas But what happened to the Nautilus Did it withstand the Maelstrom s clutches Is Captain Nemo alive Is he still under the ocean pursuing his frightful program of revenge or did he stop after that latest mass execution Will the waves someday deliver that manuscript that contains his full life story Will I finally learn the man s name Will the nationality of the stricken warship tell us the nationality of Captain Nemo I hope so I likewise hope that his powerful submersible has defeated the sea inside its most dreadful whirlpool that the Nautilus has survived where so many ships have perished If this is the case and Captain Nemo still inhabits the ocean his adopted country may the hate be appeased in that fierce heart May the contemplation of so many wonders extinguish the spirit of vengeance in him May the executioner pass away and the scientist continue his peaceful exploration of the seas If his destiny is strange it s also sublime Haven t I encompassed it myself Didn t I lead ten months of this otherworldly existence Thus to that question asked six thousand years ago in the Book of Ecclesiastes Who can fathom the soundless depths two men out of all humanity have now earned the right to reply Captain Nemo and I END OF THE SECOND PART End of the Project Gutenberg Etext of twenty thousand Leagues Under the Seas by Jules Vern
