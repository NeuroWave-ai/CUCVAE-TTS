twenty five The Bhikshu Mendicant Chapter twenty six The Brahmana Arhat DHAMMAPADA Chapter I The Twin Verses one All that we are is the result of what we have thought it is founded on our thoughts it is made up of our thoughts If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought pain follows him as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriage two All that we are is the result of what we have thought it is founded on our thoughts it is made up of our thoughts If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought happiness follows him like a shadow that never leaves him three He abused me he beat me he defeated me he robbed me in those who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease four He abused me he beat me he defeated me he robbed me in those who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease five For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time hatred ceases by love this is an old rule six The world does not know that we must all come to an end here but those who know it their quarrels cease at once seven He who lives looking for pleasures only his senses uncontrolled immoderate in his food idle and weak Mara the tempter will certainly overthrow him as the wind throws down a weak tree eight He who lives without looking for pleasures his senses well controlled moderate in his food faithful and strong him Mara will certainly not overthrow any more than the wind throws down a rocky mountain nine He who wishes to put on the yellow dress without having cleansed himself from sin who disregards temperance and truth is unworthy of the yellow dress ten But he who has cleansed himself from sin is well grounded in all virtues and regards also temperance and truth he is indeed worthy of the yellow dress eleven They who imagine truth in untruth and see untruth in truth never arrive at truth but follow vain desires twelve They who know truth in truth and untruth in untruth arrive at truth and follow true desires thirteen As rain breaks through an ill thatched house passion will break through an unreflecting mind fourteen As rain does not break through a well thatched house passion will not break through a well reflecting mind fifteen The evil doer mourns in this world and he mourns in the next he mourns in both He mourns and suffers when he sees the evil of his own work sixteen The virtuous man delights in this world and he delights in the next he delights in both He delights and rejoices when he sees the purity of his own work seventeen The evil doer suffers in this world and he suffers in the next he suffers in both He suffers when he thinks of the evil he has done he suffers more when going on the evil path eighteen The virtuous man is happy in this world and he is happy in the next he is happy in both He is happy when he thinks of the good he has done he is still more happy when going on the good path nineteen The thoughtless man even if he can recite a large portion of the law but is not a doer of it has no share in the priesthood but is like a cowherd counting the cows of others twenty The follower of the law even if he can recite only a small portion of the law but having forsaken passion and hatred and foolishness possesses true knowledge and serenity of mind he caring for nothing in this world or that to come has indeed a share in the priesthood Chapter II On Earnestness twenty one Earnestness is the path of immortality Nirvana thoughtlessness the path of death Those who are in earnest do not die those who are thoughtless are as if dead already twenty two Those who are advanced in earnestness having understood this clearly delight in earnestness and rejoice in the knowledge of the Ariyas the elect twenty three These wise people meditative steady always possessed of strong powers attain to Nirvana the highest happiness twenty four If an earnest person has roused himself if he is not forgetful if his deeds are pure if he acts with consideration if he restrains himself and lives according to law then his glory will increase twenty five By rousing himself by earnestness by restraint and control the wise man may make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm twenty six Fools follow after vanity men of evil wisdom The wise man keeps earnestness as his best jewel twenty seven Follow not after vanity nor after the enjoyment of love and lust He who is earnest and meditative obtains ample joy twenty eight When the learned man drives away vanity by earnestness he the wise climbing the terraced heights of wisdom looks down upon the fools serene he looks upon the toiling crowd as one that stands on a mountain looks down upon them that stand upon the plain twenty nine Earnest among the thoughtless awake among the sleepers the wise man advances like a racer leaving behind the hack thirty By earnestness did Maghavan Indra rise to the lordship of the gods People praise earnestness thoughtlessness is always blamed thirty one A Bhikshu mendicant who delights in earnestness who looks with fear on thoughtlessness moves about like fire burning all his fetters small or large thirty two A Bhikshu mendicant who delights in reflection who looks with fear on thoughtlessness cannot fall away from his perfect state he is close upon Nirvana Chapter III Thought thirty three As a fletcher makes straight his arrow a wise man makes straight his trembling and unsteady thought which is difficult to guard difficult to hold back thirty four As a fish taken from his watery home and thrown on dry ground our thought trembles all over in order to escape the dominion of Mara the tempter thirty five It is good to tame the mind which is difficult to hold in and flighty rushing wherever it listeth a tamed mind brings happiness thirty six Let the wise man guard his thoughts for they are difficult to perceive very artful and they rush wherever they list thoughts well guarded bring happiness thirty seven Those who bridle their mind which travels far moves about alone is without a body and hides in the chamber of the heart will be free from the bonds of Mara the tempter thirty eight If a man s thoughts are unsteady if he does not know the true law if his peace of mind is troubled his knowledge will never be perfect thirty nine If a man s thoughts are not dissipated if his mind is not perplexed if he has ceased to think of good or evil then there is no fear for him while he is watchful forty Knowing that this body is fragile like a jar and making this thought firm like a fortress one should attack Mara the tempter with the weapon of knowledge one should watch him when conquered and should never rest forty one Before long alas this body will lie on the earth despised without understanding like a useless log forty two Whatever a hater may do to a hater or an enemy to an enemy a wrongly directed mind will do us greater mischief forty three Not a mother not a father will do so much nor any other relative a well directed mind will do us greater service Chapter IV Flowers forty four Who shall overcome this earth and the world of Yama the lord of the departed and the world of the gods Who shall find out the plainly shown path of virtue as a clever man finds out the right flower forty five The disciple will overcome the earth and the world of Yama and the world of the gods The disciple will find out the plainly shown path of virtue as a clever man finds out the right flower forty six He who knows that this body is like froth and has learnt that it is as unsubstantial as a mirage will break the flower pointed arrow of Mara and never see the king of death forty seven Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is distracted as a flood carries off a sleeping village forty eight Death subdues a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is distracted before he is satiated in his pleasures forty nine

none	none	fifty Not the perversities of others not their sins of commission or omission but his own misdeeds and negligences should a sage take notice of fifty one Like a beautiful flower full of colour but without scent are the fine but fruitless words of him who does not act accordingly fifty two But like a beautiful flower full of colour and full of scent are the fine and fruitful words of him who acts accordingly fifty three As many kinds of wreaths can be made from a heap of flowers so many good things may be achieved by a mortal when once he is born fifty four The scent of flowers does not travel against the wind nor that of sandal wood or of Tagara and Mallika flowers but the odour of good people travels even against the wind a good man pervades every place fifty five Sandal wood or Tagara a lotus flower or a Vassiki among these sorts of perfumes the perfume of virtue is unsurpassed fifty six Mean is the scent that comes from Tagara and sandal wood the perfume of those who possess virtue rises up to the gods as the highest fifty seven Of the people who possess these virtues who live without thoughtlessness and who are emancipated through true knowledge Mara the tempter never finds the way fifty eight fifty nine As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the lily will grow full of sweet perfume and delight thus the disciple of the truly enlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge among those who are like rubbish among the people that walk in darkness Chapter V The Fool sixty Long is the night to him who is awake long is a mile to him who is tired long is life to the foolish who do not know the true law sixty one If a traveller does not meet with one who is his better or his equal let him firmly keep to his solitary journey there is no companionship with a fool sixty two These sons belong to me and this wealth belongs to me with such thoughts a fool is tormented He himself does not belong to himself how much less sons and wealth sixty three The fool who knows his foolishness is wise at least so far But a fool who thinks himself wise he is called a fool indeed sixty four If a fool be associated with a wise man even all his life he will perceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the taste of soup sixty five If an intelligent man be associated for one minute only with a wise man he will soon perceive the truth as the tongue perceives the taste of soup sixty six Fools of little understanding have themselves for their greatest enemies for they do evil deeds which must bear bitter fruits sixty seven That deed is not well done of which a man must repent and the reward of which he receives crying and with a tearful face sixty eight No that deed is well done of which a man does not repent and the reward of which he receives gladly and cheerfully sixty nine As long as the evil deed done does not bear fruit the fool thinks it is like honey but when it ripens then the fool suffers grief seventy Let a fool month after month eat his food like an ascetic with the tip of a blade of Kusa grass yet he is not worth the sixteenth particle of those who have well weighed the law seventy one An evil deed like newly drawn milk does not turn suddenly smouldering like fire covered by ashes it follows the fool seventy two And when the evil deed after it has become known brings sorrow to the fool then it destroys his bright lot nay it cleaves his head seventy three Let the fool wish for a false reputation for precedence among the Bhikshus for lordship in the convents for worship among other people seventy four May both the layman and he who has left the world think that this is done by me may they be subject to me in everything which is to be done or is not to be done thus is the mind of the fool and his desire and pride increase seventy five One is the road that leads to wealth another the road that leads to Nirvana if the Bhikshu the disciple of Buddha has learnt this he will not yearn for honour he will strive after separation from the world Chapter VI The Wise Man Pandita seventy six If you see an intelligent man who tells you where true treasures are to be found who shows what is to be avoided and administers reproofs follow that wise man it will be better not worse for those who follow him seventy seven Let him admonish let him teach let him forbid what is improper he will be beloved of the good by the bad he will be hated seventy eight Do not have evil doers for friends do not have low people for friends have virtuous people for friends have for friends the best of men seventy nine He who drinks in the law lives happily with a serene mind the sage rejoices always in the law as preached by the elect Ariyas eighty Well makers lead the water wherever they like fletchers bend the arrow carpenters bend a log of wood wise people fashion themselves eighty one As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind wise people falter not amidst blame and praise eighty two Wise people after they have listened to the laws become serene like a deep smooth and still lake eighty three Good people walk on whatever befall the good do not prattle longing for pleasure whether touched by happiness or sorrow wise people never appear elated or depressed eighty four If whether for his own sake or for the sake of others a man wishes neither for a son nor for wealth nor for lordship and if he does not wish for his own success by unfair means then he is good wise and virtuous eighty five Few are there among men who arrive at the other shore become Arhats the other people here run up and down the shore eighty six But those who when the law has been well preached to them follow the law will pass across the dominion of death however difficult to overcome eighty seven eighty eight A wise man should leave the dark state of ordinary life and follow the bright state of the Bhikshu After going from his home to a homeless state he should in his retirement look for enjoyment where there seemed to be no enjoyment Leaving all pleasures behind and calling nothing his own the wise man should purge himself from all the troubles of the mind eighty nine Those whose mind is well grounded in the seven elements of knowledge who without clinging to anything rejoice in freedom from attachment whose appetites have been conquered and who are full of light are free even in this world Chapter VII The Venerable Arhat ninety There is no suffering for him who has finished his journey and abandoned grief who has freed himself on all sides and thrown off all fetters ninety one They depart with their thoughts well collected they are not happy in their abode like swans who have left their lake they leave their house and home ninety two Men who have no riches who live on recognised food who have perceived void and unconditioned freedom Nirvana their path is difficult to understand like that of birds in the air ninety three He whose appetites are stilled who is not absorbed in enjoyment who has perceived void and unconditioned freedom Nirvana his path is difficult to understand like that of birds in the air ninety four The gods even envy him whose senses like horses well broken in by the driver have been subdued who is free from pride and free from appetites ninety five Such a one who does his duty is tolerant like the earth like Indra s bolt he is like a lake without mud no new births are in store for him ninety six His thought is quiet quiet are his word and deed when he has obtained freedom by true knowledge when he has thus become a quiet man ninety seven The man who is free from credulity but knows the uncreated who has cut all ties removed all temptations renounced all desires he is the greatest of men ninety eight In a hamlet or in a forest in the deep water or on the dry land wherever venerable persons Arhanta dwell that place is delightful ninety nine Forests are delightful where the world finds no delight there the passionless will find delight for they look not for pleasures Chapter VIII The Thousands one hundred Even though a speech be a thousand of words but made up of senseless words one word of sense is better which if a man hears he becomes quiet one hundred one Even though a Gatha poem be a thousand of words but made up of senseless words one word of a Gatha is better which if a man hears he becomes quiet one hundred two Though a man recite a hundred Gathas made up of senseless words one word of the law is better which if a man hears he becomes quiet one hundred three If one man conquer in battle a thousand times thousand men and if another conquer himself he is the greatest of conquerors one hundred four one hundred five One s own self conquered is better than all other people not even a god a Gandharva not Mara with Brahman could change into defeat the victory of a man who has vanquished himself and always lives under restraint one hundred six If a man for a hundred years sacrifice month after month with a thousand and if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul is grounded in true knowledge better is that homage than sacrifice for a hundred years one hundred seven If a man for a hundred years worship Agni fire in the forest and if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul is grounded in true knowledge better is that homage than sacrifice for a hundred years one hundred eight Whatever a man sacrifice in this world as an offering or as an oblation for a whole year in order to gain merit the whole of it is not worth a quarter a farthing reverence shown to the righteous is better one hundred nine He who always greets and constantly reveres the aged four things will increase to him viz life beauty happiness power one hundred ten But he who lives a hundred years vicious and unrestrained a life of one day is better if a man is virtuous and reflecting one hundred eleven And he who lives a hundred years ignorant and unrestrained a life of one day is better if a man is wise and reflecting one hundred twelve And he who lives a hundred years idle and weak a life of one day is better if a man has attained firm strength one hundred thirteen And he who lives a hundred years not seeing beginning and end a life of one day is better if a man sees beginning and end one hundred fourteen And he who lives a hundred years not seeing the immortal place a life of one day is better if a man sees the immortal place one hundred fifteen And he who lives a hundred years not seeing the highest law a life of one day is better if a man sees the highest law Chapter IX Evil one hundred sixteen If a man would hasten towards the good he should keep his thought away from evil if a man does what is good slothfully his mind delights in evil one hundred seventeen If a man commits a sin let him not do it again let him not delight in sin pain is the outcome of evil one hundred eighteen If a man does what is good let him do it again let him delight in it happiness is the outcome of good one hundred nineteen Even an evil doer sees happiness as long as his evil deed has not ripened but when his evil deed has ripened then does the evil doer see evil one hundred twenty Even a good man sees evil days as long as his good deed has not ripened but when his good deed has ripened then does the good man see happy days one hundred twenty one Let no man think lightly of evil saying in his heart It will not come nigh unto me Even by the falling of water drops a water pot is filled the fool becomes full of evil even if he gather it little by little one hundred twenty two Let no man think lightly of good saying in his heart It will not come nigh unto me Even by the falling of water drops a water pot is filled the wise man becomes full of good even if he gather it little by little one hundred twenty three Let a man avoid evil deeds as a merchant if he has few companions and carries much wealth avoids a dangerous road as a man who loves life avoids poison one hundred twenty four He who has no wound on his hand may touch poison with his hand poison does not affect one who has no wound nor is there evil for one who does not commit evil one hundred twenty five If a man offend a harmless pure and innocent person the evil falls back upon that fool like light dust thrown up against the wind one hundred twenty six Some people are born again evil doers go to hell righteous people go to heaven those who are free from all worldly desires attain Nirvana one hundred twenty seven Not in the sky not in the midst of the sea not if we enter into the clefts of the mountains is there known a spot in the whole world where death could not overcome the mortal Chapter X Punishment one hundred twenty nine All men tremble at punishment all men fear death remember that you are like unto them and do not kill nor cause slaughter one hundred thirty All men tremble at punishment all men love life remember that thou art like unto them and do not kill nor cause slaughter one hundred thirty one He who seeking his own happiness punishes or kills beings who also long for happiness will not find happiness after death one hundred thirty two He who seeking his own happiness does not punish or kill beings who also long for happiness will find happiness after death one hundred thirty three Do not speak harshly to anybody those who are spoken to will answer thee in the same way Angry speech is painful blows for blows will touch thee one hundred thirty four If like a shattered metal plate gong thou utter not then thou hast reached Nirvana contention is not known to thee one hundred thirty five As a cowherd with his staff drives his cows into the stable so do Age and Death drive the life of men one hundred thirty six A fool does not know when he commits his evil deeds but the wicked man burns by his own deeds as if burnt by fire one hundred thirty seven He who inflicts pain on innocent and harmless persons will soon come to one of these ten states one hundred thirty eight He will have cruel suffering loss injury of the body heavy affliction or loss of mind one hundred thirty nine Or a misfortune coming from the king or a fearful accusation or loss of relations or destruction of treasures one hundred forty Or lightning fire will burn his houses and when his body is destroyed the fool will go to hell one hundred forty one Not nakedness not platted hair not dirt not fasting or lying on the earth not rubbing with dust not sitting motionless can purify a mortal who has not overcome desires one hundred forty two He who though dressed in fine apparel exercises tranquillity is quiet subdued restrained chaste and has ceased to find fault with all other beings he indeed is a Brahmana an ascetic sramana a friar bhikshu one hundred forty three Is there in this world any man so restrained by humility that he does not mind reproof as a well trained horse the whip one hundred forty four Like a well trained horse when touched by the whip be ye active and lively and by faith by virtue by energy by meditation by discernment of the law you will overcome this great pain of reproof perfect in knowledge and in behaviour and never forgetful one hundred forty five Well makers lead the water wherever they like fletchers bend the arrow carpenters bend a log of wood good people fashion themselves Chapter XI Old Age one hundred forty six How is there laughter how is there joy as this world is always burning Why do you not seek a light ye who are surrounded by darkness one hundred forty seven Look at this dressed up lump covered with wounds joined together sickly full of many thoughts which has no strength no hold one hundred forty eight This body is wasted full of sickness and frail this heap of corruption breaks to pieces life indeed ends in death one hundred forty nine Those white bones like gourds thrown away in the autumn what pleasure is there in looking at them one hundred fifty After a stronghold has been made of the bones it is covered with flesh and blood and there dwell in it old age and death pride and deceit one hundred fifty one The brilliant chariots of kings are destroyed the body also approaches destruction but the virtue of good people never approaches destruction thus do the good say to the good one hundred fifty two A man who has learnt little grows old like an ox his flesh grows but his knowledge does not grow one hundred fifty three one hundred fifty four Looking for the maker of this tabernacle I shall have to run through a course of many births so long as I do not find him and painful is birth again and again But now maker of the tabernacle thou hast been seen thou shalt not make up this tabernacle again All thy rafters are broken thy ridge pole is sundered the mind approaching the Eternal visankhara nirvana has attained to the extinction of all desires one hundred fifty five Men who have not observed proper discipline and have not gained treasure in their youth perish like old herons in a lake without fish one hundred fifty six Men who have not observed proper discipline and have not gained treasure in their youth lie like broken bows sighing after the past Chapter XII Self one hundred fifty seven If a man hold himself dear let him watch himself carefully during one at least out of the three watches a wise man should be watchful one hundred fifty eight Let each man direct himself first to what is proper then let him teach others thus a wise man will not suffer one hundred fifty nine If a man make himself as he teaches others to be then being himself well subdued he may subdue others one s own self is indeed difficult to subdue one hundred sixty Self is the lord of self who else could be the lord With self well subdued a man finds a lord such as few can find one hundred sixty one The evil done by oneself self begotten self bred crushes the foolish as a diamond breaks a precious stone one hundred sixty two He whose wickedness is very great brings himself down to that state where his enemy wishes him to be as a creeper does with the tree which it surrounds one hundred sixty three Bad deeds and deeds hurtful to ourselves are easy to do what is beneficial and good that is very difficult to do one hundred sixty four The foolish man who scorns the rule of the venerable Arahat of the elect Ariya of the virtuous and follows false doctrine he bears fruit to his own destruction like the fruits of the Katthaka reed one hundred sixty five By oneself the evil is done by oneself one suffers by oneself evil is left undone by oneself one is purified Purity and impurity belong to oneself no one can purify another one hundred sixty six Let no one forget his own duty for the sake of another s however great let a man after he has discerned his own duty be always attentive to his duty Chapter XIII The World one hundred sixty seven Do not follow the evil law Do not live on in thoughtlessness Do not follow false doctrine Be not a friend of the world one hundred sixty eight Rouse thyself do not be idle Follow the law of virtue The virtuous rests in bliss in this world and in the next one hundred sixty nine Follow the law of virtue do not follow that of sin The virtuous rests in bliss in this world and in the next one hundred seventy Look upon the world as a bubble look upon it as a mirage the king of death does not see him who thus looks down upon the world one hundred seventy one Come look at this glittering world like unto a royal chariot the foolish are immersed in it but the wise do not touch it one hundred seventy two He who formerly was reckless and afterwards became sober brightens up this world like the moon when freed from clouds one hundred seventy three He whose evil deeds are covered by good deeds brightens up this world like the moon when freed from clouds one hundred seventy four This world is dark few only can see here a few only go to heaven like birds escaped from the net one hundred seventy five The swans go on the path of the sun they go through the ether by means of their miraculous power the wise are led out of this world when they have conquered Mara and his train one hundred seventy six If a man has transgressed one law and speaks lies and scoffs at another world there is no evil he will not do one hundred seventy seven The uncharitable do not go to the world of the gods fools only do not praise liberality a wise man rejoices in liberality and through it becomes blessed in the other world one hundred seventy eight Better than sovereignty over the earth better than going to heaven better than lordship over all worlds is the reward of the first step in holiness Chapter XIV The Buddha The Awakened one hundred seventy nine He whose conquest is not conquered again into whose conquest no one in this world enters by what track can you lead him the Awakened the Omniscient the trackless one hundred eighty He whom no desire with its snares and poisons can lead astray by what track can you lead him the Awakened the Omniscient the trackless one hundred eighty one Even the gods envy those who are awakened and not forgetful who are given to meditation who are wise and who delight in the repose of retirement from the world one hundred eighty two Difficult to obtain is the conception of men difficult is the life of mortals difficult is the hearing of the True Law difficult is the birth of the Awakened the attainment of Buddhahood one hundred eighty three Not to commit any sin to do good and to purify one s mind that is the teaching of all the Awakened one hundred eighty four The Awakened call patience the highest penance long suffering the highest Nirvana for he is not an anchorite pravragita who strikes others he is not an ascetic sramana who insults others one hundred eighty five Not to blame not to strike to live restrained under the law to be moderate in eating to sleep and sit alone and to dwell on the highest thoughts this is the teaching of the Awakened one hundred eighty six There is no satisfying lusts even by a shower of gold pieces he who knows that lusts have a short taste and cause pain he is wise one hundred eighty seven Even in heavenly pleasures he finds no satisfaction the disciple who is fully awakened delights only in the destruction of all desires one hundred eighty eight Men driven by fear go to many a refuge to mountains and forests to groves and sacred trees one hundred eighty nine But that is not a safe refuge that is not the best refuge a man is not delivered from all pains after having gone to that refuge one hundred ninety He who takes refuge with Buddha the Law and the Church he who with clear understanding sees the four holy truths one hundred ninety one Viz pain the origin of pain the destruction of pain and the eightfold holy way that leads to the quieting of pain one hundred ninety two That is the safe refuge that is the best refuge having gone to that refuge a man is delivered from all pain one hundred ninety three A supernatural person a Buddha is not easily found he is not born everywhere Wherever such a sage is born that race prospers one hundred ninety four Happy is the arising of the awakened happy is the teaching of the True Law happy is peace in the church happy is the devotion of those who are at peace one hundred ninety five one hundred ninety six He who pays homage to those who deserve homage whether the awakened Buddha or their disciples those who have overcome the host of evils and crossed the flood of sorrow he who pays homage to such as have found deliverance and know no fear his merit can never be measured by anybody
